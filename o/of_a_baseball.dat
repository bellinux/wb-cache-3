5|$|An art {{exhibition}} of Little Busters! {{was held in}} Osaka, Japan between May 3 and May 4, 2007, and in Tokyo, Japan between May 24 and May 25, 2007. A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and other production sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size mannequin of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>baseball,</b> a cat was in the glove. This mannequin was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website in late September 2007 and sold for 764,000 yen, {{a far cry from}} the original wish of selling the figure for 5,000,000 yen.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>baseball</b> player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E

Harold Arlin announced the Pirates-Phillies game. Attendances in the 1920s were consistently {{better than they}} had been before the war. The interwar peak average attendance was 8,211 in 1930, but baseball was hit hard by the Great Depression and in 1933 the average fell below five thousand for the only time between the wars.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} Acadian dish from New Brunswick {{is known}} as poutine râpée. The Acadian poutine is a ball of grated and mashed potato, salted, sometimes filled with pork in the center, and boiled. The result is a moist ball about the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>baseball.</b> It is commonly eaten {{with salt and pepper}} or brown sugar. It is believed to have originated from the German Klöße, prepared by early German settlers who lived among the Acadians.|$|E
25|$|Markov chain {{models have}} been used in {{advanced}} baseball analysis since 1960, although their use is still rare. Each half-inning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>baseball</b> game fits the Markov chain state when the number of runners and outs are considered. During any at-bat, there are 24 possible combinations of number of outs and position of the runners. Mark Pankin shows that Markov chain models can be used to evaluate runs created for both individual players as well as a team.|$|E

25|$|Baseball {{has been}} {{played in the}} Southern United States {{since at least the}} years leading up to the American Civil War.

The first mention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>baseball</b> team in Houston was on April 11, 1861. 19th century and early 20th century games were common, especially once the professional leagues such as the Texas League, the Dixie League, and the Southern League were organized.|$|E

Blanding was sued by the Kansas City team, and the Cleveland team argued that Blanding remained bound to play for them under the reserve clause in his 1913 contract. Blanding was allowed to play for Cleveland in 1914, which proved to be his last season in professional baseball.|$|E
25|$|This type of cricket {{is popular}} in the South Asian sub-continent, USA and Canada. In this game a harder version of tennis ball is used. The number of overs in the game varies from 6 to 25 overs.

As tennis ball cricket games are shorter {{when compared to the}} conventional version, it suits the US and Canadian lifestyle where one would see {{a large number of people}} participating. Where cricket pitches are not available, part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>baseball</b> diamond is used as a pitch in most parts of USA and Canada.|$|E
