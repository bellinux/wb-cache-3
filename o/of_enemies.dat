5|$|As players {{walk through}} the level, they are stopped by groups <b>of</b> <b>enemies</b> who must be {{defeated}} before they can continue. The level ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups <b>of</b> <b>enemies,</b> making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E

In this case, two custodian captures were performed but one was on a row, and the other was on a column.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength <b>of</b> <b>enemies</b> players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might be quickly killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number <b>of</b> <b>enemies</b> in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E

5|$|Harry confronts monsters in {{each area}} with both melee weapons and firearms. An {{ordinary}} man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting.

5|$|The game {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics and {{was described as}} another entry {{in a long line}} of poorly developed movie tie-ins.

5|$|The player {{needs to}} make moral {{decisions}} at certain points during the game, including making choices that can determine the fate of both soldiers and civilians. These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squadmates, and will cause them to react differently. The game has several subtle effects as the team starts being broken mentally and physically, including the degradation of their combat uniforms. Walker has visual and auditory hallucinations later into the game, and his executions <b>of</b> <b>enemies</b> become more violent. The orders and shouts to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice. His kill confirmations <b>of</b> <b>enemies</b> corrupts from professional in the beginning to psychotic. Similarly, loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player, but as the game progresses, the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker's actions, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall by addressing the player directly. The game features collectibles known as Intel, which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players.|$|E

50|$|Maneuver warfare advocates that {{strategic}} movement {{can bring}} about the defeat of an opposing force more efficiently than by simply contacting and destroying enemy forces until {{they can no longer}} fight. Instead, in maneuver warfare, the destruction <b>of</b> certain <b>enemy</b> targets (command and control centers, logistical bases, fire support assets, etc.) is combined with isolation <b>of</b> <b>enemy</b> forces and the exploitation by movement <b>of</b> <b>enemy</b> weaknesses.|$|R
5|$|At around 17:00 a large {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>enemies</b> {{showed up}} on radar headed towards TG38.3. As before, {{a great deal of}} these were shot down by combat air patrol.

5|$|Beat 'em up (also {{known as}} brawler) is {{a video game}} genre {{featuring}} hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents. These games typically take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots, though some games may employ historical, sci-fi or fantasy themes. Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling, two-dimensional (2D) levels, though some later games feature more open three-dimensional (3D) environments with yet larger numbers <b>of</b> <b>enemies.</b> These games are noted for their simple gameplay, a source of both critical acclaim and derision. Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the episodes}} contain a {{different}} set <b>of</b> <b>enemies</b> in their levels, which the player must stun or avoid. The first episode contains a variety of alien creatures, including large slugs, giant bouncing mushrooms, and flying bats, while the second contains different types of robots and alien energy beings. Levels can also include hazards, such as dart traps or fire; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. The episodes feature three difficulty settings, which change the number and types <b>of</b> <b>enemies</b> present. While Vorticons contained a raygun and the in-between episode Commander Keen in Keen Dreams had pellets that temporarily stunned enemies, Goodbye, Galaxy features a stun gun that knocks out most enemies permanently using ammo found throughout the game. Different enemies take differing numbers of shots to kill, {{or in some cases}} are immune. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. The first episode also contains water droplets which award an extra life for every 100 drops, and the second green drinks which do the same. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life.|$|E
40|$|WWI is {{probably}} the first conflict in which governments and armies {{have dealt with the}} issue <b>of</b> civilian <b>of</b> <b>enemy</b> nationalities on a massive scale.
