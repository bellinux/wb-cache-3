Therefore, Israel gave Sammael a present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> Atonement, as [...] says, [...] "One lot for the Lord, and the other lot for Azazel" [...] (identified with Satan or Sammael). The lot for God was the {{offering}} of a burnt offering, and the lot for Azazel was the goat as a sin offering, for all the iniquities of Israel were upon it, as [...] says, [...] "And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities."

[...] Under the headline [...] "Vivian Testifies to Harrowing Ordeal", it praised the young plaintiff as [...] "bearing up with wonderful fortitude" [...] and facing the ordeal [...] "with courageous mien". [...] Brownlee, in contrast, was a [...] "love-torn, sex crazed victim of passion and jealousy, forcing his will upon her in parked autos and on country highways".
