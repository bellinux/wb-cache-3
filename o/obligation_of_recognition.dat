40|$|The late miscarriages, the {{in utero}} deaths, the medical {{abortion}} {{are so many}} situations which lead to the tragic delivery of a lifeless born fetus. Since the 2 nd half of the 20 th century, the contraception, the ultrasound, the medically assisted procreation, the notions of desired pregnancies or invaluable pregnancies modified our glance to the fetus. The prenatal diagnosis allowed anticipating dramatic situations which previously arose at birth or afterwards. The professionals of the perinatal medicine wonder about the care of this particular mourning. Every stage of this difficult process for the parents since the announcement of an anomaly to the fetus, the prognosis evaluation, the decision-making then its realization is decoded. This necessarily multidisciplinary practice brought closer the professionals of the birth. It {{is a question of}} respecting the parents who wish recognition of the dead fetus to ritualize this loss as much as those for whom the symbolism is not the same and for whom in case of <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> the emotional consequences could be disastrous. The answer to be given to these requests requires remaining vigilant in order not to modify the legal status of the embryo or the fetus and not to call into question the legitimacy of the termination of pregnancy.

40|$|Academic {{dishonesty}} {{is nothing}} new, {{yet it is}} particularly disturbing to find among engineering students, whose professional lives need to be guided by the highest ethical standards. Moral philosophy may illuminate some of the conditions for recovering {{a sense of the}} ethical for engineering students. Classical moral philosophers held that people belong to communities in ways that inform their sense <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b> <b>Recognition</b> <b>of</b> these communities would make concrete the engineer 2 ̆ 7 s responsibility for the health, safety and welfare of the public. A further difficulty is that the primary community that students know is simply that of their peers in school or the workplace, which does not form a sufficient context for the sense <b>of</b> moral <b>obligation</b> inherent in the engineer 2 ̆ 7 s role. This paper seeks to define the moral <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the engineer using traditional moral philosophy and describe how this obligation might be translated into a more positive definition of success. It also addresses means by which educators can help engineering students to better understand their moral obligation...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis is a {{recognition}} in criminal proceedings. The thesis deals with <b>recognition</b> in terms <b>of</b> crimilonogy and criminal procedure. The <b>recognition</b> is one <b>of</b> the important evidence, {{which are often}} based on evidence in criminal proceedings. At first sight it may seem that a recognition is easy procedure in criminal proceedings, but closer examination reveals its complexity. The aim of the thesis is to introduce the recognition as a special way of proving and its specifics, summarization of the knowledge gained by studying textbooks and monographs, articles in journals and some judicial decisions, as well as outlining the selected questions and poiting out possible problems, especially the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the defendant to attend the recognition. The thesis is divided into eight chapters, which are divided to subchapters. Following the introduction, the first chapter defines the concept <b>of</b> <b>recognition,</b> and then focuses on psychological basics <b>of</b> <b>recognition,</b> historical evolution <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> as an evidence since 1873 and also its grounding in the Code of Criminal Procedure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain. Following on from these remarks I will adumbrate an alternative account of the relation which grounds (enforceable) <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice...|$|R

40|$|Notions of {{cosmopolitan}} {{and environmental}} citizenship {{have emerged in}} response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R
5000|$|The Constitution of Venezuela {{enacted in}} 1999 defined {{marriage}} as a union {{between a man and}} a woman, thus constitutionally banning same-sex marriage. However in February 2008, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice ruled in favor of Unión Afirmativa (Affirmative Union), a group advocating for same-sex marriage, who had asked for clarity on Article 21 (the article about equality before the law) and 77 (the article about marriage). They argued that the sentence is unclear and does not determine the possibility <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> economic and social rights for same-sex couples. Furthermore they asked whether same-sex couples have the rights mentioned above and what is the scope of these rights: property in case of a dissolution of the couple by separation or death, the legal <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance, the right to adoption, the benefits of social security as a couple, protection against domestic violence, the possibility of acquiring the nationality of the partner, among others. The ruling indicated that the National Assembly [...] "could" [...] (but was not bound to) legislate in order to protect such rights for same-sex partners. Subsequently Article 77 was amended and marriage defined as the following: Marriage, which is based on free consent and absolute equality <b>of</b> rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> the spouses, is protected.|$|R

40|$|Achieving good {{regulatory}} outcomes normally requires {{high quality}} design, {{implementation and review}} of the regulatory regime. Major regulatory theories focus on concepts such as the public interest, the role of interest groups, and regulatory capture to explain why regulations come into existence. Regulatory design, however, exists at two levels. Downstream design involves creating a regime to give the appropriate incentives to firms and consumers. Upstream design seeks to incentivise regulators themselves to create and operate high quality regulatory regimes. This paper focuses on the latter. The OECD has undertaken a major programme on regulatory governance to ensure quality {{in the design and}} implementation of regulations. Such measures are now widespread. New Zealand has gradually implemented these approaches including Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in its decision- making processes. These measures are supported, and to some degree required, by increased interaction with Australian practices through institutions such as the Council of Australian Governments and the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> Trans-Tasman Mutual <b>Recognition</b> Arrangement. Achieving full integration of best practice that creates an environment for consistently delivering high quality regulation requires a broad and sustained focus on design, capability, incentives and follow-up. New Zealand has attempted over the last decade to improve regulatory outcomes by focusing on the incentives on regulators. There is still scope for further improvement. Sustained progress on a number of mutually supporting initiatives, with continued reinforcement of the underlying messages and careful building of the necessary institutions and practices is required for continued improvement.

40|$|In Just Health, Norman Daniels makes {{a strong}} {{argument}} for <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance {{to fulfill the}} right to health {{at the national level}} and challenges readers to develop arguments supporting <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance at the global level. In this paper, we argue that there is global responsibility for global health and that there are <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice (beyond charity) to help fulfill (not merely respect or even protect) the right to health in other countries; these we call <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice. We show how international human rights law affirms <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice - beyond national obligations and beyond <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> charity - and assert that the human rights approach provides guidance on delineating the relationship between national and global responsibility for fulfilling the core obligations that arise from socioeconomic human rights and addressing global health inequities. We further argue that new ways of providing international assistance, originating from the global HIV/AIDS response, demonstrate the feasibility of improving health outcomes through exogenous efforts and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice thus carry much weight: the weight of lives not saved. The global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic has led to {{the emergence of a new}} international health assistance paradigm, and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is, we suggest, an embryonic form of this new paradigm. We conclude that agreements on several common parameters delineating global and national responsibility for global health can advance the movement towards a global institution for the distribution of health-related goods...|$|R
