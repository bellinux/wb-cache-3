His most successful circuit was Magny-Cours where he won eight times {{in his career}}. Schumacher's largest margin of victory was at the 1994 Brazilian Grand Prix, a race in which he lapped the field, and the smallest margin of victory was at the 2000 Canadian Grand Prix when he beat teammate Rubens Barrichello by 0.174 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Higginbotham {{initially}} sought employment {{with law}} firms in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, however, {{he was unable}} to find work at any of the major firms as a result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race.</b> He {{began his career as a}} law clerk for Judge Curtis Bok of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. In 1953 he was hired by Philadelphia District Attorney Richardson Dilworth as an assistant district attorney. Prior to Dilworth's arrival, no black lawyer had ever argued on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the Courts of Common Pleas. Higginbotham was given the opportunity to argue both in front of the Court of Common Pleas, and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.|$|E

The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E

5|$|Apolinario de la Cruz {{was born}} on July 22, 1815 in Barrio Pandác {{in the town of}} Lucban in Tayabas {{province}} (now Quezon Province) back when the Philippines was a colony of the Spanish Empire. His parents—Pablo de la Cruz and Juana Andres—were peasants and devout Catholics. Dela Cruz was literate, but stated that he had no formal education. Despite that, it is very likely that he received primary religious instruction and attended the local public primary school in Lucban. In 1829, he decided to become a priest and tried to join the Order of Preachers in Manila. During those times, Roman Catholic religious orders barred indios (native people of the Philippines) from joining, thus de la Cruz's application was rejected for the sole reason <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race.</b> He then decided to work as a donado (lay brother) at the San Juan de Dios Hospital where he was admitted to the Cofradía de San Juan de Dios, a brotherhood affiliated with the hospital and was open to indios. During this time, he improved his public speaking and studied the Bible along with other religious writings.|$|E
5|$|As the 20th century progressed, some councils in the United States became integrated, {{but many}} were not. Given {{the history of}} slavery and early {{development}} in the US, most African Americans were Protestant. But many in former French or Spanish territories had grown up Catholic. Church officials and organizations encouraged integration. By {{the end of the}} 1950s, Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates. In 1963, Hart attended a special meeting at the White House hosted by President John F. Kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders. A few months later, a local KofC council rejected a black man's application because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race,</b> notwithstanding that he was a graduate of Notre Dame University. Six council officers resigned in protest, and the incident made national news. Hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention, but died before he could see it take place.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{moved into}} an on-campus {{boarding}} house at 61 East Eleventh Avenue in the primarily black neighborhood of the University District in Columbus, and majored in architectural engineering. Brown attempted {{several times to}} apply to the school's aviation program, but was denied because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race.</b> Brown joined the track and field team as well as the wrestling team, but soon dropped both for financial reasons. He {{took a job as a}} janitor at a local Lazarus department store and then was hired by the Pennsylvania Railroad to load boxcars from 15:30 to midnight each day. In spite of this, he maintained top grades in his classes. Facing difficulties with his academics and the institutional segregation in the city, Brown nevertheless found most of his fellow students were friendly toward him. Brown rarely returned to Mississippi during the school year, but in the summers he worked at a dry cleaner in Hattiesburg to help pay for his classes.|$|E

5|$|Continuing with Jaguar in 2004, Webber {{qualified}} sixth for {{the first}} race of the season, the , but faced his second consecutive retirement from his home race, this time {{as a result of}} a gearbox failure. At the following race, the , Webber produced the best qualifying performance of his career up to that point by splitting the dominant Ferraris to line up second on the grid. The race was less rewarding with a near-stall at the start meaning he was well outside the top 10 by the time the cars reached turn 1. An aggressive lap saw him move up to ninth place but during an exciting battle with Ralf Schumacher, they collided, forcing Webber to pit with damage to his front wing and tyre. In his desperation to make up for the lost time, Webber exceeded the pitlane speed limit and was handed a drive-through penalty which left him even further behind. More frustration eventually led to the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race</b> as he spun into the gravel trap on the outside of the final corner on lap 23.|$|E
5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race.</b> Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E

Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race.</b> To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E

5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race.</b> Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} begins sinking as {{the creature}} {{in the ice}} escapes and runs amok. The TARDIS, which originally was on a course set for Las Vegas, materialises inside the submarine and the Doctor and Clara tumble out. The Doctor convinces Captain Zhukov (Liam Cunningham) to maneuver the submarine to the side, landing it safely and preventing it from imploding. During this the TARDIS inexplicably dematerialises. They then encounter the escaped Ice Warrior, Grand Marshal Skaldak (Spencer Wilding, voiced by Nicholas Briggs). The Doctor encourages the crew to be peaceful, but the ship's executive officer Stepashin (Tobias Menzies) knocks out Skaldak with a cattle prod, suspecting {{that he is not}} an alien but part of a Western plot. Knowing that Skaldak will desire vengeance for being attacked, the Doctor and the crew chain Skaldak, who sends out a distress call for others <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race</b> to find him.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E

5|$|While {{the general}} public were baffled {{that a man who}} just scored a century against Australia could be left out of the team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision. Some journalists {{supported}} the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Others, prominently the former England captain Ted Dexter, the former Test player Trevor Bailey and E.W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira deserved to be in the team on merit. Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission. Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player Learie Constantine, openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>race</b> or because the MCC supported apartheid. Some Labour politicians also expressed concern. John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira deserved to be included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should perhaps have selected him even if this were not the case. The general press took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government. According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.|$|E
