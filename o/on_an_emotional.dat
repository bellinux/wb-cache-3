5|$|The Yankee {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. <b>On</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E

25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the book is that our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern is that our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E

The Cavalier defense posted three interceptions, four sacks, two fumble recoveries, seven tackles for loss and a touchdown. The win set up a Thanksgiving match-up versus cross-state rival Virginia Tech playing for the Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division title {{and the chance to}} play in the 3rd Annual Atlantic Coast Conference Championship game.|$|E
25|$|For Shakespeare as {{he began}} to write, both traditions were alive; they were, moreover, {{filtered}} through the recent success of the University Wits on the London stage. By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe revolutionised theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form. The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple allegory. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies, creating plays that not only resonated <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements {{of what it means to}} be human. What Marlowe and Kyd did for tragedy, John Lyly and George Peele, among others, did for comedy: they offered models of witty dialogue, romantic action, and exotic, often pastoral location that formed the basis of Shakespeare's comedic mode throughout his career.|$|E

The results showed that a talking facial image was rated as more pleasant and arousing as compared to a static facial image, and elicited progressively increasing zygomatic EMG activity. In addition, a talking facial image was associated with a decrease in RSA, but only among individuals scoring high on dispositional behavioral activation system (BAS) sensitivity. It is suggested that a small talking facial image contributes to sustained attention and engagement particularly among high BAS scorers, given that it may increase the sense of presence. ...|$|R

500|$|Garbage {{decided the}} best way to start writing the album was to set up their {{recording}} equipment, guitars, keyboards, drum kit and a sampler and [...] "jam" [...] as a group.

500|$|During {{the second}} week of October 1997, David Duchovny was {{scheduled}} to be away from Vancouver for promotional purposes for the movie Playing God. As a result, the producers delayed shooting of the episode [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] and developed a Scully-centric episode to take its place in the queue. With the episode scheduled to air during December, Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz decided to craft a Christmas episode and put Dana Scully into a situation similar to that of Scrooge in the 1951 film Scrooge, starring Alastair Sim. After failing to write an episode paralleling that story, the writers decided instead to feature Scully being visited by earlier versions of herself, resulting in the flashback sequences appearing in the episode. They also decided to have her be taken <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> journey by her descendant.|$|E

It {{was well}} {{received}} by critics such as Jeff Tittsworth of RPGFan, who applauded its variety, saying that each track had a [...] "distinct feel" [...] {{even as the}} album as a whole felt [...] "cohesive". He also noted that each disc had its own feel, with the first disc containing more mellow and emotional pieces, while the second held [...] "harder" [...] rock, techno and jazz pieces, a dichotomy that he felt strengthened the album as a whole. James McCawley of RPGFan agreed; while he preferred {{the sound of the}} second disc, he felt that together they created a stronger album which reflected [...] "the split sides of Hamauzu's musical character". Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online also enjoyed the album, calling it [...] "an accomplished piece of experimentation that is also often satisfying <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> and melodic level", though he added a caveat that if the listener did not enjoy electronic music, they would find the album [...] "often wonderful but also hugely inconsistent".|$|E
500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the album}} have been positive. Derek Heemsbergen of RPGFan praised the {{consistency}} of the soundtrack both when compared to XIII-2 and the variety of locations. He said that the recurring motifs in the soundtrack [...] "work to great effect", noting how the tracks related to Lightning helped explore her personality. His highest praise went to the final disc due to [...] "its sheer emotional intensity". Despite the general praise, some tracks, such as [...] "Marimba de Chocobo", came in for minor critiques. Christopher Huynh of Video Game Music Online was also positive, noting the high production values {{of the album}}. He also generally praised the themes used both in battle and for the various locations, though he felt that the Dead Dunes tracks were the weakest on the album. His reaction to the new and rearranged characters' themes were more mixed, with him praising [...] "Snow's Theme" [...] while calling [...] "Fang's Theme" [...] a [...] "very odd and jarring failure". The final disc also received high praise, with Huynn saying that it [...] "succeeds at closing out the series <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> high".|$|E

50|$|The {{homogenisation}} of Township Jive with US and UK culture, due to globalisation, {{is viewed}} by African artists {{as a threat to}} the preservation of their local tradition and credibility.

500|$|Maes {{maintains}} that, {{regardless of}} what he was writing, Tchaikovsky's main concern was how his music impacted his listeners on an aesthetic level, at specific moments in the piece and on a cumulative level once the music had finished. What his listeners experienced <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> or visceral level became an end in itself. Tchaikovsky's focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of Mendelssohn or Mozart. Considering that he lived and worked in what was probably the last 19th century feudal nation, the statement is not actually that surprising. And yet, even when writing so-called 'programme music, for example his Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture, he cast it in sonata form. [...] His use of stylized 18th-century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward the values of Russian aristocracy. He was aided in this by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who commissioned The Sleeping Beauty from Tchaikovsky and the libretto for The Queen of Spades from Modest with their use of 18th century settings stipulated firmly. Tchaikovsky also used the polonaise frequently, the dance being a musical code for the Romanov dynasty and a symbol of Russian patriotism. Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners.|$|E

Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected {{to go along with}} it without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but to mess with them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as if somebody came and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E
500|$|Tufan Hashemi said Roksan {{sought to}} create {{equipment}} that would excel in high-quality musical reproduction {{and capable of}} involving the listener <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> level. Product characteristics were to include precision and transparency of the sound. Moghaddam, acting as chief designer, {{set out to find}} solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt-driven suspended sub-chassis turntable design of Edgar Villchur, where the sub-chassis and tonearm are free to rotate. Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes. One such torsional mode is said to be caused by [...] "groove drag" [...] – dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it. Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable-drive motor casing on its own bearing. The motor, mounted separately and tethered to a spring, is allowed limited rotation about its own axis; because the load varied with groove modulations, the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring-loaded motor, and the platter acceleration mitigated. In the words of Tufan Hashemi, Roksan Audio's managing director: [...] "We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read, as the record itself would be floating. We said that the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation {{from the rest of the}} deck, and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it." ...|$|E
