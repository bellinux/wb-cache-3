The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E

5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E

However, since 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> made it impossible for riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E

5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces {{carried out}} a winter test for {{potential}} military vehicles in March 1958. 35candidate vehicles from the two domestic producers and various importers were driven around Finland.

For part of the journey, the vehicles had to tow an eight-ton field cannon. The vehicles were tested for off-road capabilities in even, -deep snow. One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident.

5|$|Around mid-afternoon on July 9, {{observers}} {{with the}} 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry spotted {{a column of}} 200 vehicles led by 11 North Korean T-34 tanks, subsequently calling for an airstrike.

The next day, a similar airstrike by B-26 Invaders, F-80 and F-82 Twin Mustang aircraft of the Fifth Air Force took place around Pyongtaek, with 38 North Korean tanks, seven half-tracks and 117 other trucks destroyed, in addition to a large number of infantry. Much of the village of Chonui was left burning, although it had already been abandoned by South Korean soldiers and civilians. In addition, the airstrikes caused some of the largest losses of North Korean armor of the war, and were a major blow against the T-34 tanks which had been so successful during previous encounters.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were withdrawn from passenger service, and {{were converted to}} ballast motor cars, with the final one completed in early 1955.

At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E
