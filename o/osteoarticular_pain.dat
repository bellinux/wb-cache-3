50|$|Bartonella bacilliformis is the {{etiologic}} agent of Carrion's disease or Oroya fever (acute phase of infection), and verruga peruana or Peruvian wart (chronic phase of infection). The acute {{phase of the}} disease is a life-threatening disease characterized by massive invasion of Bartonella to human red blood cells and consequently acute hemolysis and fever. If the infection is not treated, the case fatality rate is 40 to 85% Patients in {{this phase of the}} infection can be complicated by overwhelming infections, primarily by enterobacteria (Salmonella spp) and parasites (Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis jirovecii).The chronic phase is characterized by benign eruptive lesions that are pruritic and bleeding, and other symptoms like malaise and <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pain.</b> Bartonella can be isolated from blood cultures and secretion of the lesions in people from endemic areas.|$|E

A syndrome of severe <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pain</b> of lower limbs occurring early after renal transplantation (TP) has been recently identified. We describe its prevalence, clinical presentation and outcome. Symptomatic patients have been studied with conventional X-rays, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and 99 mTechnetium scintigrams of the painful areas. Among 86 patients transplanted over a two-year period, nine (4 men, 5 women; mean age of 40. 4 years; range 32 to 59) developed unexplained severe spontaneous <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pain</b> of lower limbs 19 to 105 (mean 58) days after TP. Pain affected hip(s), knee(s), and/or ankle(s). Clinical examination was usually unremarkable. Favorable outcome was the rule; mean duration of pain was 86 (range 19 to 175) days. Radiographs were abnormal (joint swelling, patchy osteoporosis and/or periosteal reactions) in 41 %, MR (epiphyseal fatty marrow replacement by edema and/or hemorrhages) in 83 %, and bone scans (one to several epiphyseal foci of increased uptake) in 81 % of the symptomatic examined areas. Among joints re-examined 9 to 12 months after resolution of the symptoms, X-rays showed periosteal reactions in 31 %, and the bone scans disclosed persistent increased uptake in 53 % of the joints, whereas epiphyseal MR abnormalities had completely disappeared in 86 %. There was no difference in dialysis duration, post-TP weight gain, evidence of hyperparathyroidism, and steroid and cyclosporine doses between symptomatic and an appropriately selected group of asymptomatic patients. By contrast, serum alkaline phosphatase levels were transiently higher (at the onset of symptoms) in the symptomatic group. Clinical presentation and outcome, imaging findings (mainly MR), and transient elevation in alkaline phosphatase levels suggest a diagnosis of epiphyseal impaction as the basis of this syndrome. Cyclosporine and steroids, both osteopenic agents, might have predisposed to impaction. As their dosage was not higher than in an asymptomatic control group, it is suggested that an additional factor such as excessive physical exercise in the post-TP period may play a role...|$|E

40|$|Transient hypophosphatemia is {{frequently}} observed {{during the first}} months after renal transplantation and is usually asymptomatic. Phosphate diabetes is defined as inadequate tubular phosphorus reabsorption leading to persistent renal phosphorus wasting, which is an important but overlooked cause of osteodystrophy in the post-renal transplantation population. We report {{the case of a}} 58 -year-old male who presented with severe multiple <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pains</b> within 3 months after successful first kidney transplantation. Bone disease was attributed initially to mild hyperparathyroidism secondary to vitamin D deficiency. Despite the correction of the hyperparathyroidism, the withdrawal of corticosteroids, and the reduction of immunosuppressive treatment to tacrolimus-based monotherapy, the <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pains</b> persisted. Skeletal investigations at month 9 post-transplantation demonstrated a significant bone mineral density loss associated with osteomalacia and osteoporosis on the bone biopsy. Laboratory data showed persistent hypophosphatemia, and phosphate diabetes was then diagnosed explaining the post-transplant bone disease. A tacrolimus-induced renal tubular disorder was suspected to contribute to the excessive renal phosphorus wasting. The replacement of tacrolimus by sirolimus, in addition to oral phosphorus and vitamin D supplementations, led to the disappearance of pains, the normalization of urinary and plasma phosphate level, and a significant improvement of bone mineralization...|$|R

In these conditions, the physiological defense against, superoxide dismutases (SOD) are decreased. The complex MnL 4 {{is a potent}} SOD mimetic, and in this study it was tested in inflammatory and <b>osteoarticular</b> rat <b>pain</b> models. In vivo protocols were approved by the animal Ethical Committee of the University of Florence. Pain was measured by paw pressure and hind limb weight bearing alterations tests. MnL 4 (15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) acutely administered, significantly reduced pain induced by carrageenan, complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), and sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA). In CFA and MIA protocols, it ameliorated the alteration of postural equilibrium. When administered by osmotic pump in the MIA osteoarthritis, MnL 4 reduced pain, articular derangement, plasma TNF alpha levels, and protein carbonylation. The scaffold ring was ineffective. MnL 4 (10 − 7 [*]M) prevented the lipid peroxidation of isolated human chondrocytes when was produced by RAW 264. 7. MnL 4 behaves as a potent pain reliever in acute inflammatory and chronic articular pain, being its efficacy related to antioxidant property.

40|$|AbstractPolio {{survivors}} are aging and facing multiple pathologies. With age, walking becomes more difficult, {{partly due to}} locomotor deficits {{but also as a}} result of weight gain, <b>osteoarticular</b> degeneration, <b>pain,</b> cardiorespiratory problems or even post polio syndrome (PPS). These additional complications increase the risk of falls in this population where the risk of fractures is already quite high. The key joint is the knee. The muscles stabilizing this joint are often weak and patients develop compensatory gait strategies, which could be harmful to the locomotor system at medium or long term. Classically, knee recurvatum is used to lock the knee during weight bearing; however, if it exceeds 10 °, the knee becomes unstable and walking is unsafe. Thus, regular medical monitoring is necessary. Orthoses {{play an important role in}} the therapeutic care of polio survivors. The aim is usually to secure the knee, preventing excessive recurvatum while respecting the patient's own gait. Orthoses must be light and pressure-free if they are to be tolerated and therefore effective. Other joints present fewer problems and orthoses are rarely indicated just for them. The main issue lies in the prior evaluation of treatments’ impact. Some deformities may be helpful for the patients’ gait and, therefore, corrections may worsen their gait, especially if a realignment of segments is attempted. It is therefore essential to carefully pre-assess any change brought to the orthoses as well as proper indications for corrective surgery. In addition, it is essential for the patient to be monitored by a specialized team...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} location, distribution, and {{intensity}} of pain {{in a sample of}} adult cardiac surgery patients during their postoperative hospital stay. DESIGN: In a prospective study, pain location, distribution (number of pain areas per patient), and intensity (0 to 10 numerical rating scale) were documented on the first, second, third, and seventh postoperative day (POD). Patient characteristics (age, sex, size, and body mass index) were analyzed for their impact on pain intensity. SETTING: A university hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred consecutive adult patients who underwent median sternotomy for open heart surgery. There were 121 male and 79 female patients, with a mean (+/- SD) age of 60. 9 +/- 19. 2 years. Measurement and results: The maximal pain intensity was significantly higher on POD 1 and 2 (3. 7 +/- 2 and 3. 9 +/- 1. 9, respectively) and lower on POD 3 and 7 (3. 2 +/- 1. 5 and 2. 6 +/- 1. 8, respectively). The pain distribution did not vary significantly throughout the hospital stay, but the location did, with more shoulder pain on POD 7. Only age was found {{to have an impact on}} pain intensity, with patients < 60 years having a higher pain intensity than older patients on POD 2 (4. 3 +/- 2. 2 vs 3. 6 +/- 2. 4; p = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: In this patient population, the pain intensity diminished from POD 3 onward, although its distribution did not vary significantly during the first postoperative week.

40|$|Background: Multimodal pain is {{comprised}} of nociceptive/inflammatory and neuropathic components. pharmacological pain therapies from different classes provide pain relief using different mechanistic actions: often a combination of such therapies provides more effective pain relief than monotherapy. To assess whether pain management is adequate requires a comprehensive pain scoring system. Objective: To evaluate the adequacy of a low-dose combination of oxycodone and paracetamol (acetaminophen) in patients with multimodal, Chronic. non-malignant pain using the Pain Management Index (PMI). Methods: During this prospective. observational Study, consecutive patients were classified {{according to the presence}} of prevalent <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pain</b> (group A, n = 78) or prevalent neuropathic pain (group B. n = 72). Existing pain-relief medications were discontinued and both groups received oxycodone 5 mg, and paracetamol 325 mg, up to 8 hourly for a planned duration of >= 6 weeks. Patients ill group B who were receiving gabapentin continued this treatment Up to a maximum daily dosage of 2400 in(, during the observation period. Pain intensity was evaluated using a Visual analogue scale (VAS from 0 to 10). Functional limitation for patients in group A was evaluated Using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The intensities of dynamic allodynia and hyperalgesia in patients in group B were evaluated by a VAS. Results from the WOMAC, dynamic allodynia, and hyperalgesia assessments were evaluated using the PMI. Results: In group A, 64. 3 % of patients showed improvements in pain symptoms after 15 days of treatment in the WOMAC categories of "pain preventing sleep" and "walks with aid". The PMI showed that the oxycodone/paracetamol therapy was adequate in patients with <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pain.</b> In group B, 83. 3 % of patients reported improvement in the category of "pain preventing sleep". and all patients rated the remaining four categories ("spontaneous pain", "burning pain", "painful paresthesia", and "pinprick" as either stable or improved after 15 days of treatment. Using the PMI, hyperalgesia resolved with oxycodone/paracetamol therapy. 37. 1 % and 58. 3 % of patients did not complete the study in group A and B. respectively. Conclusion: The PMI was an effective tool for assessment of pain management efficacy. Oxycodone/paracetamol improved pain symptoms in the majority of compliant patients.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA), {{the most}} {{prevalent}} musculoskeletal pathology, is mainly characterized by the progressive degradation of articular cartilage due to an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes. Consequently, OA {{has been associated with}} defects in the chondrocitic differentiation of progenitor stem cells (PSCs). In addition, SOX 9 is the transcription factor responsible for PSCs chondrogenic commitment. To evaluate the effects of the non-amino bisphosphonate clodronate in OA patients we investigated SOX 9 gene expression in circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) and in an in vitro OA model. We evaluated pain intensity, mental and physical performance in OA patients, as well as serum biomarkers related to bone metabolism. In addition, in order to improve therapeutic strategies, we assayed nanoparticle-embedded clodronate (NPs-clo) in an in vitro model of chondrogenic differentiation. Our data showed upregulation of SOX 9 gene expression upon treatment, suggesting an increase in chondrocytic commitment. Clodronate also reduced <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pain</b> and improved mental and physical performance in patients. Furthermore, NPs-clo stimulated SOX 9 expression more efficaciously than clodronate alone. Clodronate may therefore be considered a good therapeutic tool against OA; its formulation in nanoparticles may represent a promising challenge to counteract cartilage degeneration...|$|E

Admissions of HIV-positive patients have been decreasing, in contrast, since 2008, reflecting the dramatic improvements in quality of life and survival provided by triple antiretroviral regimens. HIV infection is now a chronic disease that exposes patients to the virus and antiretroviral drugs for many years. One consequence has been the emergence of new health conditions in HIV-positive patients, such as tumors, cardiovascular disease, and osteoarticular complications. These epidemiological and clinical changes have made it necessary for rheumatologists to learn about the osteoarticular abnormalities associated with the HIV, which they are likely to encounter at some point during their everyday practice. Osteoporosis is one such abnormality, and this review article starts with a discussion of the literature on this topic. Bone loss is common, chiefly in males. Multiple factors are involved.

40|$|The {{relations}} between osteoarticular disorders and occupational exposure to heavy physical work factors were studied {{in a random}} sample of retired subjects living in the Paris area, all of whom had contributed to the same retirement pension fund. 627 subjects were originally seen in 1982 - 3 and 464 of them were seen again five years later. On both occasions, the same questionnaire was completed during a home interview. Osteoarticular disorders were evaluated by the presence of pain, with or without restricted joint movement, for at least six months before interview. The heavy physical work factors were those reported by the subject at the first interview, and only subjects who stated that they had been exposed to these factors for more than 10 years were considered as exposed persons. For those who were seen twice, the frequency of <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pain</b> increased during the five years between the two interviews, from 52 % to 65 % in the men and 72 % to 82 % in the women. Among both sexes, these frequencies were significantly higher in those who stated that in the past they had to carry heavy weights and work in tiring positions. The increases in frequency of pain during the five year study period were also related to these occupational factors. In general, the frequencies for subjects not exposed to occupational factors caught up with those found for the exposed group. This interaction of age with the relation between exposure to heavy physical work factors and osteoarticular disorders {{does not seem to be}} explained by confounding factors, including age at the first interview, the fact of living alone, of being a former manual worker, of having a cardiorespiratory disorder, and smoking habits.

40|$|Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT) is {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment of menopausal disturbances and has an established role in reducing the cardiovascular risk and in preventing the postmenopausal osteoporosis. Nevertheless several reports have evidenced that compliance with hormonal replacement therapy was not as good as expected, and that physician's and women's opinions can strongly influence the HRT choice, and the continuation of HRT use. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the opinions and the expectations of menopausal women toward HRT. PATIENT AND METHODS. We utilized a questionnaire exploring social and affective conditions, and in particular women's opinions and experiences on menopause, hormonal therapy, the possibility of information, the reasons for accepting or refusing hormonal therapy. The questionnaires were administered to 226 menopausal clinic patients (Menopausal age: 2 - 10 years) in spontaneous menopause. RESULTS. 28 % of the women were taking HRT at the time of the survey. Worries about menopause were reported by 27. 4 % of the group; this percentage was similar in both user and non-user groups. 70 % received information on HRT from family doctors, and 63 % from mass-media or conversations. 70 % believes that the main problem of menopause is osteoporosis, and its prevention represents the most frequent aim that patients feel can be achieved by HRT. 67. 5 % of the group is afraid that long term treatment can be dangerous, however only 57 % asked for detailed information to the doctor. To the question "Are you informed that HRT can reinduce menstrual bleeding?", 57. 5 % of the patients answered yes; 30 % considered it to be a problem. CONCLUSIONS. Our study was carried out in a menopausal clinic and this can influence the answers of the respondents. Most women received some information on HRT, but their knowledge was only partial and did not eliminate the unrational fear of hormone therapy. Although long term use of HRT is to prevent CVD and menopausal osteoporosis, many of our patients specifically asked for treatment to be as short as possible. Women expectations's towards HRT are mainly referred to osteoporosis prevention and treatment: this may be explained by the high frequency of <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>pain</b> found in our patients; nevertheless it is possible that the more rational fear of osteoporosis hides the unconscious fear of a dramatic physical breakdown caused by the menopause. Detailed information to family doctors, to specialists, and to patients along with a further improvement of therapeutic regimens will allow a greater diffusion of HRT, bringing its short and long term benefits to an increasing number of women...|$|E
