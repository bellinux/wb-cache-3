40|$|The {{influence}} of {{fish on the}} mooring loads of a floating net cage is studied numerically and experimentally. Two experimental series were conducted. One case was model tests with artificial fish. Nine rigid fish models with total volume of 2. 5 % of the fish cage at rest were placed inside the net cage without touching the net and towed with the net cage. The <b>other</b> case was <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> experiments in waves and current where more than 800 salmons of length 16 cm occupied about 2. 5 % of the fish cage volume at rest. The flow-displacement effect of a rigid fish in current was simulated by a potential-flow slender-body theory. Viscous wake effects were added. The displacement flow is clearly {{more important than the}} viscous wake flow. Both the numerical simulations and the model tests with rigid fish in current show that the fish influence on the mooring loads of the fish cage is less than 3 % of the mooring load without fish. However, the measured mooring loads with <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> in current are between 10 % and 28 % larger than without fish. The reason is contact between the fish and the net cage. Accounting for the latter fact in the numerical model by changing the local solidity ratio of the net in the contact area gave reasonable numerical predictions. The experiments in waves and combined waves and current also showed a non-negligible {{influence of}} the fish on the mooring loads. The waves influenced the behaviour of the fish and some of the fish went to the net bottom possibly due to that they were uncomfortable in the wave zone...|$|R

40|$|Toxicity and its {{detection}} in the dinoflagellate fish predators Pfiesteria piscicida and Pfiesteria shumwayae {{depend on}} the strain {{and the use of}} reliable assays. Two assays, standardized fish bioassays (SFBs) with juvenile fish and fish microassays (FMAs) with larval fish, were compared for their utility to detect toxic Pfiesteria. The comparison included strains with confirmed toxicity, negative controls (noninducible Pfiesteria strains and a related nontoxic cryptoperidiniopsoid dinoflagellate), and P. shumwayae strain CCMP 2089, which previously had been reported as nontoxic. SFBs, standardized by using toxic Pfiesteria (coupled with tests confirming Pfiesteria toxin) and conditions conducive to toxicity expression, reliably detected actively toxic Pfiesteria, but FMAs did not. Pfiesteria toxin was found in fish- and algae-fed clonal Pfiesteria cultures, including CCMP 2089, but not in controls. In contrast, noninducible Pfiesteria and cryptoperidiniopsoids caused no juvenile fish mortality in SFBs even at high densities, and low larval fish mortality by physical attack in FMAs. Filtrate from toxic strains of Pfiesteria spp. in bacteria-free media was cytotoxic. Toxicity was enhanced by bacteria and <b>other</b> prey, especially <b>live</b> <b>fish.</b> Purified Pfiesteria toxin extract adversely affected mammalian cells as well as fish, and it caused fish death at environmentally relevant cell densities.

40|$|Purpose. To {{calculate}} {{the cost of}} transportation of <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> by various means of transport and to identify {{ways to improve the}} efficiency of their transport. Methodology. The studies were conducted using an economic analysis. Findings. Based on the study we estimated the prime cost of <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> delivery, which ranged from 3. 7 to 6. 5 UAH for 1 km for the delivery of 1 ton {{depending on the type of}} vehicle. The main backup to increase the efficiency of the transport is to increase the density of fish. Total economic effect from introduction of a modernized park of transportation of <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> vehicles in Ukraine can be assessed based on the amount of commodity fish and stocking fish. So, last years, enterprises which report their activity in the bodies of state statistics, rear up to 20 000 t of common carp and silver carp annually. Greater part of fish will be sold to the eventual consumer in alive condition and the mean distance where the fish is transported is about 100 km. The economic effect from the decrease of prime price of transportation will make to 2 000 000 UAH per year. In addition, more than 1000 t of rainbow trout is delivered from Western regions of Ukraine at distances greater than 100 km. cost saving during transport of trout will make up to 500 000 UAH per year.

5000|$|Coral reefs {{found in}} the South Pacific are {{regarded}} as the [...] "rainforest of the sea" [...] harboring countless fish species large and small. However, recently the <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> trade has threatened the sanctity of these endangered areas. The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network has issued a recent report that estimates that 25% of the world's reefs are severely damaged and another third are in grave danger. The <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> trade {{is part of this}} alarming ecological trend caused by the popular use of cyanide which is injected into the coral reefs to stun inhabiting fish so they can be easily caught by nets. It is estimated that since the 1960s, more than one million kilograms of cyanide has been squirted into Philippine reefs alone, and since then the practice has spread throughout the South Pacific. The <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> trade is only growing, in 1994 the Philippines exported 200,000 kg of live fish; by 2004 the Philippines were annually exporting 800,000 kg annually. Although Asian markets are the primary buyers of <b>live</b> reef <b>fish</b> for food, the recently created U.S. Coral Reef Task Force has concluded that the U.S. is the primary purchaser of <b>live</b> reef <b>fish</b> for aquariums as well as eclectic jewelry. Even though the use of cyanide in the <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> trade is severely detrimental, one must realize that this issue is multidimensional. Small-scale native fishermen of the small South Pacific coastal communities are the backbone of the <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> trade, and are forced to resort to the illegal use of sodium cyanide due to demand and high prices offered by the industry.|$|R
