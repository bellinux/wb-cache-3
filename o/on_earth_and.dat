5|$|Although often inconspicuous, fungi {{occur in}} every {{environment}} <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> play very {{important roles in}} most ecosystems. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore {{play a critical role}} in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, they play an essential role in nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{believed}} in the ancient astronaut hypothesis, which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity {{in the past and}} placed humans <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> would return to collect a select few. Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the Reformed Christian concept of election, likely owing to Applewhite's Presbyterian upbringing. He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from Star Trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show.|$|E

5|$|Carter was {{interested}} in the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient mass extinctions <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> used these themes in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ, and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin as Deep Throat, Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Geochemical {{observations}} {{may help}} to deduce the global level of biological activity, or the affinity of certain fossils. For example, geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> may provide evidence {{of the presence of}} eukaryotic cells, the type from which all multicellular organisms are built. Analyses of carbon isotope ratios {{may help to}} explain major transitions such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E

Once the predator succeeds in killing Archie, it reveals it was motivated by a crush on one of Archie's girlfriends, Betty Cooper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decay of}} the {{population}} of E-belt asteroids captured onto Hungaria like orbits produces a long-lived tail of impacts which continues past the LHB.

5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{wrote that}} some Han thinkers {{believed}} that rain {{fell from the}} Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located). Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water <b>on</b> <b>earth,</b> <b>and</b> that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.|$|E
5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E

5|$|Pratchett's {{first two}} adult novels, The Dark Side of the Sun (1976) and Strata (1981), were both science-fiction, the latter taking place partly on a {{disc-shaped}} world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children, with two exceptions: Good Omens (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which {{was nominated for}} both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> Nation (2008), a book for young adults.|$|E
5|$|Prey (known as Alien Prey in some markets) is a 1977 British {{independent}} {{science fiction}} horror film produced by Terry Marcel {{and directed by}} Norman J. Warren. The plot concerns a carnivorous alien (Barry Stokes) landing <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> befriending a lesbian couple (Glory Annen and Sally Faulkner) {{as part of his}} mission to evaluate humans as a source of food. It was filmed in under two weeks on a budget of less than £60,000 in various locations near Shepperton Studios in Surrey. It had a limited distribution on release.|$|E

5|$|Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article {{describing}} a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, {{and the discovery}} of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, about 5,000 virus species have been described in detail, although there are millions of types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> are the most abundant type of biological entity. The study of viruses is known as virology, a sub-speciality of microbiology.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{date was}} also loosely {{tied to the}} long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which {{predicted}} a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.|$|E
