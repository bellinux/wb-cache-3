[...] "I didn't poll any <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff,</b> but I am who I am." [...] Political interest groups generally rank McGovern {{as one of the}} most liberal members of Congress. The National Journal ranked him among the seven most liberal representatives. The Washington Post noted that the political similarities between McGovern and his mentor, 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern, are numerous: [...] "Both are considered among the most liberal and anti-war lawmakers of their generation. The most prominent difference? They aren't related." ...|$|E
500|$|Knight and his wife, {{many years}} later, {{are taking their}} granddaughter Rhoda to the American Museum of Natural History. Knight, {{well-known}} to the staff, is visiting the closed-off areas {{to have a look}} at the new mammoth specimens: the girl, however, is eager to see more of her grandfather's paintings. During this, the staff are finally getting round to sorting out Marsh's long-neglected collection of fossils. Two of the workers discover Knight's Leaping Laelaps has been accidentally left in the storeroom yesterday. The painting is taken back downstairs while the workmen unknowingly leave Cope's skeleton and Marsh's parts behind: [...] "The rest <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> is stayin' put for who knows how long, but we don't want that to get buried." ...|$|E
500|$|The Grove Book of Hollywood {{wrote that}} the 1978 film, The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and est because actress Diana Ross and writer Joel Schumacher were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard." [...] The film's producer Rob Cohen noted that: [...] "before I knew it, the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. [...] I hated the script a lot. But it was hard to argue with Diana because she was recognizing in this script all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, saying: [...] "I will be eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by the Good Witch, played by actress Lena Horne, at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes," [...] and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} soundtrack {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that [...] "some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> is quite good". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{provided}} a mixed review, writing that the soundtrack [...] "seems to indicate her efforts are coming from a similarly era-straddling psychological place". Jim Farber from New York Daily News criticized Aguilera for her [...] "vocals offer the same distracting loop-de-loops and showy tics", but complimented Cher that she [...] "balances both aspects ideally". A reviewer from Blogcritics labelled the album a [...] "grab bag of tracks that don't really add up to cohesive album". Leah Greanblatt from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] score, naming it a [...] "shamelessly diva-fied mix of balladry, Broadway cabaret, and backroom boogie-woogie" [...] and complimented on its musical departure from Aguilera's previous studio album Bionic. In a positive review, Billboard editor Kerri Mason praised Burlesque as [...] "a campy celebration of diva-dom and an over-the-top, triple-threat performance". James Wigney of The Advertiser praised Aguilera's [...] "vocal gymnastics", but was mixed towards Cher's numbers on the soundtrack. Maura Johnston from The Village Voice named [...] "The Beautiful People (from Burlesque)" [...] as the thirteenth worst song of 2010, calling it [...] "an interesting failure." ...|$|E
500|$|Joel Schumacher's {{script for}} The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and his Erhard Seminars Training ("est") movement, as both Schumacher and Diana Ross were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard".

[...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, stating that he was [...] "eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] However, he also complained that [...] "everybody stayed exactly the way they were and went around spouting all this bull****." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by Glinda the Good Witch at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes", and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself". Although Joel Schumacher had seen the Broadway play before writing the script, none of the Broadway play's writing was incorporated into the film's.|$|E

Nagel recalled this opposition, [...] "It was a rare doctor that favored us doing any <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> — very rare.

[...] Richard Dawkins, {{in a review}} of this book, said regarding the discussion of Lacan: [...] "We do not need the mathematical expertise of Sokal and Bricmont to assure us that the author <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> is a fake. Perhaps he is genuine when he speaks of non-scientific subjects? But a philosopher who is caught equating the erectile organ to the square root of minus one has, for my money, blown his credentials when it comes to things that I don't know anything about." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Gomez, one of {{the main}} inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos {{surfaced}} online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015. [...] Many claimed she gained weight, with some news outlets going as far as to label her a [...] "mess", and suggested Gomez was [...] "going off the deep end". She commented: [...] "I was getting a lot of hate for my body and ‘you’re gaining weight,’ and so I was in Mexico and I was just feeling all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> and I would be lying to you if I said it didn’t kind of hurt my feelings, but I kind of channeled that into my music." [...] Gomez called the experience [...] "degrading", explaining that she had never been through intense bullying before.|$|E
5000|$|About his {{experience}} {{with the release of}} his film - [...] "There were huge expectations and I wanted to prove to the world that British-born Asians are capable <b>of</b> doing <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> and we will only go from strength to strength after this, but it's only having that belief that someone can do this. I didn't make this film for myself, I made it for the audience." ...|$|R

2500|$|PlayStation Official Magazine {{gave the}} game an above-average 7 out of 10, complimenting the core {{shooting}} and production values, but criticizing its repetitive nature: [...] "A Star Wars-themed 3D shooter with some optional bounty hunting. Good fun, but it promised more." [...] IGN awarded the GameCube {{version of the}} game 8.3 out of 10, and the PS2 version 8.2. Praising the graphics, sound, length and level designs, they criticized {{the implementation of the}} bounty hunting system; [...] "The whole process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a way to streamline this to make it more fluid - especially in the heat of a battle when your mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents. It works the way it is for sure, but it certainly could have been fixed to be more intuitive than it currently is." [...] In the end, however, they found the game {{to be one of the}} better Star Wars tie-in games; [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter is a solid, if not technically challenged third-person action/adventure. Successfully combining our favorite aspects of the Star Wars universe with a clever stage design and a fantastic presentation, LucasArts has done a great job in suppressing the myth that games based on the Skywalker universe aren't any fun. A definite recommendation for Star Wars fans, Bounty Hunter isn't necessarily built for everyone, but for those of you out there who just can't get enough <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff,</b> it's one of your better choices for this or any holiday season." ...|$|E
2500|$|After its release, it was aired by MTV a {{total of}} three times, all of these after the 10pm watershed, due to its highly charged sexual content, before being {{permanently}} banned; this made it Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by the channel, after [...] "Justify My Love" [...] in 1990. MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, [...] "The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience". Madonna herself said she understood the channel's ban on the video; [...] "MTV plays to a huge audience {{and a lot of them}} are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, so I understand that they say I can't show it [...] I accept it". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis said that [...] "This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can you continue mining sexuality? In checking off your list of taboos, how far can you take them? At what point does it just stop being interesting?". Similarly, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, asked [...] "Haven’t we seen most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> before? Can we be bored with the subject matter already? [...] no emotion is attached to the mechanics of these acts, so it’s difficult to identify with or care about the characters". The video was nominated for the 1993 Billie Awards in four categories: Consumer print, trade print (music) and consumer print (retail), the most for a single entry. It also was ranked at number 16 on VH1's [...] "50 Sexiest Video Moments". The video was made commercially available in 2009, when it was included, albeit in a censored version, on Madonna's [...] compilation; it had previously been excluded from 1999's [...]|$|E
