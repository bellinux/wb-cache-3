40|$|The susceptibilities {{of three}} bovine and two human Babesia divergens {{isolates}} to antimicrobial agents were evaluated in vitro by a tritiated hypoxanthine incorporation assay. The MICs at which 50 % of isolates are inhibited (MIC 50 s) for mefloquine (chlorhydrate), chloroquine (sulfate), quinine (chlorhydrate), clindamycin (phosphate), pentamidine (isethionate), phenamidine (isethionate) plus <b>oxomemazine</b> (chlorhydrate), lincomycin (chlorhydrate monohydrate), and imidocarb (dipropionate) were determined. Except for imidocarb, the MIC 50 s observed {{for the different}} isolates were close. Imidocarb and the combination of phenamidine plus <b>oxomemazine</b> exhibited the highest in vitro activity, while antimalarial agents such as mefloquine, choroquine, and quinine were inactive. Other drugs had intermediate activities. The data support further in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial agents active against B. divergens {{for the improvement of}} therapeutic strategies...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} work was to develop simple, accurate, {{sensitive}} and selective methods for the simultaneous determination of <b>oxomemazine</b> (Ox), sodium benzoate (SB), guaifenesin (Gu), andparacetamol (Par). Two methods were described and validated for the simultaneous determination of the four drugs in syrup and suppositories. The first method was a reversed phase HPLC and UVdetection at 220  nm. The assay was performed using C 18 column and an isocratic elution using acetonitrile – methanol – 35  mM KH 2 PO 4 (20 : 5 : 75; by volume, pH was adjusted to 2. 9  ±  0. 1) as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1. 5  mL/min and separation was achieved in less than 15  min. The second method was a TLC- spectrodensitometric method, used to separate, identify and quantify the four drugs when present in combination. The drugs were applied on silica gel plates and development was made using methylene chloride- methanol- acetic acid- 33 % ammonia (89 : 8. 4 : 2 : 0. 6, by volume) as a mobile phase. The bands of the four drugs were quantified by scanning spectrodensitometricaly at 270  nm. The suggested chromatographic methods were validated and applied successfully {{to the analysis of}} the syrup and suppositories...|$|E
