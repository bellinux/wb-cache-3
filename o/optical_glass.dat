25|$|In the 20th century, {{new types}} of glass such as {{laminated}} glass, reinforced glass and glass bricks increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass.

Similarly, laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens. <b>Optical</b> <b>glass</b> for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages. The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers as well as having other application in medicine and science.

25|$|Beyond his {{scientific}} research into {{areas such as}} chemistry, electricity, and magnetism at the Royal Institution, Faraday undertook numerous, and often time-consuming, service projects for private enterprise and the British government. This work included investigations of explosions in coal mines, being an expert witness in court, and along with two engineers from Chance Brothers c.1853, the preparation of high-quality <b>optical</b> <b>glass,</b> which was required by Chance for its lighthouses. In 1846, together with Charles Lyell, he produced a lengthy and detailed report on a serious explosion in the colliery at Haswell County Durham, which killed 95 miners. Their report was a meticulous forensic investigation and indicated that coal dust contributed to {{the severity of the}} explosion. The report should have warned coal owners of the hazard of coal dust explosions, but the risk was ignored for over 60 years until the Senghenydd Colliery Disaster of 1913.|$|E
25|$|An air-wedge {{shearing}} interferometer {{is described}} in and was employed in set of experiments described in. This interferometer consists of two <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> wedges (~2-5deg), pushed together and then slightly separated {{from one side to}} create a thin air-gap wedge. This air-gap wedge has a unique property- it is very thin (micrometer scale) and it has perfect flatness (~λ/10). There are four nearly equal intensity Fresnel reflections (~4% for refraction coefficient 1.5) from the air-wedge interferometer (Fig.1): 1-2 from the first glass wedge, and 3-4 from the second one. The angle between beams 1-2 and 3-4 is non adjustable and depends only on the glass wedge. The angle between beams 2-3 is easily adjusted by varying the air-wedge angle. The distance between the air-wedge and an image plane should be long enough to spatially separate reflections 1 from 2 and 3 from 4. The overlap of beams 2 and 3 in the image plane creates an interferogram.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> is crown glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown glass surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E

2500|$|A WDM {{system uses}} a {{multiplexer}} at the transmitter {{to join the}} several signals together, and a demultiplexer at the receiver to split them apart. With the right type of fiber {{it is possible to}} have a device that does both simultaneously, and can function as an optical add-drop multiplexer. [...] The optical filtering devices used have conventionally been etalons (stable solid-state single-frequency Fabry–Pérot interferometers in the form of thin-film-coated <b>optical</b> <b>glass).</b> As there are three different WDM types, whereof one is called [...] "WDM", the notation [...] "xWDM" [...] is normally used when discussing the technology as such.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{anti-reflective coating}} {{was discovered by}} Lord Rayleigh in 1886. The <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> {{available at the time}} tended to develop a tarnish on its surface with age, due to chemical reactions with the environment. Rayleigh tested some old, slightly tarnished pieces of glass, and found to his surprise that they transmitted more light than new, clean pieces. The tarnish replaces the air-glass interface with two interfaces: an air-tarnish interface and a tarnish-glass interface. Because the tarnish has a refractive index between those of glass and air, each of these interfaces exhibits less reflection than the air-glass interface did. In fact, the total of the two reflections is less than that of the [...] "naked" [...] air-glass interface, as can be calculated from the Fresnel equations.|$|E

His high resolution diffracting grating replicas were significant advances of the ideas developed by Henry Rowland, whilst his multi-slit spectroscope was the first to enable the showing of both celestial and terrestrial objects and has formed the basis for the present day spectrohelioscope. Father Aloysius Cortie, of Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, was one whom achieved good results from an example of the objective prisms. Eventually owning houses in Whitefield and also in Prestatyn, North Wales, he constructed observatories at each of these and favoured the [...] Cooke equatorial telescope for his own observations. This device was fitted with a photo-visual objective, a spectroscope and other attachments that enabled it to be used for photography.|$|E
