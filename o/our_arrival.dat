5|$|Stephen Miller, Dragonair's first CEO, said: <b>Our</b> <b>arrival</b> on {{the scene}} was not hailed very enthusiastically by the then Hong Kong government...we {{got a lot of}} {{opposition}} from Cathay (Pacific). It was later discovered that Cathay Pacific was concentrating on a boom in travel elsewhere in the 1980s, and left the undeveloped mainland China market to Dragonair. Forced into accepting less-desirable routes, the young airline focused on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon <b>our</b> <b>arrival,</b> we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E
25|$|Not {{a single}} {{member of the}} side had put a foot wrong, and our cricket {{had been more than}} adequate. I {{genuinely}} believe that we had contributed not a little towards healing the wounds which undoubtedly existed, in the cricket world, between Australia and ourselves before <b>our</b> <b>arrival.</b>|$|E

3000|$|... 30 Previous studies (see, for example, Aydemir and Skuterud 2005; Green and Worswick 2012) define {{arrival of}} an {{immigrant}} {{as the year}} that permanent residence was obtained. In <b>our</b> study, <b>arrival</b> year for prefilers is the first year in which they filed taxes.|$|R
25|$|The {{day after}} <b>our</b> <b>arrival</b> the crew formed {{themselves}} into two gangs and obtained employment at screwing cotton by the day... With {{the aid of}} a set of jack-screws and a ditty, we would stow away huge bales of cotton, singing all the while. The song enlivened the gang and seemed to make the work much easier.|$|E
25|$|On <b>our</b> <b>arrival</b> at Annapolis we {{embarked}} also, {{on board}} the Marquis Lafayette. When the troops were all on board, the fleet of transports, with two frigates, weighed anchor and preceded, with a fair wind, down the Chesapeake Bay till we arrived at Linhaven Bay, where the French fleet were moored. We passed {{the mouth of the}} York River, where lay two or three French frigates blockading the entrance. We lay that night at anchor with the fleet.|$|E
25|$|The trees {{passed with}} an unseen speed, feverish enthusiasm filled our arteries, we lifted our machine {{with the effort}} of our pushing, the cyclists who {{accompanied}} us, although they were fresh, could not follow us, and it was with happiness that we waved to them {{from the top of}} the Petites Soeurs hill in that town of Agen so distant, so desired. A splendid woman gave us flowers there and it was in a whirlwind of dust that we arrived at the Gravier velodrome, in the middle of a crowd of people gathered for the bicycle races and to applaud <b>our</b> <b>arrival.</b> All Agen was there.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect of}} <b>our</b> sudden <b>arrival</b> from above was extraordinary. Scared by the rush and the noise, the lions gave way, then bolted in every direction, the wounded cub, which could not, {{or would not}} move, being stabbed to death where it stood over Higgs and Japhet.|$|R
6000|$|I {{felt this}} to be very true but was too {{confused}} to attend to it. <b>Our</b> speedy <b>arrival</b> at <b>our</b> destination, before I had time to recover myself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the uncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss Donny's house) that afternoon! ...|$|R

500|$|The Beatles {{steadily}} improved {{during their}} time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time. McCartney recalled, [...] "We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us. The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would {{come in from the}} Top Ten (the big club where we aspired to go) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [...] would hang around to watch us. ‘What'd I Say’ was always the one that really got them." [...] The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, [...] "We have improved a thousand-fold since <b>our</b> <b>arrival</b> and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1857, an {{expedition}} led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Los Angeles, California. The wagon road began at Fort Smith and continued through Fort Defiance, Arizona before crossing the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California. The location where Beale crossed the river, {{en route to}} California, became known as Beale's Crossing. Beale described the route, [...] "It is the shortest from our western frontier by , being nearly directly west. It is the most level: our wagons only double-teaming once in the entire distance, and that at a short hill, and over a surface heretofore unbroken by wheels or trail on any kind. It is well-watered: our greatest distance without water at any time being [...] It is well-timbered, and in many places the growth is far beyond that of {{any part of the}} world I have ever seen. It is temperate in climate, passing for the most part over an elevated region. It is salubrious: not one of our party requiring the slightest medical attendance from the time of our leaving to <b>our</b> <b>arrival...</b> It crosses the great desert (which must be crossed by any road to California) at its narrowest point." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland {{told reporters}} {{at a news}} {{briefing}} [...] "Although it's no measure of success and its difficult to confirm, we estimate {{that over the past}} 11 months we've killed about 25,000 enemy fighters. When you add that to the 20,000 estimated killed prior to <b>our</b> <b>arrival,</b> that's 45,000 enemies taken off the battlefield." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is quite}} right," [...] the young soldier said. [...] "It is a shameful business. Had I known {{that we were}} coming here to be butchers, I would never have taken service under Cortez. What should we have said if, on <b>our</b> first <b>arrival</b> here, when Montezuma entertained Cortez and all the cavaliers, his people had slain them at the feast?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} far from dawn, and there's not a soul in Carrington except you and myself. Grace took all my people with her to help at Lone Hollow. So, unless you are {{inclined}} to stalk them, which I should hardly suggest, as they might be too clever for you, we must await <b>our</b> friends' <b>arrival</b> and {{make the best of}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, ladies," [...] {{said our}} genial Captain, [...] "I trust {{that you will}} {{consider}} yourselves at home aboard my vessel. I have no fears for the gentlemen. A bottle of champagne, steward. Here's to a fresh breeze and a quick passage! I trust our friends in America will hear of <b>our</b> safe <b>arrival</b> in eight days, or in nine at the very latest." ...|$|R
2500|$|Missouri {{was then}} the {{frontier}} of American expansionism west; cabins were [...] "forted" [...] with tall stockade fences to defend against Indian attacks. As men worked in the fields, sentries were posted with weapons, to protect the farmers. These men were ready to kill any Indian who attacked. Carson wrote in his Memoirs: [...] "For {{two or three years}} after <b>our</b> <b>arrival,</b> we had to remain forted and it was necessary to have men stationed at the extremities of the fields for the protection of those that were laboring." ...|$|E
2500|$|The day after, I {{asked my}} pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} we really needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could {{probably}} get away from anything except a very up-to-date fighter. [...] I {{asked him if he}} would get into trouble if we went without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing <b>our</b> <b>arrival,</b> and set off on our own.|$|E
2500|$|Tales {{from other}} parts of Germany make mine kobolds {{beneficial}} creatures, at least if they are treated respectfully. Nineteenth-century miners in Bohemia and Hungary reported hearing knocking in the mines. They interpreted such noises as warnings from the kobolds to not go in that direction. Other miners claimed that the knocks indicated where veins of metal could be found: the more knocks, the richer the vein. In 1884, spiritualist Emma Hardinge Britten reported a story from a Madame Kalodzy, who claimed to have heard mine kobolds while visiting a peasant named Michael Engelbrecht: [...] "On the three first days after <b>our</b> <b>arrival,</b> we only heard a few dull knocks, sounding in and about the mouth of the mine, as if produced by some vibrations or very distant blows..." [...] Kobolds are sometimes portrayed as being indifferent to human miners, so long as they are left alone. In these depictions, they are content to simply mine ore themselves, collect it, and haul it away by windlass.|$|E
6000|$|My friend {{accompanied}} me a {{few miles}} from Versailles. He was sad; and, in a tone of unaccustomed despondency, uttered a prayer for <b>our</b> speedy <b>arrival</b> among the Alps, accompanied with an expression of vain regret that we were not already there. [...] "In that case," [...] I observed, [...] "we can quicken our march; why adhere to a plan whose dilatory proceeding you already disapprove?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Along {{the base}} of the castle, on the {{opposite}} side to the entrance, flows a stream, sending up a pleasant murmur from among the trees. The housekeeper said it was not a stream, but only a [...] "wash," [...] whatever that may be; and I conjecture that it creates the motive-power of some factory-looking edifices, which we saw on <b>our</b> first <b>arrival</b> at Skipton.|$|R
30|$|In <b>our</b> {{practical}} case, <b>arrival</b> amplitudes are correlated, {{which means}} that A is not full rank.

2500|$|Finally the {{trackers}} {{came upon}} the unsuspecting Natives {{on the banks of}} the Canadian River near Tucumcari Butte. [...] Catching them unaware, Carson, who was in the lead, moved towards the camp, motioning the others to follow. [...] In his autobiography Carson describes what followed: [...] "I was in advance, starting for their camp, calling for the men to follow. [...] The [...] officer called a halt, none of them would follow me. [...] I was informed that Leroux, the principle guide, told the officer in command, to halt, that the Indians wanted to have a parley. The Jicarillas started packing their goods for flight and a shot was fired that struck Captain Grier, causing no serious injury. (Due to the fact that Grier had a pair of heavy gauntlets tucked in his jacket) The captain ordered a charge, but the delay allowed all but one of the Indians to escape. In about 200 yards, pursuing the Indians, the body of Mrs. White was found, perfectly warm, had not been killed more than five minutes - shot through the heart by an arrow.... I am certain that if the Indians had been charged immediately on <b>our</b> <b>arrival</b> she would have been saved." [...] Ann White's daughter and servant were never found.|$|E
2500|$|After she {{had arrived}} in the United States in 1989 with Panait, Comăneci stated, [...] "Constantin told me that I was going to live with his wife and {{children}} for a bit. I never questioned him." [...] Her arrival initially generated some negative press, however, {{as a result of the}} media's misrepresentation of her relationship with Panait. Comăneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered to help me defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was going to help a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer was that I was a home-wrecker. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon <b>our</b> <b>arrival</b> in the United States. I didn't know that, but he promised to help me get settled, and I guess I just accepted his involvement in my future career as fair payment for the risks he'd taken. People died every day trying to defect.|$|E
60|$|Strange was the {{contrast}} between this departure, and <b>our</b> <b>arrival.</b>|$|E
60|$|One morning however {{about six}} weeks after <b>our</b> first <b>arrival,</b> I had {{occasion}} to send Frank by himself down to Hilo, {{on one of the}} sure-footed little mountain ponies, to fetch up some ropes and other articles we needed for our exploration from the stores in the town; and I said good-bye to him just outside the house, where Kalaua was seated, smoking a cigarette, and wrapped up as usual in his own stern and sombre reveries.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have taken}} {{advantage}} of the lucid interval to send a telegram to uncle Rik. No doubt your father has by this time received the telegram we sent announcing <b>our</b> safety and <b>arrival</b> here, so this one won't take them by surprise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you know}} the great world? so did I in my time, Mr. Brummell. I have had the visiting tickets of half the nobility at my lodgings in Bond Street. But they left me there no more cared for than last year's calendar," [...] sighed Mr. Sterne. [...] "I wonder who is the mode in London now? One of <b>our</b> late <b>arrivals,</b> my Lord Macaulay, has prodigious merit and learning, and, faith, his {{histories}} are more amusing than any novels, my own included." ...|$|R
60|$|We rested {{ourselves}} here, {{and sent}} an express to the Lord Hopton, {{who was then}} in Devonshire, of <b>our</b> <b>arrival,</b> and desired him to assign us quarters, and send us his farther orders. His lordship expressed a very great satisfaction at <b>our</b> <b>arrival,</b> and left it to our own conduct to join him as we saw convenient.|$|E

60|$|In a word, I {{compromised}} with my contending emotions, instituting {{myself the}} guardian of her glorious beauty. <b>Our</b> <b>arrival</b> at the hotel was concurrent with the usual lively glimpses of festivity always prevalent at a pleasure resort upon the approach of evening.

6000|$|... "`No indeed,' she said, while tears {{filled her}} eyes, `but work failed [...] us in London, where we once lived, and mother came to Liverpool to a [...] brother, {{who said he}} would help her, but he died soon after <b>our</b> [...] <b>arrival,</b> and then mother got ill and I had to begin and spend our [...] savings--savings that darling mother had scraped and toiled so hard to [...] gain--and this made her much worse, for she was so anxious to save [...] money!' ...|$|R
2500|$|On August 31, 2010, Giffords {{praised the}} arrival of National Guard troops on the border: [...] "Arizonans have {{waited a long time}} for the {{deployment}} of the National Guard in <b>our</b> state.

6000|$|... . We traversed {{again that}} same weary and dreary tract of country which we passed {{over in a}} winter {{afternoon}} and night on <b>our</b> first <b>arrival</b> in Rome.
