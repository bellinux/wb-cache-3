5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> by raising their tail to the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because of the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> the queen {{tends to be the}} most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E

5|$|House mice {{use both}} audible and {{ultrasonic}} {{calls in a}} variety of contexts.

5|$|Polistes exclamans exhibit {{an alarm}} response, {{typical of many}} higher level eusocial Hymenoptera. Although it has been {{previously}} indicated that nest mates may alarm the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> through jerky movement and buzzing of wings, Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non-species-specific venomous alarm pheromone. Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive, the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator, as the venom is only released during the sting. This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator. This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Although certain other insects {{have been able to}} adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm, Polistes exclamans has yet to do so, indicating that it is still in its “primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects.” In one experiment, pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper. It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it. This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it. While it was found that one wasp couldn’t release enough pheromones to elicit a response, if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response from the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> However, this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests, and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping.|$|E

Immediate baiting produced a dead black rat Rattus rattus. However, as the islands were all baited at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nesting</b> season, this incident pointed out the need for constant vigilance of reintroduction and a requirement to provide fresh bait on the islands throughout <b>the</b> <b>nesting</b> season. This was underlined by further invasions <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nesting</b> islands, including Nonsuch Island, in 2014 and 2015, although this time without loss to the birds.|$|R

5|$|Worker {{death is}} an {{important}} factor in colony failure, and is the cause of 13–76% of colony failures. This may be in part due to the small colony size. Because the colonies are small, worker longevity is crucial for the survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|E

5|$|As suicide {{requires}} a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot {{be said to}} occur in non-human animals.

5|$|At nest sites, battles {{sometimes}} {{occur between}} {{two or more}} pairs before the original owners declare themselves as the owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting {{with each other and}} ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and raising their young if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have been implicated in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In {{the case of the}} moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make their way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not {{large enough to be}} reproductive ants. However, it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds utter {{two types}} of alarm calls, {{alternating}} between them while mobbing other animals. One is a harsh call over a wide frequency (1.3 to 5.9kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. The other a lower-pitched staccato call with a frequency of 1.1–2.2kHz. They give a harsh call when trying to distract intruders from the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.|$|E

5|$|Several egg {{clutches}} of C. dughii are known, containing {{as many as}} 25 fossilized eggs.

Therefore, they concluded that Cairanoolithus nests were covered by organic or inorganic material, similar to modern eggs with high vapor conductance.|$|E
5|$|The Delichon martins were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff.

40|$|Estimation with <b>the</b> <b>Nested</b> Logit Model: Specifications and Software Particularities Abstract: The paper {{discusses}} <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> {{logit model}} for choices between {{a set of}} mutually exclusive alternatives (e. g. brand choice, strategy decisions, modes of transportation, etc.). Due to <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> logit model to allow and account for similarities between pairs <b>of</b> alternatives, <b>the</b> model has become very popular for <b>the</b> empirical analysis <b>of</b> choice decisions. However {{the fact that there}} are two different specifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> logit model (with different outcomes) has not received adequate attention. <b>The</b> utility maximization <b>nested</b> logit (UMNL) model and <b>the</b> non-normalized <b>nested</b> logit (NNNL) model have different properties, influencing the estimation results in a different manner. This paper introduces distinct specifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> logit model and indicates particularities arising from model estimation. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> using various software packages on <b>the</b> estimation results <b>of</b> a nested logit model are shown using simulated data sets for an artificial decision situation...|$|R
