[...] Presumably after Gateway realized that its practice of selling customer information was in direct conflict with the representation it had made in its privacy policy, the company introduced updates to the privacy policy, which, amongst other things, made more transparent that the company would in fact release users’ personal information without consent. [...] In pertinent part, one specific section of the privacy policy was changed to read as follows: Do we share your personally identifiable information with third parties?

It is accessed online {{tens of thousands of}} times each year. Perhaps most importantly, it is still offered free of charge, thanks to the generous funders listed on the inside cover. But Research Initiative/Treatment Action! is more than a publication. In many ways, it represents what The CFA is all about. In fact, people still call <b>or</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>us</b> asking if “Rita ” is available to answer some questions (probably because of {{the publication}}’s e-mail address: rita@centerforaids. org) ! RITA! is an essential compo-nent of The CFA's unique information, education, and advocacy work. It is an information medium, a sounding board and voice for advocacy, and a record of our epidemic. This issue of RITA! reviews the past 10 years of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In some ways, it is also a “year book ” for The CFA, reflecting on the 10 -year history of the organization, which was found-ed to combat a dearth of vital information, as well as an abundance of misconceptions and confusion, when new treatments started to become available to treat HIV/AIDS. In 2005, The CFA has been renamed as The Center for AIDS Information & Advocacy. The organization has a renewed mission and purpose t...|$|R
40|$|Dear Mine Operator, Training for new employees, {{refresher}} training for new employees, {{refresher training}}, and new task training {{can mean the}} difference between life and death for workers. Part 46 spells out how you can develop a training program to protect workers for on-the-job hazards. Together, labor, industry, and the U. S. Department of Labor reached a milestone with the development and publication of Part 46. We want to continue working together toward the next milestone, October 2000, when the regulations take effect. We want to make sure you have all the information you need about these new training requirements. Throughout the next 12 months, MSHA personnel will be holding regional meetings across the country, delivering information and sample training plans to your operation, and offering you help to develop your plan. If you are among the many operators who are already providing training to your workers, keep up the good work. The rule will tell you exactly what is expected. If you currently have no training program, we can help you develop one. A brochure is being distributed, which highlights the main provisions of the rule. It is designed to introduce the rule to you. More detailed materials will be delivered to you. If you want information right away, simply call <b>us,</b> <b>or</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>us.</b> We also welcome your comments, suggestions, and success stories. Part 46 will be successful and beneficial to miners through our combined efforts. Together, we can make our mines safe and healthier for everyone. Sincerely, J.

40|$|The {{guidance}} in this leaflet {{does not constitute}} legal advice What is covered by publication? Any publication whether a book, journal, advertising and information leaflet, exhibition catalogue or website that uses or quotes from a document held in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) requires permission to publish {{in which case you}} need to write to <b>or</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>us.</b> Your request should include a description of the document and the full PRONI reference number. What permissions do I require before publishing a document? Permission to publish requires permission from the Deputy Keeper of the records except those public records that are covered by the Crown copyright waiver (i. e. the records of government departments and the courts of law). When you register as a user of PRONI you are required to sign the registration form undertaking ‘not to quote from or use the documents in any published form without the written permission of the Deputy Keeper of the Records, which permission I shall formally acknowledge’. Before you can publish privately deposited documents {{it may be necessary to}} obtain the permission of the owner / depositor of the archive. There are many privately deposited archives where the owner/depositor has requested that they are contacted in the event of anyone wishing to publish any of their papers. Nevertheless, where substantial use is to be made of and/or quotation from the papers, PRONI will need to contact the owner/depositor. It is important that you write to us well in advance of the publication date to give us time to check if permission is required and then to contact the owner/depositor. Even if PRONI and the depositor/owner give permission, copyright clearance will still have to be obtained. In many instances the owner/depositor of privately deposited papers may only be one of a number of copyright owners in the archive. For example, the papers of the Marquesses of Downshire may include letters from th...|$|R
40|$|Electronic mail, <b>or</b> <b>e-mail,</b> {{has brought}} <b>us</b> {{a big step}} closer towards the vision of {{paperless}} offices. To advance even closer to this vision, however, {{it is essential that}} existing e-mail systems be enhanced with value-added services which are capable of replacing many of the human procedures established in pen and paper communications. One of the most important and desirable such services is certified e-mail delivery, in which the intended recipient will get the mail content if and only if the mail originator receives an irrefutable proof-of-delivery from the recipient. In this paper, we present the design of two third-party based certified mail protocols, termed CMP 1 and CMP 2. Both protocols are designed for integration into existing standard e-mail systems and both satisfy the requirements of non-repudiation of origin, non-repudiation of delivery, and fairness. The difference between CMP 1 and CMP 2 is that the former provides no mail content confidentiality protection while the la [...] ...|$|R
