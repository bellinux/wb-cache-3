Results of an {{experimental}} study of volume <b>osmotic</b> <b>flows</b> in a single-membrane osmotic-diusive cell, which contains a horizontal, microporous, sym-metrical polymer membrane separating water and binary or ternary electrolyte so-lutions are presented.

An important assumption underlying this calculation is that both osmotic and diffusional flow are rate-limited by the same barrier in the membrane.

Here we demonstrate that the chemical anisotropy is not a necessary condition to achieve locomotion. The non linear interplay between surface <b>osmotic</b> <b>flows</b> and solute advection can produce spontaneous, and self-sustained motion of isotropic particles. We solve, for a spherical particle, the classical nonlinear autophoretic theoretical framework at arbitrary Péclet number. For a given set of material parameters, there exists a critical particle size, or equivalently a critical Peclet number, above which spontaneous autophoretic motion occurs. The flow induced by the particle further displays a hierarchy of instabilities associated with quantized critical Peclet numbers. Using numerical solutions of the full (unsteady) diffusiophoretic problem we confirm our analytical predictions and show that, above the instability threshold, the isotropic particles reach a steady swimming state with broken front-back symmetry in the concentration field and the hydrodynamic signature of a "pusher" swimmer. This instability to propulsion could be relevant to the high-throughput production of self-propelled particles. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, 1 supplementary document, 1 supplementary vide...|$|R

These opposite effects of glibenclamide on the transepithelial <b>osmotic</b> <b>flow</b> {{can be explained by}} a reduction of cAMP permeability across the basolateral membrane of the epithelium. The decrease in cAMP permeability leads, according to the direction of the cAMP gradient, to firstly an enhanced <b>osmotic</b> <b>flow</b> when cAMP is generated intracellularly by addition of ADH and FK, glibenclamide reducing cAMP exit from the cell, and secondly a decreased <b>osmotic</b> <b>flow</b> in response to cAMP (and 8 -Br-cAMP) added to the basolateral medium, glibenclamide inhibiting, in this case, their entry into the cellThe demonstration that glibenclamide actually inhibits the basolateral cAMP permeability rests on the fact that firstly it decreases the release of cAMP into the basolateral medium by about 40 %, at each concentration of ADH or forskolin tested, secondly it increases the cAMP content of paired hemibladders incubated in the presence of ADH or FK, when intracellular degradation was prevented by phosphodiesterase inhibition, and thirdly it decreases also the uptake of basolateral 8 -Br-[3 H]cAMP into paired toad hemibladders.

The coefficient of the volume flux amplification for ternary solutions in comparison to binary ones depends on solutes concentrations and has maximum values dependent on solutes concentrations.

In one group of experiments, the ADH-dependent <b>osmotic</b> water <b>flows,</b> when the perfusing solutions contained hypotonic NaCl solutions, were indistinguishable from control observations when either urea or sucrose replaced, in part, NaCl in isotonic bathing solutions (cortical collecting tubules).

Since the effective hydrodynamic radii of urea and sucrose are, respectively, 1. 8 and 5. 2 A, it is likely that σi, for urea, sucrose, and NaCl, was unity. In support of this, the diffusion permeability coefficient (PDi cm sec- 1) of urea was indistinguishable from zero.

40|$|In {{the present}} study several aspects of the osmotic water-flow-regulation {{mechanism}} in frog urinary bladder were examined, utilizing forskolin either as a direct hydrosmotic agent or in association with vasopressin. It was found that forskolin induces a hydrosmotic effect {{similar to the one}} induced by vasopressin. This effect is rapid, reversible and dose-dependent. The half-maximally effective concentration (Ec 50 FSK) is 1. 37 microM forskolin. No additional effect on the <b>osmotic</b> water <b>flow</b> was observed when maximal concentrations of forskolin and vasopressin were given simultaneously. Moreover, forskolin can also markedly potentiate vasopressin-induced hydrosmotic response. This potentiation was maximal with submaximal doses of vasopressin, whereas it disappeared when the hormonal concentration was increased to very high levels. Therefore, forskolin increases vasopressin potency without affecting vasopressin efficacy. The Ec 50 FSK for the forskolin-induced increase in vasopressin potency was 11 nmol, about two orders of magnitude lower than the Ec 50 FSK for the direct effect of forskolin on the osmotic water transport. On the whole, our results are compatible with a two-site model of forskolin action in frog urinary bladder: a low affinity site (Ec 50 FSK = 1. 37 microM) that mediates the direct action of forskolin on the <b>osmotic</b> water <b>flow</b> and a high affinity site (Ec 50 FSK = 11 nmol), which mediates the synergic effect of forskolin with the antidiuretic hormone...|$|R
