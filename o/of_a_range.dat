When the inverse phase <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ranging</b> component is received and detected, the cleanup loop is modified to demodulate phase modulated command symbols while continuing tracking the same ranging component. The command symbol rate is coherently related to the ranging signal component bit rate...|$|R

The {{point of view of}} each chapter in the story is a limited {{perspective}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as components <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery {{and the construction}} of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E

5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E

Wookey Hole was occupied by humans in the Iron Age, possibly around 250-300 BC, while nearby Hyena Cave was occupied by Stone Age hunters. Badger Hole and Rhinoceros Hole are two dry caves on the slopes above the Wookey ravine near the Wookey Hole resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during the Ice Age. Just outside the cave the foundations of a 1st-century hut have been identified. These had been built on during the Roman era {{up to the end}} of the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended {{to design and}} build a large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not envisage that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine had it that submarines were the main platform for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface ships, which were increasingly capable <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of different missions, led {{to the idea of a}} single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E

5|$|Salford's built {{environment}} {{is made up}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the {{built environment}} is poor.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasp, {{especially in the}} Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the parasitic wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser}} extent of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars at {{the turn}} of the 18th and 19th centuries led to some of the castles being re-garrisoned and improved, as part of the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of gun batteries around key locations. Some of the fortifications such as Sandgate, Southsea, Hurst and Pendennis, protected strategic locations and these were extensively modernised. Hurst, for example, was redesigned with batteries of heavier 36-pounder (16.3kg) weapons, and Pendennis was equipped with up to 48 guns. Sandgate's keep was rebuilt to form a Martello tower as part of a wider programme of work along the south coast. New gun batteries were constructed at Deal, Sandown in Kent and Tilbury, while Fort Mersea was brought back into service complete with a new battery as well. Calshot Castle was renovated, Southsea's defences were extensively modernised, as were those in Hull, with the castle and the south blockhouse being refitted.|$|E

5|$|The first {{herbarium}} {{collection of}} B.epica {{was not made}} until October 1973, when Ernest Charles Nelson visited Toolinna Cove to collect specimens for a taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. Nelson was stimulated to make that revision from {{an interest in the}} problem of disjunct plant distributions in southern Australia, and therefore collected specimens <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of plant species. On 22 October, he collected a specimen of B.epica in old flower, but incorrectly identified it as B.media, and later lodged it in the herbarium at Canberra under that name.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} {{occupied}} the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on Lambeth Road since 1936. The hospital building {{was designed by}} the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road, with a central entrance under a portico.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{rooms were}} {{positioned}} {{on the first}} floor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of buildings that ran around the outside of the ward, facing onto a courtyard. The four towers that protected the Inner Ward contained service facilities, with the Chapel Tower containing the private royal chapel. Each tower has an additional watchtower turret, probably intended both for security and to allow the prominent display of the royal flag. The arrangement was originally {{similar to that of the}} 13th century Gloriette at Corfe Castle, and provided a combination of privacy for the king while providing extensive personal security. The two sets of apartments were later unified into a single set of rooms, including a great chamber, outer chamber and inner chamber.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} {{show that}} detours that increase flight distance {{by up to}} 20% will often be adaptive on aerodynamic grounds – a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus, which fly far east across North America before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route {{is believed to be}} the consequence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation risk, or other factors.|$|E
5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{also found}} time to {{contribute}} to the administration of the wider university, serving on the Hebdomadal Council, as a Delegate of Oxford University Press, as one of the curators of the Bodleian, and as Pro-Vice-Chancellor 1974–5. It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981).
