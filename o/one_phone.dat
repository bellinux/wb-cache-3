5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was {{a privately}} held, venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto, California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform.

She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] In <b>one</b> <b>phone</b> call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional.

500|$|On June 18, 1989, after a Mets–Phillies game, the Phillies traded Samuel to the Mets for McDowell and Lenny Dykstra. Dykstra was {{a career}} [...]278 hitter with the Mets {{and had not}} equaled his 1986 season when he hit [...]295. Dykstra flourished in Philadelphia {{and went on to}} be named to three All-Star teams in six full seasons with the Phillies, finish in the top ten in National League Most Valuable Player voting twice, and help lead the Phillies to the 1993 National League pennant. McDowell saved 45 games for the Phillies in parts of three seasons and became a fan favorite. The trade was a bust for the Mets as Samuel hit only [...]228 for the Mets in 1989 and was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 1989 season. It {{signaled}} an ascent of the Phillies which culminated in their 1993 National League pennant and the demise of the Mets in the early 1990s. Sports Illustrated writer and Mets fan David Vecsey counts the Dykstra trade as one of the five worst in Mets history, writing, [...] "Never mind that Dykstra was better than Samuel, this trade was devastating to Mets fans on a purely personal level. With <b>one</b> <b>phone</b> call, GM Joe McIlvaine gutted the team of its heart." [...] The trade also ushered in a period of bad blood between the two teams.|$|E
500|$|The game's trivia {{is based}} on general {{knowledge}} from several fields including science, history, and geography, combined with contemporary entertainment, celebrities, and other news items; the game, {{as well as the}} series, is often described as [...] "high culture meets pop culture". For example, one question asks the players to identify which Jennifer Aniston film title would most likely have been suited for a hypothetical romantic comedy penned by Albert Einstein about the interactions between neutrons and electrons, the answer being [...] "He's Just Not That Into You". In addition to the usual questions, each episode typically features a [...] "Dis or Dat" [...] question. This question gives the players seven words or phrases which they have to identify as one of two possible classifications, or in some cases, both. For example, one Dis or Dat series asks the players to identify terms that would be features of a Nexus <b>One</b> <b>phone,</b> Nexxus shampoo, or both. In offline play, only one player participates, while other players try to steal by getting it right if the main player gets it wrong. [...] In online play, all players play the Dis Or Dat simultaneously. Players are also urged to look for the [...] "Wrong Answer of the Game", which is hinted at by the show's sponsor; for example, in an episode sponsored by a baby crib company, the answer [...] "Cat's Cradle" [...] is the Wrong Answer of the Game. Choosing the correct Wrong Answer does not penalize the player but instead rewards them with a large monetary bonus. Other questions are presented in the standard multiple choice format but use recurring concepts, such as questions based on a fortune cookie message, or ones read through Cookie's ventriloquist dummy incorporating a speech impediment that may make the question harder to understand.|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{services}} that AT aggressively promotes is its Rollover Minutes service, which allows customers to keep unused minutes from month to month on a twelve-month rolling cycle on its popular nationwide plans. Beginning in July 2007, AT allows its AT Unity plan users to have Rollover, a service which was exclusive to the Nation plans. AT also launched video share in 2007, in which a mobile caller can stream live video from <b>one</b> <b>phone</b> to another over the 3G network with video share capable phones. This allows one mobile phone user to view video from another user's camera through the mobile phone in real time. AT also had A-list, similar to former competitor Alltel's program launched on April 20, 2006 branded [...] "My Circle." [...] AT rolled out the A-list program on September 20, 2009. Customers with individual Nation plans of $59.99 or higher could use A-List with Rollover to select up to five domestic phone numbers to call anytime—including landlines and wireless numbers on any network—without using any of the minutes in their plan. FamilyTalk customers with plans of $89.99 or more could select up to ten numbers which any person in the FamilyTalk plan can call {{as much as they}} want. Effective September 1, 2011, the A-List feature is no longer available to new consumer and IRU customers. Existing customers who had A-List on their account prior to September 1, 2011, are able to keep the feature as long as they stay on a qualifying rate plan. As of October 25, 2013 AT no longer offers Nation Plans or Family Talk Plans to its new customers. New customers are now required to have one of AT Mobile Share Value plans which include unlimited Talk, Text and a shareable bucket of data start at $45 for a smartphone. As of January 8, 2016 AT no longer offers 2 year contracts for subsidized smart phones to its consumer customers. Customers who currently have 2 year contracts are grandfathered, until they upgrade to a new device they will have to choose from AT's NEXT installment plans for smartphones. AT has also reintroduced unlimited data plans for its customers who also have either AT U-verse or AT's newly acquired DirecTV. Unlimited data plans may be speed throttled after 22 GB of data have been used. With the inclusion of these new plans AT has also introduced a free roaming in Mexico feature for its postpaid customers.|$|E
