5000|$|Various {{parameters}} are defined and specified {{to quantify the}} performance of optical switches. The steady state performance of an optical switch (or <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> <b>matrix)</b> is measured by its ability to effectively transmit optical power from an input port {{to any one of}} N output ports over the “on” state transmission path, and its ability to effectively isolate input power sources from all non-active ports over the “off” state transmission paths. Other key optical performance parameters include transmission efficiency over a range of wavelengths, the ability to minimize input optical power reflected back into the input fiber, transmission balance, and bidirectional transmission. The optical switch (or switching matrix) transient behavior is another important characteristic that is specified by its speed of response to control stimulation via the time interval it takes to either transmit or block the optical signal on any given output port. Two rates can be associated with switches: the switching rate and the signal transmission rate. The switching rate is the rate at which a switch changes states. The signal transmission rate is the modulation rate of information passing through a switch. The signal transmission rate is usually much greater than the switching rate. (If the switching rate approaches or exceeds the transmission rate, then the switch can be called an optical modulator.) ...|$|E
40|$|Resource {{allocation}} is {{an evolving}} {{part of many}} Cloud computing and data center management problems. For {{infrastructure as a service}} (IaaS) in the Cloud, the Cloud service provider allocates virtual machines (VMs) to the customers with required CPU, memory and disk configurations. In addition to the computing infrastructures, the bandwidth resources would also be allocated to customers for data transmission between reserved VMs. In the near future, users may also want to reserve multiple virtual data centers (VDCs) to construct their own virtual Cloud, which could be called data center as a service (DCaaS). For these two types of services, how to provide guaranteed network bandwidth over an optical network and achieve the joint resource allocation is a challenge to the central resource manager. ^ In this dissertation, we focus on network-aware resource allocation in Cloud/Grid over optical networks first. We investigate this problem from the provider 2 ̆ 7 s perspective and user 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. A multi-layer (IP-over-OTN-over-WDM) optical network architecture is utilized for reserving network resources. We develop mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) mathematical models and propose different heuristics for the optimal network-aware resource allocation problem from the Cloud/Grid provider 2 ̆ 7 s and the customer 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives with different targets. ^ Furthermore, we investigate the network-efficient virtualized cloud infrastructure provisioning (NE-VCIP) problem in IP-over-EON inter-data center network (DCN) based on the DCaaS model. The elastic optical network (EON) is adopted to provide spectrum and cost-efficient networking resources for large bandwidth requests. We develop MILP mathematical models for this problem and propose a cost-optimized heuristic to solve this problem. To investigate the cost and blocking rate for the served demands, different modulation formats and optical transponders are compared in the EON layer, and the sliceable bandwidth variable transponders (SBVT) and optical traffic grooming technology are considered. ^ Finally the network-efficient virtual resource provisioning is investigated for intra-DCN based on different types of optical intra-DCN architectures: a hybrid packet and circuit switched DCN architecture (HyPaC), a novel optical switching DCN architecture (OSA) with reconfigurable <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> and a pure optical DCN architecture with fully connected non-blocking <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> <b>matrix.</b> Multi-objective MILP and mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) models are constructed for the optimal resource provisioning problems for the corresponding DCN architectures. ...|$|E
40|$|The global {{communications}} network {{has become a}} pervasive and critical item of everyday life, spawning and enabling countless worldwide services that went from nonexistent to must-have {{in less than a}} decade. Its implementation makes considerable use of optical transmission systems, which are the physical medium of choice for most non-wireless links, being capable of high data rates over long distances. However, the potential of optics is still underexploited, and can help a smarter network meet the simultaneous challenges of ever-higher data rates, network switching, and the "last-mile" access network. Very high data rates were achieved in optical transmissions in the late 1990 s especially through wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) over the C and later the L spectral bands. For some time, the way to increase data rates was forecast to be higher symbol rates per wavelength, for which optical-to-electronic (O-E) conversions are a speed bottleneck. This required all-optical functionalities, especially to process optical time-domain multiplexed signals. In that line, I contributed to ultrafast clock recovery using opto-electronic phase-locked loops. However, the recent comeback of coherent optical communications points to easier ways to increase the data rate by pushing towards higher spectral efficiencies, closer to the optical channel's Shannon capacity in the presence of certain physical impairments. Notably, some of my recent results suggest that polarization-dependent loss can be handled close to the limit thanks to a combination of space-time codes and more conventional error-correcting codes. Switching is another bottleneck: the Internet's great versatility results in part from its packet-switching paradigm, but current optical networks are essentially circuit-switched using wavelength granularity. Packet-switching functionality is implemented purely in electronics, incurring numerous energy-inefficient O-E conversions and ballooning energy costs. My work on all-optical functionalities included an all-optical label-processing scheme for switching nodes, though this approach would be subject to scaling problems in practice. More recently, my concern has shifted to hybrid switching nodes using electronic buffers to supplement an <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> <b>matrix.</b> My current studies show great improvements of their sustainable load compared to all-optical switches at a given packet-loss probability. Access network is the last stronghold where optical transmissions are not quite dominant yet. The focus there is on cost effectiveness and resource sharing, especially in passive optical networks (PONs). In order to bring WDM to PONs, I contributed to a pulsed continuum optical source that could have provided optical channels to multiple users simultaneously. More recently, I also oversaw work on reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers designed for colorless optical network units. Finally, the challenge goes on for a better match between network functionalities and the untapped potential of optics. My focus is currently shifting towards cross-layer optical networking, requiring novel network architectures to break free from the electronic-centric layered-network model, and finally meeting the energy consumption problem square-on...|$|E

40|$|A {{wideband}} {{local area}} network using <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> is presently being developed by the Heinrich-Hertz-Institut in Berlin. To ensure high reliability, the system is implemented as a star type network and {{is divided into two}} subsystems. All switching within the system are done by <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> techniques. The wideband subsystem uses lithium-niobate <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> elements interconnected as a multistage space switch. Thus bit rate independent channels is available with the ability to establish various wideband services of the in-house area. The second subsystem makes use of a single-mode star coupler. Distributed circuit switching with fast switching capability and flexible data rate is implemented utilizing a TDM frame that support 63 narrow band connections and a capacity of 8 Mb/s for fast data services...|$|R
40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>switches</b> {{using two}} {{electro-optical}} effects in liquid crystals are proposed and investigated for incorporation in a <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> for <b>optical</b> networks. These two devices employ selective reflection in cholesteric layers and total reflection {{at the border}} between glass and nematic liquid crystal. Prototypes of these switches have been designed and their parameters have been investigated. Initial results suggest the switching contrast ratio of 38. 5 and 42 dB, respectively, with insertion loss about 2. 3 … 2. 9 dB for polarized light...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{nonlinear}} directional couplers with variable coupling coefficients {{can be used}} to compose a special kind of <b>switching</b> <b>matrix.</b> The <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> can be controlled by the signal itself or by a strong pump. Light routing is realized by adjustment {{of the power of the}} signal or the pump. Because light routing is based on the optical Kerr effect, ultrafast routing is possible. © 2003 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 190. 4360, 230. 1150, 130. 3120. The potential applications of nonlinear directional couplers (NLDCs) in all-optical signal processing have attracted a great deal of research interest since they were first introduced by Jensen in 1982. 1 Several variations of the NLDC, such as Y junctions, 2 X junctions, 3 and bent couplers, 4 – 6 have been proposed since then. Usually, these devices can be used as, e. g., <b>optical</b> <b>switches,</b> <b>optical</b> limiters, optical intensity discriminators, and logic gates. When they are used as switching devices, NLDCs can be self-switching device...|$|R
