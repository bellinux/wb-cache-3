Word order universals are particularly robust examples, and the present dissertation focuses on {{the relation between the}} order of the verb and the object and the adposition and the noun. In the languages of the world, there is a preference for consistent ordering of the heads in these constituents. An artificial language learning experiment was conducted, in which participants learned one of four different miniature languages, which represented each of the possible order combinations. The results showed a combined influence of an <b>ordering</b> <b>bias</b> and the native language, showing that the head-order bias involved is strong enough to overcome native language influence. Additional interesting findings on the driving force of the verb phrase order towards other word orders are also discussed.

40|$|We {{know that}} {{students}} are more optimistic about their performance after they take a test that progresses from the easiest to hardest questions than after taking one that progresses in the opposite order¹. In fact, these “Easy-Hard” students are more optimistic than “Hard-Easy” students even when the two groups perform equally. The literature explains this question <b>order</b> <b>bias</b> {{as a result of}} students’ failing to sufficiently adjust, in the face of new information, their extreme initial impressions about the test. In the first two of six studies, we investigated the possibility that a biased memory for individual questions on the test is an alternative mechanism driving the question <b>order</b> <b>bias.</b> The pattern of results was inconsistent with this mechanism, but fit with the established impression-based mechanism. In the next four studies, we addressed the role that the number of test questions plays in determining the size of the question <b>order</b> <b>bias,</b> discovered that warning students is only a partially effective method for reducing the bias, and established a more precise estimate of the bias’ size. Taken together, this work provides evidence that the question <b>order</b> <b>bias</b> is a robust phenomenon, likely driven by insufficient adjustment from extreme initial impressions. ¹ Although the research in this thesis is my own, I conducted it in a lab and supervised a team comprised of research assistants and honours students.

Dufosky’s (1992) model concluded that the asymmetric adjustment of open limit orders for cash dividend payments under the NYSE and AMEX rules is sufficient to create abnormal returns on the ex-dividend day. Empirical evidence shows that the limit <b>order</b> <b>bias</b> incurred due to the asymmetric adjustment of open limit orders seems to dominate the overnight ex-day returns {{but at the same}} time, it is significantly corrected via active trading up until the close of the ex- dividend day. As a result, the significant association of the ex-day price drop discrepancy with the opening limit <b>order</b> <b>bias</b> eventually disappears before the ex-dividend day close. Finally, it is found that the reversal of the limit <b>order</b> <b>bias</b> is in fact quicker in stocks which are more liquid or listed on NASDAQ where strong competition among dealers is envisaged to drive stale quotes closer to the fair adjustment of the dividend.

Like part-list relearning—the reexposure of learned material for additional learning—this part-list cuing is often assumed {{to be the result}} of output <b>order</b> <b>biases</b> at test, caused by the increased strength of the reexposed material. We directly compared the effects of cuing and relearning when controlling for output <b>order</b> <b>biases.</b> In addition, we compared the two forms of reexposure with the effect of part-list retrieval. Both part-list cuing and part-list retrieval reduced recall performance for the remaining material. By contrast, part-list relearning had no such detrimental effect. These results indicate that the effect of reexposure depends on whether material is reexposed as a cue or for relearning, suggesting that part-list cuing reflects an instructional effect.

40|$|Two forestland owner {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} during 1985 and 1986 {{to examine the}} characteristics, attitudes, and motivations of nonindustrial private forest landowners in Iowa. The {{first part of this}} paper examines the effect of response <b>order</b> <b>bias</b> in telephone surveys. Unlike previous studies that found little effect from response <b>order</b> <b>bias</b> in other types of surveys, response <b>order</b> <b>bias</b> was shown to have a significant influence on response patterns. In the second part, a measure for assessing attitudes toward land stewardship is proposed. A model of land stewardship is also proposed and tested using factor analysis. The factor analysis of the land stewardship scale failed to support the apriori assumptions about the nature of attitudes toward land stewardship. Three attitude scales were developed for use in parts three and four and a revised model of land stewardship is proposed. The third section examines factors that are influencing management of private forestland holdings. Landowner characteristics, such as age, education, and gross income, were found to be positively related to forestland management. Timber production, recreation, investment, and wildlife, as reasons for owning forestland, also showed a positive relationship to management. A number of attitude scales that measured attitudes toward the environment and decision making were also included. The overall results indicated that forestland managers tend to be interested in multiple benefits from their forest and show a concern for the environment. A proposed method of characterizing non-industrial private forest landowners is presented in the fourth part. Five types of NIPF landowners are identified, including retired farmers, agriculturalists, timber agriculturalists, farm stewards, and grazing enthusiasts.

As an application, the ESPL is used to investigate an overidentified moment model. It is shown how the model 2 ̆ 7 s parameters can be estimated with both the ESPL and a conditional ESPL (CESPL), conditional on the overidentifying restrictions being satisfied. This application leads to several new tests for over-identifying restrictions. Simulations demonstrate that ESPL and CESPL have smaller bias than currently available one-step GMM estimators. The simulations also show new tests for over-identifying restrictions that have performance comparable to or better than currently available tests.
