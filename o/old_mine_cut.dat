The law required a permit and regular inspection for a municipality to use such a pit. George Segaritus, a regional landfill inspector {{who worked for the}} Department of Mines and Mineral Industries (DMMI), became concerned about the pit when he noticed holes in the walls and floor, as such <b>mines</b> often <b>cut</b> through <b>older</b> <b>mines</b> underneath.

50|$|In 1806, Napoleon I of France {{conquered the}} Holy Roman Empire. He {{restructured}} the many German {{states and the}} Duchy of Bavaria was promoted to a Kingdom. The ruling Wittelsbach Duke became King Maximilian of Bavaria.With his new status, the King ordered new regalia to be made, which included the 35.56 carat g Wittelsbach Diamond, an oval <b>Old</b> <b>Mine</b> <b>cut</b> blue diamond. The diamond's history {{dates back to the}} 1660s {{and for the most part}} has been uneventful. The gem was offered with other Bavarian Crown Jewels in a 1931 auction at Christie's in London, but apparently it did not sell, nor did it return to its display in Munich. Rumours included one that the stone had been sold illegally in 1932 through a Munich jeweller and had reappeared in the Netherlands. Later research indicated that the gem had actually been sold in Belgium in 1951 and that it had changed hands again in 1955. In 1958 millions of visitors came to Brussels for the World Exhibition, which included the jewellery display which included a large blue diamond. But no one was aware it was the missing Wittelsbach Diamond. In January 1962 Joseph Komkommer, a leading figure in the Belgian diamond industry, received a phone call asking him to look at an <b>Old</b> <b>Mine</b> <b>cut</b> diamond with a view of its recutting. When he opened the package he found a dark blue diamond, which is among the rarest and most valuable of gems. Mr. Komkommer at once recognized that the diamond was one of historical significance and that it would be a tragedy to recut it. With the assistance of his son, Jacques Komkommer, he identified the diamond as the 'lost' blue diamond. He thereupon formed a consortium of diamond buyers from Belgium and the USA which purchased the diamond, then valued at £180,000. The vendors were the trustees of an estate whose identity remained undisclosed. Finally, the Wittelsbach was acquired by private collector in 1964. It was announced in October 2008 the diamond would be offered for auction at Christie's in December. Its original Golden Fleece ornament can be seen today in the Treasury of the Residenz Palace in Munich, a blue glass replica of the Wittelsbach in place of where the diamond was set.|$|E

5000|$|Discovery of Mine à Breton in the 1770s drained much of {{the effort}} from <b>Old</b> <b>Mines,</b> but as <b>Old</b> <b>Mines</b> was only 5 to 6 mi to the north, it was close enough that some miners {{continued}} to live there while working Mine à Breton. Some of the miners' families moved {{back and forth between}} <b>Old</b> <b>Mines</b> and Mine à Breton. It is unclear whether <b>Old</b> <b>Mines</b> was continuously inhabited through the 1790s into {{the first years of the}} 19th century. There may have been disruptions due to raids by the Osage, and there is record of a complaint that inhabitants were forced to abandon their homes due to pollution of <b>Old</b> <b>Mines</b> Creek by animal and mining waste. [...] Nevertheless, there were enough inhabitants in 1797 for a petition to be made for an agricultural concession, a request that was not acted on but which may have helped forestall a later request for mining concession by the American Moses Austin who had started larger-scale mining and refining at Mine à Breton.|$|R
