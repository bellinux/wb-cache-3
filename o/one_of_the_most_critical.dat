5|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} {{amphibian}} populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinction, {{have been noted}} since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> threats to global biodiversity. In 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds, mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{messages}} were sent by agents, the Twenty Committee considered that Ironside was quite unrealistic {{and as a}} result was cautious about promoting it too heavily. Most of the information was sent with words of caution or uncertainty to ensure that the agent would not be compromised. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> Bodyguard agents, Garbo, did become involved on 5 June, but only in forwarding the message of a fictional sub-agent who he had already identified as unreliable (MI5 hoped that this would cover for, in their opinion, the implausible nature of the story). The agent's report explained that a US division based in Liverpool was preparing to head to Bordeaux.|$|E

5|$|Despite his successes, when Edward I died in 1307 {{he left a}} {{range of}} {{challenges}} for his son to resolve. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings should give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} {{amphibian}} populations {{is an ongoing}} mass extinction of amphibian species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are known as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> threats to global biodiversity, and several causes {{are believed to be}} involved, including disease, habitat destruction and modification, exploitation, pollution, pesticide use, introduced species, and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on extinction rates suggest that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the background extinction rate and the estimate goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.|$|E
5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> moments of the war.|$|E

Defects can be buried underneath or within the multilayer stack or {{be on top of}} the multilayer stack. Mesas or protrusions form on the sputtering targets used for multilayer deposition, which may fall off as particles during the multilayer deposition. In fact, defects of atomic scale height (0.3–0.5nm) with 100nm FWHM can still be printable by exhibiting 10% CD impact. IBM and Toppan reported at Photomask Japan 2015 that smaller defects, e.g., 50nm size, can have 10% CD impact even with 0.6nm height, yet remain undetectable.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Empire {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, during World War II from March 1942 {{until after the}} end of the War in 1945. The period was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> in Indonesian history. Under German occupation, the Netherlands had little ability to defend its colony against the Japanese army, and less than three months after the first attacks on Borneo, the Japanese navy and army overran Dutch and allied forces. Initially, most Indonesians joyfully welcomed the Japanese, as liberators from their Dutch colonial masters. The sentiment changed, as Indonesians were expected to endure more hardship for the war effort. In 1944–1945, Allied troops largely bypassed Indonesia and did not fight their way into the most populous parts such as Java and Sumatra. As such, most of Indonesia was still under Japanese occupation at the time of their surrender, in August 1945.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> {{elements}} of the 18th century was the increasing availability of printed material, both for readers and authors. Books fell in price dramatically and used books were sold at Bartholomew Fair and other fairs. Additionally, a brisk trade in chapbooks and broadsheets carried London trends and information out to the farthest reaches of the kingdom. That was furthered {{with the establishment of}} periodicals, including The Gentleman's Magazine and the London Magazine. People in York aware of the happenings of Parliament and the court, but people in London were also more aware than before of the happenings of York. Furthermore, before copyright, pirate editions were commonplace, especially in areas without frequent contact with London. Pirate editions thereby encouraged booksellers to increase their shipments to outlying centres like Dublin, which further increased.awareness across the whole realm. That was compounded {{by the end of the}} Press Restriction Act in 1693, which allowed for provincial printing presses to be established, creating a printing structure that was no longer under government control (Clair 158–176).|$|E

500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> reviews was by Francesca Dinglasan of Boxoffice Magazine.

[...] Although Diggs's acting was [...] "engaging", according to her the film [...] "depends on just a few too many big-screen cliches and predictable plot turns." [...] The [...] "richly designed sets and costumes" [...] were not able to overcome the less-than-satisfactory" [...] Drum.|$|E
500|$|The Germans {{knew the}} {{invasion}} was imminent {{if not the}} exact location; Major Schmidt, {{in command of the}} bridges, had been told that they were <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> points in Normandy. The defenders however were not on full alert and only two sentries were on duty when the gliders landed. The sound of a gunshot alerted the two sentries on the canal bridge. As Brotheridge's platoon attacked, one ran off shouting [...] "paratroops" [...] while the second fired a flare gun to alert nearby defenders. Brotheridge shot him while other members of his platoon cleared the trenches and pillbox with grenades. Alerted by the flare, the German machine gunners opened fire at the men on the bridge, wounding Brotheridge as he threw a grenade. The grenade silenced one of the machine gun positions and another was taken out by Bren gun fire. Number One Platoon crossed the bridge to take up a defensive position on the west bank. The Royal Engineers from number one glider searched for explosive charges and cut the fuse wires when they found any. Smith's platoon crossed the bridge next, exchanging fire with the German defenders, whereupon Smith was wounded by a grenade. Using grenades and sub-machine gun fire, the platoons cleared the trenches and bunkers. By 00:21 German resistance on {{the west bank of the}} canal bridge was over. Checking the area, the men of Brotheridge's platoon now realised that their leader was wounded. He failed to recover and soon died of his wounds, becoming the first Allied soldier killed by enemy action during the invasion. On the east bank, Wood's platoon cleared the trenches and bunkers with little opposition. Woods was hit in the leg by machine-gun fire as he ordered the platoon to storm the German defences. All three platoon commanders at the canal bridge were now either dead or wounded.|$|E
