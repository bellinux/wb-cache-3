50|$|Two {{transport}} systems {{evolved in the}} early video machines, known as the alpha wrap and the <b>omega</b> <b>wrap.</b> In the alpha-wrap machines the tape is wrapped around the head drum for a full 360 degrees (the tape looking like the lowercase Greek letter alpha). There is only one head which writes a complete stripe for every revolution of the head. This system has problems when the head transits from one piece of tape to the next, giving a large signal gap between fields. The machine has to fill this gap with the frame-synchronizing pulses. Such machines are constrained to using guard-band recording (see below).|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the <b>omega</b> <b>wrap,</b> such as that used by Echo Science Corporation of Mountain View, California in its instrumentation and high resolution video recorders in the late 1970s and 1980s, wraps the 1-inch tape about 190 degrees around the two-headed drum, so there is signal overlap between the two heads. Head switching in video recorders occurs instantaneously in the video models, during an horizontal sync interval. With a standard NTSC video signal a head can cover one sixth of a field each time it passed across the tape. Switching in instrumentation models is gradual, so the signals from both heads overlaps briefly, producing a transient-free output signal where the original signal does not contain convenient dead intervals during which a switching transient can be hidden.|$|E
50|$|He made a {{habit of}} keeping his skill a secret from his compatriots as well as his foes, using it only sparingly, and if no one was looking {{directly}} at him â€” unless it was absolutely vital. The only time when his fellow Team-X members found out about his powers was when they went up against Omega Red. John was backup on that mission that Wolverine, Maverick, and Sabretooth ran in Germany to collect a carbonadium synthesizer, and when that trio burst out of the target compound with Red in pursuit, John stalled him with his gun until the others got away. Unfazed, <b>Omega</b> went to <b>wrap</b> John up and tear him to pieces, but John teleported to safety at the last second, with only Wolverine and Omega Red seeing this. There was also a certain animosity between him and Sabretooth. He was about as violent as his fellows from the Weapon X program, but a lot more merciful and didn't enjoy killing innocents while on a mission, which put him at odds with people like Sabretooth. Sabretooth once languished for quite a time in John's basement with several shaped charges strapped to his chest. Unless he had a really good reason to, Sabretooth wouldn't lift a finger to help John.|$|R
