2500|$|A Regional Council study {{describes}} the vegetation around the estuary - [...] "Te Heru Point and up towards Pakoka Landing, {{a forest of}} akeake, kanuka and kowhai lines the estuary arm. Spartina is present on the [...] upstream of Ohiawhakainga Creek. Patches of sea meadow are found {{at the mouth of}} the Motakotako Creek in front of the rushes. The saline influence on the vegetation finishes just upstream of the road bridge at Pakoka Landing. Moving downstream on the true-left bank are bands of saltmarsh ribbonwood with marsh clubrush and raupo wetland behind. Small patches of seagrass are found on the mud flats around the corner where the river widens out. The farmland is not fenced along the [...] and stock access is potentially a problem. A mature (~10 years?) flowering mangrove is upstream of Karetoto Island. A small patch of saltwater paspalum is found immediately opposite the island. A patch of seagrass lies behind the <b>oyster</b> <b>bank</b> at Mowhiti Point. The harbour edge is lined by a thin band of rush." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dux Hut on South Stradbroke Island {{was erected}} [...] on Oyster Camp Reserve R.638, {{opposite}} <b>Oyster</b> <b>Bank</b> 122 in Tippler's Passage, by Augie Dux of Labrador, {{who had taken}} up the licence of this <b>oyster</b> <b>bank</b> in 1928, under the provisions of The Fish and Oyster Act of 1914. From early maps, this bank appears to coincide with <b>Oyster</b> <b>Bank</b> 122 worked from at least 1884 by Henry Tippler, a pioneer of oyster farming in southern Moreton Bay. Tipplers Island and Tipplers Passage are both named after Henry Tippler.|$|E
50|$|Two recent {{structures}} {{associated with}} a working <b>oyster</b> <b>bank</b> are located on the southern side of the hut, but are obscured from view by the surrounding vegetation.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} confirm the {{presence}} of historic <b>oyster</b> <b>banks</b> of Qatar and code the biotopes present. The research also collated historical records and scientific publications to create a timeline of fishery activity. The <b>oyster</b> <b>banks</b> where once an extremely productive economic resource however, intense overfishing, extreme environmental conditions and anthropogenic impacts caused a fishery collapse. The timeline highlighted the vulnerability of ecosystem engineering bivalves if overexploited. The current status of the <b>oyster</b> <b>banks</b> meant only one site {{could be described as}} oyster dominant. This was unexpected as the sites were located in areas which once supported a highly productive oyster fishery. The research revealed the devastating effect that anthropogenic impacts can have on a relatively robust marine habitat like an oyster bed and it is hoped these findings will act as a driver to investigate and map other vulnerable habitats within the region before they too become compromised...|$|R
50|$|The Oyster Act of 1886 was {{introduced}} to encourage sustainable oyster culture (the cultivation of oysters and the taking of oysters for sale). The Act offered transferable, 14 year leases over identified oyster grounds which could comprise both an oyster dredge section and <b>oyster</b> <b>banks.</b> Licenses were still available for working <b>oyster</b> <b>banks</b> not within a dredge section. A penalty for selling undersized oysters {{was introduced}}, and lessees and licensees were required to register a brand, which had to appear on all oyster bags. Importantly, lessees had to reserve some cultivation on each bank, and to constantly renew the oyster stock.|$|R

50|$|Subsequent licensees of <b>Oyster</b> <b>Bank</b> 122 {{used the}} hut in {{association}} with working the <b>oyster</b> <b>bank</b> until two new sheds were erected about 50 metres to the south, in the 1980s. From the early 1970s, Dux Hut has been used also as a recreational venue - and exclusively so since the 1980s. In 1995, R.638 was repealed, and Dux Hut currently (February 1998) sits on Unallocated State Land.|$|E
50|$|By 1886, oyster {{fisheries}} in Moreton Bay extended for nearly 100 miles, from Southport to Caloundra. 178 <b>oyster</b> <b>banks,</b> comprising over 5,000 acres, were being worked, and 40 dredge sections {{were available for}} lease. Moreton Bay and Sandy Straits were considered the great nurseries and breeding-grounds for oysters on the eastern seaboard of the Australian Continent, with an estimated 40,000 oyster cultivation bags in Moreton Bay, and scope for many times this number. The principal export market for Moreton Bay oysters was Melbourne, but periodic glutting of that market by New Zealand oysters was problematic for the Queensland industry. The industry was plagued also by operators who denuded <b>oyster</b> <b>banks,</b> and made little or no effort at replenishing the stock.|$|R

25|$|The estuary was {{originally}} {{the territory of}} the Lenape, a seasonally migrational people who would relocate summer encampments along its shore and use its waterways for transport and fishing.

50|$|Augie Dux later took {{up several}} <b>oyster</b> <b>bank</b> {{licenses}} in southern Moreton Bay, including <b>Oyster</b> <b>Bank</b> 122 in Tippler's Passage (1928). His sons {{helped him to}} develop the oyster banks, obtaining timber and shell bedding from Crusoe and Rat islands nearby. On Oyster Camp Reserve R.638, directly opposite <b>Oyster</b> <b>Bank</b> 122, Augie Dux and his son Stanley erected a one-roomed hut, for use when working their oyster lease in Tippler's Passage. It is understood they re-used timbers initially cut by Augie in 1918, when {{the family moved to}} Broad Street, Labrador, where they erected a house of saplings and bark, with a hardwood floor. About 1929 this house was demolished and replaced with a new house of milled-timber, the timbers of the 1918 building being re-cycled in the hut on South Stradbroke Island. The stumps of this hut are understood to be of Bloodwood, the framing of Ti-tree saplings, and the floor and some of the wall linings of hardwood, all of which was cut by Augie Dux and his sons in the Labrador area. Oyster farming at this period was still highly labour-intensive, and poaching was a continual problem. Stanley Dux recalls spending from Monday to Saturday each week at the hut, working and guarding the <b>oyster</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dux Hut on South Stradbroke Island, erected [...] in {{association}} with the working of <b>Oyster</b> <b>Bank</b> 122 in Tippler's Passage, is important in illustrating aspects of the early-established and important oyster industry in Moreton Bay. In particular, it demonstrates the important relationship of the oyster reserves established by the Queensland government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, to the working of oyster banks and oyster dredge sections. Significantly, the hut remains in situ, on the shoreline, opposite a working <b>oyster</b> <b>bank</b> taken up by at least 1884.|$|E
30|$|The Thebes Formation {{is about}} 350  m thick and commences with {{fine-grained}} micritic limestone and marl rich in bands and nodules of chert, probably deposited at bathyal depths (Snavely et al. 1978), {{and ends with}} repetitive skeletal limestones and <b>oyster</b> <b>banks</b> formed in a shallow water setting.

40|$|The oysters are {{sedentary}} {{bivalve molluscs}} which are gregarious and found in aggregates attached by their right shell valve to hard substrata, forming oyster beds or <b>oyster</b> <b>banks</b> in varied environments, intertidal and subtidal zones in shallow coastal waters, bays, creeks, lagoons, backwaters and estuarine environment. In India, natural stocks of oysters are exploited {{on a small}} scale at a number of places as a subsistence fishery and oysters are not cultured commercially...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Uncontrolled extractivism {{has led to}} a {{worldwide}} reduction in oyster stocks. The use of new and more efficient management tools for impacted environments must increase. The application of such tools requires previous biological and environmental knowledge of the resident populations of these bivalve mollusks. Technical difficulties are usually associated with studies of submerged <b>oyster</b> <b>banks,</b> and these difficulties result in a considerable lack of biological data on the oysters that inhabit subtidal zones. This study aimed to survey Crassostrea brasiliana (also known as C. gasar) stocks in submerged banks and to evaluate a method with which to measure the extent of the banks and identify and quantify the <b>oysters</b> in the <b>banks</b> with the use of side-scan sonar. This study was conducted on 10 <b>oysters</b> <b>banks</b> located in the subtidal zone of Guaratuba Bay, on the south coast of Brazil. The prospection of all these banks was later validated by diving, and oyster samples (n = 20 /bank) were collected for species identification with a molecular method. Only one <b>bank</b> contained <b>oysters</b> that were generically classified as Crassostrea sp.; those in the remaining banks being identified as C. brasiliana. The prospected <b>banks</b> contained <b>oysters</b> of various sizes (average 1. 5 m, n = 1, 107) that were heterogeneously scattered in the riverbeds. The total number of oysters in the 10 sampled banks was estimated to be 21, 159. 13 oysters or 1 oyster/ 4. 5 m², which represents a low oyster density in the study site. The results validate the use of side-scan sonar as an efficient means with which to prospect for <b>oysters</b> in <b>banks</b> located within subtidal zones...|$|R
50|$|The largest {{leaseholder}} of oyster dredge {{sections and}} <b>oyster</b> <b>banks</b> in Moreton Bay {{from the late}} 1870s to the 1920s was The Moreton Bay Oyster Company, established in 1876. The Company operated leaseholds near Stradbroke and Bribie Islands and at Hervey Bay, employing a small community of workers. In the southern Bay a camp was established on the mainland at Coombabah, north of Southport. In 1881 the Company took over the lease of Currigee run on South Stradbroke Island, and a small settlement of oystermen and their families was established there as well.|$|R
