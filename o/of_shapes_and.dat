5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth {{the size of}} eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E
5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes, and {{in the range from}} closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosauroids were bipedal carnivores, as {{were most}} theropods, and were {{characterized}} by numerous skeletal features, especially of the skull and pelvis. Early in their existence, tyrannosauroids were small predators with long, three-fingered forelimbs. Late Cretaceous genera became much larger, {{including some of the}} largest land-based predators ever to exist, but most of these later genera had proportionately small forelimbs with only two digits. Primitive feathers have been identified in fossils of two species, and may have been present in other tyrannosauroids as well. Prominent bony crests in a variety <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes on the skulls of many tyrannosauroids may have served display functions.|$|E

40|$|Size <b>and</b> <b>shape,</b> {{although}} intuitively simple concepts, {{are difficult}} to define mathematically in a biologically meaningful way. Darroch and Mosimann (1985, Biometrika, 72 : 241 - 252) have proposed definitions <b>of</b> size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> that incorporate the concept of geometric similarity, and have developed principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> total variability in shape based on these definitions. We adopt these definitions <b>of</b> size <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> Using a related definition of the principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape,</b> we characterize the dependence on the size variable of the principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> total variability in shape. We derive the minimum amount <b>of</b> variability in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> the corresponding size variable. The practical implications of these results are explored using data on strongylid eggs; for each of several plausible size variables, we determine the variability in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> the principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape.</b> The amount <b>of</b> variability in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> the principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> are seen {{to be sensitive to}} the choice of size variable...|$|R

5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers <b>of</b> <b>shapes,</b> <b>and</b> in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest narcissi {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering a wide range <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce {{a number of different}} alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|E
5|$|The {{collaboration}} between Disney and Square {{resulted in a}} mixture of familiar Disney and Square characters, as well as several new characters created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The primary protagonist of the game is Sora, a 14-year-old boy chosen to wield the Keyblade—a weapon which is a cross between a key and a sword—for battling darkness. The game also features two friends from his home world, Riku and Kairi. For most of the game, Sora is joined by Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, the court wizard, and Goofy, captain of the royal guard, are sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade. The three join forces to search for King Mickey Mouse, Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is Ansem, who seeks power and knowledge by using dark beings called the Heartless. The Heartless, hearts corrupted by darkness, serve as most of the enemies encountered in the game and come in a variety <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes. Maleficent, from the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty, leads a group of Disney villains that seeks to use the Heartless for their own gain.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate potential temperament endophenotypes for clinically significant importance <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight. Seven temperament risk factors for eating disorders and the Eating Disorder Examination were assessed in 699 female twins aged 12 – 15 years. Each variable was evaluated against the following endophenotype criteria : associated with illness in the general population; found in non-affected family members at a higher rate than in the general population; and, heritable. All seven variables were significantly associated with clinically significant importance <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight, while thin-ideal internalization, ineffectiveness, body dissatisfaction and sensitivity to punishment were found at significantly elevated levels in non-affected twins, when controlling for sister’s temperament score. These four variables had genetic correlations with importance <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight, ranging from 0. 48 to 0. 95. Future research should evaluate the stability of the identified endophenotypes and their utility for predicting significant growth in importance <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight, and also whether different endophenotypes emerge when the importance <b>of</b> weight <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> reaches its peak in adolescents, around 15 to 16 years of age...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern and {{self-evaluation}} {{almost exclusively}} in these terms is a core feature of eating disorder psychopathology {{and it is this}} which is thought to drive weight control behaviours. The literature indicates concerns about weight <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> can be present in children at least as young as eight rears of age. Currently, there is no tool available which measures a child's over-concern with their body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight per se. This study developed an assessment <b>of</b> children's body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern, using scales measuring <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight concern <b>and</b> perceived importance <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight. The properties <b>of</b> the new <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern assessment were examined in relation to children's self-perception and implicit attitudes towards overweight. Participants were 333 Year 5 children (181 boys and 152 girls) from North Yorkshire primary schools, {{with a mean age of}} 9 years 7 months. They completed measures <b>of</b> body <b>shape</b> perception, dietary restraint, height and weight accuracy, self-esteem <b>and</b> body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern. In addition they completed a timed implicit association task which assessed implicit attitudes towards overweight. The new assessment was concluded to have good psychometric properties and to be a reasonable assessment <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern in children. Children with high <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight concern tended to be heavier, less satisfied with their weight <b>and</b> body <b>shape,</b> have lower self-esteem and report increased levels of dietary restraint. High levels of perceived importance <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight also impacted on this latter variable. A general anti-fat bias was indicated from this group of children. Dietary restraint score was a significant predictor <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern, as was global self-worth (for the boys) and physical appearance (for the girls). No gender differences were found in the assessment <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern. This study is the first to measure <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern in children and highlights a need of continued research of over-concern in children and adults. This will continue to inform intervention and prevention programmes of eating disorders. Further research into the implicit anti-fat attitudes in children as young as 9 years is also indicated, especially in respect <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern...|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} brain {{represent}} a red circle? One {{possibility is that}} there is a specialized and possibly time-consuming process whereby the attributes <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color, carried by separate populations of neurons in low-order visual cortex, are bound together into a unitary neural representation. Another possibility is that neurons in high-order visual cortex are selective, by virtue of their bottom-up input from low-order visual areas, for particular conjunctions <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color. A third possibility is that they simply sum <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color signals linearly. We tested these ideas by measuring the responses of inferotemporal cortex neurons to sets of stimuli in which two attributes—shape and color—varied independently. We find that a few neurons exhibit conjunction selectivity but that in most neurons the influences <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color sum linearly. Contrary to the idea of conjunction coding, few neurons respond selectively to a particular combination <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color. Contrary to the idea that binding requires time, conjunction signals, when present, occur as early as feature signals. We argue that neither conjunction selectivity nor a specialized feature binding process is necessary for the effective representation of shape–color combinations...|$|R
