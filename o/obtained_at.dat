5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (<b>obtained</b> <b>at</b> a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes and narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E

5|$|Numerous mixed lead(II,IV) oxides are known. When PbO2 {{is heated}} in air, it becomes Pb12O19 at 293°C, Pb12O17 at 351°C, Pb3O4 at 374°C, and finally PbO at 605°C. A further {{sesquioxide}} Pb2O3 can be <b>obtained</b> <b>at</b> high pressure, {{along with several}} non-stoichiometric phases.

5|$|The {{projected}} {{attack on}} Aouzou never took place, as {{the dimensions of}} the victory <b>obtained</b> <b>at</b> Maaten made France fear that the attack on the Libyan base was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.|$|E

The design of the DCS came from the Nimbus-3 platform, then known as the interrogation, recording, and location system (IRLS).|$|E

The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new {{window on the}} early Universe.

25|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{is measured}} according to EN 12667. Typical values range from 0.032 to 0.038 W/(m·K) {{depending on the}} density of the EPS board.

Adding fillers (graphites, aluminium, or carbons) has recently allowed the thermal conductivity of EPS to reach around 0.030–0.034 (as low as 0.029) and as such has a grey/black colour which distinguishes it from standard EPS.
