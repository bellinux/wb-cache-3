It is not about acceptance with the disengagement , but on the contrary, it is a struggle of multitude <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> struggle with responsibility." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since Judaism {{teaches that}} a {{deceased}} person can still {{benefit from the}} merit of mitzvot (commandments) performed in their memory, it is considered a special privilege to bring merit to the departed by learning Torah in their name. A popular custom is to coordinate a group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> jointly study the complete Mishnah during the shloshim period. This {{is due to the}} fact that [...] "Mishnah" [...] (משנה) and [...] "Neshamah" [...] (נשמה), soul, have the same (Hebrew) letters.|$|E
2500|$|Polls {{basically}} involve {{taking a}} sample {{from a certain}} population. In {{the case of the}} Newsweek poll, the population of interest is the population <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> vote. [...] Because it is impractical to poll everyone who will vote, pollsters take smaller samples that are intended to be representative, that is, a random sample of the population. It is possible that pollsters sample 1,013 voters who happen to vote for Bush when in fact the population is evenly split between Bush and Kerry, but this is extremely unlikely (p = 21013 ≈ 1.1 × 10305) given that the sample is random.|$|E

This is the opportunity they sense, and we must ask what ambitions they will declare next. ... Instead of rediscovering the virtues of traditionally defined, enlightened self-interest in the aftermath of its hands down cold war victory, America's foreign policy elites are more intoxicated than ever by their own concoction of benevolent global hegemony and indispensable power.|$|E

2500|$|If {{there are}} [...] {{people who can}} shake hands with one another (where [...] ), the {{pigeonhole}} principle shows that {{there is always a}} pair <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> shake hands with the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the 'hole' to which a person is assigned is the number of hands shaken by that person. Since each person shakes hands with some number of people from 0 to , there are [...] possible holes. On the other hand, either the '0' hole or the [...] hole or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if !) for some person to shake hands with everybody else while some person shakes hands with nobody. This leaves [...] people to be placed in at most [...] non-empty holes, so that the principle applies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the letter}} to the Corinthians, within the list <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: malakoi and arsenokoitai. Malakoi is a common Greek word meaning, of things subject to touch, [...] "soft" [...] (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to {{describe}} a garment); of things not subject to touch, [...] "gentle"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include [...] "pathic". Nowhere else in scripture is Malakoi used to describe a person. Bishop Gene Robinson says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a [...] "soft" [...] or weak morality; later, it would come to denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or [...] "those who abuse themselves"; all we actually, factually, know about the word is that it means soft.|$|E
2500|$|Lynch {{was working}} for the {{building}} and establishment of seven buildings, in which 8,000 salaried people would practice advanced meditation techniques, [...] "pumping peace for the world". He estimates the cost at US$7 billion. As of December 2005, he had spent US$400,000 of personal money, and raised US$1 million in donations. In December 2006, the New York Times reported that he continued to have that goal. Lynch's book, Catching the Big Fish (Tarcher/Penguin 2006), discusses the impact of the Transcendental Meditation technique on his creative process. Lynch attended the funeral of the Maharishi in India in 2008. He told a reporter, [...] "In life, he revolutionised the lives of millions of people.... In 20, 50, 500 years there will be millions <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> know and understand what the Maharishi has done."
