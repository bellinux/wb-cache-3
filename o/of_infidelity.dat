5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Parvati (called Gauri here) is {{described}} as having suspected Shiva <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> when she saw her own reflection in the crystal-like breast of Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara. Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati's jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva's locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat on his lap. To pacify Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.|$|E

25|$|What {{constitutes}} an act <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> {{depends upon the}} exclusivity expectations within the relationship. In marital relationships, exclusivity expectations are commonly assumed although they are not always met.

Depending on the context, men and women can experience social consequences if their act <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> becomes public.

25|$|The next affective {{emotion in}} this {{beginning}} stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple {{things in a}} relationship, but during the initial stages <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> a person can experience this on an increased level. Meaning, they begin to notice when their partner does not say thank you for simple things, or they overthink any change made by the unfaithful partner. This {{can lead to a}} suspicious partner feeling like they cannot please their significant other and begin to feel incompetent in the relationship. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone else’s actions they begin to resent them creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over something small. The faithful partner is not normally aware that their suspicion is the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship, and do not expect to be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> (Miller, 2017). These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage <b>of</b> <b>infidelity.</b>|$|E

25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is {{an emotion}} that is felt in all stages <b>of</b> <b>infidelity,</b> but {{in different ways}} and at different calibers. In the initial stages <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to get angry at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed {{to be a key}} emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

25|$|Examples <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> {{are found}} acted out in {{television}} and film {{because of the}} drama often. In {{the beginning of the}} popular series Grey’s Anatomy, one of TV’s most beloved couples, Derek and Meredith, began their relationship while Derek was married to Addison. Although, Derek and Meredith went on to have a strong relationship, Addison changed. She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts {{to come to grips with}} the infidelity. There are many more examples <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> in films and television, and real life, but the point is: if your partner cheats on you it is impossible to be completely unbothered.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> enter a cognitive state.|$|E

25|$|Group {{differences}} were also found, with women responding with stronger emotions to emotional and sexual infidelity than men. Heterosexuals rated emotional and sexual infidelity as more emotionally distressing than {{lesbian and gay}} individuals did. Sex and sexual orientation differences emerged regarding {{the degree to which}} specific emotions were reported in response to sexual and emotional infidelity.  Few researchers have explored the influence of sexual orientation on which type <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> is viewed as more distressing (Leeker, 2014).|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{anger in}} {{infidelity}} is quite inevitable. In the initial stage <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> anger {{is not as}} apparent as it is seen in stage two, because there is not hard facts or evidence supporting one’s suspicions. Like previously talked about the accuser most likely feels jealous and incompetent {{in the first stage}} of cheating. These emotions can contract into anger and provide a cognitive state of anger, because the accusing person anticipates his or her anger. Unlike jealousy and resentment, it is hard to identify the purpose or cause of the individual’s anger because in reality there is nothing yet to be angry about, there is no proof of their romantic partner’s unfaithfulness. 25% of people surveyed felt angry in the beginning or suspicion stage <b>of</b> <b>infidelity</b> (Johnson, 2017). It is hard to pinpoint the anger emotion in the initial stages due to ambiguity; therefore, it begins to take on other emotions turning into a cognitive state of emotional turmoil. The individual knows they are angry and anticipates it, but cannot logically explain it to their partner {{because of the lack of}} evidence they have.|$|E
