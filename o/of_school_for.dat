Phonological awareness does continue to develop until the first years <b>of</b> <b>school.</b> <b>For</b> example, only about half of the 4- and 5-year olds tested by Liberman et al. (1974) were able to tap out the number of syllables in multisyllabic words, but 90% of the 6-year-olds were able to do so.|$|E
25|$|Tebow is the {{youngest}} of five children. He and his siblings were all homeschooled by their parents, who instilled the family's Christian beliefs. According to the subject, he is dyslexic and believes in his uniqueness as {{a gift from the}} Creator. In 1996, legislation was passed in Florida allowing home-schooled students to compete in high school sporting events. The law specifies that home-schooled students may participate on the team of the local high school in the school district in which they live. Tebow took advantage of this law when he chose to play for Trinity Christian Academy, the local high school in his hometown of Jacksonville, where he played tight end. In 2003, he moved into an apartment in nearby St. Johns County, making him eligible to play for the struggling football program at Allen D. Nease High School where he could play quarterback. His performance led to a minor controversy regarding the fact that, although home-schooled, he had his choice <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> which to play.|$|E

25|$|He {{terminated}} {{his contract}} in spring {{of the following}} year, and decided to open <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> boys aged 12 to 15; the initiative was publicized by Heliade Rădulescu's magazine Curierul Românesc. Vaillant's school was located in buildings owned by Serdar Popa, {{in the vicinity of}} Stavropoleos Monastery. Together with the similar activities of Félix Colson (who was tutoring young members of the Văcărescu family), and those of the Moldavian-based Cuénim and the abbé Lhommé, this brought an important step in the Westernization of Romanian society, while contributing to enforcing admiration for France among young boyars. It also signified a breaking point with education in Greek, which had been the norm before and during the Phanariote age (ever since the 17th century initiatives of Prince Matei Basarab). The memoirist Ion Ghica later noted that, among Vaillant's pupils, were scions of the Filipescu family, {{as well as those of}} the Grădişteanus, Bălăceanus, Rosettis, Golescus and his own family (the Ghicas). Another of his pupils was the future radical politician and historian Nicolae Bălcescu. Vaillant was also a teacher at a school for girls, which functioned without tuition.|$|E

[...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it.

2500|$|Rt Hon Nicola Murray MP (Rebecca Front) – Series 3-4 – Nicola replaces Hugh Abbot from series 3. She is {{promoted}} to Social Affairs and Citizenship Secretary as a last-minute choice {{in a government}} reshuffle in the run up to a general election. Inexperienced and naive, she begins her tenure poorly {{with a number of}} public embarrassments over her husband's career. She also finds it difficult to maintain a healthy balance between her home and work lives, conflicting with Tucker when he demands that she send her daughter to a state comprehensive school, rather than her preferred choice of a private school. Relatively powerless in the cabinet, her dour public image, largely encouraged by Tucker, leads her to be referred to as [...] "glummy mummy". Although she and Tucker regularly clash, he is occasionally shown to be much more sympathetic towards her than her predecessor, particularly when he suggests that the government might quietly accede to her wishes regarding her choice <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> her daughter [...] "in a term or two". Though little improved as a political operator and unpopular within her party, Nicola is elected as Leader of the Opposition on a technicality before the start of Series 4, and is hounded throughout the series by calls for her to resign.|$|E

The sixth grade students in 2008/2009 were the first sixth grade class {{in recent years to}} take an overnight trip in Bear Canyon. In addition the sixth graders also go on day trips, while the seventh grade class goes to Bear Canyon for a week. The 8th grade class takes a weeklong retreat to Manzano mountain or Hummingbird Music Camp and the 9th grade class takes another 4 day, 3 night, [...] backpacking trip to various areas throughout the state although sometimes just inside the borders of Arizona or Colorado. As a conclusion to the theme of group camping trips, the entire senior class also ventures to Manzano mountain retreat over the first weekend <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> additional bonding among the members of the grades, who have often been together for 7 years at the school. The campus also houses a low ropes course, and a higher 60ft(18m) tower, with a harness swing attached, called the Alpine Tower.
