5|$|In June 1457 he was {{personally}} responsible for intervening {{in the activities of}} Bishop Pecock, a virulent anti-Lollard.

Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Winston Churchill, and the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.|$|E
5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy {{may have been an}} invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E

In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont on land donated by Battell for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed. The breeding program aimed to produce horses that were sound, sturdy, well-mannered, and capable of performing well either under saddle or in harness. In 1951, the Morgan Horse Farm was transferred from the USDA to the Vermont Agricultural College (now the University of Vermont).|$|E

On 19 November, Kaga {{and the rest of the}} Combined Fleet's mobile strike force (Kido Butai), under Chuichi Nagumo and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island.

The young McAloney was educated at Thebarton Technical High School and the Adelaide School of Mines. In 1925, McAloney registered for compulsory military training in the Citizen Military Force, serving as a private with the 43rd Battalion until November 1929. During this time, he gained employment as an automotive mechanic with Vrai Ltd, where he received on-the-job training in place <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> apprenticeship.

5|$|Some of the {{information}} contained in the Liber is important to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made. The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.|$|E
5|$|The dwarf planet Pluto (39AU average) is {{the largest}} known object in the Kuiper belt. When {{discovered}} in 1930, it {{was considered to be}} the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5AU at aphelion. Pluto has a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of the introduction of polar coordinates as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> coordinate system. The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of Polar Coordinates. Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used polar coordinates {{to solve a problem}} relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.|$|E

Queen Anne was fond of the castle, and attempted to address the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> garden by instructing Henry Wise to begin work on the Maestricht Garden beneath the North Terrace, which was never completed.

5|$|In late May and June 1941, {{members of}} the Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina {{travelled}} to the oblast (regional) centres of Banja Luka in the Bosanska Krajina region, Mostar in Herzegovina, and Tuzla in the Birač region of eastern Bosnia to advise the oblast KPJ committees of {{the decisions of the}} Central Committee, and to form oblast military committees. This also occurred in Sarajevo, for an oblast military committee responsible for the Romanija region of eastern Bosnia located north of that city. Each oblast military committee formed district military committees, who in turn contacted KPJ members in towns and villages of their district to organise resistance. This pyramid-like structure mirrored the KPJ structure, and following the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June, the Central Committee met on 4 July and decided to initiate an armed uprising against the occupiers. This included the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> military structure, headed by the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, who was also the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the KPJ.|$|E
5|$|Joel Enterprises of Richmond {{was listed}} as one of Vick's larger creditors. Sports agents Andrew Joel and Dave Lowman claimed Vick signed a {{contract}} with their firm in 2001, nine days before he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech early and declaring himself eligible for the NFL Draft. With his mother as a witness, Vick signed a five-year marketing agreement that anticipated a wide range of endorsement activities using Vick's name, likeness, voice, and reputation. Joel's cut was 25% of all deals, excluding Vick's NFL contract, according to the agreement. Vick attempted to end the relationship with Joel Enterprises a few weeks later, and entered into another relationship with other agents. In 2005, Joel Enterprises sued Vick in Richmond Circuit Court for $45 million in compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract. After the Virginia Supreme Court denied a Vick motion and ruled that the civil trial could proceed in December 2006, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration for resolution instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> civil court trial. The outcome of the case was an award of $4.5 million to Joel.|$|E

5|$|Longfellow {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> garden {{and his wife}} oversaw decorating the interior. Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany's in New York as well as $350 worth of carpets. They installed central heating in 1850 and gaslight in 1853. During {{their time in the}} house, the Longfellows hosted famous artists, writers, politicians and other luminaries who were attracted to Longfellow's hospitality and fame. Specific visitors included Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, singer Jenny Lind, and actress Fanny Kemble. Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil also visited the house privately and requested the company of Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and James Russell Lowell. Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow also raised their three daughters and two sons in the home. Longfellow and his wife stayed in the home until their respective deaths but spent their summers after 1850 in Nahant, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>formal</b> agreement exists, and the evidence is {{based solely on the}} joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her {{a false sense of security}} while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
