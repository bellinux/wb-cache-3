5|$|While many Manhattan {{scientists}} {{expected that}} the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> Man plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{he served}} at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, where he was {{involved}} in an effort to improve aircraft instrumentation, notably the compass and altimeter. He attended the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering, and studied nuclear physics. In June 1942, he assumed command of a new patrol bomber squadron, VB-106, equipped with PB4Y-1 Liberators, which he led in a daring raid on Wake Island, in the Solomon Islands campaign, and in the Southwest Pacific Area. Returning to the United States in 1944, he was posted was to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California, where he joined the Manhattan Project, participating in Project Camel, the development of the non-nuclear components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> Man bomb, and in its drop testing.|$|E

Ramsey drew up tables of organization and equipment for the Project Alberta detachment that would accompany the USAAF's 509th Composite Group to Tinian.

Ramsey went to Tinian with the Project Alberta detachment as Parsons's scientific and technical deputy.

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> {{found in}} food {{is in the}} form of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

25|$|DOS accomplishes this {{by keeping}} a pointer {{to the last}} {{allocated}} cluster on each mounted volume in memory and starts searching for free space from this location upwards instead of at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FAT,</b> as it was still done by DOS 2.x. If the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FAT</b> is reached, it would wrap around to continue the search at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FAT</b> until either free space has been found or the original position has been reached again without having found free space. These pointers are initialized {{to point to the}} start of the FATs after bootup, but on FAT32 volumes, DOS 7.1 and higher will attempt to retrieve the last position from the FS Information Sector.|$|E

25|$|The {{biologic}} {{survival of}} autologous fat tissue {{depends upon the}} correct handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> graft, of its careful washing (refinement) to remove extraneous blood cells, and of the controlled, blunt-cannula injection (emplacement) of the refined fat-tissue grafts to an adequately vascularized recipient site. Because the body resorbs some of the injected fat grafts (volume loss), compensative over-filling aids in obtaining a satisfactory breast outcome for the patient; thus the transplantation of large-volume fat grafts greater than required, because only 25–50 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> graft survives at 1-year post-transplantation.|$|E

25|$|Each version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FAT</b> {{file system}} uses a {{different}} size for FAT entries. Smaller numbers {{result in a}} smaller FAT, but waste space in large partitions by needing to allocate in large clusters.|$|E
25|$|Extensive butting is {{also used}} to create low weight tubes with {{acceptable}} stiffness. The early versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> Chance Titanium (1992 and 93 versions) had tubes of different diameters welded together to create a stiffer bottom bracket area. The 1994 version had externally butted bottom tubes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{high-level}} mechanisms may read in {{and process}} larger parts or the complete FAT on startup or on demand when needed and dynamically build up in-memory tree {{representations of the}} volume's file structures different from the on-disk structures. This may, on volumes with many free clusters, occupy even less memory than an image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FAT</b> itself. In particular on highly fragmented or filled volumes, seeks become much faster than with linear scans over the actual FAT, even if an image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FAT</b> would be stored in memory. Also, operating on the logically high level of files and cluster-chains instead of on sector or track level, it becomes possible to avoid some degree of file fragmentation {{in the first place}} or to carry out local file defragmentation and reordering of directory entries based on their names or access patterns in the background.|$|E

25|$|A 100 gram {{serving of}} milk {{chocolate}} supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table).
