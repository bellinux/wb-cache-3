5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E

Reviewers complimented the album for its mature sound and production and commended Carey's musical direction, calling the work a [...] "transitional album, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> her a rarity of the 90s." [...] Though released during Carey's heavily publicized conflict with Sony Music, the album became a commercial success, topping the albums chart in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. On the Billboard 200, it debuted at number one, spending one week atop the chart. It was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and received the Million Award in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Stanford's chamber music, {{which as}} Dibble notes even Shaw praised, has not entered the general repertoire, but is well crafted. Dibble singles out the Three Intermezzi for {{clarinet}} and piano (1879), the Serenade nonet (1905), and the Clarinet Sonata (1911) with its touching lament. Writing of the First String Quintet, Porte {{calls it a}} sonorous and warm-hearted sort of work, constructed on fairly classical lines, and notes that the character and construction are typical of the composer. Porte comments similarly on other chamber works, including the Second Piano Trio: [...] "This is a typical Stanfordian work. It is sonorously scored, classical in outlook, and contains many passages of an expressive and somewhat poetical freshness. There are no very special features to note, but the work is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> a useful and interesting item." ...|$|E

The horse dies after a heart attack, and Peter disposes of it at Mort's pharmacy. In order to pay for the damage, Peter decides to participate in a series of medical drug testing including <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> him gay. He enters a relationship with another gay man called Scott, leaving his wife Lois and rest of the family heartbroken. After Stewie and Brian enroll Peter in straight camp, Lois breaks Peter out, deciding that Peter's happiness is more important than his sexuality. Almost immediately afterwards, the gay gene wears off and Peter moves back in with his family.

Stewart criticized Comedy Central's decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from [...] "possible harmful repercussions". Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, said the threats against [...] "201" [...] demonstrated {{the importance of the}} First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, [...] "When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn't just different than <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> death threats to cartoonists.

500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> it hard to choose sides".

500|$|Dave Anderson of TV Guide {{called the}} episode first-rate, while praising the comedic Bree storyline and declaring the set-up for the Orson mystery storyline ingenious. He commended Marcia Cross' {{performance}} but opined that Longoria provided the best comedic relief. He also complimented Teri Hatcher's acting, commenting that she [...] "was awesome in the poignant scene where she asks the comatose Mike {{permission to go}} on the (almost) date with Ian." [...] Anderson identified the Scavo storyline as [...] "the weakest link" [...] in the episode and hoped that the Nora and Kayla characters would not remain on the show for too long. TV Guide writer Matt Roush shared similar sentiments regarding the Scavo storyline, stating that while the premiere overall was good, [...] "Lynette is trapped in a story line so desperately unamusing, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> her and everyone around her act so idiotic, that you have to pray that we'll soon see the last of the obnoxious Nora, mother of Tom's surprise daughter." [...] He described the storyline as [...] "painfully unpleasant and unfunny." [...] However, Roush praised the performances of Metcalf and Valerie Mahaffey, while concluding that Desperate Housewives [...] "shows encouraging signs of getting its act together." [...] In a separate review, Roush unfavorably compared the Orson character to Bree's former love interest, George Williams (Roger Bart), while also admitting to being [...] "a bit weary" [...] of the Gabrielle storyline.|$|E

Archimedes showed that the torque exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point—their center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation of a floating object is the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> its center of mass as low as possible.
