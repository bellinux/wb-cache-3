5000|$|Disadvantages of {{information}} grazing come from its advantages. Switching from a [...] "fixed" [...] source {{of information}} that is constant, verifiable, and worth memorizing to [...] "fluid" [...] sources that are always in flux can lead to quick solutions that are unverified or worse, incorrect. Studies have shown that many people don't read past the first sentences of a Web site's content, and many never go beyond the first ten links listed in a search. As information becomes more like an instantaneous consumable item, memorization is less fact-based but more procedural (i.e. how to find it). Similar concepts are found in Japanese education where after intense study of many unconnected facts, {{most of the information}} is forgotten or if remembered, not connected to <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>facts.</b> In the USA, this is similar to cramming an exam. Information grazing may have the same effect but greater, since it is done over the period of years.|$|E

40|$|The {{obligation}} {{to justify a}} court decision derives from the rights to a fair trial. The purpose of justification is to preclude the court’s arbitrariness, provide a possibility to check the decision and convince the audience. The court justifies its decision with legal norms and facts. Thereby {{the aim of the}} research is to study how the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> are ascertained and assessed. A <b>fact</b> is <b>relevant</b> if it might be necessary for legal syllogism. As the court receives from the litigants “raw facts” which may include irrelevant and exclude <b>relevant</b> <b>facts,</b> the unimportant facts must be separated and the missing facts – clarified. This task is facilitated by a legal method called the relation technique. Applying the relation technique to ascertaining the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> is targeted and successive. Moreover, the ascertained <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> are laid out in a table promoting the perception of the case. All the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> must be assessed. The court has to verify whether the facts that might be necessary for legal syllogism are available. If the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> collide, then the court must decide which fact is determinant. According to the law, the court must give reasons for accepting or rejecting the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts.</b> For proper assessment of the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts,</b> the court must use a legal method called the dialogical approach. Using this method, the court decision is structured like a dialogue between the court and the litigants. The aim of the dialogical approach is to convince the audience; therefore, the court inter alia analyzes both the accepted and rejected <b>relevant</b> <b>facts...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{analysis}} of such clauses that accounts for these and <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> by positing three constraints on their formation. It is then argued that either these constraints follow directly from discourse facts about the function of syntactic form, in which case they need not be stated {{at all in the}} syntax, or else they are grammaticizations of those discourse facts. In either case, then, we see why the facts should be as they are. More specifically, I shall argue that the distribution of stars in 1 - 7 results from certain interactions of the three types of WH-clauses with Subject-Postposing and Topicalization and that these interactions reflect the discourse functions of the constructions in question. Before considering discourse, however, we must first look at the syntax of Yiddish in some more detail. 3 1. Syntax of declarative clauses...|$|E

The weakly ionized gas models were recently studied most thoroughly and are remarkably successful when combined with a hydrodynamic bubble model, in terms of reproducing observed spectral shapes, intensities, optical pulse widths and the dependencies of these observables on the experimental parameters. Other radiation models, such as proton tunnelling radiation and the confined electron model, were not combined with hydrodynamic models and/or have freely adjustable parameters so that their relevance to sonoluminescence studies is at present less critically tested...|$|E
40|$|Contextual {{information}} can facilitate automatic extraction of objects from digital imagery. This paper addresses {{the use of}} context for the automatic extraction of roads from aerial imagery. Context is restricted to knowledge about relations between roads and other objects and is hierarchically structured. More specific, context is used to guide road extraction on a global and on a local level. On a global level {{it is used to}} emphasize characteristic parts of the road model (context regions). On a local level it initiates contextual reasoning (context sketches). 1 Introduction The automatic extraction of objects from digital imagery is a very complex task. It is widely accepted that the complexity can be reduced by integrating context information into the extraction process, e. g. (Strat 1992). Generally speaking, context means that there exists knowledge not only about the object of interest but also about <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> and their relations to the object of interest.

40|$|The {{territorial}} {{conflict over}} the Diaoyu / Senkaku Islands sovereignty has dragged on since the 1970 s. Today, Japan administers the islands, {{which are also}} claimed by Taiwan and the Peopleʼs Republic of China. All claimants use historical evidence to bolster the legal strength of their claim. The dispute over the islands is also linked to other important factors, such as nationalism in an unreconciled international environment and the rights to exploitation of natural resources. The unresolved Taiwan / China question puts another burden on its resolution. This particular conflict will be compared to other similar remote islands, which already {{have been subject to}} a legal procedure and, in some cases, resolution. This thesis aims to outline the impediments involved in a potential legal resolution without ignoring the political and <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>facts.</b> Given the regional political setting, the only viable resolution is likely to be more political than legal.

40|$|We propose an {{enhanced}} form of thermocoupled J 2 -flow models of finite deformation elastoplasticity with temperature-dependent yielding and hardening behaviour. The thermomechanical constitutive structure {{of these models}} is rendered free and explicit in the rigorous sense of thermodynamic consistency. Namely, with a free energy function explicitly introduced in terms of almost any given form of the thermomechanical constitutive functions, the requirements from the second law are identically fulfilled with positive internal dissipation. We study the case when a dependence of yielding and hardening on temperature is given and demonstrate that thermosensitive yielding with anisotropic hardening may give rise to appreciable plastic flow either {{in a process of}} heating or in a cyclic process of heating/cooling, thus leading to the findings of one- and two-way thermoinduced plastic flow. We then show that such theoretical findings {{turn out to be the}} effects found in shape memory materials, such as one- and two-way memory effects. Thus, shape memory effects may be explained to be thermoinduced plastic flow resulting from thermosensitive yielding and hardening behaviour. These and <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> may suggest that, from a phenomenological standpoint, thermocoupled elastoplastic J 2 -flow models with thermosensitive yielding and hardening may furnish natural, straightforward descriptions of thermomechanical behaviour of shape memory materials...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of the Czech journalistic sport photography from mid 20 th century until recent time. Conditions that influenced the work of sports photographers are mapped, whether it was technical equipment, political constraints or <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>facts.</b> The paper mentions key events that have had importance in the Czech sports photography. The very beginnings of the Czech sports photography are described, too, to add context with the period followed. Furthermore, some noteworthy cases are mentioned, such as career change of a professional sportsman to a sport photographer. Ethically doubtful practices, once quite frequent, are followed, too. Another infrequently studied area of interest is discussed, which is the phenomenon of successful pictures of neglected events. The paper also provides the reader with a list of the foremost Czech sports photographers, a quantitative analysis of sport photos in the Rude Pravo daily (name later changed to Pravo).

40|$|More {{than forty}} {{prominent}} economists filed a Friend of the Court brief with the Supreme Court, asking the justices to overturn {{a lower court}} ruling that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may {{not take into account}} the costs of regulations when setting standards under the Clean Air Act. Calling the lower court ruling "economically unsound," the economists argued that the EPA "should be allowed to consider explicitly the full consequences" of regulatory decisions, including costs, benefits, and any <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>facts.</b> In their Amici Curiae brief, the economists contended that the "plain aim" of the Clean Air Act "is protecting the public health&quo. t; That aim, they said, "is unlikely to be achieved without, at least, an implicit balancing of benefits and costs. " The Supreme Court filing was organized by the American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies. The bipartisan group of economists signing the brief included three Nobel laureates, seven former chairmen of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and two former directors of the White House Office of Management and Budget. The case, American Trucking Association v. Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was appealed to the Supreme Court after a Federal Court in Washington D. C. ruled that the EPA was not permitted to consider costs in setting regulatory standards for enforcing the Clean Air Act. "We believe it would be imprudent for the EPA to ignore costs totally, particularly given their magnitude in this case," the economists stated in the brief. "The EPA estimates that those [clean air] standards could cost on the order of $ 50 billion annually. " The brief argued, "Not considering costs makes it difficult to set a defensible standard, especially when there is no threshold below which health risks disappear. " Ignoring costs, the economists said, "could lead to a decision to set the standard at zero pollution," which would threaten "the very economic prosperity on which public health primarily depends. " The economists declared: "The importance of this issue cannot be overstated. Both direct benefits and costs of environmental, health, and safety regulations are substantial, estimated to be several hundred billion dollars annually. " If the Supreme Court overturns the lower court ruling and allows the EPA to consider costs in establishing clear air regulations, the brief argued, it would be "a historic moment in the making of regulatory policy.
