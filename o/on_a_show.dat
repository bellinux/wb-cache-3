5|$|Bound for Glory was {{received}} with mixed reviews. Canadian Online Explorer pro wrestling section writer Matt Bishop graded the event a 7 out of 10, {{the same as}} last year's event. He stated, “TNA's biggest show of the year, Bound For Glory, was a mix of good and bad. The show's biggest matches delivered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> that featured a weak undercard”. He also gave the main event 8 out of 10, and the Lethal Lockdown match 7 out of 10. His lowest scores were for the Knockouts Title match that was given a 2 out of 10 and the Young-Jordan versus Neal-Moore match that was rated a dud.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Reubens {{attended}} his own tribute at the SF Sketchfest, {{where he}} talked about his career with Ben Fong-Torres. He also signed with NBC to make a pilot <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> called Area 57, a sitcom about a passive-aggressive alien, but it was not picked up for the 2007–2008 season. Reubens did, however, appear on the hit NBC series 30 Rock as an inbred Austrian prince, a character Tina Fey created for him. He also made three guest appearances on FX's series Dirt. This time he was recommended for the role by Dirt star and close friend Courteney Cox. Cox's husband, David Arquette, would then cast Reubens for his directorial debut, the 2007 film The Tripper.|$|E
5|$|Rodriquez had {{initially}} refused {{to audition for}} the series as {{he wanted to be}} a part of the 2000 drama The Street instead. After being contacted repeatedly by All Souls producers, he read for the parts of Fortado and Sterling; he had to go through the lines a total of five times. During the audition, he met and talked to Aaron Spelling. After failing to be cast in The Street, Rodriquez committed to portraying Fortado. He said that his main attraction to the television project was the ability to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> produced by Spelling. While filming the episodes in a wheelchair, Rodriquez said that he gained an increased awareness and appreciation for handicapped people.|$|E

5|$|The Army of the Republic of Vietnam {{responded to}} the appeal, putting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> of {{solidarity}} behind Diệm to isolate dissident officers. Thirty high-ranking officers headed by General Lê Văn Tỵ declared their resolve to carry out all missions entrusted to the army {{for the defense of}} the constitution and the Republic. The declaration was a veneer which masked a developing plot to oust Diệm. Some of the signatories were to become personally involved in Diệm's overthrow and death in November. Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn, the presidential military advisor and the chief of the army who were to lead the coup, were overseas.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} the band's manager Antwan (Big Boi) talking to Ice Cold 3000 and Dookie Blasingame backstage.

The band performs while {{the girls in the}} audience scream loudly; one girl is carried off by security after rushing the stage, and another faints.|$|E
5|$|Turpitude was communicated through visual deceptions in Syria by {{all three}} armed forces. The RAF flew {{reconnaissance}} flights across the supposed targets, whilst the Navy set up major {{facilities in the}} Syrian coastal ports (anti-aircraft guns, search lights and other efforts that might hide major activity). Along the Turkish border the British Ninth Army (the small force protecting Syria), the 31st Indian Armoured Division and 20th Armoured Division (a fictional division, really the dummy tanks of Jones' 24th Armoured Brigade) put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> of readiness. Political deception, via Royal Flush, was also used to hint heavily at Allied actions in the region.|$|E

25|$|Good-bowling from Josh Hazlewood and {{defensive}} fielding meant England could only reach 130 {{thanks in part}} to Jos Buttler who top-scored with just 22.
