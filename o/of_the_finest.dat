30|$|Smaller {{grains of}} fine {{aggregates}} showed higher adsorption per unit mass. For air-dried conditions, since the mortar including <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> aggregate with higher absorption rate decreases water-to-cement ratio, yield stress and viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mortar can be increased. From the absorption rate measurement, when <b>the</b> mean size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> aggregate sample {{is higher than}} 0.34  mm (S 60), <b>the</b> absorption rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> aggregate is remarkably increased as <b>the</b> mean size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> aggregate is increased.
