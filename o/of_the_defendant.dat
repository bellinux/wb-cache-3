50|$|First, <b>the</b> stop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Defendants</b> was {{justified}} because the officer observed <b>the</b> occupants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle breaking the traffic laws. <b>The</b> seizure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Defendants</b> became proper when, upon approach and after hearing <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle and <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> on <b>the</b> flash call, the officer had {{probable cause to}} make the arrest.|$|R

5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> {{can be a}} factor in {{determining}} the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|The Equal Protection Clause {{prohibits the}} {{exclusion}} of persons from selection for a grand or petit jury {{on the basis of}} race, regardless of the race <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> in the forum state.|$|E
50|$|Appeal {{was allowed}} {{for all but}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> bad {{character}} {{includes not only}} previous convictions but also previous misconduct other than misconduct relating to the offence(s) charged.

5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|The case {{came before}} Mr. Justice Owen and a jury at Leicester Crown Court in July 1990. The judge {{rejected}} a submission on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> {{that he could}} not be found guilty of rape due to the marital rape exemption. He then pleaded not guilty to rape, but guilty to attempted rape and to the assault charge. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for attempted rape and 18 months' imprisonment for assault, with the sentences to run concurrently.|$|E
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how a court’s perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> socio-legal identity {{may be affected}} by interpreting. Since this perception relies largely on language, interpreters are expected to minimise their impact on <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> direct communication between primary participants. The analysis focuses on an interpreter-mediated defendant’s examination, recorded in an attempted murder case tried before the Belgian Assize Court, identifying possible departures from <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> orality and authenticity. The recordings include exchanges, not necessarily audible to the court, between <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> and <b>the</b> interpreter. Our analysis shows that: (a) the participation framework (directness) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> input is altered, while <b>the</b> relative inaudibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction between <b>defendant</b> and interpreter deprives <b>the</b> jury <b>of</b> access to authentic features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> delivery; (b) <b>the</b> interpreter’s intervention may shift <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> oral exposition into a different style, and hence condition <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is eventually perceived by the jury. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them {{for use in a}} milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E
