[...] Writing for CNN-News18, Rituparna Chatterjee spoke of her transformation to date: [...] "fter 40 films and 10 years of fighting off competition {{from some of the}} most versatile actors of her generation, Kareena has matured into a bankable actor reinventing herself with surprising ease."

500|$|When her son {{became a}} member of The Beatles, Mona {{repeatedly}} tried to get the group a lunchtime residency at The Cavern Club by talking to the owner, Ray McFall, but was turned down, as The Cavern had a jazz-only policy at the time. Brian Epstein later wanted to manage the group, and Mona was asked for her advice, and although she had her own plans for the group, she concluded that Epstein would be good for them over time. After The Beatles signed a management contract with Epstein, Mona did not relinquish her control over them, as they had been using her telephone to call agents, and frequently slept <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> living room between concerts. She constantly harassed Epstein about the quality of their bookings, and his management of them, which led to Epstein never referring to her by name, but always calling her [...] "that woman". One musician commented that if Mona said it was a Sunday when it was Tuesday, one would be forced to agree with her.|$|E
