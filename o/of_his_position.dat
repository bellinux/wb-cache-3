5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations for the sale <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position,</b> finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's trusted {{butler and}} confidant, who {{acts as a}} father figure to Bruce but is unable to accept Bruce's desire to revive his Batman persona, even resigning from his {{position}} to impress the seriousness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> upon him. Christopher Nolan emphasized the emotional bond between Alfred and Bruce, stressing its importance in the previous films and predicting that the relationship will be strained as it never has before.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the event, TNA held a thirty-minute pre-show during which Larry Zbyszko announced that Director of Authority Dusty Rhodes had been relieved <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> in the storyline. After the show, Jeff Jarrett attacked a planted fan at ringside and was arrested in the storyline. Therefore, Jarrett was removed from the King of the Mountain match for being unable to compete. The team of Simon Diamond and Trytan defeated the team of Sonny Siaki and Apolo in a bout lasting 3 minutes and 56 seconds during the pre-show.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{impact on}} the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often {{effected}} by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> overwhelm his identity and fortitude. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise clash with {{the traditions of the}} Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war {{he spent}} most of his time flying {{throughout}} Europe and meeting various commanding officers and units. He took advantage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> to fly other types he had not had the chance to operate. He flew Supermarine Spitfires frequently on such trips. Soon after the Normandy Campaign he took leave to visit his mother in Ireland. She was staying with his sister Mary, (and his niece) who had lost her husband killed in action at Anzio in Italy. He remained with 11 Group until the capitulation of Germany on 8 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|When the LM voted {{narrowly}} in May 1976 {{to rejoin}} the Liberals (222 to 211), Millhouse immediately created the New LM, and became its only parliamentary representative. He tried to put an optimistic view on the matter, saying that the close-run vote as an endorsement <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position,</b> and the merger {{as an opportunity to}} start with a clean slate with no debt. The merger was finalised on 4 June when the Liberals' State Council voted heavily in favour.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} the Spanish Parliament, he made the most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> and {{encouraged}} {{the abolition of slavery}} in Puerto Rico and Cuba, and drafting a constitution to guarantee Puerto Ricans more political rights. On November 4, 1866, he was named Puerto Rico's representative to Paris' 1867 Universal Exposition. He served as a critic and subsequently wrote a review titled Exposición Universal de París en 1967. Memoria presentada a la Comisión Provincial de Puerto Rico. After completing his participation in Paris, Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; {{he was unable to}} repay Artaphernes, and had, moreover, alienated himself from the Persian royal family. He fully {{expected}} to be stripped <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E

5|$|Although Howe {{was in a}} {{favourable}} position, Villaret had {{not been}} idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was {{within a few hours}} of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> on the weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.|$|E
5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position.</b> Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around {{the left side of}} A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes, {{who was now}} {{confident}} of the strength <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position,</b> began plotting against the ephors. He first recruited his stepfather, persuading him {{of the need to}} do away with the ephors. Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his stepfather, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and Asea. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the ephors. Four of the five ephors were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, {{the revolt}} spread further. The Ionians sent {{men to the}} Hellespont and Propontis, and {{captured}} Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing {{the spread of the}} rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion. For the next three years, the Persian army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in Caria and Cyprus, and Ionia seems to have had an uneasy peace during these years. At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing the untenability <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position,</b> decided to abandon his position as leader of Miletus, and of the revolt, and he left Miletus. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled.|$|E
5|$|Haig's {{solution}} to this diplomatic crisis was a compromise. Alderson {{was transferred to the}} nominal post of Inspector-General of Canadian Forces and the highly effective Sir Julian Byng replaced him in command of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, supported by Sir Arthur Currie, who had succeeded Alderson in command of the 1st Canadian Division. In exchange, Haig finally got rid of the Ross rifle, all Canadian troops being reissued Lee–Enfields in preparation for the upcoming Battle of the Somme. Alderson was not made aware of the purely nominal nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> until later, when he requested a staff car and was informed that he was no longer entitled to one. In September 1916, Alderson became Inspector of Infantry in the British Army, a position he retained until 1920, when he retired from active service at the age of 61.|$|E
25|$|He {{commanded}} the New 9th Division, New 2nd Army, and the 82nd Army. Another one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions</b> was vice-commander <b>of</b> the 77th Brigade of the 26th Division.|$|R

5|$|Hess did {{not build}} a power base or develop a coterie of followers. He was {{motivated}} by his loyalty to Hitler {{and a desire to}} be useful to him; he did not seek power or prestige or take advantage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> to accumulate personal wealth. He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E
5|$|In 799, {{the founder}} of the Aghlabid dynasty, Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab, secured {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> as autonomous emir of Ifriqiya by the Abbasid caliph, Harun al-Rashid, thereby marking the establishment of a practically independent state centred on modern Tunisia. In 805, Ibrahim concluded a ten-year truce with the Byzantine governor of Sicily, which was renewed by Ibrahim's son and successor Abdallah I in 813. During this time, the Aghlabids were too preoccupied with their rivalry with the Idrisids to the west to plan any serious assault on Sicily. Instead, there are testimonies of commercial traffic between Sicily and Ifriqiya, and of the presence of Arab traders on the island.|$|E
50|$|In December 1952 he was arrested, {{stripped}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions</b> and imprisoned. Following his release, in May 1957 he {{was able}} to flee to West Germany, but he never again engaged in public politics.|$|R
