The profits were large, the hands well paid and contented. Ned had begged Dr. Green and the other trustees of his mother's property {{to allow him to}} devote a considerable part of the profits to assist, during the hard time of winter, the numerous hands in Varley and other villages round Marsden who were out of employment; but the trustees said they were unable to permit this. Mrs. Mulready absolutely refused to hear anything about the mill or to discuss any questions connected with money, therefore they had no resource but to allow the profits, after deducting all expenses of living, to accumulate until, at any rate, Lucy, the youngest of the children, came of age.|$|E

Assembly {{of the last two}} MD-11s were completed in August and October 2000; they were delivered to Lufthansa Cargo on February 22 and January 25, 2001 respectively. Production ended because of lack of sales, resulting from internal competition from the Boeing 767-400 and Boeing 777, as well as external competition from the Airbus A330/A340.|$|E
50|$|De Havilland's {{pioneering}} Comet entered airline {{service in}} 1952. Initially {{it was a}} success, but it was grounded after several fatal crashes in 1953 and 1954. The cause of the Comet crashes {{had nothing to do}} with jet engines; it was a rapid metal fatigue failure in corners of the near-square windows brought on from cycling cabin pressures in flight to high altitudes and back. The understanding of metal fatigue that the Comet investigation produced would play a vital part in the good safety record of later types like the DC-8. In 1952 Douglas remained the most successful of the commercial aircraft manufacturers. They had almost 300 <b>orders</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> for the piston-engined DC-6 and its successor, the DC-7, which had yet to fly. The Comet disasters, and the airlines' subsequent lack of interest in jets, seemed to show the wisdom of their staying with propeller-driven aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Charges {{were brought}} against Sir William Malcolm Mount and F. G. Miles. They were 24 charges {{regarding}} {{publication of a}} Miles Aircraft Ltd prospectus with [...] "false and reckless statements". The trial began on 10 May 1950 of at the Old Bailey. After 17 days of sitting, the jury stopped the case against Miles and Sir William, and they were discharged. They had appeared on charges of inducing people to acquire shares in the company by making a misleading forecast and dishonestly concealing a material fact in a prospectus. According to Flight, [...] "Twenty of the original 24 counts were thrown out before the defence was reached. The prosecution alleged that the defendants gave a misleading forecast that for 1947 the profit covering the production of aircraft would have been £75,000, whereas there was a substantial loss. It was alleged that they recklessly made the misleading statement {{that the company had}} <b>orders</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> which were sufficient to ensure production for the following two years, and that they dishonestly concealed the fact that a profit for the manufacture of aircraft in 1947 was unlikely." [...] Both men said that they believed every word of the prospectus was true. After the acquittal, an application for costs for £20,000 was disallowed. The aviation assets were purchased by Handley Page as Handley Page Reading Ltd. Handley Page produced the Miles-designed M.60 Marathon as the H.P.R.1 Marathon. The Miles Aeronautical Technical School was taken over by the Reading Technical College. Other products in which Miles had interests, such as photocopiers became Copycat Ltd, which was acquired by the Nashua Corporation in 1963. The Philidas locking nut unit became an independent company. The bookbinding machinery and actuator production were taken over by a specifically formed company, the Western Manufacturing Estate Ltd, the name [...] "Western" [...] referring to its location on the Woodley aerodrome. This company later merged with the Adamant Engineering Company Ltd. to form the Adwest Group. Miles also manufactured ballpoint pens designed by László Bíró through an associated company, the Miles Martin Pen Co. Ltd.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of inventory control theory to job shop operation has been limited, {{largely because the}} made-to-order nature of the product prohibits its accumulation in finished form prior to sale. In this situation it is, in fact, not inventory which must be controlled {{in order to achieve}} optimal operation, but rather it is the backlog of <b>orders</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> at any time for production and delivery at some future time which requires management's attention. This paper describes a heuristic system for control of order backlog which was developed for a rather special type of job shop operation.

40|$|In {{connection}} with the rapid development of commerce of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), the optimality of their use with UAV companies (UAVCo) is becoming increasingly important. The basis of such companies are mobile units (mobile units (MU)), which include UAV, means of their delivery {{to the place of}} rendering services and maintenance personnel. A problem of determining the optimal level of orders for the use of MU with UAVCo has been formulated and solved. The task is formulated as an overbooking task. The process under investigation is described as a discrete-time Markov chain corresponding to 24 hours. Based on a fixed number of MU and a fixed overbooking level, distributions for the number of <b>orders</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand,</b> the number of unfulfilled customs, and the average income with an MU usage fee and penalties for unfulfilled orders factored in have been calculated.
