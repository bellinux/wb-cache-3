5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> {{the judicial}} procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights.

The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with {{superior}} specifications. This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France. Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World WarI.|$|E
40|$|In {{the scope}} of the discussions about {{microgeneration}} (and microgrids), the avoided electrical losses are often pointed out as an important value to be credited to those entities. Therefore, methods {{to assess the impact of}} microgeneration on losses must be developed in order to support the definition of a suitable regulatory framework for the economic integration of microgeneration on distribution networks. This paper presents an analytical method to quantify the value <b>of</b> <b>avoided</b> losses that microgeneration may produce on LV networks.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} the national effects of widespread adoption of grid-connected residential rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems. A Geographic Information System (GIS) model is used to estimate potential PV system adoption and PV electricity generation and the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) is used to estimate the national effects of PV electricity generation. Adoption is assumed to occur if levelized PV system cost is less than the local average retail electricity rate at the country level. An estimate of the current {open_quotes}best{close_quotes} scenario (defined by a 6. 5 % real interest rate, 30 -year loan life, $ 6 {sub 1994 }/W system cost, and $ 4 {sub 1994 }/month voluntary premium) results in no adoption. Several scenarios designed to stimulate PV adoption are modeled. As an example, if PV system costs are instead assumed to be $ 3 {sub 1994 }/W, rooftop systems are found to be cost effective in 16 % of detached single-family households in the U. S. by 2015 (assuming full adoption of 4 -kW systems), this results in 82. 1 TWh of annual PV electricity generation, 170 TWh <b>of</b> <b>avoided</b> electricity transmission, distribution, and generation losses, 6 Mt/a <b>of</b> <b>avoided</b> carbon emissions, 50 kt/a <b>of</b> <b>avoided</b> NOx emissions, and 27. 3 GW <b>of</b> <b>avoided</b> electricity generating capacity in place...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, the intended use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although never intended for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E
