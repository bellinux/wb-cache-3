40|$|Abstract [...] The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} portable {{systems and the}} need to limit power consumption in very high density, VLSI chips have led to rapid and innovative development in low power design during the recent years. The need for low power design is becoming a major issue in high performance digital systems such as microprocessor,digital signal processor and other applications. For these applications, Multiplier is the major core block. Based on the Multiplier design, an efficient processor is designed. In this paper, branch based –pass transistor logic or ULPFA full adder and High performance Low power full adder is designed and compared with the existing logics such as CPL and DPL. The adders which is designed is implemented in 8 x 8 vedic multiplier and the parameters like area,transistor count and power dissipation are compared by using Tanner EDA tool. Because the high voltage level of the pass-transistor outputs is lower than the supply voltage level by the threshold voltage of the pass transistors, the signals have to be amplified by using CMOS inverters at the outputs. CPL full adder consists of cross coupled NMOS transistors and static PMOS <b>circuits</b> at the <b>output</b> <b>makes</b> the <b>circuit</b> to have good driving capability and full swing operation. [3] The demerit of this CPL adder is that there is large power dissipation in the circuit due to lot of static inverters and internal nodes.
