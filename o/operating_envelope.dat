25|$|On 3 March 2001, a C-23B Sherpa {{belonging}} to the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard was carrying 18 construction workers from Hurlburt Field (Florida) to Naval Air Station Oceana (Virginia). The pilot left the flight deck to use the aft bathroom. His weight in the tailcone shifted {{the center of gravity}} sufficiently (later calculations determined that the aircraft had been loaded outside its <b>operating</b> <b>envelope</b> {{at the start of the}} flight) that the airplane became unstable when a patch of severe turbulence was encountered. The violent g-force shifts then encountered rendered the crew unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight near Unadilla, Georgia, killing the 21 persons on board.|$|E
2500|$|An {{extensive}} {{flight test}} program of VMS Eve, with nearly twenty flights between December 2008 and August 2009, was undertaken {{to validate the}} design and gradually expand the aircraft <b>operating</b> <b>envelope.</b> [...] The flight tests were complete by September 2009, and testing with SpaceShipTwo began in early 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The Concorde's {{variable}} geometry intake, {{designed by}} BAC, like any jet engine intake, has {{to deliver the}} air to the engine at as high [...] pressure as possible (pressure recovery) and with a pressure distribution [...] (distortion) that can be tolerated by the compressor. Poor pressure recovery is an unacceptable loss for the intake compression process and unacceptable distortion causes engine surging (from loss of surge margin). If the engine is an afterburning turbojet the intake also has to supply cooling air for the hot afterburner duct and engine nozzle. Meeting all the above requirements over the relevant parts of the <b>operating</b> <b>envelope</b> was vital for Concorde to become a viable commercial aircraft. They were met with variable geometry and an intake control system that did not compromise {{the operation of the}} engine nor the control of the aircraft.|$|E

Tunnel performance <b>operating</b> <b>envelopes</b> of altitude, dynamic pressure, Reynolds number, total pressure, and total temperature {{as a function of}} test section Mach number are presented. <b>Operating</b> <b>envelopes</b> are shown for both the aerodynamic (closed) cycle and the propulsion (open) cycle. The tunnel test section Mach number range is 2. 0 to 3. 5. General support systems, such as air systems, hydraulic system, hydrogen system, fuel system, and Schlieren system, are described.

40|$|This {{document}} presents {{recommendations for}} electromagnetic <b>operating</b> <b>envelopes</b> to augment test criteria and test methods addressing electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio-frequency interference (RFI), and power surges that are applicable to safety-related {{instrumentation and control}} (I and C) systems in nuclear power plants. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was engaged by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research to assist in developing the technical basis for regulatory guidance on EMI/RFI immunity and power surge withstand capability (SWC). Previous research has provided recommendations on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design and installation practices, endorsement of EMI/RFI immunity and SWC test criteria and test methods, and determination of ambient electromagnetic conditions at nuclear power plants. The present research involves development of recommended electromagnetic envelopes that are applicable to nuclear power plant locations where safety-related I and C systems either are or may be installed. These recommended envelopes establish both emissions criteria and the levels of radiated and conducted interference that I and C systems {{should be able to}} withstand without upset or malfunction. The EMI/RFI <b>operating</b> <b>envelopes</b> are derived from conditions in comparable military environments and are confirmed by comparison with the nuclear power plant electromagnetic environment based on measured plant emissions profiles. Detailed information on specific power surge conditions in nuclear power plants is not available, so industrial guidance on representative surge characteristics for susceptibility testing is adopted. An engineering assessment of the power surge environment in nuclear power plants leads to the recommendation of <b>operating</b> <b>envelopes</b> based on location categories and exposure levels defined in IEEE Std C 62. 41 - 1991, IEEE Recommended Practice on Surge Voltages in Low-Voltage AC Power Circuits...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the flight}} tests, Boeing {{discovered}} a buffet {{problem with the}} aircraft, involving turbulence coming off the landing gear doors interfering with the inboard flaps. Boeing undertook {{an evaluation of the}} issue, which included devoting the third test aircraft to investigating the problem. The issue was resolved by a design change to the outboard main landing gear doors. In early April 2010, Boeing identified a possible defect in a part {{at the top of the}} fuselage called a longeron. According to Boeing, the parts, manufactured by subcontractor Vought Aircraft Industries, were, under certain loads, susceptible to cracking. Boeing said that the issue would not affect flight testing, but other sources stated that the problem could impact the <b>operating</b> <b>envelope</b> of the aircraft until it was fully repaired. Two other issues found during testing were oscillation in the inboard aileron and a structural flutter, which had not been resolved as of 2010. [...] Combined, these problems slowed flight testing and used up almost all the margin in Boeing's development schedule.|$|E
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} pilot in command (PIC) allowing the aircraft to be loaded beyond its operating limitations. The required pre-flight weight and balance computations would have shown it was dangerously overloaded and also outside its weight and balance <b>operating</b> <b>envelope,</b> but in this instance the pilot in command, as a former military pilot, was neither accustomed to nor responsible for computing weight and balance computations during his military career, as this was the responsibility of the military loadmaster, and thus it is believed he may have by force of habit overlooked this responsibility as a civilian pilot is required to do. Don Alan Burmeister was a former United States Marine Corps aviator, but FAA records show he had very limited experience / training in flying conventional (vs. centerline thrust) twin engine aircraft. [...] Records show it was only a short time prior to the accident (6/9/82) that he completed a check-ride to remove the [...] "centerline thrust" [...] restriction from his pilot's certificate. This check-ride should have fully evaluated his ability to fly a conventional multi-engine aircraft throughout its designed range of operations, but the flight examiner was decertified the next month (7/10/82) by the FAA due to a [...] "history of incomplete or substandard check-rides". Additionally, the insurance carrier (Ideal Mutual Insurance Co.) required Burmeister to log 1,045 hrs of flying time, attend a Cessna ground and flight training course, as well as log 15 hours in a Cessna 414 (C-414) prior to acting as the PIC of the leased aircraft. The NTSB record shows he failed to accomplish all of these requirements, with disastrous results. With pilot and eleven passengers, the aircraft was overloaded by an estimated , and the location of the center of gravity was found to be [...] beyond the maximum aft limit. Combined with an air temperature of , creating a condition known as [...] "hot and high" [...] (high density altitude, producing a lower climb rate on takeoff and greater danger of stalling), the C-414 could do little but struggle into the air within ground effect, and once airborne was left virtually uncontrollable. These factors prevented the aircraft from ever attaining sufficient altitude, and it crashed into trees {{less than a mile from}} the airport.|$|E
50|$|If a sufficiently-wide {{range of}} {{variables}} {{were to be}} tested, a normal shmoo plot would show an <b>operating</b> <b>envelope</b> of some shape not unlike Al Capp's Shmoo, but in practice, this might damage the device under test, and finer-grained views are of much more interest, particularly focusing on published component margins (e.g., - 5% Vcc).

40|$|A {{methodology}} for dynamic {{analysis of the}} Space Station Freedom thermal/environmental control system is described which uses linear system analysis techniques to determine {{the ability of the}} system to accommodate thermal load transients. A nonlinear integrated model of the system as it exists at Stage 6, Man Tended Capability (MTC), is described which encompasses the cabin air cooling system, avionics air cooling system, internal and external thermal control systems. The nonlinear model is linearized at an assumed design operating point, and the linear model is evaluated by comparison with the nonlinear model. Transfer functions are derived to determine the response of the heat rejection system to time-varying thermal loads applied at various points in the heat acquisition system. The frequency response calculated from the transfer functions is used to determine allowable <b>operating</b> <b>envelopes</b> of thermal load magnitude and frequency for each point of application of thermal load. The dynamic <b>operating</b> <b>envelopes</b> provide a quantitative indication of the degree and duration of peak loads which the thermal/environmental system is able to transport and reject...|$|R
50|$|Like all systems, {{these systems}} have their <b>operating</b> <b>envelopes,</b> though with {{hydraulic}} pumps these are often misunderstood by designers.

40|$|The Ground Control System {{contributes}} to the safe construction and operation of the subsurface facility, including accesses and waste emplacement drifts, by maintaining the configuration and stability of the openings during construction, development, emplacement, and caretaker modes {{for the duration of}} preclosure repository life. The Ground Control System consists of ground support structures installed within the subsurface excavated openings, any reinforcement made to the rock surrounding the opening, and inverts if designed {{as an integral part of}} the system. The Ground Control System maintains stability for the range of geologic conditions expected at the repository and for all expected loading conditions, including in situ rock, construction, operation, thermal, and seismic loads.
