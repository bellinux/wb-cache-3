40|$|Diversity of weed {{communities}} of annual crops in Cote-d'Or, France. Weed flora of annual crops in Cote-d'Or, France, were characterized in three successive growing seasons by measuring species frequencies and abundance over 245 fields. A total of 210 species in 143 genera were recorded representing {{a total of}} 43 families with Asteraceae, Poaceae, Fabaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Brassicaceae, Lamiaceae and Caryophyllaceae predominating. More than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species occurred in less than 5 / <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sampled <b>plots</b> (fields x years) and only 9 species (namely Galium aparine L., Polygonum aviculare L., Fallopia convolvulus (L.) A. Loeve, Alopecurus myosuroides Hudson, Stellaria media (L.) Vill., Convolvulus arvensis L., Sinapis arvensis L., Veronica persica Poiret and Anagallis arvensis L.) occurred in more than 50 / <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots.</b> <b>The</b> maximum <b>plot</b> density was greater than 20 plants per square metre {{for more than one}} third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> where <b>the</b> density exceeded 20 plants per square metre, were rare and represented, for the most abundant species (A. myosuroides), less than 16 / <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots.</b> <b>The</b> total number <b>of</b> weed species per plots varied from 4 to 65 with a median species number of 20. In most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots,</b> <b>the</b> weed community was mainly composed of species having a small density (less than one plant per square metre) and was dominated by only one or two species in half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots...</b>|$|R

He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plot,</b> from which the twist ending was derived.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii and directed by Takeo Oin. The story was written by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by Yoko Shimomura.

While critics generally praised the graphics, they were dismissive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plot,</b> mixed on the actual gameplay and sharply negative on what they saw as poor artificial intelligence and pathfinding inhibiting actual play.|$|E
