5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} that where the P. rebeli {{lay their eggs}} {{is based on the}} size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony. Evidence for P. rebeli <b>oviposition</b> depending upon the range of the food plant rather than the range of the ants is supported by the timing of its <b>oviposition.</b> P. rebeli lays their eggs during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their <b>oviposition</b> on where they found Myrmica nests.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} {{can influence the}} occurrence of Karner blue butterflies in habitats of varying canopy cover. The lower temperatures occurring in partial and shaded habitats of Wisconsin and Minnesota meant that 1st-flight females only had access to these areas {{for a few hours}} a day. In contrast, these females could access open habitats an average of 10.5 hours a day. The percent of adults in habitats of varying canopy categories was significantly (p=0.0001) influenced by temperature, with butterflies, especially females, increasing in partial (15-75%) and shaded (>75%) habitats with increasing temperature. In addition, 80% (n=45) of 1st-flight <b>ovipositions</b> when temperatures were cool (68-79 °F, 20-26 °C) were in sun, while only 40% (n=17) of 1st-flight <b>ovipositions</b> in hot temperatures (86-97 °F, 30-36 °C) occurred in the sun. The same trend was observed in 2nd-flight <b>ovipositions.</b> In cool temperatures 65% (n=11) of <b>ovipositions</b> occurred in the sun, while in hot temperatures only 40% (n=37) occurred in the sun.|$|R
50|$|Some {{animal species}} such as the Edith's checkerspot {{butterfly}} use these plants as hosts during <b>ovipositioning.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely to}} lay their eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage <b>oviposition</b> by butterflies.|$|E
5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and <b>oviposition</b> are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{in a series}} of slits usually cut by the mother's {{ovipositor}} in live branches or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch of a few hundred, are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a day or two of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions. <b>Oviposition</b> has been observed {{on a wide range of}} native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.|$|E
40|$|In many {{damselfly}} species mature females exhibit colour polymorphism: {{one female}} morph resembles the conspecific male (androchrome) {{while the others}} do not (gynochromes). Hypotheses {{for the maintenance of}} such polymorphisms differ mainly as to whether they are based on density- and/or frequency-dependent selection and {{on the nature of the}} frequency dependence. We collected lifetime fitness data (individual lifespan, number of copulations and number of <b>ovipositions)</b> for female morphs of the damselfly Ischnura elegans from 15 insectaries differing in population parameters (density, sex ratio and ratio of andro- to gynochromes). Both density and frequency affected a specific set of the studied fitness components. While morph frequency influenced lifespan, sex ratio influenced the number of copulations, and density affected lifespan and the number of <b>ovipositions.</b> Clearly, discrepancies among studies may be generated if the studied fitness components differ. Our final fitness estimate, the number of <b>ovipositions,</b> was only influenced by density, thereby not supporting frequency-based hypotheses. Contrary to expectation under the current density-based hypothesis, androchromes compared to gynochromes had a lower number of <b>ovipositions</b> at high density. We discuss our findings in the light of mechanisms maintaining the female polymorphism.

40|$|Using a {{molecular}} marker {{that allows the}} differentiation of two strains of the solitary endoparasitoid wasp Venturia canescens, the study investigated the influence of host mass and the time interval between <b>ovipositions</b> on the survival and development of larvae from both {{the first and second}} laid eggs in superparasitised Ephestia kuehniella. As the time interval between <b>ovipositions</b> increased both overall and superparasitism success decreased, however, time between, and order of, <b>ovipositions</b> had little effect on other developmental parameters. Adult size increased with host mass under both parasitism and superparasitism, while host mortality decreased with host mass under superparasitism. In addition, wasps emerging from superparasitised hosts were larger than wasps from parasitised hosts. The results confirm that for V. canescens on the host E. kuehniella both self- and conspecific-superparasitism will be an adaptive strategy when hosts are the limiting factor. Harry L. S.

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of maiking easier the {{determination}} of the physiological age of Stomosys calcitrans population, a classification based on the oocitary developtment and number of <b>ovipositions</b> was proposed. Female were reared under laboratory conditions, in individual cages and maintained in the presence of male for copulation. On the proper time, ovary and oviduct were removed and the stage of development was observed. Adult female were classified as: 1 -New emerged female, 2 - Young nuliparous female, 3 - Old nuliparous female, 4 - Uniparousfemale, 5 - Two or three <b>ovipositions</b> times female, and 6 - Multiparous female...|$|R
5|$|Once {{males and}} females are both sexually mature, mating is spread over a few weeks. Insects are active when {{temperature}} reaches 20°C; temperatures above 25°C are very favorable to their activity in the field whereas colder temperatures below 15°C and wet weather limit insect mobility. Once fertilized, females B. rufimanus lay eggs on developing pods of faba beans. Rain, wind and temperatures below 20°C put on hold the <b>oviposition</b> process. Eggs are laid predominantly on the lowest parts of the plant. Eggs are small (< 2mm diameter), white-yellowish. A maximum of ten eggs per pod is observed. Females lay between 50 and 100 eggs. Rain might increase egg mortality.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the <b>oviposition</b> period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E

40|$|In patchy environments, patch-leaving {{decision}} {{rules are}} {{a key component of}} the foraging behavior of parasitoids that have to share their searching time between the different host patches to optimize the number of <b>ovipositions.</b> It has been experimentally shown that one of the proximate cues involved in patch-leaving decision is the number of <b>ovipositions</b> performed by the parasitoid while in the patch. <b>Ovipositions</b> can have either a decremental or an incremental effect on the patch residence time depending on parasitoid species. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that environmental conditions and the ability of parasitoids to reliably estimate the number of available hosts on a patch when entering it should influence how patch departure depends on <b>ovipositions.</b> We developed an individual-based model to test a large variety of patch-leaving decision rules in different environmental conditions. This model includes a more realistic representation of individual acquisition of information than previous theoretical work. In accordance with previous results, we show that the best use of information depends on environmental conditions. Moreover, we identify the environmental factors that have a decisive influence on the most appropriate type of rule (incremental or decremental). Decremental mechanisms are most efficient only in restricted conditions characterized by a large number of patches and few parasitoids. The sensitivity of decision rules to frequency-dependent processes was tested by numerical invasibility experiments. Rare mutants using any alternative rule never outperform populations using a high-performance rule. Incremental rules seem to be more sensitive than decremental ones to frequency-dependent processes.

40|$|Egg {{dispersion}} and the {{sex ratio}} of progeny were studied {{in relation to}} the host density of the parasitoid, Bracon hebetor Say, infesting larvae of Plodia interpunctella (H. ubner).

The dispersion pattern of the parasitoid <b>ovipositions</b> among hosts was influenced by host density.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} the time of male {{permanence}} with females and different sex ratios on the reproductive capacity of Chrysoperla externa F 3 adults was evaluated. The insects were kept at 25 ± 2 °C, 70 ± 10 % RH, under a 12 h photoperiod. The first experiment consisted of mating females with males that were subsequently removed after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 days; the control group consisted of males remaining with the females during the entire experimental period. The second experiment consisted of mating: one male with one female (1 : 1); one male with two females (1 : 2); one male with three females (1 : 3); one male with four females (1 : 4); and one male with five females (1 : 5), and then evaluating their pre-ovipositioning periods, daily and total <b>ovipositioning,</b> egg viability percentages, and efficiency indices (which considered total <b>ovipositioning,</b> mean egg viability, and the <b>ovipositioning</b> period).

40|$|Leaf miners of {{the family}} Agromizydae contain many pest species that are often {{difficult}} to control exclusively with insecticides due {{to high levels of}} resistance. Biological control with insect parasitoids is an alternative or compatible option in leafminer management. Effective mass rearing systems of parasitoids are essential to successful biocontrol because cost of parasitoid production is often too high and lowering the cost is crucial to economically reasonable practices of biological control. Experiments were conducted to examine whether provision of protein sources as supplemental food could improve mass rearing efficiency of Hemiptarsenus varicornis, a parasitoid wasp attacking the leafminer Liriomyza trifolii. No significant difference was found in the number of <b>ovipositions</b> and host-feedings between female groups, i. e., females that had been fed on a honey solution and those fed on a honey-protein mixture. Females that fed on more hosts parasitized more hosts, suggesting that host-feeding was involved in an enhancement of egg production in H. varicornis. However, the relationships between the number of host-feedings and <b>ovipositions</b> did not differ between the female groups.
