Vildanden {{stated that they}} aimed to <b>outperform</b> Widerøe on price to Bergen. The ATR-42 {{turned out to be}} too large; from 1 July, operations was taken over by the Czech company Air Aurora, with a smaller 30-seater Saab 340. This reduced the monthly leasing costs from NOK700,000 to NOK550,000. DAT remained responsible for the booking system.|$|E
5|$|The {{specialized}} hardware of graphics processing units (GPU) {{is designed}} to accelerate rendering of 3-Dgraphics applications such as video games and can significantly <b>outperform</b> CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs {{are one of the}} most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the open source OpenMM library, which uses a bridge design pattern with two application programming interface (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly <b>outperform</b> CPU implementations.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{proposed a}} purpose-built aircraft, but tests indicated {{it would not}} <b>outperform</b> the already-operational 707, so the latter was chosen instead. To increase endurance, this design was to be powered by eight General Electric TF34s. It would carry its radar in a rotating dome mounted {{at the top of}} a forward-swept tail, above the fuselage. Boeing was selected ahead of McDonnell Douglas's DC-8-based proposal in July 1970. Initial orders were placed for two aircraft, designated EC-137D as test beds to evaluate the two competing radars. As the test-beds did not need the same 14-hour endurance demanded of the production aircraft, the EC-137s retained the Pratt & Whitney JT3D commercial engines, and a later reduction in endurance requirement led to retaining the normal engines in production.|$|E

40|$|Who is {{more likely}} to behave aggressively? Is it someone <b>outperformed</b> by others or is it someone who <b>outperformed</b> others? For safety reasons, it is {{important}} to know the answer to this question. In Studies 1 and 2, participants were told that they did worse or better than an ostensible partner on a first task. Then they aggressed against this partner on a second task using loud, painful noise blasts. Results showed that participants aggressed more against someone they <b>outperformed</b> (the loser) than against someone who <b>outperformed</b> them (the winner). However, these results do not indicate whether participants were especially aggressive against someone they <b>outperformed,</b> or whether they were especially nonaggressive against someone who <b>outperformed</b> them. Study 3 included a control group and showed it was the former. These studies suggest that one should pay particular attention to winners rather than losers, because winners tend to aggress against losers...|$|R
