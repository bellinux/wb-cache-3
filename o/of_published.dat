5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus <b>of</b> <b>published</b> Elvish {{comprised}} {{only a few hundred}} words. Since then, the use of Elvish has flourished in poems and texts, phrases and names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation. As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language that is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} <b>of</b> <b>published</b> archaeological {{material and the}} misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range <b>of</b> <b>published</b> tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
5|$|Goldman united populations {{ranging from}} {{northern}} Veracruz through eastern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua south to far northwestern Costa Rica in the nominate subspecies, Oryzomys couesi couesi.

According to Goldman, individual variation within the subspecies is large, {{which has led to}} the large number <b>of</b> <b>published</b> synonyms, but populations from all parts of its range are essentially similar.|$|E

Transforming {{relational}} data into XML, as known as XML publishing, is often necessary when {{one wants to}} exchange data residing in databases or to create an XML interface of a traditional database.

We present a notion <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> transducers recently developed for studying the expressive power and complexity <b>of</b> XML <b>publishing</b> languages. In terms <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> transducers we then characterize XML publishing languages being used in practice. In addition, we address dy-namic aspects <b>of</b> XML <b>publishing,</b> namely, incremental maintenance and update management <b>of</b> XML views <b>published</b> from {{relational data}}. ...|$|R

5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results <b>of</b> <b>published</b> trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E

5|$|In {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>published</b> and {{unpublished}} {{studies in the}} 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, J.E.S. Thompson, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis. Whorf {{argued that it was}} exactly the reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within the elements of the specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by Yuri Knorozov's syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The Hongwu Emperor (ruled 1368–98) {{attempted}} {{to create a}} society of self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid, immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty: the empire's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy's dockyards in Nanjing were {{the largest in the}} world. He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates, enfeoffing his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang Ming Zu Xun, a set <b>of</b> <b>published</b> dynastic instructions. This failed spectacularly when his teenage successor, the Jianwen Emperor, {{attempted to}} curtail his uncles' power, prompting the Jingnan Campaign, an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402. The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing, constructed the Forbidden City, and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments. He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats. One, Zheng He, led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the Indian Ocean as far as Arabia and the eastern coasts of Africa.|$|E
5|$|The saxaul sparrow is less social {{than other}} sparrows while breeding, {{due to its}} dry habitat and its choices of nesting locations, holes in trees and earth banks. Isolated pairs are usual, though it {{sometimes}} breeds in small groups, with members of its own species as well as house and Eurasian tree sparrows. The breeding season is short, lasting from May to July, with most young raised in April and June. Unusually for a sparrow, {{it has not been}} recorded nesting openly in branches, though this may simply represent the lack <b>of</b> <b>published</b> records. Nests are often built in tree cavities, where they are sometimes placed close together. Other common nesting localities are earth banks and rocky slopes, and nests have been recorded on the nests of birds of prey, unused buildings, walls, and electricity pylons. Nests in man-made structures are increasingly common, as large trees in the saxaul sparrow's habitat are removed. Nests may be quite close to the ground, especially when they are built in trees.|$|E
