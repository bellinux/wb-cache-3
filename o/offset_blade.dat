They have a series of blades on a base, therefore they are not suitable for root planing and fine scaling. Universal curettes are double-ended instruments with paired mirror working ends and a rounded toe. These instruments can be used on all surfaces of the tooth including root surfaces in a periodontal pocket. Gracey curettes have a stronger, rigid shank and angulated working blades that are area specific. They are best for subgingival scaling and root planing because the <b>offset</b> <b>blade</b> allowing for greater adaptation. After fives are similar to gracey’s except they have an extended shank to allow extension into deeper pockets (>5mm). They also have a thinner blade for heavy or tenacious calculus. Mini fives are a modification of after fives as their blades are half the length to allow for easier insertion and adaptation into deep pockets, furcations, developmental grooves and line angles. They also contribute to a reduction in tissue trauma. Ultrasonic scalers move in an elliptical motion and do not have a cutting edge. They operate at a frequency of 3,000-8,000 cycles per second and use magnetostrictive or peizo-electric technology, thus helping remove plaque and calculus while reducing operator wrist fatigue.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of active}} blade pitch control to {{increase}} helicopter rotor/body damping is studied. Control is introduced through a conventional nonrotating swashplate. State variable feedback of rotor and body states is used. Feedback parameters include cyclic rotor flap and lead-lag states, and body {{pitch and roll}} rotations.

For the rotor/body configuration analyzed, rotor cyclic inplane motion and body roll-rate and roll-acceleration feedback can considerably augment system damping levels and eliminate ground resonance instabilities. Scheduling of the feedback state, phase, and gain with rotor rotation speed can be used to maximize the damping augmentation. This increase in lead-lag damping can be accomplished without altering any of the system modal frequencies. Investigating various rotor design parameters (effective hinge <b>offset,</b> <b>blade</b> precone, blade flap stiffness) indicates that active control for augmenting rotor/body damping will be particularly powerful for hingeless and bearingless rotor hubs...|$|E

40|$|For many years, {{analysts have}} been {{puzzled by the}} fact that the {{off-axis}} coupling of a helicopter exhibits the opposite sign in flight tests as compared to simulations. Recently, researchers have shown that the effect may be attributable to the bending of the wake during a pitching maneuver, which introduces a fore-to-aft gradient in induced flow that can reverse the predicted sign of the roll coupling. Other research as shown that this result can also be obtained with momentum and vortex theory. There are many issues still under debate regarding the magnitude of wake distortion and its effectiveness in predicting off-axis dynamics. In the present work, a generalized ynamic wake model is augmented to include wake distortions. This model is then coupled with a flap model for simulation in low speed forward flight.

To provide the necessary data base, the parametric study included variation in the pylon pitch and yaw stiffnesses, flapping hinge <b>offset,</b> and <b>blade</b> kinematic pitch-flap coupling over a large range of advance ratios. Cases of forward whirl flutter and of backward whirl flutter are documented. Measured whirl flutter characteristics were shown to be in good agreement with predictions from two different linear stability analyses which employed simple, two dimensional, quasi-steady aerodynamics for the blade loading.

Quasi-steady blade-element strip theory was applied to derive the aerodynamic operator which includes boundary layer type gradient winds.

A new method of generating an appropriate time-dependent equilibrium position (required for the stability analysis) has been implemented. Representative steady-state responses and stability boundaries, applicable mainly to an existing blade design (NASA/-ERDA MOD- 0), are presented.

The blade is cantilevered in bending, but has a torsional root spring to simulate pitch link flexibility. Aerodynamic forces acting on the blade are derived from strip theory based on quasi-steady two-dimensional airfoil theory. The equations are hybrid, consisting of one integro-differential equation for root torsion and three integro-partial differential equations for flatwise and chordwise bending and elastic torsion. The equations are specialized for a uniform blade and reduced to nonlinear ordinary differential equations by Galerkin's method. They are linearized for small perturbation motions about the equilibrium operating condition.

For the fuselage, only four rigid body degrees of freedom are considered; longitudinal and lateral translations, pitch, and roll. The rotor is assumed to consist of three or more rigid blades. Each blade is joined to the hub by means of a flexible beam segment (flexbeam or strap). Pitch change is accomplished by twisting the flexbeam with the pitch-control system, the characteristics of which are variable. Thus, the analysis is capable of implicitly treating aeroelastic couplings generated by the flexbeam elastic deflections, the pitch-control system, and the angular <b>offsets</b> of the <b>blade</b> and flexbeam.

The computed properties include cross-coupled stiffness properties, inertia properties, and <b>offsets</b> of the <b>blade</b> shear center, tension center, and center of mass {{with respect to the}} blade pitch axis. Analysts need these properties to properly model the major flexible components of a wind turbine—blades, tower, and drivetrain shaft.

Designers need these properties to rapidly evaluate alternate composite layouts and their effects on blade properties and material strains. Structural properties are difficult to extract from 3 -D finite element models (FEMs), which are primarily suited to obtaining detailed stress and displacement distributions. Such models also take time and effort to develop and are typically used during the final design stage. Salient features of PreComp are accurate computation of blade torsion stiffness and cross-stiffness properties.

40|$|Load {{fluctuations}} {{caused by}} the unsteady nature of tidal streams can have severe impacts on turbine components. As seen in the wind industry, turbine blades can become misaligned due to a fault in the pitch mechanism or blade deformations arising over time. These misalignments will represent a loss of power capture and perhaps even premature failure of the components if not detected in time. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) techniques {{can be used to}} predict the performance of a turbine with a misaligned blade. However, these numerical modelling techniques quickly become computationally expensive when modelling realistic, time-varying conditions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the structural {{design of a}} tidal composite blade. The structural design is preceded by two steps: hydrodynamic design and determination of extreme loads. The hydrodynamic design provides the chord and twist distributions along the blade length that result in optimal performance of the tidal turbine over its lifetime. The extreme loads, i. e. the extreme flap and edgewise loads that the blade would likely encounter over its lifetime, are associated with extreme tidal flow conditions and are obtained using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Given the blade external shape and the extreme loads, we use a laminate-theory-based structural design to determine the optimal layout of composite laminas such that the ultimate-strength and buckling-resistance criteria are satisfied at all points in the blade. The structural design approach allows for arbitrary specification of the chord, twist, and airfoil geometry along the blade and an arbitrary number of shear webs. In addition, certain fabrication criteria are imposed, for example, each composite laminate must be an integral multiple of its constituent ply thickness. In the present effort, the structural design uses only static extreme loads; dynamic-loads-based fatigue design will be addressed in the future. Following the blade design, we compute the distributed structural properties, i. e. flap stiffness, edgewise stiffness, torsion stiffness, mass, moments of inertia, elastic-axis offset, and center-of-mass <b>offset</b> along the <b>blade.</b> Such properties are required by hydro-elastic codes to model the tidal current turbine and to perform modal, stability, loads, and response analyses...|$|R

The relative positions of the characteristic points of the cross-sections of helicopter blades like the shear center, the neutral axis and the cross-sectional center of gravity are formative for the dynamic behaviour of the rotating structure. Even the location of the reference point of the cross-section — which is defined by the radial connection between the hub and the cross- section, standing normal on the respective plane — plays an important role concerning the equilibrium of a rotating blade differential mass element. Although in helicopter blade design generally efforts are made to keep the offsets of these characteristic structural points small they can reach non-negligible extents and thus, together with the gyroscopic effects, contribute significantly to the coupling mechanisms between the motion components of the vibrating elastic blade structure like the flapping, lagging and torsional deformation. Also in terms of aeroelastic stability the cross-sectional offsets may have a dominant influence. Here the scope of modelling <b>blade</b> <b>offsets</b> in MBS is to capture the complete variety of offsets resulting in the full range of mechanical coupling mechanisms like the bending-torsion coupling, the bending-longitudinal coupling and the bending-bending coupling (with “bending” meaning the flapping or lagging motion respec- tively). It is shown how special joint modelling techniques and the usage of “pseudo” bodies with additional DOF are introduced into the “pure” MBS model to reach this aim. The two basic approaches for incorpo- rating elastic properties into a MBS model are addressed. The way of mapping the continuously distributed elastic properties of the blade beam structure on dynamic equivalent discrete spring stiffnesses of a “pure” MBS model is compared with FEM models which can be used as basis in the strategy of importing separately built upp elastic Finite Element models with modal substructure techniques (FEMBS), thus resulting in a hybrid MBS model. While modelling of structural offsets within the pure MBS model refers to the genuine characteristics of the MBS modelling approach, the hybrid FEMBS model inherits all the advantageous (or deficient) properties of the incorporated Finite Element substructure. Since for the rotating blade the equilibrium state is now not only defined by the longitudinal normal forces but is three-dimensional, {{it is important for the}} geometric stiffness matix Sg of the FEM formulation to contain the whole set of second order terms, while the cutting forces depend linear on the cross-sectional offsets and contribute linear to the geometric stiffness. Because the completeness of the FEM model constitutes the quality of the FEMBS solution by providing in particular the geometric stiffness matrix of the rotating blade, a separate FEM model has been analysed. On the MBS side the commecial tool SIMPACK has been tested while on the FEM side the inhouse tool GYRBLAD is used. As fully elastic single blade examples generic test beam cases with considerable offsets are used. The validation of the models is done by comparing the eigenvalue results produced with the two independent elasto-mechanical methods MBS and FEM. ...|$|R
