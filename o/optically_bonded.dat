5000|$|Silicone: The most {{commonly}} found adhesive in optical bonding processes {{that dates back}} to the 1970s as a solution. Silicone's core properties of low conductivity and chemical reactivity, thermal stability, and ability to repel water and form watertight seals make it a common solution for optical bonding. Also, because it is a soft material, it is very feasible to rework for bonds that become damaged over time. However, debris often forms {{around the edges of the}} bonds if they are rubbed during handling. To reduce this, edges of <b>optically</b> <b>bonded</b> displays should be covered or configured so that edges are not exposed.|$|E
40|$|Current {{state-of-the-art}} {{and next}} generation laser systems - {{such as those}} used in the NIF and LIFE experiments at LLNL - depend on ever larger optical elements. The need for wide aperture optics that are tolerant of high power has placed many demands on material growers for such diverse materials as crystalline sapphire, quartz, and laser host materials. For such materials, it is either prohibitively expensive or even physically impossible to fabricate monolithic pieces with the required size. In these cases, it is preferable to <b>optically</b> <b>bond</b> two or more elements together with a technique such as Chemically Activated Direct Bonding (CADB{copyright}). CADB is an epoxy-free bonding method that produces bulk-strength bonded samples with negligible optical loss and excellent environmental robustness. The authors have demonstrated CADB {{for a variety of}} different laser glasses and crystals. For this project, they will bond quartz samples together to determine the suitability of the resulting assemblies for large aperture high power laser optics. The assemblies will be evaluated in terms of their transmitted wavefront error, and other optical properties...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{investigations}} of direct bonding of mono-crystalline Terbium Gallium Garnet (TGG) to sapphire {{for use as}} Faraday isolator in high power fiber laser applications. The technology of direct bonding allows joining of inorganic crystalline and non-crystalline materials without any auxiliary materials at high bonding strength. Lack of additional joining material and related absorption is very promising for high power laser applications. The ability to join different materials allows inserting sapphire as a heat spreader into the beam path for TGG cooling to avoid thermal lensing. All samples were subjected to extensive chemical cleaning and subsequent low temperature plasma activation before bonding. Bonding was performed under compressive forces in a high vacuum environment at moderate temperature. <b>Optically</b> transparent <b>bonds</b> with a very low fraction of defects were obtained. The size of the bonded area depends significantly on the samples' flatness...|$|R
50|$|Taken to the {{ultimate}} limit, {{with the aid of}} accurate interferometry and specialized polishing machines or skilled hand polishing, lensmakers can produce surfaces that are flat to better than 30 nanometers. This is one twentieth of the wavelength of light from the commonly used 632.8 nm helium neon laser light source. Surfaces this flat can be molecularly <b>bonded</b> (<b>optically</b> contacted) by bringing them together under the right conditions. (This {{is not the same as}} the wringing effect of Johansson blocks, although it is similar).|$|R
40|$|The copper-based InterChip Via (ICV) {{technology}} was evaluated as a fully CMOS-compatible wafer-scale process for Vertical System Integration VSI®, that provides vertical electrical interchip interconnects placed at arbitrary locations, without intervention to the IC´s fabrication technologies. Key processes are the <b>optically</b> adjusted <b>bonding</b> of a thinned top wafer to a bottom wafer {{and the formation}} of copper-filled interchip vias through the thinned top wafer to the bottom wafer, providing a high-density vertical wiring between metallization levels of both wafers. The low temperature Cu deposition process provides excellent step coverage of nearly 100 %. The high aspect ratio interchip vias could be filled completely and the developed total process sequence including MOCVD of TiN diffusion barrier and Cu/TiN etchback was used for the fabrication of vertically integrated wafer stacks. The electrical resistance of the Cu-filled interchip vias was characterized and compared to the results of the standard tungsten-based ICV technology...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{investigations}} of direct bonding of glass materials for application as optical devices or high precision mechanical stages under vacuum. SiO 2 (fused silica) wafers of about 0. 8 mm thickness and 200 mm diameter were bonded to massive SiO 2 substrates {{of up to}} 20 mm thickness. With suitable wet cleaning and a low pressure Nitrogen plasma surface activation, rather high quality (<b>optically</b> transparent) <b>bonds</b> were obtained. Successful bonding was achieved at relatively low temperatures of about 250 °Celsius in vacuum under compressive forces of several tens of kN, using a commercial bond equipment. Remaining bonding defects were analyzed by transmitting polarized light and measuring stress birefringence. At particle related defects in the bonding area, stress levels of the order of 0. 2 MPa were discerned. Small unbound regions typically emerged at locations where no significant pressure was applied during the bonding process. Crack-opening indicated a bonding strength of about 0. 6 J/m²...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{microfluidics}} has powerful applications in low-cost healthcare diagnostics, DNA analysis, and fuel cells, among others. As the field moves towards commercialization, {{the ability to}} robustly manufacture these devices at low cost is becoming more important. One of the many challenges in microfluidic manufacturing is the reliable sealing of the microfluidic chips once the channels have been generated. This work was an investigation of innovative ways to robustly heat the substrate-cover plate interface of a microfluidic device {{for the purpose of}} bonding and sealing the microfluidic channels. An extensive literature review revealed the benefits of interfacial heating, and both simulations and experimental investigations were used to evaluate a few different methods. Ultimately, a unique method was established that uses light to provide both the bonding energy and the illumination for an in-process vision system for real-time viewing and control of the bonding process. The process results in the generation of a homogenous and <b>optically</b> clear <b>bond,</b> and preliminary tests show that when properly controlled, a bond with minimal microchannel deformation can be created. by Michelle E.

40|$|A {{new system}} {{to provide a}} contact with a silver mesh trapped between the cell and an {{encapsulating}} glass cover is described. Borosilicate glass is joined to the cell by electrostatic bonding during which the glass is deformed around the silver mesh to form a permanent <b>optically</b> coupled integral <b>bond</b> to the cell. The hermetic seal prevents the silver from oxidizing and destroying the electrical contact formed during the bonding process. It is demonstrated that electrostatic glass/silicon bonds have excellent stability {{under a variety of}} accelerated environmental tests. Electrostatic bonds to thin films of AL 2 O 3, Ta 2 O 5, and ZrO 2 on glass {{can be used to make}} antireflective coatings for solar cells manufactured by this process. Test solar cells were manufactured by electrostatic bonding with good curve fill factors and efficiencies of 10 percent...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} optical {{contacting}} or "direct bonding" of glass to glass for optical and precision engineering applications. Fused silica (SiO 2) and ultra-low-expansion (ULE) glass materials with low and extremely low coefficients of thermal expansion, respectively, were investigated. Large glass wafers {{of up to}} 150 mm diameter and about 1. 5 mm thickness were bonded {{to each other and}} to plane glass substrates of up to 20 mm thickness. Successful bonding was achieved after extensive chemical cleaning and low pressure plasma surface activation, using a commercial wafer bonding equipment. High quality (<b>optically</b> transparent) <b>bonds</b> with a very low fraction of aerial defects were obtained at low bonding temperatures of about 250 °C, by applying compressive forces of several tens of kN in a high vacuum environment. Typically, only small unbound locations occurred at the rim, where insufficient pressure had been applied in the bonding process. Bonding strengths were estimated from destructive "razor-blade" testing of bonded wafer pairs, resulting in bond energies up to about 2 J/m 2. For surface activation, Nitrogen-plasma was tested in comparison to Oxygen-Plasma without significant differences. However, ULE wafers were found to bond much stronger than fused silica wafers under nominally identical bonding conditions. An exemplary "sandwich" structure was generated from ULE materials by bonding wafers from both sides to a core structure, obtained by perforating a massive plane plate with bore holes. This illustrates possible use in light-weight and stiff construction for high precision opto-mechanical applications...|$|R
