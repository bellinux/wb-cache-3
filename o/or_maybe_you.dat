Josiah had to stand the hectoring and nagging that thitherto had been distributed among many.

This disruptive behavior negatively impacts the persons with whom the physician initeracts. ” 1 The behavior further “disrupts the operation of the hospital, affects the ability of others to get their jobs done, and creates a ‘hostile work environment’. ” 2 What doesn’t constitute disruptive behavior is a single episode or an occasional bad day. 1 This behavior puts patient’s safety and appropriate healthcare at risk.

5000|$|.....my own {{interests}} {{are a little}} more specific. I'm interested in Japanese aesthetics, Tarkovsky's ideas on [...] "sculpting in time", an emphasis on moments. But there's something else I've really been thinking about lately. I believe that {{the most effective way to}} really make subjective and authentic work involves an [...] "addressing of the shadow" [...] (as Billy Childish and Charles Thomson have described it). Now what does this mean exactly? It might mean that you are really obsessed with pubic hair, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> are really embarrassed by a physical or mental disability that you try to hide, or like Billy Childish, you were abused as a child. These things, these [...] "shadows" [...] that we are hiding within ourselves, need to be brought forth into the light of day - in our films, in our work, in our poetry. It's necessary for us to share these parts of ourselves so we and the people we share with can grow into complete, honest human beings. Now, this kind of brutal honesty about ourselves shown through imagery that isn't shy, has been explored to a degree in the work from the Cinema of Transgression, and is advocated by Antonin Artaud in his writings about the Theatre of Cruelty, and his later writings on cinema. But I don't think it's quite as simple as just that. As human beings, we are also full of beauty and love and poetry - we can see this in ourselves and in others and in the world around us. So this beauty must be explored as well, and in combination with the exploration of the shadow. The funny thing is that if we would just be honest as filmmakers, or painters, or as whatever we happen to work with, if we could be this honest, this approach would happen automatically. But we are told again and again- these things don't go together, don't tell people about that thing that you can't get out of your head- that image is inappropriate. We've become very afraid of just expressing ourselves honestly, of removing the desperate attempts to appear clever, we've been afraid of showing our true selves out of fear that others will think us fools. So this is where Artaud, the Cinema of Transgression, and even Andrei Tarkovsky have not gone quite the distance. The cinematic exploration of spirituality and transgression together - pubic hair, blood and shit and love and the green grass and the dying cherry blossoms, falling snow, passing trains - every single fucking beautiful piece of life - that is what my conception of Remodernist film is.|$|E
