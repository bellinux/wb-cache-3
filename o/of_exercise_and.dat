5|$|Jack Russells are an {{energetic}} breed {{that rely on}} a high level <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> stimulation and are relatively free from serious health complaints. Originating from dogs bred and used by Reverend John Russell in the early 19th century, from whom the breed takes its name, the Jack Russell has similar origins to the modern Fox terrier. It has gone through several changes over the years, corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs. Recognition by kennel clubs for the Jack Russell breed has been opposed by the breed's parent societies – {{which resulted in the}} breeding and recognition of the Parson Russell terrier. Jack Russells have appeared many times in film, television, and print - with several historical dogs of note.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 1569, Mary {{was moved}} to Tutbury Castle {{and placed in the}} custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his {{formidable}} wife Bess of Hardwick. Elizabeth considered Mary's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury's properties, including Tutbury, Sheffield Castle, Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House, all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London, and distant from the sea. Mary was permitted her own domestic staff, which never numbered less than 16, and needed 30 carts to transport her belongings from house to house. Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets, as well as her cloth of state on which she had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement ("In my end lies my beginning") embroidered. Her bedlinen was changed daily, and her own chefs prepared meals with a choice of 32 dishes served on silver plates. She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision, spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton, and spent much of her time doing embroidery. Her health declined, perhaps through porphyria or lack <b>of</b> <b>exercise,</b> <b>and</b> by the 1580s, she had severe rheumatism in her limbs, rendering her lame.|$|E

25|$|Stress often manifests in {{physical}} ailments, including behavioral {{changes such as}} poor dietary choices, lack <b>of</b> <b>exercise,</b> <b>and</b> sleep deprivation. Survivors, including some who lost homes, villages, and family members, were found likely to face mental health and physical challenges. Much of the stress came from lack of information and from relocation.|$|E

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this {{systematic}} review was to summarize, structure and evaluate the findings on automatic evaluations <b>of</b> <b>exercising.</b> Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported measuring automatic evaluations <b>of</b> <b>exercising</b> with an implicit measure and assessed some kind <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> variable. Fourteen nonexperimental and six experimental studies (out of a total N = 1, 928) were identified and rated by two independent reviewers. The main study characteristics were extracted and the grade of evidence for each study evaluated. First, results revealed a large heterogeneity in the applied measures to assess automatic evaluations <b>of</b> <b>exercising</b> <b>and</b> the <b>exercise</b> variables. Generally, small to large-sized significant relations between automatic evaluations <b>of</b> <b>exercising</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> variables were identified {{in the vast majority}} of studies. The review offers a systematization of the various examined <b>exercise</b> variables <b>and</b> prompts to differentiate more carefully between actually observed exercise behavior (proximal <b>exercise</b> indicator) <b>and</b> associated physiological or psychological variables (distal exercise indicator). Second, a lack of transparent reported reflections on the differing theoretical basis leading to the use of specific implicit measures was observed. Implicit measures should be applied purposefully, taking into consideration the individual advantages or disadvantages of the measures. Third, 12 studies were rated as providing first-grade evidence (lowest grade of evidence), five represent second-grade and three were rated as third-grade evidence. There is a dramatic lack of experimental studies, which are essential for illustrating the cause-effect relation between automatic evaluations <b>of</b> <b>exercising</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> investigating under which conditions automatic evaluations <b>of</b> <b>exercising</b> influence behavior. Conclusions about the necessity <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> interventions targeted at the alteration of automatic evaluations <b>of</b> <b>exercising</b> should therefore not be drawn too hastily...|$|R
25|$|Holsinger has {{consistently}} aired concerns about childhood obesity, {{pushing for a}} limit on junk food in schools, lobbying and educating for the promotion <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> improvements of school nutrition. He included this {{as one of his}} highest priorities at his confirmation hearing. He said he supported banning mass media advertising of junk food geared to children.|$|E
25|$|Housepets, {{particularly}} {{dogs and}} cats in industrialized societies, are also highly susceptible to obesity. Overweight pets {{have been shown to}} be at a higher risk of developing diabetes, liver problems, joint pain, kidney failure, and cancer. Lack <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> high-caloric diets are considered to be the primary contributors to pet obesity.|$|E
25|$|Humans use sweat {{thermoregulation}} {{for body}} heat removal, particularly {{to remove the}} heat produced during exercise. Moderate dehydration as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> heat is reported to impair cognition. These impairments can start after body mass lost that is greater than 1%. Cognitive impairment, particularly due to heat and exercise {{is likely to be}} due to loss of integrity to the blood brain barrier. Hyperthermia also can lower cerebral blood flow, and raise brain temperature.|$|E

25|$|A stroke {{can also}} reduce people's general fitness. Reduced fitness can reduce {{capacity}} for rehabilitation {{as well as}} general health. Physical exercises {{as part of a}} rehabilitation program following a stroke appear safe. Cardiorespiratory fitness training that involves walking in rehabilitation can improve speed, tolerance and independence during walking, and may improve balance. There are inadequate long-term data about the effects <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> training on death, dependence and disability after a stroke. The future areas of research may concentrate on the optimal exercise prescription and long term health benefits of exercise. The effect of physical training on cognition also may be studied further.|$|E
25|$|Experts on {{the ground}} in Japan agree that mental health {{challenges}} are the most significant issue. Stress, such as that caused by dislocation, uncertainty and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. So even if radiation risks are low, people are still concerned and worried. Behavioral changes can follow, including poor dietary choices, lack <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> sleep deprivation, all of which can have long-term negative health consequences. People who lost their homes, villages and family members, and even just those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress. Much of the damage was really the psychological stress of not knowing and of being relocated, according to U.C. Berkeley's McKone.|$|E
25|$|The maximum safe ppO2 in a {{breathing}} gas depends on exposure time, the level <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> {{the security of}} the breathing equipment being used. It is typically between 100 kPa (1 bar) and 160 kPa (1.6 bar); for dives of less than three hours it is commonly considered to be 140 kPa (1.4 bar), although the U.S. Navy has been known to authorize dives with a ppO2 of as much as 180 kPa (1.8 bar). At high ppO2 or longer exposures, the diver risks oxygen toxicity which may result in a seizure. Each breathing gas has a maximum operating depth that is determined by its oxygen content. For therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy partial pressures of 2.8 bar are commonly used in the chamber, but there is no risk of drowning if the occupant loses consciousness.|$|E

25|$|A fastidious dresser, Caruso took {{at least}} two baths a day and enjoyed good food and convivial company. He forged a {{particularly}} close bond with his Met and Covent Garden colleague Antonio Scotti– an amiable and stylish baritone from Naples. Caruso was superstitious and habitually carried several good-luck charms {{with him when he}} sang. He played cards for relaxation and sketched friends, other singers and musicians. His wife, Dorothy said that by the time she knew him, her husband's favorite hobby was compiling scrapbooks. He also amassed a valuable collection of rare postage stamps, coins, watches and antique snuffboxes. Caruso was a heavy smoker of strong Egyptian cigarettes, too. This deleterious habit, combined with a lack <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> the punishing schedule of performances that Caruso willingly undertook season after season at the Met, {{may have contributed to the}} persistent ill-health which afflicted the last year of his life.|$|E
25|$|After 1554 {{he became}} the city physician. In {{addition}} to his duties there, and apart from a few journeys to foreign countries, and annual summer botanical journeys in his native land, and illnesses, {{he was able to}} devote himself to research and writing. His expeditions frequently involved visits to mountainous country, below the snow-line). Although primarily for purposes of botanical collection, he also extolled mountain climbing for the sake <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> enjoyment of the beauties of nature. In 1541 he prefixed to his treatise on milk and milk products, Libellus de lacte et operibus lactariis a letter addressed to his friend Jacob Avienus (Vogel) of Glarus on the wonders to be found among the mountains, declaring his love for them, and his firm resolve to climb at least one mountain every year, not only to collect flowers, but in order to exercise his body. In 1555 he issued his narrative Descriptio Montis Fracti sive Montis Pilati of his excursion to the Gnepfstein (1920m), the lowest point in the Pilatus chain.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{dancing is}} a strong {{influence}} {{in many of the}} books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and At School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, and to teach each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself had come into contact with the English Folk Dance Society and realised that the dances were not so simple after all. The books written from this time for the next six years or so, until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) depict members of the EFDS hierarchy with affection and almost reverence. It seems that something happened to spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, certainly not in such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in An Abbey Champion (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to Worthing and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some sixty miles, but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Caroline Daking) may have objected to the way they were being portrayed. Oxenham never lost the love of folk dancing itself, however, and always shows it as a healthy form <b>of</b> <b>exercise,</b> <b>and</b> a way of lifting oneself out of depression.|$|E

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the follow-up, all the patients were re-educated in the field of general principles of functional insulin therapy. With regard to glucose control, an individual approach for each patient was used, that took into consideration the type of the training (aerobic, resistance, intermittent intensive aerobic), the sequence <b>of</b> the <b>exercises,</b> <b>and</b> the relative proportion of different forms <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> (Sigal et al. 2013). During the training sessions, performing resistance exercise before aerobic exercise was preferred (Sigal et al. 2013, Yardley et al. 2012).
