Techniques used for measuring the energy consumption <b>of</b> <b>office</b> plug <b>loads,</b> and efforts for saving energy by using this equipment more rationally and efficiently are identified and categorized. Popular methods and techniques for energy metering are discussed, together with efforts to classify and benchmark office equipment. Our study reveals that many issues are still open in this domain, including more accurate, diverse and meaningful energy audits for longer time periods, taking into account device profiles, occupant behavior and environmental context. Finally, there is a need for a global consensus on benchmarking and performance metrics, as well as a need for a coordinated worldwide activity for gathering, sharing, analyzing, visualizing and exposing all the silos of information relating to plug loads in offices and commercial buildings...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of high demand charges and time of use energy rates by electric utilities has attracted engineers and building owners to various peak shaving strategies. Gas chillers and thermal energy storage are two technologies that have been updated and are generally thought to be competing in the market place. The combination of these two strategies into one competitively priced product {{is the goal of}} the Gas Research Institute/American Gas Association project. The analysis phase is presented in this report. The economic analysis consisted <b>of</b> <b>office</b> building <b>load</b> and equipment simulations in ESAS, thermal storage sizing and strategy, installed costs of chillers and heat rejection equipment, and utility rate inputs. Maintenance and replacement costs during a 25 year plant life are included. A standard electric centrifugal chiller is used as a base case. The results indicate that the engine-driven thermal storage system can be economically attractive due to lower first cost than gas chillers of the same rated capacity. Electric-drive thermal storage, engine-driven thermal storage and engine-driven chillers are each competitive under different utility rate structures. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Herman Miller, Inc., and Legrand North America, an {{innovative}} manufacturer of electrical and network infrastructure solutions, announced a strategic alliance designed {{to broaden the}} reach of energy management strategies to fuel the adoption of flexible, sustainable spaces, ultimately reducing real estate and building operating costs while improving worker productivity. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, technology from Herman Miller’s Convia, Inc. subsidiary is embedded into Wiremold wire and cable management systems from Legrand. These include modular power and lighting distribution systems, floor boxes, poke-thru devices and architectural columns, which provide flexible, accessible power distribution to building owners and managers. Convia technology integrates a facility's power delivery and other infrastructure and technology applications, including lighting, HVAC, and occupancy and daylight harvesting sensors into an energy efficient, easy-to manage platform. Under the new alliance, “Convia-enabled” Wiremold systems enhanced this capability by adding control and monitoring <b>of</b> <b>office</b> plug <b>loads</b> (the amount <b>of</b> energy drawn by devices from an electrical outlet) and lighting loads. The “Convia-enabled” Wiremold offering provides a truly integrated control solution for end-to-end power applications.|$|R
