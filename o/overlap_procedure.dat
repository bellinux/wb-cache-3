40|$|The whole-genome shotgun (WGS) {{assembly}} {{technique has}} been remarkably successful {{in efforts to}} determine the sequence of bases {{that make up a}} genome. WGS assembly begins with a large collection of short fragments that have been selected at random from a genome.

We report on a set of procedures that (1) corrects most of the sequencing errors, (2) changes quality values accordingly, and (3) produces a list of “overlaps”, i. e., pairs of reads that plausibly come from overlapping parts of the genome.

40|$|Abstract: It is demonstrated, using {{transportation}} theory, {{that controlled}} selection {{can be used}} to solve the following sampling problem. Sample units are to be selected with probability proportional to size for two designs, both one unit per stratum, denoted as D 1 and D 2, with generally different stratifications. The goal of the problem is to simultaneously select the sample units for the two designs in a manner which maximizes the expected number of units that are in both samples. The procedure differs from previous <b>overlap</b> <b>procedures</b> in that it yields a better overlap, but is only applicable when the two samples can be selected simultaneously.

Muscle spindles were constantly present in the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles.

Other, inconstant proprioceptors included tendon endings, Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, paciniform and lamellated endings. Topologically, the endings other than spindles were extra-muscular, so that the overall pattern of proprioceptive innervation resembled that of skeletal muscle in general. Lingual nerve section was without apparent effect on the proprioceptors. Section of the hypoglossal nerve at its point of entry into the tongue caused severe depletiion of ipsilateral proprioceptors and of fusimotor nerves.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 In this thesis, {{a digital}} {{computer}} method for locating transmission line towers is presented. The computer program selects {{the position of}} both angle and tangent type towers for a given ground profile. This selection will provide a minimum cost per foot of transmission line {{in terms of the}} average costs associated with the basic tower types only. Basically, this computer program consists of a mathematical simulation of the established manual 'Template Method' for representing the conductor sag characteristics with respect to a ground profile of the existing terrain features. The constraints imposed by the allowable conductor swing and tower side forces are investigated for violation as each span is determined by the computer. The foregoing features plus the ability to determine them rapidly with alternative tower selections are the major advantages of this computer program. The program consists of the following distinct algorithms to perform the general functions discussed below: 1) Locate the conductor position in such a manner that a specified minimum ground clearance is not violated in any span length. 2) Locate a tower at the best location on the given ground profile to support the above chosen conductor span. 3) Classify the tower type by examining the uplift condition, the conductor swing angle, the horizontal and vertical tower loads, and the position of angle towers. 4) Calculate the tower cost per unit distance covered for each span. The choice of towers and their location is determined by an iterative procedure that examines successively each tower type. An <b>overlapping</b> <b>procedure</b> is also used to avoid a span length that would be too short. The program was tested with a section of ground profile containing an obstruction and a void area. The results have been plotted and shown in this thesis...|$|R

The optimization of complex shape silencing systems is generally a time-consuming operation, which {{must be carried out}} by means of concurrent experimental measurements and numerical simulations. This paper describes the development and application of different non-linear models: a coupled 1 D-multiD model and a coupled 1 D-quasi- 3 D model, to predict the silencer behavior in the time and frequency domains. Second order time and space discretization were adopted in the 3 D and quasi- 3 D approaches, whereas specific coupling strategies were developed to realize the interface between them and the 1 D model. In particular, since the 3 D relies on a collocated grid discretization, a Riemann solver based method was developed to realize the coupling with the 1 D code while a cell <b>overlapping</b> <b>procedure</b> was exploited to interface the 1 D code with the quasi- 3 D method in order to fit with the pseudo staggered grid arrangement. Both a white noise and a single impulse boundary conditions have been imposed upstream of the pipe system to excite the wave motion. The integrated 1 D-multiD and the quasi- 3 D approaches were applied to predict the transmission loss of reactive and dissipative mufflers in which the pressure waves can be significantly non-planar, to point out the influence of higher order modes on the acoustic performance. Reverse chambers with extended inlet and outlet and perforates have been investigated, showing the potential of both the hybrid 1 D- 3 D code and the quasi- 3 D code with respect to a simple, fully 1 D model.
