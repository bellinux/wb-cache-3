5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale.

In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed {{as an alternative to}} the Cartesian dualism that plagued popular science. Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to Kant's Critique <b>of</b> <b>Pure</b> Reason.|$|E

5|$|Free {{hydrochloric}} acid was first formally {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles.

5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample <b>of</b> <b>pure</b> heavy water by electrolysis in 1933.|$|E
5|$|However, {{evidence}} {{pointing out}} that the number of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, as well as the fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), support this explanation as one <b>of</b> <b>pure</b> myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the International Union <b>of</b> <b>Pure</b> and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union <b>of</b> <b>Pure</b> and Applied Physics (IUPAP) {{formed a}} Joint Working Party (JWP) aimed at {{assessing}} discoveries and establishing final {{names for the}} elements in question. The party held numerous meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognizing an element and in 1991, they completed the work on assessing discoverer statuses and the party was disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 experiment in Berkeley, followed closely by the June 1970 Dubna experiment; thus, credit for discovery of the element should be shared between the two competing teams.|$|E

5|$|In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of {{international}} scientific bodies International Union <b>of</b> <b>Pure</b> and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union <b>of</b> <b>Pure</b> and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned {{the priority of}} the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of {{the properties of the}} granddaughter of 294Og, 286Fl, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of 294Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of 294Ts via the reaction 249Bk(48Ca,3n), but the short half-life of 249Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to 249Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, it was {{reported}} that one of the few fluorite deposits in Europe located near Chiprovtsi would be developed by a Bulgarian company that had leased the mine for 20 years. The company has invested BGN 14.5 million and aims to extract 150,000 tonnes of raw material and produce 50,000 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>pure</b> fluorite a year. , the company employs 73 miners, all former workers in the closed local mines, and expects their number to reach 150.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of {{rutherfordium}} were produced in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the former Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.

In this paper, one method for judgment of the peak direction <b>of</b> the <b>pure</b> spectra was proposed, where the base line <b>of</b> the <b>pure</b> spectra was drawn by using their histograms and the peak directions were chosen so as to make all <b>of</b> the <b>pure</b> spectra located upwards over the base line. Results of the SOS analysis on the visible hyperspectral images of the mixture composed of two or three chemical components showed that the present method offered the reasonable shape and direction <b>of</b> the <b>pure</b> spectra <b>of</b> its components.
