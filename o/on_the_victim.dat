25|$|Since the 1970s, {{many changes}} have {{occurred}} in the perception of sexual assault {{due in large part to}} the feminist movement and its public characterization of rape as a crime of power and control rather than purely of sex. In some countries the women's liberation movement of the 1970s created the first rape crisis centers. One of the first two rape crisis centers, the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, opened in 1972. It was created to promote sensitivity and understanding of rape and its effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> In 1960 law enforcement cited false reporting rates at 20%.

25|$|Bembenek {{continued}} to insist she was innocent, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to overturn her no contest plea, saying such a plea cannot be withdrawn. In April 2008, Bembenek filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court, seeking {{a reversal of}} the second murder conviction. Bembenek's attorney pointed to evidence not heard in the original trial, including ballistics tests matching the murder bullets to the gun owned by Fred Schultz, male DNA found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> evidence the victim had been sexually assaulted and the eyewitness testimony of the two young sons who said they had seen a heavyset, masked man. Bembenek's petition argued the court needed to clarify whether defendants who plead guilty or no contest have an opportunity to review evidence comparable to the rights of those who plead not guilty. Her appeal was denied in June 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, an ex-foster {{child was}} awarded $30 million by jury trial in California (Santa Clara County) for sexual abuse damages that {{happened}} to him in his foster home from 1995 to 1999. The foster parent, John Jackson, was licensed by the state, {{despite the fact that}} he abused his own wife and son, overdosed on drugs and was arrested for drunken driving. In 2006, Jackson was convicted in Santa Clara County of nine counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child by force, violence, duress, menace and fear, and seven counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14, according to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office. The sex acts that he forced the children in his foster care to perform sent him to prison for 220 years. Later in 2010, Giarretto Institute, the private foster family agency responsible for licensing and monitoring Jackson's foster home and others, was also found to be negligent and liable for 75 percent of the abuse that was inflicted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> and Jackson himself was liable for the rest.|$|E
50|$|The {{doctrine}} is applied {{in all areas}} of torts - intentional torts, negligence, and strict liability cases - as well as in criminal law.

25|$|There {{have been}} several {{instances}} when forensic dentists have made claims, accusations, and guarantees supported by bite mark evaluation that have been proven incorrect through other forensic sciences. DNA analysis has {{shed some light on}} the limitations of bite mark analysis because often the DNA from saliva surrounding the area of the bite mark proves to be a more reliable form of identification. In the case of Mississippi vs. Bourne, the DNA of a suspect excluded them from the crime after a dentist claimed the bite marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> matched the defendant’s teeth. DNA sampling has been included as a task for a forensic odontologist. For a crime scene investigator, taking DNA samples is as common as taking pictures of the scene. In the case of State vs. Krone, the defendant was sentenced to death, which was overturned. Then Krone was later reconvicted and given life in prison. Both convictions were based largely on bite mark evidence, but ten years later DNA evidence surfaced that identified the real killer and Krone was set free.|$|E

Santer commented: [...] "One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years. Chris agreeing to come back for these episodes will enable us to continue showing the long-term consequences of Tony's abuse of Whitney and – I hope – continue to do justice to the issue of child sex abuse."

500|$|Most of {{the sources}} agree that the first murder in January or February 1828 was either that of a miller named Joseph lodging in Hare's house, or Abigail Simpson, a salt seller. The {{historian}} Lisa Rosner considers Joseph the more likely; a pillow was used to smother the victim, while later ones were suffocated by a hand over the nose and mouth. The novelist Sir Walter Scott, who took {{a keen interest in}} the case, also thought the miller was the more likely first victim, and highlighted that [...] "there was an additional motive to reconcile them to the deed", as Joseph was suffering from a fever and had become delirious. Hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger would be bad for business. Hare again turned to Burke and, after providing their victim with whisky, Hare suffocated Joseph while Burke lay across the upper torso to restrict movement. They again took the corpse to Knox, who this time paid £10. Rosner considers the method of murder to be ingenious: Burke's weight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> stifled movement—and thus the ability to make noise—while it also prevented the chest from expanding should any air get past Hare's suffocating grip. In Rosner's opinion, the method would have been [...] "practically undetectable until the era of modern forensics".|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. But I hope by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody.

500|$|The game {{is set in}} 1947 Los Angeles, and {{the open}} world was {{modelled}} accordingly. To model the city, the developers used aerial photographs taken by photographer Robert Spence. The team also used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, {{as well as the}} location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919. In addition to recreating the city as it was in 1947, all of the in-game cases that the developers worked upon were each inspired in some part by the actual real-life crimes that the city's media reported on during that year. Each of the game's cases features at least a few of the real-life elements that were reported in newspaper articles of that time, with one example of a case that developers found inspiration for being the [...] "Red Lipstick Murder". The case, part of the game's Homicide Desk, is based upon the facts and elements that were mentioned in articles about the real-life, unsolved murder of Jeanne French, a woman who was found dead in exactly the same conditions as the victim of the in-game case is found in, including the M.O. used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> the state the body was left in, the lipstick message found on the body, and the initial suspect being the victim's husband, yet the in-game case differs from this in that it is closed by the main protagonist and not becoming a cold case towards the end of its investigation.|$|E

500|$|K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow state: [...] "An {{important}} vulnerability factor, therefore, for {{the abuse}} of psychiatry, is the subjective nature of the observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends." [...] The concerns about political abuse of psychiatry as a tactic of controlling dissent have been regularly voiced by American psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, and he mentioned that these authors, who correctly emphasized the value-laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and the subjective character of psychiatric classifications, failed to accept the role of psychiatric power. Musicologists, drama critics, art historians, and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications; however, lacking state-legitimated power over persons, their classifications do not lead to anyone's being deprived of property, liberty, or life. For instance, plastic surgeon's classification of beauty is subjective, but the plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without the patient's consent, therefore, there cannot be any political abuse of plastic surgery. The bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment. What transforms coercion into therapy are physicians diagnosing the person's condition a [...] "illness," [...] declaring the intervention they impose <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> a [...] "treatment," [...] and legislators and judges legitimating these categorizations as [...] "illnesses" [...] and [...] "treatments." [...] In the same way, physician-eugenicists advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons {{as a form of}} treatment for both society and patient long before the Nazis came to power. Szasz argued that the spectacle of the Western psychiatrists loudly condemning Soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy. Psychiatric abuse, such as people usually associated with practices in the former USSR, was connected not with the misuse of psychiatric diagnoses, but with the political power built into the social role of the psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike. Psychiatrically and legally fit subjects for involuntary mental hospitalization had always been [...] "dissidents." [...] It is the contents and contours of dissent that has changed. Before the American Civil War, dissent was constituted by being a Negro and wanting to escape from slavery. In Soviet Russia, dissent was constituted by wanting to [...] "reform" [...] Marxism or emigrate to escape from it. As Szasz put it, [...] "the classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as Negroes was scientific, in the sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks. But that did not prevent the [...] "abuse" [...] of such racial classification, because (what we call) its abuse was, in fact, its use." [...] The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the [...] "Therapeutic State", a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed ("cured") through pseudomedical interventions. Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.|$|E

40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{deals with}} the topic of {{collective}} memory in Latin America. It analyzes {{the role of the}} Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica (CNMH) in the construction of collective memory and concludes that it can be understood as a new approach to peace building. The thesis is divided into three parts: first it gives a theoretical background about the concept of collective memory. The second part deals with collective memory in the Southern Cone of Latin America and shows recent developments in the field. The third part turns to the Colombian case study. Here the Colombian conflict is shortly explained and the CNMH tasks are presented. Thereafter the discussion follows, which concludes that the construction of collective memory can be understood as a peace-building tool. In this context the focus of <b>the</b> CNMH <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> is explained. <b>The</b> focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> in <b>the</b> construction of collective memories about the Colombian conflict serves as a tool to relieve them from the psychological burden that presses on their shoulders due to the experienced violence. In addition <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> serve as a common denominator in memory, since by <b>the</b> focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>the</b> actual cause of the conflict, political and societal polarization, is taken out of the focus of the public commemoration process. In addition to that, by <b>the</b> focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims,</b> <b>the</b> CNMH registers civil society’s voices and ensures that they are heard. By giving civilians a greater level of participation in the public debate, the civil society becomes a third party actor, which is seen as crucial to an enduring peace process...|$|R
