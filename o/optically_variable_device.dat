50|$|An optical {{variable}} device or <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>device</b> (OVD) is an iridescent {{image that}} exhibits various optical effects such as movement or color changes. OVDs cannot be photocopied or scanned, nor {{can they be}} accurately replicated or reproduced. The OVD is often used as a security device and anti-counterfeiting measure on money, credit cards and government issued identification cards. OVDs can be created {{through a combination of}} printing and embossing.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, the Reserve Bank of Australia issued $10 {{notes in}} plastic. The {{polypropylene}} polymer banknotes were produced by Note Printing Australia, {{to commemorate the}} bicentenary of European settlement in Australia. These notes contained a transparent [...] "window" [...] with a diffractive <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>device</b> (DOVD) image of Captain James Cook as a security feature. Australian banknotes were {{the first in the}} world to use such features. All current Australian banknotes also contain Microprinting for further security.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{printing}} process via hot embossing of either grating or micro-mirror microstructures {{has been demonstrated}} in thermoplastic acrylic lacquer. Embossing experiments were performed in the temperature range 100 - 150 °C and at 80 kN force. The range of microstructures has included a dot-matrix hologram, grating-based <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>devices</b> (OVDs) and a micro-mirror based OVD. High quality replicas of each type of device have been fabricated using this process. Embossed replicas of grating-based OVDs have shown optical effects including image switching and color movement. For devices based on micro-mirror arrays, the embossed replicas have shown an <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> switch between a portrait and a non-portrait image. Printing via an embossing process offers the possibility of incorporating <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>devices</b> into documents {{without the use of}} hot stamping foil. This is particularly relevant for documents based on polymeric substrates such as credit cards and polymer banknotes...|$|R
50|$|Following a major forgery of Australia's newly {{introduced}} $10 {{notes in}} 1967, Solomon {{was invited to}} a meeting {{about how to make}} more secure bank notes. Given his background in polymer science Solomon's idea was to print the notes on a plastic substrate rather than the traditional paper, and incorporate <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>devices</b> (OVDs) - defined as a device that changes its appearance when you do something external to the note.|$|R
5000|$|The 100 córdoba {{banknote}} {{was also}} revised. The notable differences {{from the first}} issue is that the note was issued on the 100th anniversary of the córdoba currency. Also notable is the wider security thread, a revised registration device, a repositioned serial number, subtle underprint design changes and the commemorative text [...] "1912-2012 Centenario del Cordoba" [...] in pearlescent ink at the left front of the note. The 500 córdoba banknote was also revised. The most notable change for the note is the Bank logo's patch, now a holographic patch instead of an <b>Optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>device</b> patch and a wider security thread.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 forgeries of the Australian $10 note {{were found}} in {{circulation}} and the Reserve Bank of Australia was concerned about an increase in counterfeiting {{with the release of}} colour photocopiers that year. In 1968 the RBA started collaborations with CSIRO, and funds were made available in 1969 for the experimental production of distinctive papers. The insertion into banknotes of an <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>device</b> (OVD) created from diffraction gratings in plastic as a security device was proposed in 1972. The first patent arising from the development of polymer banknotes was filed in 1973. In 1974 the technique of lamination was used to combine materials; the all-plastic laminate eventually chosen was a clear, BOPP laminate, in which OVDs could be inserted without needing to punch holes.|$|E
50|$|The paper design {{included}} a watermark {{in the white}} field of Captain James Cook, the watermark was also used in the last issue of pound banknotes. A metallic strip, first near {{the centre of the}} note, then from 1976 moved to the left side on the obverse of the note. Polymer issue includes a shadow image of the coat of arms which is printed over. Embossing or a raised image in the clear window of wavy lines. Also for this issue fluorescent colouring was added to the serial numbers.

40|$|Measurements of the {{diffraction}} {{characteristics of}} one-dimensional surface-relief gratings of locally varying profile are compared with rigorous diffraction theory. These gratings {{result from the}} superposition of two linear sinusoidal gratings of uniform depth for which the relative phase between the two gratings varies slowly with position. The resultant surface profile exhibits a relatively large-period variation in profile form. The periodic variation in diffraction efficiency that results yields a visual moiré pattern that has interesting asymmetry and polarization properties that alter as the viewing conditions are changed; the gratings can be exploited by diffractive <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>devices</b> for document security...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the anti-counterfeiting performance of <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>devices,</b> the innovative interference security image structures based on metamerism have been developed. In this letter, we show a pair of all-dielectric metameric filters offering a hidden image effect with the color shift at a specific angle of observation. These filters are designed by two materials TiO 2 /SiO 2 based on the different angle color target optimization. The 6 -layer- and 9 -layer stacks are achieved {{and the performance of}} prototype filters prepared by remote plasma sputtering is shown. The color difference index of the experiment is up to 1. 19, which shows good metameric matching effect. ? 2014 Chinese Optics Letters...|$|R
40|$|At {{the past}} optical {{security}} conferences attention {{was focused on}} diffractive structures, e. g. holograms, embossed gratings and thin—film devices, as security elements on valuable documents. The main reasons for this emphasis are, that the iridescent effect of such diffractive <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>devices</b> (OVD’s) can be easily observed by the naked eye and that their fraud-resistance is considered excellent. No {{attention has been paid}} to non—diffractive <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> phenomena like reversible photosensitivity, e. g. luminescence and photochroism. These may be employed in non-diffractive OVD’s which may be readily authenticated and may provide excellent fraud-resistance as well. In order to survey the enormous variety of document security features the library SECURIDAT was compiled from a number of public domain databases. This paper discusses a few security applications of reversible photosensitivity that resulted from a search in SECURIDAT, viz. dual fluorescence with longwave remanence, thermochroism, stimulation of mixed inorganic phosphors and photochroism...|$|R
50|$|In both 1993 and 2001, the Central Bank of Kuwait issued {{commemorative}} 1-dinar polymer banknotes {{to celebrate}} its Liberation from Iraq. The first commemorative note, dated 26 February 1993, was issued {{to celebrate the}} second anniversary of the Liberation. The front features the map of the State of Kuwait, the emblem of Kuwait and on the left and right side of the note is the list of nations that assisted in its Liberation, in both English and Arabic. The second commemorative note, dated 26 February 2001, was issued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Liberation. One feature from the note is an <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>device</b> (OVD) patch that shows a fingerprint, a reference to the victims of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Even though they were denominated as 1 dinar, both of the commemorative notes state that they were not legal tender.|$|E
40|$|The hot {{embossing}} of grating-based optically variable devices {{has been}} demonstrated in biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP). Embossing of the grating structures was examined over a range of temperatures (80 - 155 °C) at 135 kN force. However, only at temperatures above the glass transition temperature, Tg, was high quality replication achieved over a full embossing area of 80 × 80 mm. The embossing of several different types of <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>device</b> has been examined including portrait, non-portrait and 3 -dimensional images.

5000|$|The Cupón Diario (daily cupón) {{is drawn}} daily (Monday to Friday) as a five-digit number and a Series number. Each ticket costs €1.50. Prizes can vary, {{based on how}} many of the five digits a {{particular}} cupón has, or the sum of all numbers on the cupón and the Series number. The digits have to be in order to win, from left to right. The lowest prize is effectively a refund of the €1.50 that was used to purchase a ticket. ONCE lottery tickets are sold on the streets by authorised cupón sellers, as well as in ONCE kiosks. These are clearly identified by the word [...] "ONCE" [...] and can be found along the high street, at airports, and in shopping malls.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that one of the basic {{functions}} of security holograms is the maximal complication of their non-authorized reproduction, in other words – counterfeiting. To solve the problem, concealed images that can be observed only under special conditions are placed into a structure of the hologram. A popular way to place concealed image in Diffractive <b>Optically</b> <b>Variable</b> Image <b>Device</b> (DOVID) is integration into DOVID's structure of a Concealed Laser-Readable Image (CLRI). Traditionally CLRI is a 2 D Computer-Generated Hologram (2 D CGH), which is a digitized Interference Fringe Data (IFD) structure, computed under the scheme of Fourier-hologram synthesis. Such hologram provides inspection of the second level with portable laser reading devices. While it is being read, two (+/– 1 order of diffraction) identical images are formed. It is very interesting to achieve a CGH, which restores the image only in one diffractive order or two different images in + 1 and – 1 orders of diffraction...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the use of}} micro- or nano-patterned {{surfaces}} is {{well established}} in wide fields of science and in numerous applications in the industry. Periodic surface-relief profiles with dimensions in the wavelength range of the light can act as diffractive optical elements but moreover, the regular pattern can also modify physical properties of a material’s surface. In this dissertation, {{we focus on the}} patterning of surfaces by lithography techniques. The useful structured areas are several square centimeters (4 - 100 cm 2) large and the dimensions of the -periodic surface-relief structures are in the range of hundreds of nanometers to micrometers (= 160 nm - 10 m). We present different lithographic methods, in particular interference lithography, to originate the structures in photoresist. We introduce novel setups for multiple beam interference, interference in dense media and sequentially exposures with controlled phaseshift. A way to realize arbitrarily profiles is to use the Fourier Synthesis (FS). The desired profile is decomposed in a series of sinusoidal functions having a determined amplitude, phase and harmonic number, which is an integer number of the base period of the desired structure. The sum of these sinusoidal functions, aka Fourier components, gives an approximation of the desired profile. Thus, the more components are added, the better becomes the approximation. But what happens when the harmonic number is not exactly an integer? Through the dissertation, we cover all the aspects, theoretical as well as practical, of the FS. We present a setup that allows to expose sequentially Fourier components and demonstrate the potential of the FS technology by three examples. These consist in saw-tooth profiles, micro-prisms and a fan-out function profile. The profiles were realized with ten Fourier components with structure’s period between 1. 8 m and 4. 7 m. We investigate also one- as well as two- dimensionally profiles for <b>Optically</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Devices</b> (OVDs) for visual security against counterfeiting, which exhibit interesting color and polarization properties. Part of them was realized by using the moiré phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} Computer-Generated Rainbow Holograms (CGRHs), which can restore the 3 D images under white light. They {{are devoted to}} include in Diffractive <b>Optically</b> <b>Variable</b> Image <b>Devices</b> (DOVIDs) that are {{currently}} widely used for security needs. CGRHs prevent counterfeiting due {{to the complexity of}} recreation, on the one hand, and allow the simple identification at the first (visual) level of verification, on the other hand. To record it, the Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) is used. As recently proved, this method is a most promising for multi-level optical-digital security devices using chalcogenide glasses as resists. The CGRH computation process is conventionally divided by two parts: synthesizing and recording. On the synthesis stage, firstly, the geometrical and optical constants of recording scheme are determined; secondly, the basic parameters accounting for discretization of Interferogram Data (ID) in hologram plane are defined and, finally, the calculation of the ID - the array of Bipolar Intensity (BI) values - is carried out. This calculation is performed separately in each independent horizontal slice of object space and hologram plane. On the recording stage, suitable quantization parameters are chosen and transformation of ID into the multilevel rectangle data appropriate for EBL is accomplished. The investigations on optimization of synthesis and recording of the multilevel CGRHs of 3 D images integrated in Polygrams are presented here. So the rules for definition of the appropriate discretization parameters were finding out. Advantages of using non-linear quantization that implies condensing of quantization levels near the BI zero were explored. The random deviation of location and direction of elemental hybrid radiating area was applied. Practical applications of the method developed were made using chalcogenide semiconductors of various As-S-Se compositions...|$|R

40|$|Deep X-ray surveys using Chandra {{have found}} the highest density of AGN on the sky (˜ 5000 deg- 2) and {{are thought to be}} the most {{efficient}} means of finding AGN. However, a recent two-epoch variability analysis of the HDF-N found comparable sky densities of sources with variable nuclei, which strongly suggest the presence of an AGN. There is only a small amount of overlap between the <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> (OV) and X-ray selected AGN, which indicates that the majority of these <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> selected AGN are underluminous in the X-ray band. In this poster we investigate the nature of the X-ray faint, <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> GOODS source population. We employ X-ray stacking techniques to measure the average X-ray photometric and spectroscopic properties of these sources. A comparison between the (stacked) X-ray undetected and X-ray detected OV sources shows the hardness ratios of the two populations differ with redshift. The X-ray undetected OV population appears to get harder with redshift, while the hardness ratios of the X-ray detected OV sources remain relatively unchanged. This is consistent with the X-ray undetected OV population being comprised of moderately Compton thick sources (NHI ˜ 2 × 1024 cm- 2) where, at higher redshifts, the > 10 keV photons that can penetrate this column {{can be seen in the}} hard (2 - 8 keV) X-ray band. In addition, we combine the optical spectra, when available, to look for the presence of high ionization lines that are indicative of AGN.
