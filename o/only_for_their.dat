Some hunted dodos <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters {{had to be careful}} not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer {{is consumed}} can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E

5|$|The Georgetown University men's {{basketball}} team {{is perhaps the}} most well-known Hoya program. Georgetown's first intercollegiate men's {{basketball team}} was formed in 1907. Former Georgetown great Patrick Ewing is the head coach. The Hoyas historically have been well regarded not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> team success, but also for their ability to generate players that after graduation succeed both on the court, such as Patrick Ewing, and off, such as Paul Tagliabue and Henry Hyde. The team has reached the NCAA Tournament Final Four five times including the 1984 national championship, and has won the Big East Tournament seven times, and has also won or shared the Big East regular season title seven times.|$|E
5|$|Traces {{of onions}} {{recovered}} from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions {{were used as}} far back as 5000 BCE, not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> flavour, but the bulb's durability to store and transport. Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb, viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life. Onions were used in Egyptian burials, as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Cm(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Cm3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and adenosine triphosphate. Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> detection, but also for studying the interactions between the Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is unlike {{that of any other}} carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E

25|$|With no {{intermediate}} {{chain of}} command, army headquarters was weighed down with minor administrative details. Divisional commanders were responsible not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> active formations, {{but also for}} internal security and volunteer troops within their respective areas. On mobilisation, divisional staffs took the field, leaving no-one to maintain the local administration. Supporting services were insufficient, and many troops intended for the field force were not moved from their old stations into the areas of their new divisional command. These defects became clear during the First World War, and lead to further reorganisation.|$|E

25|$|The {{form and}} content of the Review changed fairly {{dramatically}} in the years after Simons' forced departure, with Kerr and his new chief lieutenant, Mary Marcy, soliciting material written on issues of the day by its working class readers. Shorter articles giving timely news of the contemporary class struggle, profusely illustrated, displaced long and sometimes dreary essays notable <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> lack of passion. Slick magazine paper began to be used for the better reproduction of photographs, while provocative pictorial covers were henceforth employed. The tone of the magazine became more vigorous and radical.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the pancarte was recopied after {{a number}} of {{additions}} had been made to the original, and this could occasionally lead to errors in chronology, as the additions to the original might have been made without respect to the actual order of the donations.

25|$|The Muscovy duck can be crossed with mallards {{in captivity}} to produce hybrids, known as mulard duck ("mule duck") {{because they are}} sterile.

Conversely, though crossing Mallard drakes with Muscovy hens is possible, the offspring are neither desirable for meat nor for egg production.|$|E
