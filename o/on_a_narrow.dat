5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> band of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band samplers were highly valued, often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations. These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to use {{constraint}} programming techniques for solving first-order constraints over the reals (i. e., formulas in the first-order predicate language over {{the structure of the}} real numbers). More specifically, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrowing</b> operator that implements an arbitrary notion of consistency for atomic constraints over the reals (e. g., box-consistency), the paper provides <b>a</b> <b>narrowing</b> operator for firstorder constraints that implements a corresponding notion of first-order consistency, and <b>a</b> solver based <b>on</b> such <b>a</b> <b>narrowing</b> operator. <b>As</b> a consequence, this solver can take over various favorable properties from the field of constraint programming...|$|R
5|$|Few railway tunnels {{exist in}} Victoria, with the {{exception}} of the Melbourne City Loop. The longest tunnel before the opening of the loop was on the Fyansford Cement Works Railway (near Geelong), where a 1300 metre long tunnel existed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> gauge quarry railway. Of those open today the longest is the single track 422 metre long Geelong Tunnel, followed by the double track 385 metre Elphinstone and the 390 metre long Big Hill Tunnels on the Bendigo line. A 154 metre long tunnel also exists on the Healesville line, as well as three tunnels on the suburban Hurstbridge line, and another on the freight lines under Footscray station.|$|E
5|$|Kota Kinabalu {{is located}} on the west coast of Sabah. The city lies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> {{flatland}} between the Crocker Range to the east and the South China Sea to the west. There are six islands off the coast of the city. The largest is Gaya Island, the site of the first British settlement. Approximately 8,000 people live there. The smaller islands, mainly uninhabited, are named Sapi Island, Manukan Island, Sulug Island, Mamutik Island and Sepanggar Island to the north. Sepanggar island is located north of the National Park opposite Sepanggar Bay.|$|E
5|$|Shakti <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> path. As a kshatriya (member of {{the ruler}} class), Kalmashapada {{does not make}} way for Shakti, a brahmin (priestly class). Nevertheless, Shakti refuses to budge. Finally, an enraged Kalmashapada hits Shakti with his whip. In turn, the sage curses the king to wander the forest for 16 years. The sage Vishwamitra, the arch-enemy of Vashishtha who desires to have Kalmashapada as his disciple, sends a rakshasa to possess the king's body. Vishwamitra plots to destroy his enemy's family {{with the help of}} the king. Under the {{influence}} of the rakshasa, the king serves human flesh to a Brahmin, who sets Shakti's curse into effect. The king turns into a cannibalistic rakshasa.|$|E

5|$|Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed {{at least}} 64 {{artillery}} pieces <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the artillery and infantry of the I Russian Corps. In the artillery barrage that lasted until 17:00, {{the forces of}} Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish artillery positions, but every time the charge was bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle {{all the way to}} Górce. Half of the Russian artillery fought an intense artillery duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences. Although the barrage prepared the field for yet another Polish counter-attack, Krukowiecki would not risk it.|$|E
5|$|Gerard {{also had}} an uneasy {{relationship}} with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them {{to give up their}} wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On {{the second day of the}} search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff. Irwin and a crew member escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.|$|E
50|$|Every {{attempt to}} {{establish}} a unified field theory must start, in my opinion, {{from a group of}} transformations which is no less general than that of the continuous transformations of the four coordinates. For we should hardly be successful in looking for the subsequent enlargement of the group for <b>a</b> theory based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> group.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that there are, at least, two sorts of cases where one should not prefer a direct {{inference}} based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> reference class, in particular: cases where the narrower reference class is gerrymandered, and cases where one lacks an evidential basis for forming a precise-valued frequency judgment for the narrower reference class. I here propose (1) that the preceding exceptions exhaust the circumstances where one should not prefer direct inference based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> reference class, and (2) that minimal frequency information for <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> (non-gerrymandered) reference class is sufficient to yield the defeat of a direct inference for a broader reference class. By the application of a method for inferring relatively informative expected frequencies, I argue that the latter claim does not result in an overly incredulous approach to direct inference. The method introduced here permits one to infer a relatively informative expected frequency for a reference class R', given frequency information for a superset of R' and/or frequency information for a sample drawn from R'...|$|R
5|$|Sherman {{attacked}} {{once again}} down the Graveyard Road, with 150 volunteers (nicknamed the Forlorn Hope detachment) {{leading the way}} with ladders and planks, followed by the divisions of Blair and Brig. Gen. James M. Tuttle, arranged in a long column of regiments, hoping to achieve a breakthrough by concentrating their mass <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> front. They were driven back {{in the face of}} heavy rifle fire. Blair's brigades under Cols. Giles A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith made it as far as a ridge 100 yards from Green's Redan, the southern edge of the Stockade Redan, from where they poured heavy fire into the Confederate position, but to no avail. Tuttle's division, waiting its turn to advance, did not have an opportunity to move forward. On Sherman's far right, the division of Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele spent the morning attempting to get into position through a ravine of the Mint Spring Bayou.|$|E
5|$|The brothers' {{efforts to}} recruit the Bani Saqr failed when Zahir bribed the tribe not to back his sons and {{subsequently}} had Uthman imprisoned in Haifa {{for six months}} before exiling him to a village near Safad. Meanwhile, in 1765, Zahir had Haifa demolished and then rebuilt and fortified at a site three kilometers to the southeast in 1769. While the old village was situated on a plain, the new town, which remained a port along the Haifa Bay, was built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> strip of land at the northern foot of Mount Carmel {{to make it easier}} to defend by land. In May 1766, Uthman renewed his rebellion against Zahir with backing from the Druze clans of Galilee, but this coalition was defeated by Zahir near Safad. This conflict expanded to include competing Druze and Shia factions from Mount Lebanon and Jabal Amil, with Emir Mansur Shihab (the Sunni leader of a Druze faction) and the Metawali, Sheikh Qublan, siding with Zahir, while Emir Yusuf Shihab (the leader of another Druze faction) and Sheikh Nasif sided with Uthman. Mediation by Emir Isma'il Shihab of Hasbaya culminated in a successful peace summit near Tyre between the two factions and a reconciliation between Zahir and Uthman, whereby the latter was granted control of Nazareth.|$|E

50|$|Its main {{objective}} was to gain self-government for Wales. The movement {{lost some of its}} impetus following the withdrawal of T. E. Ellis to join the Government in 1892, after which the leadership of Cymru Fydd was taken over by David Lloyd George and Herbert Lewis (MP for Flint Boroughs). Cymru Fydd was re-launched <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower,</b> more political basis.|$|R
50|$|The wing {{was mounted}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrowed</b> pylon which faired {{into the cockpit}} canopy, {{reducing}} interference drag between fuselage and wing. A rubber sprung nose skid, landing wheel and sprung tail-skid completed the undercarriage. A large comfortable cockpit with an upright seat was covered by a canopy made from blown plexiglas, providing excellent visibility but sometimes giving a poor fit.|$|R

In total there are five beaches, including la Grande Plage, and further to the east, Plage Men Dû and Beaumer.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of which view {{the government would}} take was answered in a January 19 memorandum issued jointly by EPA and the Corps for headquarters and field/regional staff who work on the section 404 program, discussed above; the agencies provide a legal interpretation, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> reading of the Court's decision.|$|E
25|$|Farther {{northeast}} is Grand-Vivy Castle <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> outcrop {{between the}} Schiffenensee {{and a small}} stream. This was also {{the site of a}} medieval castle, but this was replaced by today's late-Gothic structure with its semicircular stairway tower, and other tower construction. The chapel next to the castle was built in the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|This is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} one of the primary problems with differing gauge systems - gauge incompatibility. However, it means that the narrower gauge network must be built to a structure gauge large enough to accommodate the loading gauge of the wider gauge equipment, negating one of the cost advantages of <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> gauge construction. Additionally, a large wider gauge wagon balanced <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> gauge transporter wagon is not very stable, and is generally restricted to low speeds of 15 mph or so.|$|R
50|$|Pyloroplasty can be {{performed}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrowed</b> or thickened pylorus, but also <b>on</b> <b>a</b> normal pylorus. Pyloroplasty is used to treat those who have complications causing a blockage of the pylorus, commonly peptic ulcers. It also can {{be performed}} on patients {{at high risk for}} gastric or peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Pyloroplasty is almost never performed by itself; it is most commonly paired with another procedure like a vagotomy.|$|R
25|$|Continental Flight 1883, a Boeing 757–200 {{aircraft}} carrying 160 passengers, landed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> unoccupied taxiway {{parallel to}} runway 29 at Newark Liberty International Airport.

Here, the insurrectional patriots of 1844 were executed by a firing squad.|$|E
50|$|The Vel' d'Hiv has {{remained}} a symbol of a wider disquiet, at the broadest level because of the Pétain government which France at first welcomed and then saw deteriorate into an organ of the occupation - often enthusiastically - and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> level by individuals who profited from the occupation and furthered its cause or didn't raise what in retrospect seemed enough objection.|$|R
50|$|Modern thermal desorbers {{can also}} {{accommodate}} two-stage operation, whereby the gas stream from the sorbent tube (typically 100-200 mL) is collected <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> tube {{integral to the}} thermal desorber, called the focusing trap or cold trap. Heating this trap releases the analytes once again, but this time in an even smaller volume of gas (typically 100-200 µL), resulting in improved sensitivity and better GC peak shape.|$|R
