5|$|The Emperor's great-grandmother, Maria I <b>of</b> <b>Portugal,</b> {{had been}} a queen regnant. However, she had been married to her uncle, Pedro III <b>of</b> <b>Portugal</b> who was a Braganza. This meant that her {{offspring}} would continue {{to belong to the}} House of Braganza. Emperor Pedro II was the last of the direct male line in Brazil descended from Dom Afonso I, first king <b>of</b> <b>Portugal</b> and founder, in 1139, of the dynasty which headed the Brazilian Empire. There were two other male Braganzas, albeit living abroad: Pedro II's half-brother Rodrigo Delfim Pereira and his cousin Miguel, Duke of Braganza. Both were barred from the line of succession, however. The former because he was an illegitimate son, and the latter because he was a foreigner and not a descendant of the first Brazilian Emperor, Pedro I.|$|E

5|$|With the {{invasion}} <b>of</b> <b>Portugal</b> by Napoleon's imperial army in 1807, the Portuguese Royal Court fled to Brazil, establishing {{the capital of}} the Portuguese Monarchy and Empire in Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the Portuguese state of Brazil was elevated to a kingdom, thus receiving the same status as the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Portugal</b> and the Algarves. The whole of the Portuguese Monarchy became then the United Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Portugal,</b> Brazil and the Algarves. To reflect the change of the status of the Portuguese Monarchy, the Prince Regent John (future King John VI, at that time still reigning in name of his mother, Queen Mary I) established a new Royal coat of arms, where the Portuguese shield (representing Portugal and the Algarves) charged a blue-filled yellow armillary sphere (representing Brazil) surmounted by the same beret-bearing five-arched crown. The new coat of arms replaced the previous one in the Portuguese flags.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown <b>of</b> <b>Portugal</b> on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king <b>of</b> <b>Portugal</b> and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Badajoz was {{captured}} by Alfonso IX of León on 19 March 1230. Shortly after its conquest, {{in the time of}} Alfonso X the Wise of Castile, a bishopric see was established and work was initiated on the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. In 1336, during the reign of Alfonso XI of Castile, the troops of King Afonso IV <b>of</b> <b>Portugal</b> besieged the city. However, soon afterwards, the Castilian-Leonese troops, which included Pedro Ponce de León the Elder and Juan Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y Coronel, second lord of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and son of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, defeated the troops of Alfonso IV in the Battle of Villanueva de Barcarrota. Their victory forced the king <b>of</b> <b>Portugal</b> to desert the city and it fell into neglect.|$|E

5|$|By now {{the castle}} was in disrepair, and the bailey and the {{earthworks}} {{were covered with}} a combination of pigsties, cabbage gardens and a skittle alley used by a local pub. Local tradition states that the visiting Queen <b>of</b> <b>Portugal,</b> Maria II <b>of</b> <b>Portugal,</b> complained about the condition of the site to Queen Victoria, which resulted in Hugh Percy, the 3rd Duke of Northumberland and the castle's constable, landscaping the area to create a public park between 1840 and 1842 at a cost of £3,000. The south gatehouse was repaired, and the remains of the north gatehouse turned into stables. Hugh sold off his local interests in 1864 and the Northumberlands' control of the post of constable lapsed with the death of his brother Algernon Percy, the 4th duke, the following year. The post lay vacant until in 1883 the local Member of Parliament, Hardinge Giffard, was appointed as the constable by the then Prince Edward in his capacity as the Duke of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Despite the United Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Portugal,</b> Brazil and the Algarves {{ceased to}} exist in 1822, when Brazil became independent, its coat of arms {{continued}} to be used, inclusive in flags, until the death of John VI in 1826. From then on, the previous coat of arms, without the armillary sphere, became in use again.|$|E
