Jonny Greenwood wrote on Radiohead's official forum: [...] "We're kind of pissed off about it, to be honest... Work we've not finished, being released in this sloppy way, ten {{weeks before the}} real version is even available... It's not [...] I'm pissed off about, it's just the situation I guess. It's stolen work, fer fuck's sake." [...] Colin Greenwood said the leak was [...] "like being photographed with one sock on {{when you get out}} <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning," [...] but expressed dismay at the cease-and-desist orders sent by label EMI to radio stations and fan sites playing the leaked tracks, saying: [...] "Don't record companies usually pay thousands of dollars to get stations to play their records? Now they're paying money to stations not to play them." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Shakira getting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of a}} full-moon night. Her nails begin to grow and she is shown lacing a pair of boots. Shakira then enters a closet, {{which leads to the}} inside of a {{glittering}} ruby-red cave, where she begins dancing wearing a black asymmetric bodysuit. The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard. Shakira explained the usage of the golden cage in the video, saying that [...] "I just wanted to express what it feels like for a she-wolf to be in captivity. To be in a golden cage. I think I've been in a golden cage most of my life. And now not anymore". The setting changes and Shakira is seen performing a dance routine in a club with many back-up dancers. A wolf is also shown walking in the club and transforming into a woman. Near {{to the end of the}} video, Shakira dances on a rooftop with a backdrop resembling San Francisco. As the song ends, she falls backwards from the roof and lands in her closet. The video ends with Shakira lying back in her bed and smiling as thunder cracks.|$|E
2500|$|The sleeper serves {{mainly to}} keep the wearer warm at night, {{even in the absence}} of {{blankets}} and bed covers. [...] The sleeper covers the entire body except for the head (except in certain cases where a hood is present) and (in most cases) hands (except in cases where a sleeper has attached mitts, mostly on infant sizes), where it is snug at the neck and wrists. [...] The use of a zipper closure in place of buttons or snap fasteners also further retains warmth by eliminating drafts. [...] This is especially important for infants, for whom loose blankets may pose a safety hazard (including increasing the risk of SIDS), and possibly for older children, who may still be too young to be relied upon {{to keep the}}ir own sleepwear or bed covers adjusted so as to prevent exposure to the air of bare skin. [...] This is reflected in advertisements by blanket sleeper manufacturers, which often emphasize that their garments [...] "can't be kicked off", or that [...] "no other covers are needed". The permanently attached feet can also be a beneficial feature for children who are prone to get out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning before their parents are awake, and are too young to be relied upon to put on slippers or other footwear to keep their feet warm, as well as for adults who find putting on, and/or wearing socks in bed too bothersome, yet still want their feet covered when getting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. [...] Blanket sleepers without feet allow more room for growth and reduce the possibility of slipping. [...] Also, children with larger or smaller feet find a better fit.|$|E

2500|$|Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) – The {{most common}} cause of vertigo. [...] It is {{typically}} described as a brief, intense sensation of spinning that occurs when there are changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced calcium crystals called otoconia, which are normally found in the utricle and saccule (the otolith organs) and are used to sense movement. If they fall from the utricle and become loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement and cause a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, causing a spinning sensation.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{recording}} did {{not begin}} until April 2010. Friend and Pretty. Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning. He encouraged them to love the work they do, and [...] "... Just get out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, don’t loathe {{the things that you}} actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E

Every hour so increased my abhorrence of him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.
