50|$|An {{adjustable}} spanner (UK, {{and most other}} English-speaking countries) or adjustable wrench (US and Canada) is an <b>open-end</b> <b>wrench</b> with a movable jaw, allowing it {{to be used with}} different sizes of fastener head (nut, bolt, etc.) rather than just one fastener size, as with a conventional fixed spanner. Several other names are in use, including the US trademark crescent wrench.|$|E
50|$|In North American English, wrench is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called <b>open-end</b> <b>wrench</b> and box-end wrench. In American English, spanner refers to a specialised wrench {{with a series of}} pins or tabs around the circumference. (These pins or tabs fit into the holes or notches cut into the object to be turned.) In American commerce, such a wrench may be called a spanner wrench to distinguish it from the British sense of spanner.|$|E
40|$|A wrench is {{described}} that is usable where limited access normally requires an <b>open-end</b> <b>wrench,</b> but which has substantially the high-torque capacity and small radial clearance {{characteristics of a}} closed-end wrench. The wrench includes a sleeve forming a nut-engageable socket with a gap in its side, and an adaptor forming a socket with a gap in its side, the adaptor closely surrounding the sleeve and extending across {{the gap in the}} sleeve. The sleeve and adaptor have surfaces that become fully engaged when a wrench handle is applied to the adaptor to turn it so as to tighten a nut engaged by the sleeve...|$|E

50|$|McKaig-Hatch was a tool {{manufacturer}} for the automotive industry. The company, based out of Buffalo, New York made economy tools, and produced and supplied the screwdriver, pliers, and <b>open-end</b> <b>wrenches</b> in the pouch tool kits supplied with new Ford and GM cars from the 1930s through the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|In 1904, {{the company}} {{moved to a}} 12000 sq ft {{facility}} in Meadville, Pennsylvania and added nippers, pinchers and <b>open-end</b> <b>wrenches</b> to its product line. George B. DeArment’s two sons, Almon W. and J. Howard DeArment, became partners in the company in 1911 and expanded the product line again to include hammers. In 1923, the company moved again to a 33000 sq ft facility at its current location in Meadville. Four years later, {{the name of the}} company was changed to the Champion-DeArment Tool Company.|$|R
40|$|GWPD 13 —Measuring {{water levels}} {{by use of}} an air line VERSION: 2010. 1 PURPOSE: To measure the depth to the water surface below a {{measuring}} point using the submerged air line method. Materials and Instruments 1. 1 / 8 or 1 / 4 -inch diameter, seamless copper tubing, brass tubing, or galvanized pipe with a suitable pipe tee for connecting an altitude or pressure gauge. Flexible plastic tubing also can be used, but is less desirable. 2. Calibrated altitude or pressure gauge, and spare gauges. Gauges that are filled with either oil or silicone work best and are most durable. 3. Compressed air source and corresponding valve stem, usually a Schrader valve. A tire pump {{can be used on}} shallow wells and piezometers, but a more substantial source of compressed air is needed where depth to water is hundreds of feet. 4. Small <b>open-end</b> <b>wrench</b> 5. Wire or electrician’s tape 6. A steel tape graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet 7. Blue carpenter’s chalk 8. Clean rag 9. Field noteboo...|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} associated with hazardous materials control are numerous and complex. One of these problems involves selecting hand protection which will resist permeation {{for the duration of}} the exposure while maintaining sufficient levels of dexterity and tactility so that the worker can safely and efficiently perform the required task. This study investigated the effect of nine glove combinations on manual dexterity. These included three single glove and six double glove combinations plus the bare hand condition. The subjects performed a nut-bolt-washer assembly-dissassembly task using the Bennett Hand Tool Dexterity Test apparatus. The task required the use of a screw driver, two sizes of <b>open-end</b> <b>wrenches,</b> and an adjustable wrench, along with handling the bolt, nut, and washer while performing the assembly-disassembly task for three different bolt, nut, and washer sizes (1 / 2 ", 5 / 16 ", 1 / 4 "). The response variables measured in the experiment were the time to complete each task and number of errors committed during each task. any of the items handled. model and the Duncan's Multiple Range Test. analysis. The results of the analyses showed that gloves increased the average completion time by 15 to 37 %.

40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section E of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This method of test is an indication of the amount of elasticity that a latex has imparted to an asphalt. This elasticity is an indicator of the percent of latex that has been added to the asphalt. B. APPARATUS 1.
