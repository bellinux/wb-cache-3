5|$|Integer {{powers of}} nonzero complex numbers {{are defined by}} {{repeated}} multiplication or division as above. If i is the imaginary unit and n is an integer, then i'n equals 1, i, −1, or −i, according to whether the integer n is congruent to 0, 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. Because of this, the powers of i are useful for expressing sequences <b>of</b> <b>period</b> 4.|$|E
5|$|Interactions {{with the}} Mesopotamian south grew {{during the second}} half <b>of</b> <b>period</b> F (designated LC4) c. 3600 BC, and an Urukean colony was {{established}} in the city. With the end of Uruk culture c 3000 BC, Tell Brak's Urukean colony was abandoned and deliberately leveled by its occupants. Tell Brak contracted during the following periods H and J, and became limited to the mound. Evidence exists for an interaction with the Mesopotamian south during period H, represented by the existence of materials similar to the ones produced during the southern Jemdet Nasr period. The city remained a small settlement during the Ninevite 5 period, with a small temple and associated sealing activities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} set <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> degree 1 {{continuous}} maps from σ into itself, where σ denotes the space shaped like the letter σ (i. e., a segment {{attached to a}} circle by one of its endpoints). Since the maps under consideration have degree 1, the rotation theory can be used. We show that, when {{the interior of the}} rotation interval contains an integer, then the set <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> (<b>of</b> periodic points of any rotation number) is the set of all integers except maybe 1 or 2. We exhibit degree 1 σ-maps f whose set <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> is a combination of the set <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> a degree 1 circle map and the set <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> a 3 -star (that is, a space shaped like the letter Y). Moreover, we study the set <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> forced by periodic orbits that do not intersect the circuit of σ; in particular, when there exists such a periodic orbit whose diameter, at lifting level, is at least 1, then there exist periodic points <b>of</b> all <b>periods.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|CIS Vancouver and Pac Title created most of {{the visual}} effects, under the overall {{supervision}} of Michael Owens. CIS' work was headed by Geoff Hancock and Pac Title's by Mark Freund. Each studio created around 90 shots. Pac Title focused primarily on 2D imagery; VICON House of Moves handled the motion capture. The effects work consisted mainly of peripheral additions: architecture, vehicles, crowds and furniture. CIS used 3D modeling package Maya to animate city scenes before rendering them in mental ray; they generated matte paintings in Softimage XSI and Maya, and used Digital Fusion for some 2D shots. The team's work began with research into 1928 Los Angeles; they referenced historical photographs and data on the urban core's population density. CIS had to generate mostly new computer models, textures and motion capture because the company's existing effects catalog consisted primarily of modern era elements. CIS supplemented exteriors with skylines and detailed backdrops. They created set extensions digitally and with matte paintings. CIS created city blocks by using shared elements <b>of</b> <b>period</b> architecture that could be combined, rearranged and restacked to make buildings of different widths and heights; that way, the city could look diverse {{with a minimum of}} textural variation. CIS referenced vintage aerial photographs of downtown Los Angeles so shots would better reflect the geography of the city, as Hancock felt it important to have a consistency that would allow audiences to understand and become immersed in the environment.|$|E

5|$|Thorium {{is nearly}} half as dense as uranium and plutonium, and is harder {{than either of}} them. It becomes superconductive below 1.4K. Thorium's melting point of 1750°C is above both those of {{actinium}} (1227°C) and protactinium (1568°C). In the beginning <b>of</b> <b>period</b> 7, from francium to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (as in other periods), {{because the number of}} delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium, leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After thorium, there is a new downward trend in melting points from thorium to plutonium. The number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6, due to the itinerance of the f-orbitals, increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals, and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding. (The f-electron count for thorium is a non-integer due to a 5f–6d overlap.) Among the actinides, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density; actinium is lighter. Thorium's boiling point of 4788°C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points, behind osmium, tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium.|$|E

There exists a pair of diffracted beams that co-propagate from the third grating to the camera. They interfere with each other to produce intensity fringes if the gratings are slightly misaligned with each other. The central pair of diffraction paths are always equal in length regardless of the x-ray energy or the angle of the incident beam. The interference patterns from different photon energes and incident angles are locked in phase.|$|E
