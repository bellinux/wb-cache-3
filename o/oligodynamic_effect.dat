50|$|Copper {{and copper}} alloys such as brass {{have been found}} to be toxic to {{bacteria}} via the <b>oligodynamic</b> <b>effect.</b> The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but common to other heavy metals. Viruses are less susceptible to this effect than bacteria. Associated applications include the use of brass doorknobs in hospitals, which {{have been found to}} self-disinfect after eight hours, and mineral sanitizers, in which copper can act as an algicide. Overuse of copper sulfate as an algicide has been speculated to have caused a copper poisoning epidemic on Great Palm Island in 1979.|$|E

50|$|While silver is {{potentially}} toxic to humans at high doses, {{the risk of}} serious harm from low doses, given over a short term, is slight. Treatment of external infections is considered safe; oral use of colloidal silver is safe for short term administration if the dose is low. Silver is used in some medical appliances because of its anti-microbial nature, which stems from the <b>oligodynamic</b> <b>effect.</b> Chronic ingestion or inhalation of silver preparations (especially colloidal silver) can lead to argyria in the skin and other organs. This is not life-threatening, but is considered by most to be cosmetically undesirable.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{concern is}} the fact that door handles are {{instrumental}} in the spread of many infections. [...] However, some materials, e.g. brass, copper and silver, are slowly poisonous to many germs. The exact mechanism is not known, but is commonly thought to be via the <b>oligodynamic</b> <b>effect,</b> perhaps by some other electrostatic effect. [...] Brass and copper, for example, disinfect themselves of many door handle bacteria within eight hours. Other materials such as glass, porcelain, stainless steel and aluminium do not have this effect. Self-disinfecting door handles are particularly important in hospitals, but useful in any building.|$|E
50|$|Varaka is {{mentioned}} in several ancient Sanskrit documents, particularly in Ayurvedic and medical literature. Varaka means cloth, cloak or {{a thing that}} covers something else. The word varaka {{is mentioned}} with swarna (gold), tara (silver) or rupera (silver) in these documents; the discussion is in three forms of these precious metals: patra (leaf), varaka (thin foil) and bhasma (ash). Ayurvedic documents consider silver as an antimicrobial astringent, while gold is claimed to be an aphrodisiac. This {{is not unique to}} Indian subcontinent; in Europe, edible gold (Aureum potabile) and silver were also claimed to have medicinal properties; later studies found that they can indeed be antibacterial owing to <b>Oligodynamic</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Silver {{and most}} silver {{compounds}} have an <b>oligodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> and are toxic for bacteria, algae, and fungi in vitro. The antibacterial action of silver {{is dependent on}} the silver ion. The effectiveness of silver compounds as an antiseptic is based on the ability of the biologically active silver ion (...) to irreversibly damage key enzyme systems in the cell membranes of pathogens. The antibacterial action of silver has long been known to be enhanced by the presence of an electric field. Applying an electric current across silver electrodes enhances antibiotic action at the anode, likely due to the release of silver into the bacterial culture. The antibacterial action of electrodes coated with silver nanostructures is greatly improved in the presence of an electric field.|$|E
50|$|Health {{concerns}} surrounding brass {{stem from}} lead contamination. Lead is sometimes added {{to enhance the}} machinability of brass. It is often present in concentrations around 2%. Thirteen key manufacturers were sued by the California state attorney general on October 1999. Lab tests revealed the average brass key contained more than the acceptable limit of lead. They were required to reduce the lead content to 1.5% after April 2001. By January 1, 2010, the California law states that brass containing less than 0.25% lead must be used for each component that comes {{into contact with the}} wetted surface of pipes, plumbing fittings and fixtures. On the other hand, the copper in brass does create a natural germicidal or <b>oligodynamic</b> <b>effect.</b> Brass doorknobs will virtually disinfect themselves within eight hours.|$|E
50|$|The medical uses {{of silver}} and silver ions have been known for some time; its use {{can be traced to}} the Phoenicians, who would store their water, wine, and vinegar in silver bottles to keep them from spoiling. There has been renewed {{interest}} in silver coatings for antimicrobial purposes. The antimicrobial property of silver is known as an <b>oligodynamic</b> <b>effect,</b> a process in which metal ions interfere with the growth and function of bacteria. Several in vitro studies have confirmed the effectiveness of silver at preventing infection, both in coating form and as nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix. However, concerns remain over the use of silver in vivo. Considering the mechanism by which silver interferes with bacterial cell function, some fear that silver may have a similarly toxic effect on human tissue. For this reason, there has been limited use of silver coatings in vivo. Despite this, silver coatings are commonly used on devices such as catheters.|$|E
50|$|The {{anti-microbial}} {{properties of}} metal surfaces are of high interest to water sanitation. The metals produce an <b>oligodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> due to oxide formation and subsequent ion formation, making them biocidically active. This prevents contaminants from {{adhering to the}} surface. Coliform bacteria and E.coli content on metal surfaces {{have been shown to}} substantially decrease with time, indicating the ability of these surfaces to prevent biofouling and thus promote sanitation. Of these metal surfaces, copper and zinc {{have been found to be}} most effective.Polyurethane, polyethylene glycol, and other polymers have been shown to reduce external bacterial adhesion, which elicits applications of anti-microbial substances to the polymer and coatings industry. Sustainable alternatives like topographically modified cellulose are also of high interest due to recyclability and low cost. Surfaces that are superhydrophobic are desirable for non-fouling behavior because an affinity for water correlates to an affinity for contaminants. Superhydrophobic xerogels made from silica colloids have been shown to reduce bacterial adhesion, specifically S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The non-fouling applications of these polymers and superhydrophobic coatings is of substantial importance to the field of medical devices.|$|E
40|$|Photocatalytic {{antibacterial}} sol-gel coated substrates {{have been}} reported to kill bacteria under light or in the dark. These coatings showed non-uniform distribution, poor adhesion to the substrate and short effective lifetime as antibacterial surfaces. These serious limitations to the performance/stability retard the potential application of antibacterial films {{on a wide range of}} surfaces in hospital facilities and public places. Here, the preparation, testing and performance of flexible ultra-thin films prepared by direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) at different energies are reviewed. This review reports the recent advancements in the preparation of highly adhesive photocatalytic coatings prepared by up to date sputtering technology: High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HIPIMS). These latter films demonstrated an accelerated antibacterial capability compared to thicker films prepared by DCMS leading to materials saving. Nanoparticulates of Ti and Cu have been shown during the last decades to possess high oxidative redox potentials leading to bacterial inactivation kinetics in the minute range. In the case of TiO 2 CuOx films, the kinetics of abatement of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were enhanced under indoor visible light and were perceived to occur within few minutes. <b>Oligodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> was seen to be responsible for bacterial inactivation by the small amount of released material in the dark and/or under light as detected by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The spectral absorbance (detected by Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS)) was also seen to slightly shift to the visible region based on the preparation method...|$|E
40|$|Tentamos verificar, em algumas experiências, a ação oligodinâmica da prata sôbre os vírus da coriomeningite linfocitária benigna, amostra WE, da poliomielite, amostra MEF 1, e da vacina, amostra do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, como o haviamos feito com o vírus da gripe, amostras PR 8 e DL/Rio. Nas provas usamos recipientes de barro, recobertos de fina camada de prata na parede interna, ou aquêles em que a prata, sob a forma de pó se misturava ao próprio barro. Esses recipientes são denominados, no comércio, moringas esterilizantes. Colocou-se, no seu interior, a emulsão a 10 % do tecido {{cerebral}} contendo o vírus da coriomeningite linfocitária ou da poliomielite, verificando-se o seu poder patogênico para camundongos, em intervalos regulares, pela injeção intracerebral de 0, 03 ml do material. Os resultados, que podem ser vistos nos Quadros 1 e 2, indicam que aquêles virus resistem à ação oligodinâmica da prata. No caso do vírus da vacina, a diluição foi colocada, da mesma maneira, nos referidos recipientes. O vírus apresentou, também, completa resistência, conforme se vê nas figuras de 1, 2 e 3. Experiências testemunhas feitas com Micrococcus pyogenes e Escherichia coli, cujas suspensões foram igualmente colocadas nas moringas esterilizantes, revelaram que as bactérias não sobreviviam além de 20 horas. Frizamos, na publicação sôbre vírus da gripe, que o referido fenômeno é importante porque sabemos que o efieto oligodinâmico se observa sôbre microorganismos como bactérias, protozoários e outros seres vivos, alterando as suas propriedades ou matando-os sendo, portanto, interessante sob o ponto de vista biológico. O fenômeno pode ainda ser aplicado para o isolamento de vírus, quando em contaminação com bactérias. We {{have tried}} to verify, in some experiments, the silver oligodynamic action upon the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, WE strain the poliomyelitis virus, MEF 1 strain, and the vaccinia virus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz strain, as we have done with the influenza virus, PR 8 strain and DL/Rio strain. In the tests we used clay pitchers covered in the inner surface with {{a thin layer of}} silver of with powdered silver mixed with the clay material. The 10 per cent infectious cerebral emulsion of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or of the poliomyelitis virus were put into the pitcher and the pathogenic power for mice verified, at regular intervals, by the intracerebral injection of 0, 03 ml. The results expressed in the tables 1 and 2 indicates that those viruses resist the silver oligodynamic action. In the case of the vaccinia virus, the dilution was put into the pitcher in the same way. The virus presented, too, complete resistence, as we can see in the figures 1, 2 and 3. Control experiments made with Micrococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli, put into the pitchers with silver, showed that the bacteriae were dead after 20 hours. As we emphasized in the paper about the influenza viruses, the reported phenomenon is important because we know that the <b>oligodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> is observed upon microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa and other living beeings altering its properties or killing them and, therefore, intersting from the biological point of view. The phenomenon can also be applied to the isolation of viruses with bacterial contamination...|$|E
