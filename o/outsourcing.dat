5|$|<b>Outsourcing</b> {{is among}} some of the many reasons for {{increased}} competition within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see <b>outsourcing,</b> in particular offshore <b>outsourcing,</b> as an opportunity for increased income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It is because of competition (including <b>outsourcing)</b> that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E

5|$|Redundant {{staff members}} are often laid off {{as part of}} the {{consolidation}} process, and the sharing of news content reduces the number of unique editorial voices in the market. This in particular is one of the caveats of pushes to ban <b>outsourcing</b> agreements by media consolidation critics, who also suggest that LMAs result in a decreased amount of local news coverage on the brokered station.|$|E

40|$|The storage as {{a service}} paradigma has {{recently}} raised interest in the security community, where a few works have been proposed to check whether an <b>outsourcer</b> has tampered with {{the integrity of the}} <b>outsourced</b> data. In this paper, we assume that storage is <b>outsourced</b> in accordance to some integrity enforcing protocol. Under this assumption, we focus on a specific issue; that is, when the <b>outsourcer</b> is requested to provide access to the <b>outsourced</b> data within a given time-bound—for instance, set in a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This paper provides several contributions: first, we identify and motivate the above requirement in the <b>outsourced</b> storage context; second, we show that current integrity enforcing protocols fail in detecting the violation of the time-bound limit against a rationale malicious outsourcer; third, we show how the <b>outsourcer</b> can actively perform such an attack. Results are supported by thorough analysis and extensive simulations...|$|R

Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments. During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems. It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the FCC {{modified}} its media ownership {{rules to}} count LMAs formed after November 5, 1996 that cover more than 15% {{of the broadcast}} day toward the ownership limits for the brokering station's owner. Even still, the related joint sales and shared services agreement structures became increasingly common during the 2000s; these <b>outsourcing</b> agreements proliferated between 2011 and 2013, when station owners such as Sinclair and the Nexstar Broadcasting Group began expanding their portfolios by acquiring additional stations {{in an effort to}} drive scale as well as to gain leverage in retransmission consent negotiations with cable and satellite television providers.|$|E

5|$|Lurgan has {{historically}} been an industrial town in which the linen industry predominated {{as a source of}} employment during the Industrial Revolution, and is said to have employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers {{at the end of the}} 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town's resident population at the time. That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of <b>outsourcing</b> to low wage countries.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of LMAs involve the <b>outsourcing</b> of one television station's operations to another, occasionally, a company may operate a station under an LMA, JSA or SSA {{even if it does}} not already own a station in that market. One example occurred in December 2013, when the Louisiana Media Company (owned by New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Hornets owner Tom Benson) entered into a shared services agreement with Raycom Media to run the former company's Fox affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, WVUE-DT; while Louisiana Media Company retained the station's ownership and license, other assets were assumed by Raycom, which owns stations in markets adjacent to New Orleans (including Baton Rouge, Jackson, Biloxi, Lake Charles and Shreveport) but not within New Orleans itself. Benson had received offers from Raycom and others to buy the station, but was not prepared to sell WVUE outright.|$|E

5|$|During the Internet bubble {{that led}} up to 2000, heavy {{investments}} in undersea fibre-optic cables linked Asia {{with the rest of the}} world. The fall that followed the economic boom resulted in the auction of cheap fiber optic cables at one-tenth of their original price. This development resulted in widely available low-cost communications infrastructure. All of these investments and events, not to mention a swell of available talent, resulted in India becoming almost overnight the centre for <b>outsourcing</b> of Business process. Within this sector and events, the ITES-BPO sector has become a big employment generator especially amongst young college graduates. The number of professionals employed by IT and ITES sectors is estimated at around 1.3million as of March 2006.

However, the sector evidence shows that, whole sale and retail shops which forms the bulk of the sample <b>outsources</b> much of their accounting services and this leads to the high average percentage so recorded even though, some educational services hardly <b>outsource</b> their accounting services.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory. In the A-model of topological string theory, physically interesting quantities are {{expressed in terms of}} infinitely many numbers called Gromov–Witten invariants, which are extremely difficult to compute. In the B-model, the calculations can be reduced to classical integrals and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can translate difficult calculations in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier calculations in the B-model. These calculations are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in string theory. Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to translate calculations in one theory into equivalent calculations in a different theory. By <b>outsourcing</b> calculations to different theories in this way, theorists can calculate quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} chapter, the book {{describes}} {{the process as}} new drugs move from animal testing through phase 1 (first-in-man study), phase 2, and phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 participants {{are referred to as}} volunteers, but in the US are paid $200–$400 per day, and because studies can last several weeks and subjects may volunteer several times a year, earning potential becomes the main reason for participation. Participants are usually taken from the poorest groups in society, and <b>outsourcing</b> increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations (CROs). The rate of growth for clinical trials in India is 20 percent a year, in Argentina 27 percent, and in China 47 percent, while trials in the UK have fallen by 10 percent a year and in the US by six percent.|$|E
