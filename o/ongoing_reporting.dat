A passive surveillance system consists of the regular, <b>ongoing</b> <b>reporting</b> of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory.

30|$|If {{the subsidy}} {{is based on}} {{earnings}} and eligibility is based on factors that either don’t change over time or change predictably, like age, the only <b>ongoing</b> <b>reporting</b> requirement is employer-reported earnings.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis considers why some crimes persist beyond the moment of newsworthiness {{and how they are}} able to transcend this period of intense reporting to become a feature of popular memory. The central argument is that the popular memory of a crime is built up over time through a synthesis of public discourses, which are predominantly developed in news reporting, people s everyday experience and the normative social frameworks of everyday life. A temporally sensitive analysis of two case studies, the murder of James Bulger and the murder of Sarah Payne, tests this hypothesis by exploring the connections and disconnections between the <b>ongoing</b> <b>reporting</b> of these crimes and the remembering of them. The study finds that the personal past and public discourse intertwine in remembered accounts of these crimes and considers that this is evidence of the ways audiences utilise crime news as an imaginative resource for understanding crime and criminality more broadly. It can thus be said that audiences use the news to frame, but not define their understandings of the world around us...|$|E
40|$|An {{enterprise}} that has previously accounted for its liability for outstanding debentures as extinguished through an in-substance defeasance has proposed to purchase, at a premium, approximately 90 {{percent of those}} outstanding debentures and to acquire from the defeasance trustee a proportional amount of the accumulated assets residing in the trust established {{in connection with the}} in-substance defeasance. The proposed transaction is intended to arbitrage the 1986 tax rate differential between capital gains and ordinary income. The issue is whether the removal of assets from the trust should affect the enterprise's initial and <b>ongoing</b> <b>reporting</b> of the debentures as having been extinguished previously, {{in view of the fact}} that, as a precondition for an in-substance defeasance, Statement 76 requires a debtor to irrevocably place assets in a trust to be used solely for satisfying scheduled payments of both interest and principal.

40|$|Introduction Toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis (TEN) {{is a rare}} condition characterised by mucocutaneous exfoliation {{of greater}} than 30 % {{total body surface area}} (%TBSA), increasingly being treated in burns centres. The rate of mortality varies significantly in the literature, with recent prospective studies in non-burns centres reporting percentage mortality of approximately 45 %. We undertook a systematic review of published studies that included TEN patients treated specifically in burns centres to determine a cumulative mortality rate. Methods Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2010) databases from 1966 onwards were used to identify English articles related to the treatment of TEN in burns centres. Results The systematic literature search identified 20 studies which specifically described patients with TEN grater than 30 % %TBSA. Treatment regimens varied amongst studies, as did mortality. The overall percentage mortality of the combined populations was 30 %. Risk factors commonly described as associated with mortality included age, %TBSA and delay to definitive treatment. Conclusion The review highlights the variation between principles of treatment and mortality amongst burns centres. It offers a standard that burns centre can use to internationally compare their mortality rates. The review supports the <b>ongoing</b> <b>reporting</b> of outcomes in TEN patients with epidermal detachment greater than 30 %. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Yaws, {{caused by}} Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue, is {{reportedly}} endemic in Ghana. Mass distribution of azithromycin {{is now the}} cornerstone of the WHO yaws eradication campaign. Mass distribution of azithromycin at a lower target dose was previously undertaken in two regions of Ghana for the control of trachoma. <b>Ongoing</b> <b>reporting</b> of yaws raises the possibility that resistance may have emerged in T. pallidum pertenue, or that alternative infections may be responsible for some of the reported cases. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in thirty communities in two districts of Ghana where MDA for trachoma had previously been conducted. Children aged 5 - 17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled. Samples for treponemal serology and lesion PCR were collected from all children. 90 children with 98 lesions were enrolled. Syphilis serology was negative in all of them. PCR for T. pallidum ssp pertenue was negative in all children, but Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. In these communities, previously treated for trachoma, we found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws. H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but the majority of lesions remain unexplained. Integration of diagnostic testing into both pre and post-MDA surveillance systems is required to better inform yaws control programmes. 098521 /Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom 102807 /Wellcome Trust/United Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} birth defects and syndromes {{associated}} with cleft lip and/or cleft palate in children born from 2000 through 2002 in Victoria, Australia, comparing {{data from the}} birth defects registry and detailed clinical assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data recorded in the Victorian Birth Defects Register were retrieved for all children with cleft lip and/or palate born from 2000 through 2002. In parallel, a cohort of children with clefts was recruited from the two cleft centers in Victoria. Clinical data were collected using structured parental interview, clinical/dysmorphologic examination, and file review. Results: Victorian Birth Defects Register records of 312 children with cleft lip and/or palate were identified, and 53 children were recruited for the clinical study. The clinical study found {{a higher proportion of}} nonisolated clefts than were listed in the registry; this was largely due to the more detailed assessment, but some selection bias was possible. Poor growth and developmental delay were most likely to predict the presence of other birth defects or a syndrome diagnosis in a child with cleft lip and/or palate. The clinical study led to modifications to 16 / 53 (30. 2 %) of records in the Victorian Birth Defects Register. Conclusions: This study provides complementary registry- and clinic-based data on cleft lip and/or palate-associated malformations and syndrome diagnoses in Australian children and emphasizes the value of having a clinician experienced in dysmorphology involved in cleft services with <b>ongoing</b> <b>reporting</b> to the Victorian Birth Defects Register. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This study {{summarizes}} {{passive surveillance}} data for adverse events following immunization (AEFI) {{reported to the}} National AEFI Surveillance System (NASS) in Zhejiang province and describes reporting trends from 2008 to 2011. AEFI reporting rates were calculated using denominator data from the Individual Immunization Information System and the Zhejiang provincial Bureau of Statistics. A total of 6, 265 AEFI records were reported; the overall reporting rate was 9. 2 per 100, 000 doses. There were two peaks of reporting rates, which were associated mainly {{with the introduction of}} the pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza virus vaccine (pH 1 N 1) in 2009 and the measles-mumps vaccine (MM) campaign in 2010. The majority of the AEFI described nonserious events. Fifteen deaths were recorded, but only one was possibly related to immunization. The most frequently reported reactions were fever and injection site reaction. Vaccines distributed in Zhejiang province have proven to be generally safe. The data on AEFI surveillance provide a reference point for <b>ongoing</b> <b>reporting</b> of trends and illustrate the value of the NASS database as a surveillance tool for monitoring of AEFI. During the last decade, rising concerns about vaccine and im-munization safety have emerged among themedical commu-nity aswell as the public (1).
