40|$|Abstract-The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of small amber lamps mounted near {{the front and rear}} on each side of a passenger car-so called side marker lamps-on visual detection and recognition of passenger cars in complex nighttime environments. It was determined whether cars equipped with side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> are detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than cars without side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps.</b> Subjects were presented with slides of natural nighttime scenes in which a car, either with or without side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps,</b> viewed from its side, approaching from a side street, was either present or not. Subjects determined as fast as possible whether a car was present or not. Reaction time measures (speed and accuracy) indicated that both under clear and fog visibility conditions, a car equipped with side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> was detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than a car without side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps.</b> The results indicate that side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> increase both lateral conspicuity and recognizability suggesting that side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> may be effective i...|$|R

40|$|This {{field study}} {{investigated}} the efficiency of color coding for peripheral identification of vehicle signals. Specifically, the study dealt with identification of stimuli as “yellow” or “red” when presented at intensities corresponding to typical turn signal <b>lamps</b> and side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps.</b> Turn signal lamps were studied both during bright, sunny conditions and at night, while side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> were studied at night only. We used two different yellow stimuli and two different red stimuli. For each color category, one stimulus was relatively far from the contrasting color category while the other stimulus was relatively near. Four viewing angles were used: 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees from visual fixation. A total of 28 subjects participated, ranging from 21 to 78 years old. Nighttime identification of colors was perfect at all viewing angles for stimuli representing turn signal lamps. On the other hand, there were strong effects of viewing angle for turn signals in the daytime and for side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> at night. Although in these two conditions performance deteriorated for stimuli in both color categories, it did so more for the red stimuli. This {{finding is consistent with}} the previously reported finding that peripherally presented red stimuli often appear yellow. The present findings imply that coding signals yellow and red is not sufficient for their peripheral identification under the two most difficult conditions tested (turn signals during bright daytime and side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> during nighttime). To the extent that peripheral discriminability is important in actual driving, efficient signaling should rely on other coding parameters (e. g., intensity, and flashing versus steady burning) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the trafficking of Burkholderia cenocepacia, an opportunistic respiratory pathogen {{of persons with}} cystic fibrosis (CF), in immortalized CF airway epithelial cells in vitro. Our results indicate that bacteria enter cells in a process involving actin rearrangement. Whereas both live and heat-killed bacteria reside transiently in early endosomes, only live bacteria escape from late endosomes to colocalize in vesicles positive for lysosomal membrane <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane marker calnexin, and autophagosome marker monodansylcadavarine (MDC). Twenty-four hours after infection, microcolonies of live bacteria were observed in the perinuclear area colocalizing with calnexin. In contrast, after ingestion, dead bacteria colocalized with late endosome marker Rab 7, and lysosome <b>markers</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1 and cathepsin D, but not with calnexin or MDC. Six to eight hours after ingestion of dead bacteria, degraded bacterial particles were observed in the cytoplasm and in vesicles positive for cathepsin D. These results indicate that live B. [*]cenocepacia gain entry into human CF airway cells by endocytosis, escape from late endosomes to enter autophagosomes that fail to fuse with mature lysosomes, and undergo replication in the ER.
