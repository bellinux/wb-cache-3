25|$|The {{band was}} formed in May 2012 by Enon Kawatani, out of members of other musical units. Kawatani formed the band <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> he respected, and had enjoyed {{performing}} with. Kawatani concurrently worked as the vocalist and songwriter for indigo la End, a band {{he had been a}} member of since 2009. Of the members, he chose Kyūjitsu Kachō, who was a former member of indigo la End, as well as Chan Mari and Hona Ikoka, from the bands Crimson and Microcosm respectively. The members had known each other since early 2010, from performing together at different events at the Shimokitazawa Era live house in Tokyo. They saw the project as more for fun, aside from their usual musical endeavours. The band name came from a custom tote bag that Chan Mari had brought with her to the recording studio, which had been created by a friend of hers who attended art school.|$|E

500|$|Rhodes coached at Harrow School until 1936. Cricket {{was very}} {{important}} to the school, and they were following the lead of Eton College who had appointed George Hirst as their coach. However, Rhodes's personality and generally critical nature did not communicate well with privileged schoolboys who were accustomed to getting their own way, and he was eventually replaced with the more genial and sympathetic Middlesex professional Patsy Hendren. This was in contrast to the success Hirst enjoyed at Eton. According to Bowes, Rhodes had vast technical knowledge, but unlike Hirst {{did not know how to}} get the best <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> [...] " [...] could not relate to beginners.

500|$|A week into filming, Francis {{felt the}} {{infected}} (referred to as [...] "Darkseekers" [...] or [...] "hemocytes" [...] in the script), {{who were being}} portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open {{all of the time}} and Lawrence explained, [...] "They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can't get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{in the middle of the}} night when they're barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they're constantly hyperventilating, which you can't really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out." [...] The actors remained on set to provide motion capture. [...] "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard", so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script, O'Bannon drew {{inspiration}} from many previous works of science fiction and horror. He later stated that [...] "I didn't steal Alien from anybody. I stole it from everybody!" [...] The Thing from Another World (1951) inspired the idea of professional men being pursued by a deadly alien creature through a claustrophobic environment. Forbidden Planet (1956) gave O'Bannon {{the idea of a}} ship being warned not to land, and then the crew being killed one by one by a mysterious creature when they defy the warning. Planet of the Vampires (1965) contains a scene in which the heroes discover a giant alien skeleton; this influenced the Nostromo crew's discovery of the alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. O'Bannon has also noted the influence of [...] "Junkyard" [...] (1953), a short story by Clifford D. Simak in which a crew lands on an asteroid and discovers a chamber full of eggs. He has also cited as influences Strange Relations by Philip José Farmer (1960), which covers alien reproduction, and various EC Comics horror titles carrying stories in which monsters eat their way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Matheson, {{primarily}} {{known for}} horror fiction, {{wanted to move}} away from the genre. [...] "I was determined to fight against this image. Dammit, I never wrote 'real' horror to begin with! To me, horror connotes blood and guts, while terror is a much more subtle art, a matter of stirring up primal fears. But, by the mid-seventies, I had tired of playing the fright game. Scaring the hell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> no longer appealed to me."

[...] They criticized that the Timulator controls are too confusing, especially for the game's targeted age group, but nonetheless summarized the game as both enjoyable and educational.

2500|$|Cruyff had {{remained}} a highly controversial figure throughout his life. Cruyff’s relationships with Ajax, Barça, and KNVB (Royal Dutch Football Association) were turbulent for some time, especially {{in his later}} years. Also, in his native Netherlands, there has been always a love-hate relationship between Cruyff and his fellow countrymen. There was a long-standing feud between Cruyff and Louis van Gaal, though never confirmed publicly by both sides. He also often criticised José Mourinho for his defensive-based coaching philosophy, stated, “José Mourinho is a negative coach. He only cares about the result and doesn't care much for good football.” As David Winner notes, “Cruyff has had many enemies and critics over the years.” He {{has been accused of}} being arrogant, greedy, intolerant, despotic, “too idealistic, too stubborn, insufficiently interested in defending and simply too difficult a personality. He loves an argument, and his conflict-model method of working can be bruising.” And Winner concludes that, “With his belief in the “conflict model” – the idea that you got the best <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> by provoking fights and thereby raising levels of excitement and adrenaline – Cruyff made enemies almost as easily as he generated delight. Battles with club presidents and teammates led to ruptures, especially at Ajax and Barcelona, the two clubs that defined his career.” ...|$|E

They were named for the pep-pills (see purple hearts) favoured by band members – not the US military decoration of same name (see Purple Heart). Their debut recordings were covers of [...] "Gloria" [...] and Graham Bond's [...] "Long Legged Baby" [...] cut to acetate disc in 1965 at Soundtrack Studios, Brisbane. A different version of [...] "Long Legged Baby" [...] was issued as their debut single on Sunshine Records later in 1965.

2500|$|The {{impact of}} the coordinated action was {{generally}} considered to be significant. Yochai Benkler of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society stated that the January 18 blackout was [...] "a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more," [...] further adding [...] "You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act. That's not trivial." [...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. [...] One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had [...] "a lot to learn," [...] noting that they don't have grassroots support: [...] "There are no Facebook pages to call your congressman to support PIPA and SOPA." [...] The New York Times, which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy, headlined the activism as a [...] "political coming of age for the tech industry." [...] (James Grimmelmann, an Associate Professor at New York Law School, opined two months later that [...] "Legal systems are like Soylent Green: they're made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> [...] If you want to protect civil liberties using law, you need to get people on your side who share your vision of what law stands for.
