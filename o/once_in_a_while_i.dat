500|$|The choreography, {{in which}} Astaire was {{assisted}} by Hermes Pan, is principally concerned throughout with {{the possibilities of}} using taps to make as much noise as possible. In the film, Astaire [...] suffers from what Rogers terms an [...] "affliction": [...] "Every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> suddenly find myself dancing." [...] Astaire introduces the film's tap motif when he blasts a tap barrage at the somnolent members of a London Club. There are eight musical numbers.|$|E
500|$|This {{title of}} [...] "Spokesman of a Generation" [...] was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came {{to feel it}} was a label that the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, Chronicles, Dylan wrote: [...] "The press never let up. <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> would have to rise up and offer myself for an {{interview}} so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline [...] "Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman". I felt {{like a piece of}} meat that someone had thrown to the dogs." ...|$|E
500|$|One reader was Sam Simon, a {{producer}} of the animated sitcom The Simpsons. He sent Meyer a compilation reel of Simpsons shorts from Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show that preceded {{the development of the}} series. Meyer turned down the job initially, but was offered a second chance to work as a creative consultant in the fall of 1989, which he accepted. Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. Meyer often played {{an active role in the}} show's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the [...] "rewrite room", a role he performed more than solo script work; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes. A. O. Scott described him as the [...] "guru" [...] of the room. In the room, according to Mike Reiss, writers would [...] "involuntarily glance at Meyer for approval when they pitch lines of their own". By 1995, Meyer became tired of the show's lengthy writing schedule and decided to leave after the sixth season to work on a film or TV pilot script. He soon returned, however, as a consultant and later as a part of the writing staff again and an executive producer. In 2004 he noted: [...] "It's hard to leave The Simpsons. Every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> get romantic notions that I should be doing something much more subterranean. Something like Army Man, or maybe guerrilla filmmaking." [...] He has attempted several TV projects that were not picked up. He left the show in 2006, and received his final credits in season 17. Meyer returned to co-write the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie, which he later had mixed feelings about: [...] "We worked so hard, and people liked it, but it still feels slapdash to me.‚Äù ...|$|E
