40|$|The paper {{presents}} data on authigenic carbonate {{distribution in}} Holocene - Upper Pleistocene deposits of the Okhotsk, Japan, East China, Philippine and South China Seas. Description of carbonate samples, their chemical and isotope compositions are given. Chemical {{analysis of the}} samples indicates that almost all authigenic carbonates are composed of calcite or magnesian calcite; and only in one case, of siderite. Oxygen isotopic composition (d 18 O) ranges from + 37. 7 to + 26. 1 per mil (SMOW); it is, probably, connected with different temperatures of carbonate formation. A distinct geographic regularity is traced. Decrease in d 18 O values is observed from the cold Okhotsk Sea to the warm South China Sea. A very wide range of carbon isotopic composition (d 13 C from - 42 to + 3. 8 per mil) indicates different sources of carbonic acid required for formation of these carbonates. As a basis for carbon isotopic composition we can distinguish three sources of carbonic acid in the studied sediments: microbiological methane oxidation, organic matter destruction during sediment diagenesis, and dissolved <b>organogenic</b> <b>limestone.</b> Thus, formation of authigenic carbonates in sediments from the marginal seas of the Northwest Pacific results from: 1) sediment diagenesis, 2) methane oxidation in zones of gas anomalies, 3) their precipitation from the supersaturated by carbonates sea shoal waters of tropical sea lagoons...|$|E
40|$|Carbonate {{successions}} of {{the early}} Lower Devonian (Lochkovian-early Pragian) from the Mindigulovo section (West Zilair Zone, western slope of the South Urals) can be globally correlated using diverse conodont faunas. The number of the documented widespread or cosmopolitan taxa of the Lochkovian and early Pragian age enables the definition of globally recognized conodont successions {{and the establishment of}} a refined regional conodont biozonal scale. The present three-fold global subdivision of the Lochkovian Stage can be applied as well to the studied area. The Lochkovian in the South Urals is represented by two Horizons (regional terminology) with different facies development: 1. The Siyak Horizon of the lower Lochkovian characterized by the dominance of shallow-water <b>organogenic</b> <b>limestones</b> of the hesperius-optima and optima-omoalpha Zones, and 2. The Sherlubai Horizon of the middle and upper Lochkovian age characterized by the dominance of carbonate-terrigenous successions. The middle and upper Lochkovian is subdivided into five biozones (using a binominal system) : omoalpha-eoeleanorae, eoeleanorae-eleanorae, eleanorae-trigonicus, trigonicus-pandora beta and pandora beta- sulcatus eta/ steinachensis. The Lochkovian-Pragian boundary and the early Pragian time are determined by the presence of eognathodontid and icriodontid stocks. The established regional conodont zonal scale in the South Urals provides a solid basis for refined correlation with the Lochkovian-early Pragian carbonate rocks of peri-Gondwana and Euramerica...|$|R
40|$|The Magura Nappe in the Polish {{sector of}} the Outer Carpathians {{consists}} of four tectonic subunits characterized by differing development of facies. From the south to the north, they include the Siary, Rača, Bystrica and Krynica subunits. The sedimentary succession in the Rača Subunit {{in the vicinity of}} the village of Osielec is composed of Campanian Palaeogene flysch deposited in the Magura Basin. In this succession, the Middle Eocene Pasierbiec Sandstone Fm consists of thick-bedded sandstones and conglomerates with occasional intercalations of thin-bedded shale-sandstone flysch. Within the Pasierbiec Sandstone Fm at Osielec there is an olistostrome, rich in pebbles and cobbles of exotic rocks. In addition, large blocks of Neoproterozoic metabasites and boulders of Palaeogene <b>organogenic</b> <b>limestones</b> were found. The discovery of metabasites raised the possibility that the rocks in question could be evidence of supposed oceanic crust in the basement of the Magura sedimentary basin, because of the suggestion that they represent the Alpine orogenic cycle. This concept was abandoned when investigations of the absolute age of the metabasites gave a date of ca. 600 Ma. In the Osielec area, there are two tectonic thrust sheets in the Rača Subunit, namely the Osielczyk Thrust Sheet in the north and the Bystra Thrust Sheet in the south; they are folded and cut by a transverse system of strike-slip and oblique faults. The Osielczyk Thrust Sheet was overthrust northwards on to the Siary Subunit...|$|R

The deposits of Manín, Klape and Drietoma units originated between the PKB Zone and Peripieninie deepwater fault (Mahel 1980). Tectonically, these units were created in the foreland of a transferring block of the Central Western Carpathians (Rakus & Hok 2005). From the lithological point of view the Manín Unit {{can be divided into}} two groups of sedimentary sequences: the first one, the Manín - Butkov Group (Rakus 1977), which is built up mostly of hemipelagic Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous marly limestones; and the second one, the Podmanin Group (Kysela et al. 1982), consisting of Albian to Maastrichtian flysch and pelagic rock complexes. The most characteristic massive set of Barremian - Lower Albian Urgonian limestones is developed in Manín and Podhorie formations (Vasicek et al. 1994). The recorded Albian stratigraphic hiatus within the Manín Unit was followed by rapid deepening of this sedimentary area and onset of the pelagic deposition of dark marls of the Butkov Formation. The Manín Formation is developed in complex of mainly gray to light gray massive <b>organogenic</b> <b>limestones</b> with numerous Barremian to Albian fossils of foraminifers (Orbitolina), crinoids, echinoids, molluscs, ostracods, corals and calcareous algae. Organodetritic bituminous limestones with dark grey cherts are typical of the Barremian - Lower Aptian Podhorie Formation. In microfacies, the fragments of foraminifers (Hedbergela), molluscs and crinoid ossicles are the most frequently identified bioclasts (Borza et al. 1987). In the Butkov Quarry, within the Manín Formation three lithological sections were sampled, which were used for the biostratigraphic analysis. The lower parts of the sections consist of grainstones, pelbiointrasparites, with dominance of recrystallized peloids and intraclasts. Fragments of foraminifers, corals and sponges are less common. Microborings of blue green and green algae were observed in bioclasts, which indicate deposition within the photic zone (up to 75 m), (Budd & Perkins 1980). In the upper parts of the sections only biomicrite wackestones occur with dominant increase of bioclasts. Biostratigraphically important foraminifers (Globigerina, Textularia, Miliolida, Orbitolina) are common. They belong sometimes to rock-forming elements, especially in the Lower Cretaceous open shelf and deep-shelf deposits. Fragments of brachiopods, echinoids, bivalves and gastropods were also identified. The limestone sedimentation in the Manín Unit in Manín - Butkov Group ends with typical hardground (Rakus 1977), which terminates the Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous sedimentary cycle. Total thickness is variable and ranges from about 50 m (Butkov Quarry) to 120 m (Manín Strait). Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

Some of the strata are highly fossiliferous and rich in various species of freshwater gastropods of the genera Melanopsis, Theodoxus, Pyrgula, Prososthenia, Orygoceras and Valvatawith the new species V. (?Costovalvata) pagana. Bivalves are represented by the genera Congeria, Unio, Pisidium. There is also, a rich ostracod assemblage, and remains of flora: twigs, leaves and seeds of higher and lower plants, and agglomerations of aquatic grasses and algae. Fish bones and teeth, {{as well as the}} crocodile tooth, are not particularly common, but they do help to complement the image of the diversity of the biological association that lived in the ancient lake and along its shores. According to facies analysis, the Miocene deposits of the Island of Pag, were deposited on the south-western edge of Paratethys, which has been moved more westward and south-westward within Croatian territory. </span...|$|R
