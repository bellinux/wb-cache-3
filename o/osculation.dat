De Stancy withdrew from bending over Paula, and she was very red in the face. Nothing seemed clearer than that he had actually done the deed. The applause continuing, Somerset turned his head. Five hundred faces had regarded the act, without a consciousness that it was an interpolation; and four hundred and fifty mouths in those faces were smiling.

Why should it be forced into premature contact with them, merely to feed our vanity or selfishness? Why should we assume our particular parental accident as superior to the common lot? If we do not give our offspring that prominence before our visitors so common to the young wife and husband, it is for that reason solely; and this may account for what seemed the forgetfulness of Enriquez in speaking of it or pointing it out to you.

40|$|The glucose {{concentration}} in the blood represents a metabolic state characterised in all living by variations that can be reliably recorded. It therefore is a parameter suitable for observation over prolonged periods for the classification of physiological oscillations. By aid of the continuous in vivo technique <b>osculations</b> are observed in 3 different fields of indication: 1. high-frequency oscillations after acute metabolic disturbances in ischaemia, 2. medium-frequency oscillations after experimental hyperglycaemia in the intravenous glucose tolerance test, and 3. low-frequency oscillations {{in the form of}} diurnal or circadian rhythms. The described oscillations are interpreted not only as an indication of counter-regulation and feed-back but as principal features of individual-specific, self-induced vibrations. Die Glucosekonzentration im Blut repräsentiert einen metabolischen Zustand, der in allen lebenden Systemen durch gut registrierbare Schwankungen gekennzeichnet ist. Sie ist daher ein geeigneter Parameter, um im Zusammenhang mit der Einordnung physiologischer Oscillationen über längere Zeitabstände beobachtet zu werden. Mit Hilfe der kontinuierlichen in-vivo-Analyse wird dies in drei verschie-denen Indikationsräumen getan: es handelt sich um 1. die hochfrequenten Oszillationen nach akuten Stoff Wechselstörungen durch Ischämie, 2. die mittelfrequenten Oszillationen nach experimenteller Hyperglykaemie im intravenösen Glucose-Toleranz^Test, und 3. die niederfrequenten Oszillationen in Form diurnaler und circadianer Rhythmen...|$|R
5000|$|Macleay was the {{originator}} of {{the short-lived}} Quinarian system of classification, {{which is used}} extensively in his Horae Entomologicae. This {{was an attempt to}} classify animals into related groups and was put forward in Part 2 of his book Horae Entomologicae (1821). According to his reasoning, each major group of animals could be subdivided into 5 subgroups, and each sub-group could be further divided into 5. MacLeay {{was one of the first}} systematists to note the difference between similarity due to true relation, called affinity, and similarity due to function, called analogy. Major groups united by affinities could also be related to other groups or subgroups by overlaps known as <b>osculations,</b> based on analogy. As precursors of the concept of homology, these proposals were taken very seriously at the time, and Charles Darwin, who got to know Macleay after he returned from the Beagle voyage, tried to fit Quinarian ideas into his evolutionary schemes up to about 1845 (see [...] "The Development of Darwin's Theory" [...] by Dov Ospovat, 1981). The ideas were also taken up by William Swainson, Nicholas Aylward Vigors, and others.|$|R
60|$|More caresses follow. Mamma is in a rapture. How pretty they look--the {{mother and}} daughter--two lilies twining together! The {{necessity}} of an entertainment at the Temple-lunch from Dick's (as before mentioned), dessert from Partington's, Sibwright's spoons, his boy to aid ours, nay, Sib himself, and his rooms, {{which are so}} much more elegant than ours, and where there is a piano and guitar: all these thoughts pass in rapid and brilliant combination in the pleasant Mr. Pendennis's mind. How delighted the ladies are with the proposal! Mrs. Mackenzie claps her pretty hands, and kisses Rosey again. If <b>osculation</b> is a mark of love, surely Mrs. Mack is the best of mothers. I may say, without false modesty, that our little entertainment was most successful. The champagne was iced to a nicety. The ladies did not perceive that our laundress, Mrs. Flanagan, was intoxicated very early in the afternoon. Percy Sibwright sang admirably, and with the greatest spirit, ditties in many languages. I am sure Miss Rosey thought him (as indeed he is) one of the most fascinating young fellows about town. To her mother's excellent accompaniment Rosey sang her favourite songs (by the way, her stock was very small--five, I think, was the number). Then the table was moved into a corner, where the quivering moulds of jelly seemed to keep time to the music; and whilst Percy played, two couple of waltzers actually whirled round the little room. No wonder that the court below was thronged with admirers, that Paley the reading man was in a rage, and Mrs. Flanagan in a state of excitement. Ah! pleasant days, happy gold dingy chambers illuminated by youthful sunshine! merry songs and kind faces--it is pleasant to recall you. Some of those bright eyes shine no more: some of those smiling lips do not speak. Some are not less kind, but sadder than in those days: of which the memories revisit us for a moment, and sink back into the grey past. The dear old Colonel beat time with great delight to the songs; the widow lit his cigar with her own fair fingers. That was the only smoke permitted during the entertainment--George Warrington himself not being allowed to use his cutty-pipe--though the gay little widow said that she had been used to smoking in the West Indies and I dare say spoke the truth. Our entertainment lasted actually until after dark: and a particularly neat cab being called from St. Clement's by Mr. Binnie's boy, you may be sure we all conducted the ladies to their vehicle: and many a fellow returning from his lonely club that evening into chambers must have envied us the pleasure of having received two such beauties.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{several decades}} of {{research}} on eutrophication in lakes, changes in reservoir plankton communities are poorly understood. The current study examined spatial patterns and dynamics of algae and Zooplankton in an oligomesotrophic main-stem reservoir. Bull Shoals Lake, Missouri-Arkansas, which is currently threatened from rapid development inupstream reservoirs. Eighteen sites were sampled during one week in summer and the seasonal dynamics of algae and Zooplankton were followed at two of these sites. The lake showed strongspatial patterning in transparency, concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll-a, and densities of algae and Zooplankton. Algal composition also varied substantially amongsites, with cyanobacteria most abundant in up-reservoir and tributary sites. Although cyanobacteria were most abundant in late summer, appreciable densities were found throughout the year. Zooplankton were dominated by rotifers and cladocerans, which showed large <b>osculations</b> in density over time. Abundance peaks occurred earlier in an up-reservoir than in a down-reservoir site, with a time delay of about a month for algae and four months for Zooplankton. The plankton composition {{was consistent with the}} oligo-mesotrophic status of Bull Shoals Lake, but high densities of cyanobacteria at some tributary sites and in upstream reservoirs indicate localized enrichment and the threat of eutrophication in this clear Ozark lake. © Copyright by the North American Lake Management Society 2004...|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} the tunnelling current through a Fabry-Pérot interferometer in the fractional quantum Hall regime. Within linear response theory (weak tunnelling but arbitrary source-drain voltage) {{we find a}} general expression for the current due to tunnelling of quasiparticles in terms of Carlson's R function. Our result is valid for fractional quantum Hall states with an edge theory consisting of a charged channel {{and any number of}} neutral channels, with possibly different edge velocities and different chiralities. We analyse the case with a single neutral channel in detail, which applies for instance {{to the edge of the}} Moore-Read state. In addition we consider an asymmetric interferometer with different edge lengths between the point contacts on opposite edges, and we study the behaviour of the current as a function of varying edge length. Recent experiments attempted to measure the Aharanov-Bohm effect by changing the area inside the interferometer using a plunger gate. Theoretical analyses of these experiments have so far not taken into account the accompanying change in the edge lengths. We show that the tunnelling current exhibits multiple <b>osculations</b> as a function of this edge length, with frequencies proportional to the injected edge current and inversely proportional to the edge velocities. In particular the edge velocities can be measured by looking at the Fourier spectrum of the edge current. We provide a numerical scheme to calculate and plot the R function, and include sample plots for a variety of edge states with parameter values which are experimentally relevant.

40|$|The phenomenology, {{generation}} and associated dynamics of short period seiche oscillations observed {{along the northern}} coast of the Maltese Islands are studied from a set of densely sampled, long term hydro-meteorobgical observations made at a permanent sea level gauge, together with simultaneous observations of bottom pressure recordings at offshore positions and across the Malta Channel. This coastal seiche, known locally as the 'milghiibd, manifests itself {{in conjunction with the}} occurrence of mesoscale atmospheric gravity waves travelling in the lower troposphere. The associated open sea waves excite the water bodies of the various inlets, bays and harbours into resonant <b>osculations</b> which reach a range ofup to lmin Melfeha Bay. Numerical experiments based on the free surface, non-linear Princeton Ocean Model (POM) in 2 D mode explain the response characteristics of two adjacent wide-mouthed open embayments. The seiche-induced barotropic circulation and impact on the flushing ofMellieha Bay are studied by means of an advection-diffusion scheme implemented within POM. Sea level signals on the synoptic, planetary wave and seasonal scales dominate the residual spectrum A multiple regression model and a novel analytic technique based on the wavelet transform provide in combination a very effective means of studying the composition ofthe sea level signal and the dependence of its variability in time on one or more correlated parameters. Atmospheric pressure is the predominant factor determining the sea level variability at frequencies lower than 0. 75 cpd. In the upper synoptic frequency (0. 3 < f < 0. 5 cpd) the response is very close to isostatic, with an average gain of 0. 7. At other frequencies the overall response is non-isostatic implying that other factors besides mesoscale atmospheric pressure forcing contribute to the sea level variability. On account of the station's position close to the latitudinal axis of the Strait of Sicily, these signals are important in understanding the control ofthe Strait on intra-basin exchanges. Seasonal changes in the mean sea level show a major minimumin March and a major maximum towards the last months ofthe year. Besides the usual steric and direct meteorological effects, this variability is attributed to adjustments in the mass balance ofthe whole Mediterranean basin...|$|R
