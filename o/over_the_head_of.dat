The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against Miami to 16–22.|$|E

On the next play, Eddie Lacy scored on a six-yard run for a 7–0 Crimson Tide lead. The Razorbacks responded with an eight-play, 51-yard drive, but failed to score any points after a 41-yard Zach Hocker field goal hit the left upright. Each team again traded punts before the Crimson Tide extended their lead to 10–0 {{early in the second}} quarter on a 51-yard Cade Foster field goal.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{during his}} first Opening Day start with the Red Sox, Beckett struck out 10 through seven innings {{allowing}} only one run and two hits in a 5–3 victory over the Rays. On April 14, 2009, MLB fined and suspended him six games for intentionally throwing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> Angels outfielder Bobby Abreu. Beckett later appealed the suspension and got it reduced to five games. On June 20, 2009, he recorded his first complete game shutout in three years against the Atlanta Braves in a duel against former Red Sox pitcher Derek Lowe.

5|$|The Bulls {{began their}} next drive {{at their own}} 26-yard line, but went three-and-out. Buffalo punter Peter Fardon kicked the ball <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> UConn {{returner}} Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo {{to tie the game}} at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.|$|E

Apart from the attributes described in texts like the sword, bow; he sometimes also carries {{a cup of}} wine in his hand. Revanta is often depicted wearing long boots reaching up to the calves, unlike other Hindu divinities – except Surya – who are depicted barefoot. Revanta is depicted seated on a horse and accompanied by a hunting dog. Revanta's attendants are depicted with various hunting weapons like lances and swords. Some of them are shown blowing a conch or beaming drums or holding an umbrella <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> their lord, the umbrella being the symbol of royalty. Also, {{some of them are}} depicted as flying or holding wine or water jars. Sometimes, an attendant carries a dead boar in his shoulder or the dog chasing a boar.|$|E

25|$|Adventists {{teach that}} the scapegoat, or Azazel, {{is a symbol}} for Satan. They believe that Satan will finally have to bear the {{responsibility}} for the sins of the believers of all ages, and that this was foreshadowed on the Day of Atonement when the high priest confessed the sins of Israel <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the scapegoat (Leviticus 16:21).|$|E

25|$|The game started disastrously for the Broncos who, despite {{losing the}} coin toss, {{received}} the opening kickoff. On the game's first play from scrimmage from the Broncos' 14 yard line, Broncos center Manny Ramirez sent a shotgun snap <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> quarterback Peyton Manning. The ball traveled into the endzone {{where it was}} covered by Broncos running back Knowshon Moreno who was touched down for a safety with just 12 seconds of game time elapsed. This was the quickest score ever in a Super Bowl. The Seahawks did not relinquish the lead in a 43–8 victory.|$|E
25|$|In {{his next}} start, Game Two of the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, Ankiel was removed {{in the first}} inning after {{throwing}} 20 pitches, five of which went past catcher Eli Marrero (only two were official wild pitches, as no runners were on base for the others), and the first of which sailed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> Mets' hitter Timo Perez. Ankiel appeared again in the seventh inning of Game Five facing four hitters, walking two and throwing two more wild pitches. The Cardinals lost the series four games to one to the Mets.|$|E
25|$|Gibson next {{pitched in}} Game 4 of the 1968 World Series, {{defeating}} the Tigers' ace pitcher Denny McLain by a 10–1 score. The teams continued to battle each other, {{setting the stage}} for another winner-take-all Game 7 in St. Louis on October 10, 1968. In this game Gibson was matched against Tigers pitcher Mickey Lolich, and the two proceeded to hold their opponents scoreless for the first six innings. In the top of the seventh, Gibson retired the first two batters before allowing two consecutive singles. Detroit batter Jim Northrup then hit a two-run triple <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> center fielder Curt Flood, leading to Detroit's Series win.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, Kerry {{once again}} faced little {{competition}} in the Provincial Championship. A 3-14 to 3-7 defeat of Cork gave Ó Sé a fourth Munster medal in-a-row. Kerry later qualified for a third All-Ireland final in four years. Old rivals Dublin provided the opposition; however, the game turned into a rout. The game is chiefly remembered for Mikey Sheehy's sensational goal. The Kerry forward lobbed the ball <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> Paddy Cullen, who was caught off his line arguing with the referee. New full-forward Eoin Liston scored a hat-trick of goals. Pat Spillane played all over the field, including goalkeeper after Charlie Nelligan was sent off. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the winners by 5-11 to 0-9.|$|E
25|$|Landrith made {{immediate}} headlines when he {{was involved}} in a scuffle against the New York Yankees on June 11. Rookie Oriole outfielder Boog Powell was hospitalized after Yankees pitcher Bud Daley beaned Powell {{in the head with a}} pitch in the top of the 4th. In the bottom of the 4th, Baltimore pitcher Robin Roberts immediately threw a fastball <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> Yankees star Roger Maris. Maris started walking toward the mound, bat in hand. Roberts was afraid that if things got physical he would break his hand. Landrith jumped on Maris' back, clearing the benches. No punches were thrown in the incident, nor were any suspensions or fines levied by American League president Joe Cronin. The Orioles won 5-3.|$|E
25|$|The bowling of fast short pitched {{balls and}} of high full pitched balls is {{dangerous}} {{and is also}} considered unfair. Where the umpire considers that there are regular fast short pitched balls, that by their length, height and direction, coupled with the relative skill of the batsman is dangerous, the umpire calls no ball and cautions the bowler. If this happens a second time in an innings, the bowler is barred from bowling again in that innings, also is reported to the authorities he is responsible to for further disciplinary action. Where a delivery, after pitching, passes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the striker, the umpire calls no ball and includes it in his consideration of whether fast short pitched bowling is unfair, even though such a delivery is not dangerous.|$|E
