500|$|Eberhardt and Ehnni {{relocated}} to Ténès in July 1902 after Ehnni obtained employment {{there as a}} translator. Eberhardt was incorrigibly bad with her money, spending anything she received immediately on tobacco, books, and gifts for friends, and pawning her meagre possessions or asking for loans when she realised {{there was no money}} left for food. This behaviour made her even more of a pariah among the other European residents of the town. Eberhardt would frequently leave for weeks at a time, being either summoned to Algiers by Barrucand or sent <b>on</b> <b>assignments.</b> She was given a regular column in his newspaper, where she wrote about the life and customs of Bedouin tribes. Both Ehnni and Eberhardt's health deteriorated, with Eberhardt regularly suffering from bouts of malaria. She was also probably affected by syphillis.|$|E

In July 1934, Dahl joined the Shell Petroleum Company. Following {{two years of}} training in the United Kingdom, he was transferred first to Mombasa, Kenya, then to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Along with the only two other Shell employees in the entire territory, he lived in luxury in the Shell House outside Dar es Salaam, with a cook and personal servants. While out <b>on</b> <b>assignments</b> supplying oil to customers across Tanganyika, he encountered black mambas and lions, among other wildlife.|$|E

2500|$|With Nanavati {{frequently}} away <b>on</b> <b>assignments</b> {{for long}} periods of time, Sylvia fell in love with Prem Bhagwan Ahuja, a Sindhi friend of Nanavati's. In her testimony in court, Prem's sister Mamie Ahuja, stated that Prem had agreed to marry Sylvia, provided she divorced her husband. However, this was contradicted by the letters written by Sylvia (admitted as Sylvia's testimony), where she expressed her desire to divorce Nanavati and marry Prem, but she doubted whether Prem had the same intentions. In a letter dated 24 May 1960, she wrote [...] "Last night when you spoke of your marrying me and the various other girls you might marry, something inside me snapped and I knew I could not bear the thought of your loving someone else…".|$|E

2500|$|With the {{beginning}} of the third season, further changes were made to target the show at a teenage audience. The title theme was re-recorded again to give it a disco beat, the use of the robot 'Rover' was increased for comic effect, and episodes began to revolve around topical subjects like skateboarding, roller coasters and the environment. (Feld also gave Wonder Woman a [...] "skate-boarder's" [...] uniform, which was also capable of use for training in any [...] "extreme sport" [...] in which she participated.) Teenagers or young adults were commonly used as main characters in the plot lines. Eve disappeared from the cast although she is mentioned once or twice. Episodes during this season showed Diana <b>on</b> <b>assignments</b> by herself far more often (particularly outside of Washington DC), and Steve Trevor had become Diana's boss and was seen less.|$|E
2500|$|During E.R.S. Canby's {{military}} career, Louisa {{joined him}} <b>on</b> <b>assignments</b> with the almost sole {{exception of the}} Mexican-American War. In his memoirs, William Tecumseh Sherman recalls {{the arrival of the}} Canbys at Monterey, California, in early 1849 where then-Major Canby succeeded Sherman as adjutant-general of the military Department of California. The Canbys, with their six-year-old daughter, Mary (who died in childhood), took up residence in Monterey which was then the military headquarters for California. (Benicia, California was soon added as the headquarters for the Pacific.) About this time, Louisa met Lt. Col. Henry Stanton Burton, who became involved in controversy when he proposed marriage to Maria Amparo Ruiz, the granddaughter of the former Mexican governor of Baja California. (She was a remarkable woman in her own right: widely admired for her beauty and aristocratic carriage, she later became a successful novelist.) The announcement of their engagement set off a firestorm as the Roman Catholic Bishop of California condemned the union (Burton was a Protestant), and the governor declared that [...] "all the authorities of California are not to authorize any marriage when either of the parties is a Catholic." [...] Louisa offered the couple the use of the Canby home where their marriage took place on July 7, 1849. Major Canby, who had begun a tour of northern California on July 2 and did not return to Monterey until August 9, was forced to explain that he had taken no part in the affaire and that his wife, a civilian, had acted alone.|$|E
