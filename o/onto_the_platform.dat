5|$|Now {{possessing}} three powers, Delsin encounters Hank, who {{has escaped}} again. Hank tells Delsin that Fetch and Eugene have been {{captured by the}} D.U.P., and are being held on an artificial concrete island in Puget Sound. However, the situation {{turns out to be}} a trap set by Augustine. Reggie appears and rescues Delsin with a rocket launcher. While the brothers free Fetch and Eugene, Augustine encases Reggie's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform. As they dangle above the ocean, Reggie realizes that Delsin cannot save both of them, tells him that he is proud of him, and lets Delsin's hand go and falls to his death. Distraught and enraged, Delsin climbs back up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> and battles Augustine, destroying the entire island.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E
5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E

25|$|Premier Rescue {{is practiced}} in the Australian RoboCup Junior competition. It {{is very similar to}} the Australian Rescue {{challenge}} except for some minor additions. The teams must capture the object within the marked area and place it on a platform. This is more difficult than the regular Australian Rescue challenge because the participants must construct a device to secure the object and lift it <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
25|$|In rotary parlors, {{the cows}} are loaded {{one at a}} time <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{platform}}</b> as it rotates. The milker stands near the entry to the parlor and puts the cups on the cows as they move past. By the time the platform has completed almost a full rotation, another milker or a machine removes the cups and the cow steps backwards off the platform and then walks to its feed. Rotary cowsheds, as they are called in New Zealand, started in the 1980s but are expensive compared to Herringbone cowshed - the older New Zealand norm.|$|E
50|$|There were {{plans to}} {{completely}} rebuild <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> area, demolishing <b>the</b> original liftshaft {{space and the}} current circulating area {{at the foot of}} the escalators and replacing them with a large two-level atrium, the upper level taking the form of a balcony, with various access points <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> and escalator access between levels.

25|$|Train 2D57, the 19:09 {{service from}} London Waterloo to Effingham Junction, became derailed on the {{approach}} to Epsom at about 19:42 on Tuesday 12 September 2006. The train was formed of two four-car class 455 electric multiple units (EMUs). The leading bogie of the fourth coach was derailed towards the left as it passed over a set of trailing points on a right-hand curve at about 17 miles per hour (27km/h). The train {{came to a stop}} partially in Epsom station, and passengers were quickly evacuated <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> There were no injuries, and there was only minor damage to the train and the track.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} the asteroid, each X-Man quickly becomes engaged with an obstacle {{on the way}} to Magneto: Storm is needed to cover the breach the X-Men blow into Asteroid M, Dazzler takes on Pyro, Wolverine traps Toad, Colossus engages Juggernaut, and Cyclops battles White Queen. Only Nightcrawler (after effortlessly teleporting past the Blob) finally confronts a gloating Magneto as the Scorpio comet is approaching Earth. As Magneto is about to blast Nightcrawler, Kitty emerges from the floor, causing Magneto to accidentally blast the wiring of his device. Nightcrawler teleports up and uses his body as a conduct, while Kitty knocks Magneto <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> using his power to redirect the comet's course towards Asteroid M. Nightcrawler must risk sacrificing himself to complete the machine's circuit, or the comet will change course back to Earth.|$|E
25|$|When {{moving through}} areas, the player mostly modifies the {{landscape}} so that new paths can be opened. For example, {{in order to}} reach an isolated area, the player might have to bring down a platform by casting a gust of wind, climb <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> and then return the platform to its original position and jump off. The player is also given tools to help with puzzles. One such tool acts as a reef blower or vacuum cleaner, moving items out of the way or defeating enemies. Some tools or objects must first be created on the controller's touch pad. Here, the player can draw the shape of an object and choose the colours. When finished, the item is then used in the game world wherever it is necessary. One instance of this occurs when the player is asked to create a butterfly design. The butterfly design the player creates can then be seen numerous times throughout each level {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E
50|$|System RTL designs or netlistâ€™s {{will have}} to be {{partitioned}} onto each FPGA to be able to fit <b>the</b> design <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> prototyping <b>platform.</b> This introduces new challenges for the engineer since manual partitioning requires tremendous effort and frequently results in poor speed (of the design under test).

25|$|A {{staircase}} {{near the}} main chamber, {{at the level}} of the radio room and toilet facility, led up to the east observation post. It was decided that the aerial would be hidden by withdrawing it into a pipe after use, with the pipe extending down the stairs which led to the main room. While it had initially been planned that the observation apertures would both be slits, the final choice was for the eastern aperture over the Mediterranean to be larger, overlooking a narrow ledge, yet still completely concealed. The opening and ledge were sufficiently large that a man could climb out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> for fresh air. Part way up the main set of stairs was another set which led to the west observation post. The western slit over the bay was concealed with a concrete wedge. The entirety of the main chamber had been plastered and its floor covered in cork tiles, both methods to reduce sound transmission. The entrance passage had loose soil, to facilitate burials if needed. It also had loose bricks to further brick up the tunnel access once the six men had been sealed inside the cave.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Levi Buchanan {{described}} {{the game as}} somewhere between a traditional tie-in game and a cash grab, and [...] "ambitious" [...] but limited by {{the confines of the}} mobile platform. He added the game appeared forced <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> despite its inability to support open world gameplay. Keith Andrew of Pocket Gamer felt similarly, and Rob Hearn of the same outlet also complained of how the large sprites restricted screen space and made driving slower. IGN's Buchanan felt that the screen was too small to fit so much action, especially due {{to the size of the}} minimap, and though the city [...] "looks alive", it became [...] "a painful obstacle course". He found driving difficult between its controls and his inability to plan for the offscreen unknown. Pocket Gamer Andrew also found both driving controls complicated and found himself accidentally killing pedestrians and thus getting into police chases. On the other hand, Andrew Podolsky of 1UP.com enjoyed driving through the destructible environments.|$|E
500|$|The {{decoupled}} locomotive {{went back}} to the Treblinka station or to the layover yard in MaÅ‚kinia for the next load, while the victims were pulled from the carriages <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> by Kommando Blau, one of the Jewish work details forced to assist the Germans at the camp. They were led through the gate amidst chaos and screaming. They were separated by gender behind the gate; women were pushed into the undressing barracks and barber on the left, and men were sent to the right. All were ordered to tie their shoes together and strip. Some kept their own towels. The Jews who resisted were taken to the [...] "Lazaret", also called the [...] "Red Cross infirmary", and shot behind it. Women had their hair cut off; therefore, it took longer to prepare them for the gas chambers than men. The hair was used in the manufacture of socks for U-boat crews and hair-felt footwear for the Deutsche Reichsbahn.|$|E

500|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} year, the 2002 dive season {{was dedicated to}} lifting the [...] turret to the surface. Around 160 divers were assigned to remove {{the parts of the}} hull, including the armor belt, that lay on top of the turret using chisels, exothermic cutting torches and [...] hydroblasters. They removed as much of the debris from inside the turret as possible to reduce the weight to be lifted. This was usually concreted coal as one of the ship's coal bunkers had ruptured and dumped most of its contents into the turret. The divers prepared the turret roof for the first stage of the lift by excavating underneath the turret and placed steel beams and angle irons to reinforce it for its move onto a lifting platform for the second stage. A large, eight-legged lifting frame, nicknamed the [...] "spider", was carefully positioned over the turret to move it <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> and the entire affair would be lifted by the crane mounted on the Wotan. The divers discovered one skeleton in the turret on 26 July before the lift and spent a week carefully chipping about half of it free of the concreted debris; the other half was inaccessible underneath the rear of one of the guns.|$|E
500|$|The Liberals {{concluded}} {{their campaign}} {{with a large}} rally at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on June 7. Entertainment at the event {{was provided by the}} Leslie Bell singers, and according to Grosart, many in the audience were Tory supporters who had turned out to hear them. St. Laurent's speech at the rally was interrupted when William Hatton, a 15-year-old boy from Malton, Ontario, climbed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> Hatton carried a banner reading, [...] "This Can't Be Canada" [...] with a Liberal placard bearing St. Laurent's photograph, and moved to face the Prime Minister. Meisel describes Hatton as an [...] "otherwise politically apathetic boy who... slowly and deliberately tore up a photograph of the Prime Minister as the latter was speaking" [...] and states that Hatton engaged in [...] "intensely provocative behavior". Liberal partisans interceded, and in the ensuing fracas, Hatton fell from the platform, audibly hitting his head on the concrete floor. St. Laurent watched in apparent shock, according to his biographer Dale Tompson, as officials aided the boy and took him from the hall. According to Tompson, the crowd [...] "turned its indignation on the men on the platform" [...] and spent the remainder of the evening wondering about the boy's possible injuries rather than listening to the Prime Minister's speech. Hatton was not seriously injured, but, according to Newman, [...] "the accident added to the image of the Liberal Party as an unrepentant arrogant group of old men, willing to ride roughshod over voters". Grosart later described the incident as [...] "the turning point" [...] of the campaign. Professor Meisel speculated that the Hatton incident might have been part of an organized campaign to annoy St. Laurent out of his pleasant [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] persona, and Grosart later related that Liberal frontbencher Jack Pickersgill always accused him of being behind the boy's actions, but that the incident was [...] "a sheer accident". Hatton's mother described his actions as [...] "ust a schoolboy prank," [...] and a reaction to reading an article about how the art of heckling was dying. According to public relations executive J.G. Johnston in a letter to Diefenbaker on June 10, Hatton had come to the rally with several other boys, including Johnston's son, but had gone off on his own while the other boys paraded with Diefenbaker posters which had been smuggled inside. According to Johnston, Hatton was caught on CBC tape saying to St. Laurent, [...] "I can no longer stand your hypocrisy, Sir" [...] before tearing the St. Laurent poster. Attempts by Johnston to have the Liberal activist who pushed Hatton off the platform arrested failed, according to Johnston, on the ground that the police could find no witnesses.|$|E
