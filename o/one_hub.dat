40|$|The {{automated}} {{generation of}} links within {{a body of}} educational material {{is critical to the}} cost-effective implementation of Technology Based Learning. This paper describes the linking system used by WHURLE- an adaptive web-based integrated learning environment. Structural links are dynamically generated from lessons using an autonavigation system. Authored links are created by teachers or students, and consist of bidirectional links between different points in the content or between WHURLE and elsewhere on the Web. Authored links are defined in a linkbase that is either attached to a lesson (i. e. teacher originated) or to a user profile (i. e. student originated). These links may be single (i. e. <b>one</b> to <b>one),</b> <b>hubs</b> (<b>one</b> to many) or plural (many to many), and are implemented by Goate, a content modifying proxy system...|$|R

50|$|Although Petrarch is {{accredited}} with {{perfection of}} the sonnet, Shakespeare still made changes in sonnet form and composition 200 years after Petrarch's death. While Petrarch’s sonnets focused mainly on <b>one</b> <b>hub,</b> Shakespeare developed many subjects within his themes such as insomnia, slave of love, blame, dishonesty, and sickness. Despite creating complicated plots, Shakespeare also manages to place ulterior motifs among his two lovers, building new poetic form where Petrarch left off.|$|E
50|$|The rich-club {{coefficient}} {{of a network}} is useful as a heuristic measurement of the robustness of a network. A high rich-club coefficient implies that the hubs are well connected, and global connectivity is resilient to any <b>one</b> <b>hub</b> being removed. It is also useful for verifying theories that generalize to other networks. For example, the consistent observation of high rich-club coefficients for scientific collaboration networks adds evidence to the theory that within social groups, the elite tend to associate with one another.|$|E

5000|$|Tandem rotor {{aerodynamics}} is {{a complex}} subject. Tandem rotor helicopters {{have the advantage of}} being able to hold more weight with shorter blades, since there are two sets. However, the rear rotor works in the aerodynamic shadow of the front rotor, which reduces its efficiency. This loss can be minimized by increasing the distance between the two rotor hubs, and by elevating <b>one</b> <b>hub</b> over the other. [...] Tandem rotor helicopters tend to have a lower disk loading than single rotor helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{domestic}} routes, especially hub-to-hub {{service and}} certain non [...] "United p.s."

While the physical seats and entertainment {{are the same}} as on international flights, the service, catering and other amenities {{are the same as}} in domestic first class. Unlike routes marketed as United p.s., these flights are eligible for complimentary premier upgrades.|$|E
50|$|An {{integrated}} regular timetable with half-hourly or hourly headways requires routes {{on which}} a service takes 28 or 58 minutes to make it from <b>one</b> <b>hub</b> to another. A service that takes 40 minutes would be bad because passengers and vehicles have to wait uselessly for their connections, and it generates nearly the same cost as a route that takes 58 minutes, because vehicles and personnel cannot be used during the remaining 20 minutes. Therefore, when an integrated timetable is introduced running times might be cut or extended to meet the ideal duration.|$|E

50|$|In the Nintendo DS, PSP, and iOS {{versions}}, several {{changes were}} made from the versions of the other formats.There is only <b>one</b> <b>hub,</b> the Room of Requirement, but the explorable Hogwarts and Diagon Alley hubs of the other versions were removed and both boss battles and spellcasting were simplified. Also, unlike all previous Travelers Tales Lego video games, the Nintendo DS, PSP and iOS versions have written sentences. In other Lego video games before 2012, the Lego figures only grunted to each other. The DS version uses touchscreen controls to perform spells, and is a downscaled port of the PSP version.|$|E
50|$|First 4 of the 7 hubs must {{be fully}} {{occupied}} (all 8 terminals on each hub filled by alliance bases, with each player only allowed on one terminal of <b>one</b> <b>hub)</b> for 10 days {{to bring down}} the Fortress shield. If any base leaves or is destroyed during this period, the shield is fully restored, once fewer than 4 hubs are fully occupied. For this reason, and for the virus injections mentioned below, it is wise to occupy 6 hubs (occupying all 7 would require more players than an alliance can have) and surround them by allied bases, to protect them from enemy attacks.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} {{and record the}} velocity components, the vector averaging circuitry is turned on by a rotor count, which is signaled by a proper sequence {{of changes in the}} levels of the magnetodiodes. The instrument heading (...) is determined and stored in a register and updated at a 1-Hz rate (once each second). If either propeller rotates sufficiently (the original version of VMCM had a speed threshold of less than one centimeter per second [...] ), a pair of pulses is produced by the magnetodiodes of <b>one</b> <b>hub</b> and a count occurs from the rotor. Then, the cosine and sine of the heading (that is currently stored in the heading register) are added to the proper register that stores the [...] and [...] velocity components. To accomplish this, {{at the end of each}} sampling interval over which the averaging is performed, the following sums are evaluated: ...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Symmetric & Asymmetric Database Encryption" [...] section {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} public and private keys with basic examples in which users exchange keys. The act of exchanging keys becomes impractical from a logistical point of view, when many different individuals need to communicate with each-other. In database encryption the system handles the storage and exchange of keys. This process is called key management. If encryption keys are not managed and stored properly, highly sensitive data may be leaked. Additionally, if a key management system deletes or loses a key, the information that was encrypted via said key is essentially rendered [...] "lost" [...] as well. The complexity of key management logistics is also a topic that needs to be taken into consideration. As the number of application that a firm uses increases, the number of keys that need to be stored and managed increases as well. Thus it is necessary to establish a way in which keys from all applications can be managed through a single channel, which is also known as enterprise key management. Enterprise Key Management Solutions are sold by a great number of suppliers in the technology industry. These systems essentially provide a centralised key management solution that allows administrators to manage all keys in a system through <b>one</b> <b>hub.</b> Thus {{it can be said that}} the introduction of enterprise key management solutions has the potential to lessen the risks associated with key management in the context of database encryption, as well as to reduce the logistical troubles that arise when many individuals attempt to manually share keys.|$|E
