5|$|The Browns' first game, {{against the}} Miami Seahawks, took place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> late-summer evening in September. The crowd was the second-largest ever for a {{professional}} football game. The game was well-attended {{in part because of}} team owner Arthur B. McBride's promotion of the new team, but also because the Browns' two black players helped draw a large African-American crowd. Miami's team, drawn mainly from the Southern United States, was overmatched by Cleveland. The score was 27–0 at halftime and the final was 44–0. Browns end Mac Speedie scored the team's first points on a 19-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Cliff Lewis. Otto Graham came in at quarterback in the second quarter and threw a touchdown to Dante Lavelli. Placekicker Lou Groza kicked three field goals, and the Browns had two defensive touchdowns. Miami never advanced past the Browns' 39-yard line.|$|E

25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E
25|$|The {{participants}} received a life ban from Caribbean cricket in 1983. In many instances, they were ostracised socially and professionally, {{such was the}} hostility toward players that complied with the South African apartheid system. In contrast, the players commented <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> reception from both blacks and whites in South Africa and the tour {{may have been a}} positive influence on relations between races. It {{was one of the few}} occasions when white and black people had played sport together in South Africa. The players' bans were lifted in 1989 (although Lynch appeared in ODI's for England a year earlier against the touring West Indians) but the only tour member who played for West Indies again was Moseley, at the age of 32 (two tests in the 1989-90 home series against England: though he did not take many wickets, his appearance was chiefly notable for breaking Graham Gooch's hand, forcing Gooch - now England's captain - to miss the remainder of the series). Stephenson and Clarke had very successful first-class careers in South African and English domestic cricket: and Stephenson in particular could perhaps be thought unlucky not to be given a chance in Test cricket, given the precedent set by Moseley's selection and the fact that his performances in the English county championship had been nothing short of spectacular.|$|E

A 30% mortality rate was found, with the rate for deaths among males likely to be of a similar order.|$|E
