2500|$|Dow {{described}} his own philosophy of design as [...] "Architecture {{is more than}} <b>the</b> front face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> heating and cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> furnishing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> landscaping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is, in its entirety, <b>the</b> manifestation <b>of</b> wholesome living." [...] Frank Lloyd Wright's philosophy.|$|R
500|$|Public {{reaction}} to <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> has been mixed. In the first 6 months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{being open to}} the public, 250,000 people visited it, which Presiding Officer George Reid has said showed the public were [...] "voting with their feet". Critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> such as Margo MacDonald MSP, {{have pointed out that}} <b>the</b> high number <b>of</b> visitors does not prove that all <b>of</b> them like <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> As well as cost, criticisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> stem primarily from the modernist and abstract architecture, <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> work and <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|R

5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy {{the last vestiges of}} these Nazi landmarks.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> grew {{over many}} years in {{incremental}} phases, so the structure varied in each phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was supported by concrete slabs and columns with only <b>the</b> original 1903-08 <b>building</b> using massive heavy timber construction from the old growth forests that were available near Vancouver at <b>the</b> turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square footage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was not retail space; mazes of stockrooms and offices comprised much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building's</b> space, outside <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> customers.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis deals about plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> Social and {{shopping}} {{center in the}} city Třebíč and about processing of documentation for this buliding as well. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> is situated in the city area called Borovina.

50|$|In 2011, {{the owners}} {{redesigned}} <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> upper floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was {{converted into a}}n art gallery, similar with <b>the</b> previous use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> while <b>the</b> lower floor was converted into a restaurant with an architecture that is similar in language with old Batavian architecture.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, the capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings,</b> {{the nature of the}} space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E

5|$|One such {{community}} was Linn City (originally named Robin’s Nest). Settled in 1843 by Robert Moore, Robert himself built four flour and lumber mills {{along the banks}} of the Willamette. Warehouses, homes, and mills were steadily added until 1861, when a fire destroyed several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings.</b> Efforts at rebuilding the small town entirely ceased when the Great Flood of 1862 struck, wiping out the remaining buildings.|$|E
5|$|Paris urban tissue {{began to}} fill and {{overflow}} its 1860 limits from around the 1920s, and because of its density, it has seen few modern constructions since then.
