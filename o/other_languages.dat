5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of <b>other</b> <b>languages.</b> The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into <b>other</b> <b>languages.</b> That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences <b>other</b> <b>languages.</b> Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E

5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from <b>other</b> <b>languages</b> {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to <b>other</b> <b>languages</b> that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} use of the English language globally has {{had an effect on}} <b>other</b> <b>languages,</b> leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of <b>other</b> <b>languages.</b> This influence of English has led to concerns about language death, and to claims of linguistic imperialism, and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.|$|E

I manipulated whether they sometimes used the syntactic properties of adjectives from the <b>other</b> <b>language.</b> The results showed that both grammars of the two languages were activated during bilingual language production. The effect of the grammar of the <b>other</b> <b>language</b> increased in the switch conditions. More inappropriate responses observed when switching from bilinguals’ L 2 to L 1.

40|$|I report three {{experiments}} that examined whether words from one language of bilinguals {{can use the}} syntactic features form the <b>other</b> <b>language</b> and how such syntactic co-activation might influence syntactic processing. In other words, I examined whether there are any cases in which a lexical item inhibits its inherent syntactic feature and uses the syntactic feature(s) that belongs to the <b>other</b> <b>language,</b> instead. In the non-switch condition in experiment 1 and 2, Persian-English bilinguals described pictures using an adjective-noun string from the same language requested. In the switch condition, they used the nouns and adjectives from the <b>other</b> <b>language.</b> In Experiment 3, in the switch condition participants used only the adjectives of noun phrases from the <b>other</b> <b>language.</b> The results showed that bilinguals may inhibit the activation of a word’s syntactic feature and use the syntactic property from the <b>other</b> <b>language</b> instead (e. g., pirāhane (N) black). As the combinatorial node (the node that specify different kinds of syntactic structures in which a word can be used) of a used adjective retains activation at least temporarily, bilinguals {{are more likely to}} use the same combinatorial node even for an adjective from the <b>other</b> <b>language.</b> Using the syntactic features from the <b>other</b> <b>language</b> increased in the switch conditions. Moreover, more inappropriate responses observed when switching from bilinguals’ L 2 to L 1. The results also revealed that different experimental contexts may lead to different patterns of the control mechanism.
