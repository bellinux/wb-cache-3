40|$|This study {{examines}} the genetic and environmental etiology underlying {{the development of}} <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> skills, {{and the relationship between}} them, {{over a long period of}} developmental time spanning middle childhood and adolescence. It focuses particularly on the differential relationship between language and two different aspects of reading: <b>reading</b> <b>fluency,</b> and <b>reading</b> comprehension. Structural equation models were applied to language and reading data at 7, 12, and 16 years from the large-scale TEDS twin study. A series of multivariate twin models show a clear patterning of <b>oral</b> language with <b>reading</b> comprehension, as distinct from reading fluency: significant but moderate genetic overlap between <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> (genetic correlation rg =. 48 -. 58 at 7, 12 and 16) contrasts with almost complete genetic overlap between <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> comprehension (rg =. 80, at 12 and 16). This pattern is even clearer in a latent factors model, fit to the data aggregated across ages, in which a single factor representing <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> comprehension is correlated with – but distinct from – a second factor representing <b>reading</b> <b>fluency.</b> A distinction between <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> is also apparent in different developmental trajectories: while the heritability of oral language increases over the period from 7 to 16 years (from h 2 =. 27 to. 45), the heritability of <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> is high and stable over the same period of time (h 2 =. 68 –. 77).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the effects of two {{instructional}} approaches designed to improve the <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> of 2 nd-grade children. The first approach was based on Stahl and Heubach’s (2005) fluency-oriented reading instruction (FORI) and involved the scaffolded, repeated reading of grade-level texts over the course of each week. The second was a wide-reading approach that also involved scaffolded instruction, but that incorporated the reading of 3 different grade-level texts each week and provided significantly less opportunity for repetition. By the end of the school year, FORI and wide-reading approaches showed similar benefits for standardized measures of word reading efficiency and reading comprehension skills compared to control approaches, although the benefits of the wide-reading approach emerged earlier and included <b>oral</b> text <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> skill. Thus, we conclude that fluency instruction that emphasizes extensive <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> of grade-level text using scaffolded approaches is effective for promoting reading development in young learners...|$|R
40|$|Text <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> – {{the ability}} to read quickly, {{accurately}} and with a natural intonation – has been proposed as a predictor of reading comprehension. In the current study, we examined the role of <b>oral</b> text <b>reading</b> <b>fluency,</b> defined as text reading rate and text reading prosody, as a contributor to reading comprehension outcomes in addition to decoding efficiency and language comprehension. One hundred and six Dutch primary school children from fourth grade participated in this study and were assessed on decoding efficiency, vocabulary, syntactic ability, <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> performance and <b>reading</b> comprehension skills. Regression analysis showed that text reading prosody, not text reading rate, explained additional variance in reading comprehension performance when decoding efficiency and language comprehension were controlled for.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} reading and reading development. The majority of these studies, however, focused on <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> {{rather than on the}} more dominant silent reading mode. Similarly, it is common practice to assess <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> abilities rather than silent reading abilities in schools and in diagnosis of reading impairments. More important, insights gained through examinations of <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> tend to be generalized to silent reading. In the current study, we examined whether such generalizations are justified. We directly compared <b>oral</b> and silent <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> by examining whether these reading modes relate to the same underlying skills. In total, 132 fourth graders read words, sentences, and text orally, and 123 classmates read the same material silently. As underlying skills, we considered phonological awareness, rapid naming, and visual attention span. All skills correlated significantly with both reading modes. Phonological awareness contributed equally to <b>oral</b> and silent <b>reading.</b> Rapid naming, however, correlated more strongly with <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> than with silent reading. Visual attention span correlated equally strongly with both reading modes but showed a significant unique contribution only to silent reading. In short, we showed that <b>oral</b> and silent <b>reading</b> indeed are fairly similar reading modes, based on the relations with reading-related cognitive skills.

F tests were calculated for comparison of the means and also to determine if there were nonparallel trends across time for the dependent variables. In addition, a correlation matrix was developed to determine if there was a relationship among the four dependent variables. ^ It was hypothesized that the means of the experimental group would be significantly greater than the means of the control group on the four language factors.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between reading and {{time in the}} <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> of an authentic, connected text is conceptualized using a hydrological "flow" metaphor in this theoretical dissertation. The concept of <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> in <b>oral</b> and silent <b>reading</b> is critically examined. The concepts of "reading fluency" and "reading rate" have historically {{been part of a}} word identification view of reading. In this view, the act of reading is defined as the ability to identify words. Accordingly, <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> is characterized as rapid and accurate word identification. In an alternative sociopsycholinguistic transactional view (the view taken in this dissertation) reading is described as a meaning construction process in which a reader constructs a personal meaning by transacting with a written text. The concept of <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> is supplanted with a hydrological reading-as-flow metaphor. In this dissertation, a deconstruction of "reading fluency" is initially provided. Next, a definition of "reading flow" is offered along with a procedure for its documentation. The procedure makes extensive use of miscue analysis. This is followed by a fine-grained analysis of reading and time relationships for several readers reading orally. Major findings include that <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> rate varies throughout a text in response to readers' employment of cognitive reading strategies; reading rate varies for both effective and proficient readers; the variability of reading rate can be represented as a quantity.

In this thesis we researched the reading of 4 th grade children with specific focus on the <b>reading</b> <b>fluency.</b> We prepared a program for increasing <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> focusing on <b>reading</b> technique and speed. The program was applied on six 4 th grade students of the Središče ob Dravi primary school. The program included 9 sessions, with parent involvement in homework each other week. The session included making reading material with children, presentations and applications of strategies for increasing <b>reading</b> <b>fluency</b> and fluency measurement. In the research we used a method following the example of CBM (Curriculum Based Measurement of <b>oral</b> <b>reading).</b> The method is based on continuous monitoring and evaluation of the child’s progress. The fluency was measured {{as the number of}} correctly read words per minute, with well-defined rules for the correctness of a read single word. Additionally we conducted surveys about the satisfaction with the program on the students and their parents.

Furthermore, it is important to maintain the student’s motivation by selecting appropriate reading materials, based on his interests. ...|$|R
