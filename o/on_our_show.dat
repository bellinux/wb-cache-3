We're {{not in the business}} of offending people. We're in the business of making people laugh." [...] The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of the second grade, when he started at a Cheyenne, Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year. Parker said, [...] "It was brutal ... Everybody already had their little groups and the year was almost over, so I wasn't going to fit into any of them, and I just wanted to destroy and kill, which was the inspiration for this show." ...|$|E

5000|$|As Another Side of Bob Dylan was {{prepared}} for release, Dylan premiered his new songs at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1964. The festival also marked Dylan's first meeting with Johnny Cash; Dylan was already an admirer of Cash's music, and vice versa. The two spent a night jamming together in Joan Baez's room at the Viking Motor Inn. According to Cash, [...] "we were so happy to finally meet each other that we were jumping on the beds like kids." [...] The next day, Cash performed Dylan's [...] "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" [...] {{as part of his}} set, telling the audience that [...] "we've been doing it <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>shows</b> all over the country, trying to tell the folks about Bob, that we think he's the best songwriter of the age since Pete Seeger...Sure do." ...|$|R

But on the night following, it abated somewhat; {{and in the morning}} we went to the village to seek for food, being so famished with hunger that we lost all feeling of danger and all wish to escape in our desire to satisfy the cravings of nature. But no sooner had we {{obtained}} food than we began to wish that we had rather endeavoured to make our escape into the mountains. This we attempted to do soon afterwards; but the natives were now able to look after us, and <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>showing</b> a disposition to avoid observation and make towards the mountains, we were seized by three warriors, who once more bound our wrists and thrust us into our former prison.|$|R
500|$|The episode makes {{mention of}} several MCU films, {{including}} Marvel's The Avengers, , , [...] and Ant-Man, while {{the appearance of}} Sadler as President Ellis and his announcement of an anti-superhuman task force are {{the beginning of the}} series tying in with [...] As Whedon says, [...] "When we came into the Marvel [...] Universe in the first films, there were very, very few people with powers. Now they are in a new world and the rules {{are going to have to}} change....a lot of those same themes [...] will be addressed <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>show.</b> How they tie in is a question mark for all involved, but we would definitely be dealing with some of those same themes." [...] The presidential address was broadcast by the fictional news station WHiH, which has been seen throughout the universe.

500|$|The {{fourth season}} explores {{the concept of}} Life Model Decoys (LMDs), which were first {{referenced}} in The Avengers, and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU. On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously {{did not want to}} explore the concept before the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that [...] "with Doctor Strange coming out this year, the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters," [...] referring to the exploration of magic. [...] "We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>show</b> that we feel fits with that shift." [...] The season also continues storylines from the second season of Agent Carter, with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company Roxxon, a mainstay of the MCU. In August 2017, Emily VanCamp said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of Sharon Carter for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series Revenge.|$|E
500|$|The season's {{exploring}} of supernatural {{and mystical}} concepts ties-in {{with the release}} of Doctor Strange, the first MCU film to explore magic. In addition to the Darkhold, this includes the introduction of Ghost Rider, with Whedon explaining in July 2016, that [...] "the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters [...] We felt that [...] was obviously a great character that we’d love to have <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>show</b> that we feel fits with that shift." [...] Whedon pointed out that the previous tie-ins were sometimes [...] "very direct", and other times [...] "more thematic. The tie this year will feel more of a reflection of , less an interweaving plot." [...] He added, [...] "Hopefully some of the questions that we’re asking will be answered by [...] then pose some new themes and ideas for us to explore." [...] "Deals with Our Devils", aired after the release of Doctor Strange, sees Aida create a portal to rescue Coulson and Fitz from another dimension. The visuals for these are intentionally reminiscent of those used in the film. Bell added that the Darkhold [...] "feels like it belongs in the library in Kathmandu", referring to the Kamar-Taj library seen in Doctor Strange.|$|E

500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>show,</b> but in the cinematic universe".|$|E
500|$|In June 2015, it was {{revealed}} that the season would include the Secret Warriors team by introducing Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name. The episode [...] "Emancipation" [...] is set in the aftermath of Civil War, and deals with how the Secret Warriors and other Inhumans are affected by the Sokovia Accords, with some members of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team feeling [...] "Inhumans should be registered and [...] who feel that's a first step to them being sequestered, imprisoned, exterminated." [...] Wen noted that [...] "The connection is there, but it’s also very tenuous at this point, because S.H.I.E.L.D. has become so isolated with what’s going on with the Avengers and them not knowing still that Coulson is alive." [...] On how the themes of Civil War allowed the series to make more of a philosophical tie-in than with previous films, Whedon stated that [...] "we do have people across the globe who have powers <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>show</b> and there would be varying reactions to that. A lot of fear, some excitement, some people wanting to use it for good, some people wanting to use it for evil. So, a lot of those same themes [...] will be addressed on our show." [...] Bennet added, [...] "we've been dealing with the bigger issues of Civil War on a smaller, more personal scale for a while now. It's been building. We've been having our own mini version of Civil War." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Babeu, {{the sheriff}} of Pinal County, Arizona, {{appeared}} on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, {{he referred to}} James Edwards as a [...] "great American". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, {{saying that he had}} not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was [...] "hoodwinked" [...] into appearing on the show and that he rejects [...] "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that [...] "Of all the people we’ve interviewed on this radio show, I would say the only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke." [...] Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: [...] "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>show,</b> for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie." [...] As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.|$|E

She received a standing ovation from the audience and the approval of all four judges. Piers Morgan told Steel, [...] "We have seen a lot of children <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>show</b> over the past three series and I have never heard any of them sing as well as you do". [...] Kelly Brook was in tears and called her performance, [...] "beautiful and lovely". Media reports at the time claimed that Steel had referred to Cowell as a bully for critical comments he made after her first appearance on the show; however, a blog at a Lancashire newspaper's web site that was attributed to Steel and her mother denied that she had ever made such a comment. Commentators and mainstream media outlets speculated that she might defeat Susan Boyle, who had made an impression worldwide in the first show of the series. [...] Over thirteen million viewers watched Steel's performance and, within one day of a video of her performance being posted on YouTube, over a million viewers had seen her worldwide. She was interviewed on US television via satellite link during NBC's Today show.|$|E

2500|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft, and they were changed to be more appealing in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. For example, while an early draft of the pilot script had Mark saying he didn't care about Leslie or the pit but would support her plan because he liked Ann Perkins and wanted an excuse {{to spend more time}} with her, the finished pilot had Mark backing Leslie because he admired her passion and drive. Schur said the writing staff strove to avoid the type of cynical humor prevalent in most television comedies at the time, and wanted the characters to have genuine appreciation for each other. Schur said of this, [...] "I've never liked mean-spirited comedy. The characters <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>show</b> make fun of each other, but not in a biting, angry way. And there's no shortage of conflict in the world of government." [...] The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season as if it were a single television pilot. Daniels felt due to pre-expectations from viewers familiar with The Office, the first-season episodes were [...] "just about trying to tell people what we weren't", and that the writers had a better understanding of the characters by season two and could better write to their strengths.|$|E

[...] Eyewitness Jerry Schilling writes, [...] "The way Elvis looked out at us at that moment, I thought I could see a mix of hurt over the attacks he’d been subjected to in the press, and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing." [...] (According to historian Tim Parrish, Presley's manager, Colonel Parker, [...] "had threatened to remove Elvis from the show if Sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that Elvis's 'gyrations' were immoral.") Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: [...] "So they arranged to put me on television. At that particular time there was a lot of controversy—you didn't see people moving—out in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show. They photographed me from the waist up. And Sullivan's standing over there saying, 'Sumbitch.' I said, 'Thank you, Ed, thank you.' I didn't know what he was calling me, at the time." ...|$|E
