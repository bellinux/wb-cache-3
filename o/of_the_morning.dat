5|$|Realising {{that the}} 22nd Guards Brigade {{group would be}} {{vulnerable}} to German armoured counterattacks in the open ground around Bir Wair and Mussaid, Brigadier Gott withdrew it during the early hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of 16 May. By 10:00, the infantry had taken up new positions back at Halfaya Pass, although the 7th Armoured Brigade group was ordered to remain west of Fort Capuzzo for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{was born}} in Heraklion, {{the capital city of}} the Greek island of Crete. His {{favourite}} footballer growing up was Marco van Basten. Samaras was also a keen basketball fan and his father, Ioannis Samaras, often let him stay up until the early hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> so he could watch his hero Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|The {{timetable}} for January 1883 shows {{a variety of}} passenger, goods and mixed trains, giving five passenger services down to Amlwch, and six up.

The majority of trains still terminated at Gaerwen. As Llangefni held a livestock market on a Thursday, an extra service from Bangor to Llangefni on Thursdays was introduced by the 1896 timetable.|$|E

Re-arming had been under way for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40, the delayed scout plane from Tone signaled that it had sighted a sizable American naval force to the east, but neglected to describe its composition.

5|$|About half-past {{one o'clock}} on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E

5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or the early hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, {{even in the absence}} of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|At RAF Uxbridge, AOC No. 11 Group RAF Keith Park and his {{controllers}} directed No. 501 Squadron RAF and its 12 Hawker Hurricanes, {{already in}} the air, to Canterbury at 20,000 feet. They had been {{on their way back}} to RAF Gravesend having spent most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> on patrol operating from RAF Hawkinge near Folkestone. Within minutes eight more Squadrons were dispatched to meet them; two from Kenley, two from Biggin Hill and one each from North Weald, Martlesham, Heath, Manston and Rochford.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> an {{infantry}} battalion from the 22nd Armoured Brigade group, took up defensive {{positions in the}} town; the troops at Point 213 had been cut off and a force was assembled to extricate them. The relief force was unable to advance on the ridge, and when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00 the trapped squadron surrendered. More German troops had arrived, and engaged the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the road back to Livry.|$|E

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes during the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans unbeaten on 47. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller at the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> which would help break up the wicket {{and make it more}} likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia before setting England a target. The hosts needed to beat Australia to avoid a series defeat. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would make the surface less favourable for batting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of November 7, 1825, the very morning the {{legislature}} was to convene, Sharp was assassinated. Charges were made that Old Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these charges by introducing a resolution condemning Sharp's murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer's capture. When assassin Jereboam O. Beauchamp was apprehended, {{it became clear that}} the motivation for the killing was personal, not political. (Beauchamp's wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he wanted to avoid any implication in the matter.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Tháº£o's main partner PhÃ¡t headed towards Tan Son Nhut Air Base â€” the country's {{military}} headquarters â€” {{to capture}} {{it with an}} assortment of marines, paratroopers and special forces troops. At the time, most of the senior officers had been in meetings with American officials at Tan Son Nhut since the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and KhÃ¡nh left at 12:30. The plotters had secured the cooperation of someone working inside the Joint General Staff headquarters. This collaborator was supposed to have closed the gate so KhÃ¡nh would be held up, but left them open. Some of the other senior officers in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and were caught by PhÃ¡t's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings in the complex remained under junta control.|$|E
