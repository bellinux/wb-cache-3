With Adirondack, McGrattan abandoned fighting and tried to play an all-round game in the hopes <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> to the NHL.|$|E

30|$|The figure shows {{a declining}} {{trend of the}} rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to capital. In 2010, the {{last year when the}} {{estimate}} is available, the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> was as low as 5.1  %. Note that this is the average rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to capital <b>of</b> the whole country. For firms with some monopoly power, the marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to capital is lower than the average rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> because the latter includes the monopoly profit, and therefore the average marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to capital <b>of</b> the whole country is below 5.1  %. Furthermore, because the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to capital varies across investment projects, there must be many projects with marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> even lower than 5.1  %. These results about the rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to capital suggest that one needs to be concerned about overinvestment, especially if the declining trend continues.|$|R

5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for his style <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> the football; upon receiving the ball, {{he would run}} straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them.

40|$|The {{economic}} value {{of investment in}} education has typically been measured by its rate <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> frequently estimated by the internal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> or the earning function approach. Given {{the importance of the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> estimates for individuals and countries, especially developing countries, in making decision on educational investment, we need to know how these methods compare as empirical researchers have used only one method, mainly due to data constraints. This study presents and compares the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> estimates obtained from these two methods using household data‐sets that have been typically employed in such studies. The results of the study confirm the previously established stylized facts about the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to education. In addition, the internal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> approach exhibits ‘diminishing returns’ to schooling, reflecting ever rising cost of higher increments of schooling, while the earning function approach yields the opposite pattern, reflecting the greater relative increase associated in earnings with additional schooling. Moreover, the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> is greater using the internal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> approach than the earning function approach. Finally, the internal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> approach reveals a more accurate estimate <b>of</b> the earning <b>return</b> to the actual amount invested in schooling, whereas the earning function approach is more thorough in measuring earning differences associated with additional schooling. cost of education, economics of education, investment in human capital, rate <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> Turkey,...|$|R
