Also a deal with the fabrication of mechanical equipment to separate oil from the water. <b>Oil</b> and water <b>separator</b> is mechanical equipment, which is used in the environment pollution control from <b>oil</b> spillage. <b>Oil</b> <b>separator</b> helps in removing the oily from the waste water. By removing the oil from waste water, it becomes free of oil pollution. This is mainly due to oleophilic material used in the <b>oil</b> <b>separator.</b> This <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> can be used in the effluent treatment plant. This project consists of construction, fabrication details, assembly, working and applications of <b>oil</b> and water <b>separator.</b> The belt speed, oil recovery rate and oil recovery efficiency are the operating parameters of <b>oil</b> <b>separator.</b> The <b>oil</b> recovery rate and the oil recovery efficiency, the two most important parameters displayed the performance of the <b>oil</b> <b>separator...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The lube <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> {{is widely}} used in lube oil system of {{merchant}} vessel. The lube <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> functions to purify the lube oil to ensure its good working performance. The working condition of the <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The lube <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the separator is introduced. The separator is dismantled according to the procedure. After cleaning some parts found dirty and replacing some sealing elements, the separator is reassembled. When starting the separating process again, the failure remains. Through further analyzing the structure and working principle of the separator, the trouble spot is found out. After removing the failure, the separator finally is repaired. To prevent similar accident occurring again, some suggestions are presented. Oil Leakage from Water-outlet In {{the operation of the}} lube <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> working for the main engine, failure warning is emitted,and then lube oil leakage from the water-outlet is found.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the compressor, oil {{is added to the}} refrigerant during installation or commissioning. The type of oil may be mineral or synthetic to suit the compressor type, and also chosen so as not to react with the refrigerant type and other components in the system. In small refrigeration systems the oil is allowed to circulate throughout the whole circuit, but care must be taken to design the pipework and components such that oil can drain back under gravity to the compressor. In larger more distributed systems, especially in retail refrigeration, the oil is normally captured at an <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> immediately after the compressor, and is in turn re-delivered, by an oil level management system, back to the compressor(s). <b>Oil</b> <b>separators</b> are not 100% efficient so system pipework must still be designed so that oil can drain back by gravity to the <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> or compressor.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A closed type {{crankcase}} ventilation system has been adopted to engines to prevent emission of blow-by gas to atmosphere. In the early closed type {{crankcase ventilation}} system, blow-by gas which contains engine lubricating oil is re-circulated into the intake system. The blow-by gas containing oil mist leads to increased harmful emissions and engine problems. To reduce loss of the engine oil, a highly-efficient oil separation device is required. Principle of a cyclone <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> is to utilize centrifugal force in the <b>separator</b> and, therefore, <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> designs depend on rotational flow which causes the centrifugal force. In this paper, flow characteristics and oil separation performances for cyclone type designs are calculated with CFD methodology. In the CFD model, oil particle was injected on a inlet surface with Rosin-Rammler distribution and uniform distribution. The major design parameters considered in the analysis model are inlet area, cone length and outlet depth of the <b>oil</b> <b>separator.</b> As results, reducing inlet area and increasing cone length increase oil separation performance. Changes in outlet depth could avoid interference betwee...|$|R

An <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> (7) separates <b>oil</b> and water fractions from the water/oil sludge mixture. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A sand storage unit and an oil storage unit (6) hold separated sand or separated oil and if appropriate, oil sludge. Adsorption filters (4, 8) clean the separated water. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding method of treatment. Preferred features: Storage (9. 1) is provided for separated oil sludge. Water outlets from the sand <b>separator</b> and/or <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> are each connected to an adsorption filter (4, 8). The adsorption filter is coke-filled, the coke being made from lignite or hard coal. The extraction unit can remove separated oil and oil/sludge mixture separately. The separated oil is introduced {{directly into the}} oil storage unit. The <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> is a coalescer. A screw classifier (9) further separates oil sludge removed by the <b>oil</b> <b>separator.</b> A vacuum chamber (1) is connected with its inlet to the extraction unit for water/sand mixture. Its output {{is connected to the}} sand separator, e. g. a hydrocyclone or a thickener. A screw classifier further separates sand removed in the sand separator. A water storage tank holds the cleaned water. The extraction unit includes a coarse sieve. USE - A mobile treatment unit carrying out disposal from oil separation plant. ADVANTAGE - This unit disposes from e. g. an oil separation plant of an industrial concern, the latter operating in accordance with DIN 1999. It treats on the spot. This contrasts with the earlier method of carrying off and possibly re-mixing the contents of the separation plant. This special waste is costly to dispose of.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Oils, greases, {{and grit}} which collect on an {{aircraft}} during flight are removed on the U. S. Air Force washracks using an alkaline, water-base cleaner. Waste-flows from these washracks may include {{in addition to}} free oils, emulsified oils, and alkaline, water-base cleaners several other constituents such as acid skin brightners, paint stripping solvents, paint scrapings, and volatile cleaning solvents. A study of aircraft washrack waste characteristics and treatment methods is presented in this thesis. The first section is a review of available literature including past experimental analysis. A survey of current washrack installations and treatment facilities at 65 Air Force bases in the United States forms the second section. The final section of this thesis contains an experimental analysis of the washrack wastes and the treatment facility at Portland AFB, Oregon. Oil concentration, five-day BOD., suspended solids, total solids, and effluent over-flow are {{used to measure the}} waste characteristics and flow and to determine the efficiency of a gravity <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> at the Portland base. A testing procedure for determining oil concentrations is developed. Tests of the inflow and outflow of the gravity <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> showed the following ranges. Waste Characteristics: 5 -day BOD.
