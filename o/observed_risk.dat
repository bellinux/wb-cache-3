Guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend statin treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190mg/dL or those with diabetes, age 40–75 with LDL-C 70–190mg/dl; or in those with a 10-year risk of developing heart attack or stroke of 7.5% or more. In this latter group, statin assignment was not automatic, but was recommended to occur only after a clinician-patient risk discussion with shared decision making where other risk factors and lifestyle are addressed, the potential for benefit from a statin is weighed against the potential for adverse effects or drug interactions and informed patient preference is elicited.

40|$|Introduction: Clinicians use {{different}} {{breast cancer risk}} models for patients considered at average and above-average risk, based largely on their family histories and genetic factors. We used longitudinal cohort data from women whose breast cancer risks span the full spectrum to determine the genetic and nongenetic covariates that differentiate the performance of two commonly used models that include nongenetic factors - BCRAT, also called Gail model, generally used for patients with average risk and IBIS, also called Tyrer Cuzick model, generally used for patients with above-average risk. Methods: We evaluated {{the performance of the}} BCRAT and IBIS models as currently applied in clinical settings for 10 -year absolute risk of breast cancer, using prospective data from 1, 857 women over a mean follow-up length of 8. 1 years, of whom 83 developed cancer. This cohort spans the continuum of breast cancer risk, with some subjects at lower than average population risk. Therefore, the wide variation in individual risk makes it an interesting population to examine model performance across subgroups of women. For model calibration, we divided the cohort into quartiles of model-assigned risk and compared differences between assigned and <b>observed</b> <b>risks</b> using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) chi-squared statistic. For model discrimination, we computed the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and the case risk percentiles (CRPs). Results: The 10 -year risks assigned by BCRAT and IBIS differed (range of difference 0. 001 to 79. 5). The mean BCRAT- and IBIS-assigned risks of 3. 18 % and 5. 49 %, respectively, were lower than the cohort's 10 -year cumulative probability of developing breast cancer (6. 25 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 5. 0 to 7. 8 %). Agreement between assigned and <b>observed</b> <b>risks</b> was better for IBIS (HL X 42 = 7. 2, P value 0. 13) than BCRAT (HL X 42 = 22. 0, P value < 0. 001). The IBIS model also showed better discrimination (AUC = 69. 5 %, CI = 63. 8 % to 75. 2 %) than did the BCRAT model (AUC = 63. 2 %, CI = 57. 6 % to 68. 9 %). In almost all covariate-specific subgroups, BCRAT mean risks were significantly lower than the <b>observed</b> <b>risks,</b> while IBIS risks showed generally good agreement with <b>observed</b> <b>risks,</b> even in the subgroups of women considered at average risk (for example, no family history of breast cancer, BRCA 1 / 2 mutation negative). Conclusions: Models developed using extended family history and genetic data, such as the IBIS model, also perform well in women considered at average risk (for example, no family history of breast cancer, BRCA 1 / 2 mutation negative). Extending such models to include additional nongenetic information may improve performance in women across the breast cancer risk continuum...|$|R

40|$|Rapid Fire Session 10 : Vascular {{risk factors}} and risk estimationTopic: Epidemiology of CVD; The Risk Factor ConceptOBJECTIVE: The 2013 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association {{guidelines}} recommended the Pooled Cohort equations for evaluation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk of individuals. We investigated {{the usefulness of the}} Pooled Cohort equations in Chinese by validating this risk prediction model using the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study (CRISPS) cohort. METHODS: The Hong Kong CRISPS is a population-based prospective cohort study of cardiovascular risk factors among 2895 Chinese men and women (aged 25 - 74 years) initiated in 1994. Cardiovascular (CV) events were ascertained until December 2013. The discrimination and calibration of the Pooled Cohort equations was evaluated and compared with the Framingham risk equation. A Hosmer-Lemeshow Chi-square statistic (X 2) 0. 7). However, the calibration score of both models was unacceptable in men (Pooled Cohort X 2 = 24. 1, Framingham X 2 = 20. 1). Since the Framingham model systematically over-estimated CV risk [average predicted risk 18. 3 % (95 % CI 15. 5 - 21. 0) versus average <b>observed</b> <b>risk</b> 13. 4 % (95 % CI 11. 0 - 15. 8) ], this can be corrected by recalibration of the model using the CRISPS data [average predicted risk 11. 5 % (95 % CI 9. 2 - 13. 7) versus average <b>observed</b> <b>risk</b> 11. 8 % (95 % CI 9. 6 - 14. 1) ]. Recalibration cannot be applied to the Pooled Cohort model because the degree of miscalibration varied across the different risk categories. In women, although calibration of Pooled Cohort (X 2 = 10. 1) and Framingham model (X 2 = 12. 1) appeared similar, the accuracy of the Framingham model was better [average predicted risk 6. 2 % (95 % CI 4. 6 - 7. 7) versus average <b>observed</b> <b>risk</b> 6. 3 % (95 % CI 4. 8 - 7. 9) ] than the Pooled Cohort model [average predicted risk 4. 8 % (95 % CI 3. 3 - 6. 3) vs average <b>observed</b> <b>risk</b> 6. 9 % (95 % CI 5. 1 - 8. 7) ]. CONCLUSIONS: Risk prediction models should be able to discriminate between individuals with and without disease, and also well-calibrated so that predicted risk estimates matches as closely as possible the <b>observed</b> <b>risk</b> in the population. The Pooled Cohort equations provide poor calibration and moderate discrimination in Hong Kong Chinese, especially in men.

40|$|Aim: Primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the precision of UKPDS model in predicting the CAD risk in type 2 DM patients by quantifying its discrimination and calibration. Material and methods: Observational study with a cohort of 1, 404 type 2 DM patients from Republic of Macedonia prescribed insulin treatment in the period from September 2002 till January 2004. UKPDS model uses nine risk factors for CAD risk assessment in type 2 DM patients: age at diabetes diagnosis, duration of diabetes, gender, race, smoking, systolic blood pressure, HbA 1 c, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Endpoints defined in this study were cases with CAD by 01 January 2012. Discrimination was examined by using the с-statistics (aROC), and calibration by using the Hosmer–Lemeshow χ 2 (HLχ 2) goodness-of-fit test. Prognostic value was evaluated by the graphic presentation of deciles of predicted and the corresponding <b>observed</b> <b>risk,</b> and by the visual inspection of the calibration plots. Results: Out of the study cohort, 835 patients (59. 5 % of the cohort) were identified for analysis followed for a mean of 9. 4 ± 0. 5 years. <b>Observed</b> <b>risk</b> was 36. 4 % (95 % CI 33. 2 - 39. 8) compared to the predicted risk for CAD by UKPDS model of 20. 8 %, i. e. UKPDS model underestimated the <b>observed</b> <b>risk</b> by 43 %. Discrimination evaluated by c-statistics was 0. 59 (95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 63), p< 0. 001, and the discrimination power of UKPDS model in CAD risk prediction was determined as low (0. 5 - 0. 7). Calibration evaluated with the use of HLχ 2 test was 5. 74 (p= 0. 68), resulting in generally good calibration of UKPDS model in CAD risk assessment. Graphic presentation of deciles of predicted and corresponding <b>observed</b> <b>risk,</b> and the calibration plots, demonstrated larger deviation between observed and predicted risk in deciles of lower predicted risk, and increased level of concordance in deciles of higher predicted risks. Discussion and conclusion: In our study, UKPDS model demonstrated higher predictive ability in patients with higher predicted risk compared to patients with lower predicted risk. Recalibration of UKPDS model is needed to further improve its predictive ability in diabetic population from Republic of Macedonia, in order to take into consideration the population characteristics, such as very high cardiovascular mortality risk...|$|E
