40|$|This paper evaluates {{medicine}} prices, their {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines on the market (originator brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”), using an established methodology. Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines (originator brand, lowestpriced generic and similar medicines) were collected from public, private and popular pharmacies (N= 56) across six cities in Southern Brazil. Median prices obtained are divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP for originator brands, respectively. <b>Mean</b> <b>availability</b> was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % for originator brands, generics and similars, respectively. The number of working days needed {{to pay for a}} complete medicine treatment (affordability) varied considerably between medicines aimed at treating acute and chronic diseases and by type of medicine. In the public sector, the <b>mean</b> <b>availability</b> of similar medicines was 2 - 7 times higher than that of generics. The <b>mean</b> overall <b>availability</b> in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, <b>mean</b> <b>availability</b> was greater than 90 % in all cities. This analysis finds that availability of medicines in the public sector does not meet the challenge for supplying essential medicines to the entire population, as stated in the Brazilian constitution. This has unavoidable repercussions for affordability, particularly amongst the lower socio-economic strata. Policies targeted to reduce the prices of the generics need to be implemented in Brazil, as well as making them more widely available. Popular pharmacies may help overcome the lack of medicines in the public sector, but the limited number of medicines distributed in these facilities is of concern...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} a determination method of transport means serviceability {{in a real}} city transport system. The considerations have been demonstrated {{on the basis of}} a real city bus transport system in a chosen agglomeration. The executive subsystem consisting of elementary subsystems of the type human – technical object (operator – transport means) whose serviceability and reliability have a direct influence on capability to perform the transport task is directly responsible for accomplishment of the city transport system tasks. In order to develop a model of means of transport serviceability there were determined significant states of the operational use process and there was made a division and reduction of the number of states in terms of the availability criterion. On this basis, an event model of the process of transport means operational use, and then a mathematical model of this process, were built with the assumption that its model is a homogenous Markov’s process X(t). Next, boundary values of availability coefficient for the distinguished availability levels of transport means used in the city transport system were determined for operational data obtained from a real city bus transport system. The discussed model for determination of transport <b>means</b> <b>availability</b> is an initial one, developed {{on the basis of a}} nine-state model of operational use. In further part of the paper, there will be developed a resultant model of transport <b>means</b> <b>availability</b> determination (semi-Markov’s sixteen-state model), being a component of a wider, decision model for creation and assessment of transport <b>means</b> <b>availability...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} which of the three selected taxes, incomes, sales, and property and combinations of the three selected taxes in each of the three selected taxation Models I, II, and III, produced the most equitable distribution of the tax burden upon the entire mean family total income group population in Indiana. Mean tax burden scores were computed for each tax and combination of taxes, income, sales, and property in each of the three selected taxation Models I, II, and III, and then compared to determine which of the three selected taxation Models I, II, or III produced the most of the tax burden upon the entire mean group population. One Group Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance was used to statistically analyze four null hypotheses and twelve sub-hypotheses formulated to test if a statistically significant difference existed between the income, sales, property and combined tax burdens in each of the three selected taxation Models I, II, and III. None of the four null hypotheses were rejected. Findings of the study revealed that combined tax burdens in taxation Model III were larger than the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> income, sales, property and combined tax burdens in either taxation Model I and II. However, when statistically compared and analyzed no statistically significant differences were found to exist between the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> income, property, sales and combined tax burdens in each of the three taxation Models I, II, and III. Therefore, when compared, neither taxation Model I, II, or III produced the most equitable distribution of the income, property, sales or combined tax burden. The following conclusions were drawn from the findings with regard to the equitable distribution of the tax burden in each of the three selected taxation Models I, II, and III. 1. A progressively graduated income tax was utilized in taxation Model III. A flat rate two percent income tax policy was utilized within taxation Model I, and a flat rate two percent income tax policy with an $ 8 per person sales tax credit was utilized within taxation Model III. As a result, the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> income tax burden in taxation Model III was larger (1. 013) than the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> income tax burden in either taxation Model I (1. 000), or taxation Model II (1. 009). However, when the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> tax burden scores in taxation Models I, II, and III were statistically compared and analyzed, the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> income tax burdens in taxation Model I, II, and III were found not to be significantly different. The evidence suggests, then, that neither income tax policy utilized in taxation Models I, II, or III produced a significantly more equitable distribution of the income tax burden. 2. Evidence presented and analyzed indicated that property tax relief measures utilized within taxation Model I reduced the statewide property tax rate. As a result, the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> property tax burden in taxation Model I was larger (. 984), than the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> property tax burden (. 977) in taxation Model II. Utilization of a "Modified Minnesota Circuit-Breaker Property Tax Relief Plan" in taxation Model III, however, produced a larger (. 993) <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> property tax burden than either taxation Model I or II. However, when the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> property tax burdens in taxation Models I, II, and III were statistically compared and analyzed, the finding was that the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> property tax burdens in taxation Model I, II, and III were not significantly different. The evidence suggests, then, that neither property tax policy utilized in taxation Models I, II, or III produced a significantly more equitable distribution of the property tax burden. 3. Evidence presented in the review of literature indicated that the utilization of a state sales tax reduces the regressivity of the overall state tax structure. Furthermore, a progressive state income tax was reported to reduce the regressivity of the overall state tax structure even more than thein taxation Model III. As a result, <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> combined tax burden (1. 005) in taxation Model III was indeed larger than the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> combined tax burden in either taxation Model I (. 977) or taxation Model II (. 976). Once again, however, when the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> combined tax burdens in taxation Models I, II, and III were statistically compared and analyzed, no significant difference was to exist between the combined tax burdens in taxation Models I, II, and III. Therefore, evidence presented in the study suggests that neither combination of income, sales, and property tax policies in taxation Models I, II, or III produced a significantly more equitable distribution of the combined tax burden. 4. The <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> sales tax burden in taxation Models I, II, and III were very similar,. 991,. 991, and. 993 respectively. When the <b>observed</b> <b>mean</b> sales tax burdens in taxation Models I, II, and III were statistically compared and analyzed, however, no statistically significant difference was found to exist, even though the sales tax rate in taxation Model I was doubled in order to fund property tax relief measures. The evidence, then, suggests that neither sales tax policy utilized in taxation Models I, II, or III produced a significantly more equitable distribution of the sales tax burden. Thesis (D.

40|$|Given p {{independent}} normal populations, {{we consider}} the problem of estimating the mean of those populations, that based on the observed data, give the strongest signals. We explicitly condition on the ranking of the sample means, and consider a constrained conditional maximum likelihood (CCMLE) approach, avoiding {{the use of any}} priors and of any sparsity requirement between the population means. Our results show that if the <b>observed</b> <b>means</b> are too close together, we should in fact use the grand mean to estimate the mean of the population with the larger sample mean. If they are separated by more than a certain threshold, we should shrink the <b>observed</b> <b>means</b> towards each other.

Unlike other methods, our approach does not need to pre-specify the number of selected populations and the proposed CCMLE is able to perform simultaneous inference.
