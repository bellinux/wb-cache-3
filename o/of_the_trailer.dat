5|$|A {{week after}} the release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> {{more than one million}} people had viewed it through YouTube, {{exceeding}} Deep Silver's expectation of only 100,000 views.

Following the trailer's release, Dead Island became a widely anticipated game.|$|E

It depicted a yellow Program engaged in a light cycle battle with a blue Program, and it prominently featured Jeff Bridges reprising his role as an aged Kevin Flynn (from the first film). At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> the yellow Program showed his face, which appeared identical to Flynn's earlier program Clu (resembling the younger Flynn in Tron).|$|E

5|$|Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer is an {{announcement}} trailer for the 2011 video game Dead Island, which {{was developed by}} Techland and published by Deep Silver. The story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who {{has turned into a}} zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window.

5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives a page from the disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Halo 2 {{was officially}} {{announced}} in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer, subsequently packaged with Halo: Combat Evolved DVDs. A real-time gameplay video was shown at E3 2003, {{which was the}} first actual gameplay seen by the public; it showcased new features such as dual-wielding and improved graphics. Many elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> however, were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded, and the trailer's environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on how big the game environments could be. The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of Halo 2 for nearly a year, and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped.|$|E

5|$|In response, SMRT {{announced}} it was replacing important engineering components on all C151 trains by 2019. This included changing the existing Mitsubishi Electric propulsion system for the newer Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) propulsion system by Toshiba, technology currently used in the Tokyo Metro's 1000 series and 16000 series trains {{as well as the}} Kyushu 305 series and Hankyu 1000 series trains. As of July 2015, train sets 055/056 and 131/132 are trialed with the new propulsion system. In tandem with the replacement of the signalling system on the East-West Line and North-South Line with the newer Thales SelTrac signalling system, new equipment are installed in the passenger compartment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> cars.|$|E
5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> faux <b>trailers</b> before <b>the</b> film also {{received}} mixed reviews. David Ansen of Newsweek approved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailers,</b> writing [...] "Tropic Thunder is <b>the</b> funniest movie <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summer—so funny, in fact, that you start laughing before the film itself has begun." [...] Christy Lemire, {{writing for the}} Associated Press, called <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> [...] "...the best part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trip." [...] Robert Wilonsky <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Village Voice was critical, saying that the trailers' comedy [...] "...resides in <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obvious, easy chuckle." ...|$|R

5|$|The trailer was {{produced}} and {{made by the}} Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director and the director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them {{to create their own}} characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.|$|E
5|$|The next installment, also titled God of War, {{was officially}} {{announced}} at Sony's 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference with a gameplay trailer.

The end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> showed the title God of War and confirmed it is in development for the PlayStation 4. Gameplay in the trailer showed elements similar to role playing games (RPG), such as archery knowledge points, {{as well as a}} Spartan Rage timed-ability during battle. The game will take place many years after the events of God of War III and will be set in the world of Norse mythology; a concept originally considered by David Jaffe after Kratos eliminated the Greek gods.

At E3 2017, another trailer was shown and it was confirmed that the game will release in early 2018.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} enjoyed <b>the</b> fake <b>trailers.</b> Geoff Pevere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Star {{wrote that}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> helps <b>the</b> film establish [...] "its credibility as both mock-artifact and geeky fetish object {{even before the}} opening feature." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety claimed that <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> were [...] "excellent candidates for exploitation immortality." [...] Jeff Vice of Deseret News, who gave the feature films negative reviews, called <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> [...] "... <b>the</b> strongest aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire presentation."

2500|$|Initially the 1960 stock {{cars were}} coupled to two modernised [...] "Standard Stock" [...] trailers, {{numbered}} 4900-4911. Originally {{the cars were}} to have been numbered starting at 4000. Conversion work included <b>the</b> fitting <b>of</b> fluorescent lighting, <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> door indicator lights to <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cars, and painting in silver paint, to match <b>the</b> unpainted aluminium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motor cars. Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> had been built in 1927, and only included two sets of double central doors. Two of these were rebuilt with additional single doors at each end. <b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> were built in 1931, and included the extra single doors when built. Four of these trailers were later fitted with de-icing gear, and carried a 'D' below the running number to indicate this. By 1974, <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> were a serious maintenance problem, and a decision was taken to replace them with single 1938 Stock cars marshalled between the two motor cars, reducing the units from four to three cars. Conversion work included <b>the</b> fitting <b>of</b> two compressors, as <b>the</b> pre-1938 <b>trailers</b> had been equipped with one each, but the process was costly, and only three sets were completed.|$|R
