5|$|Broad Street {{was a major}} {{terminal}} station in the City of London, adjacent to Liverpool Street station. It served as the main terminus of the North London Railway (NLR) network, running from 1865 to 1986. During its lifetime, it catered for mainly local suburban services around London, and over time struggled to compete with <b>other</b> <b>modes</b> of transport, leading to its closure.|$|E

30|$|The global {{shear wall}} {{resistance}} would {{be governed by}} the failure mode A, but the global displacement of CLT wall is not caused by a failure <b>mode</b> only. The <b>other</b> <b>mode</b> would also affect the total global displacement. Therefore, global displacements for the <b>other</b> <b>mode</b> have to be calculated and added to the global displacement of the failure mode A (Eq.  10). At each displacement step, the global displacements of the <b>other</b> <b>mode</b> under the global force of each displacement steps were calculated.|$|R

In the deep-sea genus Stauroteuthis, {{some of the}} muscle cells that control the suckers in most species have been replaced with photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth, making them {{one of the few}} bioluminescent octopuses.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{and kidney}} disease {{can affect the}} {{biological}} activity of analgesics. When people with diminishing liver or kidney function are treated with oral opioids they must be monitored for the possible need to reduce dose, extend dosing intervals, or switch to other opioids or <b>other</b> <b>modes</b> of delivery. The benefit of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be weighed against their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with <b>other</b> <b>modes</b> of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the <b>other</b> <b>modes</b> of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{includes}} additional {{modes of}} play that display elements {{not seen in}} the game's primary scenario. The New Game+ option allows a player that has completed the game to replay the game with all equipment and souls the player had acquired in a previous file. Additionally, the player can opt to start the game in Hard Mode, offering the same gameplay at a higher difficulty level. Two <b>other</b> <b>modes</b> offer alternatives to the standard gameplay. Boss Rush mode involves the player facing all of the game's bosses in quick succession, and is unlocked after the player completes the game once. Julius Mode is an additional mode of play unlocked with the same method. The player takes control of , the member of the Belmont clan featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|In a {{gameplay}} mode {{exclusive to}} Western releases, the Arcade mode converts {{the game in}} a traditional fighting game, with all RPG elements removed and characters' abilities being stripped down to the basics to balance the playing field. Within the Arcade Mode, there are three tiers: Normal, Hard, and Time Attack; beating any tier of the Arcade mode will reward the player with PP (player points) and special items {{that can be used}} in story mode. All characters, including villains, are playable in Arcade mode; for example, Golbez, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Jecht are available for use in this mode from the start, but they still need to be bought via the PP Catalog for use in <b>other</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|E

5|$|NYC Ferry {{was officially}} {{announced}} by the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2015. It was planned to launch in two phases. The first phase launched on May 1, 2017, with service along the East River and to the Rockaways. Routes to Bay Ridge and Astoria respectively started in June and August of that year. A second phase, in 2018, will launch to the Lower East Side and Soundview. A ferry to Coney Island and Stapleton is under consideration. Single-ride trips on the system cost $2.75, with monthly and bike fares also available, {{but there is no}} free transfer to <b>other</b> <b>modes</b> of transport in the city. NYC Ferry also provides free shuttle buses in the Rockaways, connecting to the ferry stop there.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{songs in}} the main setlist are {{available}} from the start. Once a song is unlocked for play within Career Mode, it becomes available for play in all <b>other</b> <b>modes.</b> When working through Career Mode at a specific difficulty level, the next tier of songs is unlocked once the required number of songs on the current tier (3-5, depending on difficulty and console) are completed. Additionally, the encore song for a particular tier is only made available once its requirements are completed. On the Easy difficulty setting, there are no encores available, but the next tier will be unlocked immediately after completing the required {{songs in the}} previous tier.|$|E

All stations can be identified at ground level by signs with a blue T in a circle. Stations outside the center are unmanned since the 1995, with ticket machines for fare purchase; some stations feature kiosks. A system of turnstiles have been installed, but will never be activated due to security issues. All stations have step-free accessibility through at least one entrance (except the inbound platform at Frøen), and the platform height is aligned with the train cars.|$|E

5|$|There are controlled-release {{versions}} of levodopa.

A newer extended-release levodopa preparation {{does seem to be}} more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and <b>other</b> <b>modes</b> of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.|$|E
5|$|Cross Generation of Heroes, the 2008 Wii {{version of}} Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, has an Arcade game mode: the player fights against {{artificial}} intelligence (AI)-controlled opponents {{to reach the}} final boss character, Yami from Ōkami. Time attack and Survival modes are also available, and require the player to defeat every character in the game. While Survival limits health regeneration, Time attack challenges players {{to win in the}} shortest time possible. <b>Other</b> <b>modes</b> include Vs. Mode, in which two players engage in combat, and Original Games, which sees up to four players competing in character-specific minigames. Using money obtained throughout the game, the player may purchase unlockable characters, alternate character costumes, minigames, character profiles, movies, illustrations, and background music. Once purchased, the latter four are viewable in a gallery. The arcade release of Cross Generation of Heroes omits the game modes, and instead features a character selection screen from which a player may compete against either AI opponents or a second player.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. <b>Other</b> <b>modes</b> will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E
