5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific {{theory of the}} nature of matter, which states that matter is composed <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> units called atoms. It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> inheritable units {{was first}} suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E

The high-frequency wave {{sent by the}} tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as {{to pick up the}} high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> values).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E

However, Eliurus molars are slightly more hypsodont {{than those of}} Voalavo. The third upper and lower molars are smaller relative to the second molars in Voalavo than in Eliurus. Perhaps as a consequence, the upper third molar lacks discrete laminae in Voalavo, and the lower third molar has only two laminae (three in Eliurus). There are three roots under each upper molar and two under each lower.|$|E

Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin {{on the role}} of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} matter {{is made up}} <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> units is a very old one, {{appearing}} in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India.

It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that could easily be explained using the concept of atoms.|$|E

The American robin is often among the first songbirds singing as dawn rises or hours before, and last as evening sets in. It usually sings from a high perch in a tree.
