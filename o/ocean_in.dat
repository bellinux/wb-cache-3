5|$|Canada {{occupies}} much of {{the continent}} of North America, sharing land borders with the contiguous United States to the south, and the US state of Alaska to the northwest. Canada stretches from the Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>in</b> the east to the Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>in</b> the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean. Greenland is to the northeast. By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, {{the difference being due}} to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Pułaski was initially used as a French and, after the Fall of France, a British troopship. Pułaski sailed variously in the North Atlantic, between African ports, and in the Indian <b>Ocean.</b> <b>In</b> 1946, the ship's name was changed to Empire Penryn and continued trooping duties under the management of Lamport & Holt. She was scrapped in 1949 at Blyth.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} far from land, the waves triggered by Liza {{were able to}} reach California, where they combined with high tide, threatening beachfront homes that had weakened foundations after a previous tide. The hurricane was responsible for sweeping hundreds of Labor Day swimmers out into the <b>ocean</b> <b>in</b> Zuma Beach and Newport Beach, {{all of whom were}} saved by lifeguards. The waves also tore off a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) near Laguna Beach.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Hollanda was {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclone in Mauritius in 19years. It formed on February6, 1994, in the central Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>in</b> the southern hemisphere. The cyclone moved southwestward for much of its duration, striking Mauritius on February10 at peak intensity with winds of 155km/h (100mph). It later passed just southeast of Réunion before turning {{to the south and}} weakening. The cyclone became extratropical on February14 in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area of <b>ocean</b> <b>in</b> the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E
