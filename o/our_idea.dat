25|$|In all these, {{a process}} is defined for loading the indenter, {{measuring}} the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces numbers {{that are consistent with}} our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with <b>our</b> <b>idea</b> of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{being the}} series premiere, {{features}} the first {{usage of the}} theme song by pop punk band Nerf Herder. Parry Gripp, the band's songwriter, guitarist, and admitted fan of the show explained that the band created the theme song after [...] "fancy pants Hollywood" [...] failed to write a theme song that the producers approved. Eventually, [...] "they [...] asked a bunch of local, small time bands who they could pay very little money {{to come up with}} some ideas and they liked <b>our</b> <b>idea</b> and they used it." [...] Several songs by the band Sprung Monkey play during the episode. When Buffy is deciding what to wear, the song [...] "Saturated" [...] is playing faintly in the background. At The Bronze, the band plays their songs [...] "Believe", [...] "Swirl", and [...] "Things are Changing". All of the songs featured in the episode can be found on their 1995 album Swirl. The score for the episode, as well as all first season entries, was created by Walter Murphy.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Terri Schwartz {{gave the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.8 out of 10, calling the {{blackout}} plot [...] "fairly throwaway" [...] but a backdrop to [...] "tell {{far more interesting}} stories", with Luna's Reyes continuing to be the strongest new element of the season. Schwartz criticized the episode's killing and resurrection of May as [...] "one of the weaker storytelling tricks in an otherwise solid episode—and as expected, May came back and is just fine." [...] Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe had mixed feelings about the episode's political angle {{and the use of}} Inhumans as a stand-in for minorities, but praised the chemistry between Coulson, Mack, and Fitz, and the further exploration of Jeffrey Mace. McCabe was highly critical of guest star Lorenzo James Henrie, calling him [...] "no more charismatic here than he was in Fear the Walking Dead, and his character is every bit as unsympathetic as his misguided rebel was on that show, wheelchair or no." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush was particularly negative, feeling the episodes' different storylines [...] "ended up feeling like three disparate stories with some notable reaching'. He felt the Inhuman prejudice storyline and attack by looters on Gabe were forced, and that the May storyline did not [...] "really [...] <b>our</b> <b>idea</b> of where the AI or ghostly threads will end up". Fitzpatrick did think that the introduction of Nagra would [...] "help Season 4 find its footing again" [...] with a more focused overarching story.|$|E

500|$|... "She's Out of My Life" [...] {{had been}} written for Jones by Tom Bahler three years earlier. Jackson heard and enjoyed it, and Jones allowed him to use it on the record. Jones called in Heatwave's keyboardist Rod Temperton to write three songs. The {{intention}} was for Jackson and Jones to select one of his songs, but Jackson, liking them all, included {{all of them in}} the final cut. Jackson stayed up all night to learn the lyrics to these songs instead of singing from a sheet. He finished the vocals to these three Temperton songs in two recording sessions. Temperton took a different approach to his song writing after spending some time researching the background to Jackson's music style. Temperton mixed his traditional harmony segments with the idea of adding shorter note melodies to suit Jackson's aggressive style. Jackson wrote [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" [...] after humming a melody in his kitchen. After listening to hundreds of songs, Jackson and Jones decided upon a batch to record. In hindsight, Jones believed they took a lot of risks in the production of Off the Wall and the final choice of album tracks. Attention was also paid to the album cover, which shows Jackson smiling, wearing a tuxedo and trademark socks. His manager stated, [...] "The tuxedo was the overall plan for the Off the Wall project and package. The tuxedo was <b>our</b> <b>idea,</b> the socks were Michael'".|$|E

2500|$|The Greeks {{seem to have}} valued {{painting}} above even sculpture, and by the Hellenistic {{period the}} informed appreciation and even the practice of painting were components in a gentlemanly education. [...] The ekphrasis was a literary form consisting of {{a description of a}} work of art, and we have a considerable body of literature on Greek painting and painters, with further additions in Latin, though none of the treatises by artists that are mentioned have survived. [...] Unfortunately we have hardly any of the most prestigious sort of paintings, on wood panel or in fresco, that this literature was concerned with. [...] The contrast with vase-painting is total; for there are no mentions in literature at all, but over 100,000 surviving examples, giving many individual painters a respectable surviving oeuvre. [...] <b>Our</b> <b>idea</b> of what the best Greek painting was like must be drawn from a careful consideration of parallels in vase-painting, late Greco-Roman copies in mosaic and fresco, some very late examples of actual painting in the Greek tradition, and the ancient literature.|$|E
2500|$|This theodicy of Cousin {{laid him}} open {{obviously}} {{enough to the}} charge of pantheism. This he repels, and his answer may be summed up as follows. Pantheism is properly the deification of the law of phenomena, the universe God. But I distinguish the two finite causes self and not-self from each other and from the infinite cause. They are not mere modifications of this cause or properties, as with Spinoza,--they are free forces having" [...] their power or spring of action in themselves, and this is sufficient for <b>our</b> <b>idea</b> of independent finite reality. I hold this, and I hold the relation of these as effects to the one supreme cause. The God I plead for is neither the deity of Pantheism, nor the absolute unity of the Eleatics, a being divorced from all possibility of creation or plurality, a mere metaphysical abstraction. The deity I maintain is creative, and necessarily creative. The deity of Spinoza and the Eleatics is a mere substance, not a cause in any sense. As to the necessity under which Deity exists of acting or creating, this is the highest form of liberty, it is the freedom of spontaneity, activity without deliberation. His action is not the result of a struggle between passion and virtue. He is free in an unlimited manner the purest spontaneity in man is but the shadow of the freedom of God. He acts freely but not arbitrarily, and with the consciousness of being able to choose the opposite part. He cannot deliberate or will as we do. His spontaneous action excludes at once the efforts and the miseries of will and the mechanical operation of necessity.|$|E

Which {{would be so}} also in mathematical figures, {{if we were to}} have <b>our</b> complex <b>ideas</b> of them, only by collecting their properties in reference to other figures. How uncertain and imperfect would <b>our</b> <b>ideas</b> be of an ellipsis, if we had no other idea of it, but some few of its properties? Whereas, having in <b>our</b> plain <b>idea</b> the WHOLE essence of that figure, we from thence discover those properties, and demonstratively see how they flow, and are inseparable from it.|$|R

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. <b>Our</b> <b>idea</b> is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diet was {{an issue}} that is often {{discussed}} through this time, as an aspect of medical care. [...] Since <b>our</b> <b>idea</b> of modern technology did not exist, diet was a simple way for Romans to attain a healthy life. [...] This remains true in the Roman Military as the soldiers required appropriate nutrition in order to function at high activity levels. Because of the number of the people requiring food, there were unique circumstances in the acquisition of food. [...] During a campaign the soldiers would often forage food from their enemies land. [...] In fact as part of the standard kit, Roman soldiers would carry a sickle, which would be used to forage food. [...] They would carry a three-day ration of food in case they were in a situation where foraging was not available. [...] This would largely consist of items such as wheat and barley. [...] During a time of peace, the Roman Army would have had a typical diet consisting of bacon, cheese, vegetables, and beer to drink. Corn is mentioned in their works as well, however; this was a [...] common term that was applied to their use of grain. [...] The Roman use of the term corn is {{not to be confused with}} maize, which did not come to Europe until the discovery of the New World. [...] Items such as poultry and fish were also likely part of the standard diet. [...] The soldier was given a ration, which was taken from his pay. [...] This shows that the soldiers were well fed in times of peace. [...] If the soldiers were well fed, they were healthier and able to maintain a high level of physical activity, as well as stave off disease. [...] Disease is something that is easier to prevent rather than treat. [...] This idea holds true in the event a fort was under siege; certain food items were rationed such as poultry. [...] The reasoning behind this was that poultry was very inexpensive to maintain and in the event of a siege it did not require a lot of resources to maintain. [...] It was also noted that poultry had benefits for those who were sick. [...] This demonstrates the idea was present that the army needed to maintain the health of its members regardless of circumstances. [...] These discoveries were made while looking at the remains of Roman military sites. [...] By excavating these sites and looking at fecal matter found, scientists were able to determine what was eaten. [...] It is a simple fact that poor diet negatively affects a military's combat readiness. [...] The variety of food found shows the Romans were not focused on just caloric intake, as they knew a variety of food was important to health.|$|E
