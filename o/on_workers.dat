5|$|Meat ants are {{generally}} intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) {{living in their}} colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey <b>on</b> <b>workers</b> as discussed earlier, some are inquilines {{and live in the}} nest commensally. Unused or abandoned areas inside colonies are sometimes occupied by other species of ants and in some cases, termites. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify.|$|E
5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey <b>on</b> <b>workers</b> passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they are getting attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an ant will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E

5|$|Some {{invertebrate}} species specialise in predation of Iridomyrmex ants. One spider in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is {{a specialist}} predator against these ants and {{will use the}} alarm pheromones that are released by the ants during territorial disputes to locate them. The Australian thorny devil lizard (Moloch horridus) is a sit and wait predator that primarily preys on Iridomyrmex ants, and one lizard will reject specific species in this genus while eating others. The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follows trails laid by these ants to locate them as a potential prey species and will eat the broods of some species, while ground beetles dig burrows near ant nests to prey <b>on</b> <b>workers</b> passing by.|$|E
5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool. When they were eventually able to access the area, they discovered thirty-two workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, with the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the thirty-two deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell <b>on</b> <b>workers</b> below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E

25|$|The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 outlawed {{spying on}} and intimidating union activists, {{provoking}} violence, and company unions. However, spying <b>on</b> <b>workers</b> and harassing them continued, according to testimony before congress in 1957. Other abuses by labor consulting firms included manipulating union elections through bribery and coercion; threatening to revoke workers' benefits if they organized; installing union officers sympathetic to management; and, offering rewards to employees who worked against unions.|$|E
25|$|The strikers, however, {{lost nearly}} all of the gains they had won in the next few years. The IWW disdained written {{contracts}}, holding that such contracts encouraged workers to abandon the daily class struggle. The mill owners proved more persistent, slowly chiseling away at the improvements in wages and working conditions, while firing union activists and installing labor spies to keep an eye <b>on</b> <b>workers.</b> A depression in the industry, followed by another speedup, led to further layoffs.|$|E

25|$|The USW was {{established}} May 22, 1942, in Cleveland, Ohio, by {{a convention of}} representatives from the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers and the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, after almost six years of divisive struggles {{to create a new}} union of steelworkers.
