6000|$|Coleridge now {{returned}} to Cambridge, and remained there till {{the commencement of}} the summer vacation. But the adventures of the preceding six months had broken the continuity of his academic life, and given birth to new views of future exertion. His acquaintance with Frend had materially contributed to his adoption of the system called Unitarianism, which he now openly professed, and this alone made it imperative on his conscience to decline availing himself of any advantages dependent on his entering into holy orders, or subscribing the Articles of the English Church. He lived, nevertheless, to see and renounce his error, and to leave on record his deep and solemn faith in the catholic doctrine of Trinal Unity, and the Redemption of man through the sacrifice of Christ, both God and Man. Indeed his Unitarianism, such as it was, was not of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>quality.</b> [...] "I can truly say"--were Coleridge's words in after life--"that I never falsified the Scripture. I always told the Unitarians that their interpretations of the Scripture were intolerable upon any principles of sound criticism; and {{that if they were}} to offer to construe the will of a neighbour as they did that of their Maker, they would be scouted out of society. I said then plainly and openly that it was clear enough that John and Paul were not Unitarians. But at that time I had a strong sense of the repugnancy of the doctrine of vicarious atonement to the moral being, and I thought nothing could counterbalance that. 'What care I,' I said, 'for the Platonisms of John, or the Rabbinisms of Paul?--My conscience revolts!' That was the ground of my Unitarianism."--"Table Talk", Bohn Library edition, p. 290.|$|E

Grapes are rich in polyphenols and 60 - 70 % of grapes polyphenols exist in grape seeds. The seeds contain lipid, proteins, carbohydrates and 5 - 8 % polyphenolic compounds. The phenolic compounds present in grape seeds are flavonoids including gallic acid, flavan- 3 -ol monomers and their oligomeric and polymeric derivatives (procyanidins). The most abundant flavan- 3 -ol monomers isolated from grape seeds are Catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin- 3 -O-gallate, and epigallocatechin- 3 -O-gallate. Three novel flavan oxidative derivatives named viniferones A, B and C have also been isolated from grape seeds. The grape seeds are chiefly known for their significant antioxidant properties.

40|$|Since 2000, mixed-tenure {{development}} has been advocated in planning policy guidance to local authorities in England, {{as a means of}} providing subsidised housing alongside market rate properties. This research explores residents’ experiences of three large, high-density, mixed-tenure housing developments in East London. A combination of in-depth interviews and survey responses provide insights into various aspects of daily life in these schemes, including interpersonal contacts and social relations between residents, attitudes towards tenure-based differences, and perceptions of the local neighbourhood. These insights are, in turn, situated within the context of an analysis of the provision process for mixed-tenure housing, based on interviews with key informants from housing associations, developers, architects and regeneration agencies. Policies for tenure-mixing ostensibly constitute a novel means of providing subsidised housing within a more social inclusive residential form. However, this research reveals a distinctly <b>ordinary</b> <b>quality</b> to everyday life in mixed-tenure schemes, within which the majority of interactions between residents were casual and infrequent, with relatively few close or sustained relationships, especially with between those from different social, economic or cultural backgrounds. On the other hand, these ‘mixed communities’ were by no means immune to tensions, divisions or prejudice. In both these respects, residents’ actions, attitudes and experiences did not correspond to ambitious propositions for tenure mixing to create an inherently more ‘inclusive’ social milieu with instrumental benefits for lower-income residents. This combination of banal and occasionally divisive social relations therefore appears to challenge the rationale for policy programmes to ‘engineer’ positive social relations through market-led interventions in housing provision. Rather, if this model of mixed-tenure housing provision does have a role in structuring the lives of residents’, it is arguably through design strategies that in fact function to keep inhabitants of different tenure groups apart...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{using the same}} grading standard for agricultural products from the places of shipment to the consumers is hard to be realized. The grading standard which adopted by producers is not understood by consumers. General consumers have usually doubted and distrusted the present grading method. On the other hand, producers spent considerable time and labor on grading and sorting method of the mandarin oranges. Viewing the importance of grading standard for agricultural products, this study intended to reassess the grading method that currently used in the marketing process by basing on the data analysis. It is expected that {{the result of this}} study will lead to the clarification of the grading standard used by the people concerned and simplify it. The empirical study was carried out by using the data of tracing survey of the mandarin orange in which the technique of quantification theory to be tried. The following approaches were considered for grading system: (1) Deviation of the assessment values of grading standard (classified by quality and size) among different wholesale markets, (2) The transitional change of grading assessment at the different points of the marketing channel, (3) Method of simplification of the grading system. 1. The assessment values of 2 ̆ 2 grade 2 ̆ 2 (categorized by quality) and 2 ̆ 2 class 2 ̆ 2 (categorized by size) were often different at different markets even for the same product. The price quoted by Fukuoka market was higher for the 2 ̆ 2 excellent 2 ̆ 2 quality than other markets. The price difference arisen from market assessment was likely to be wider for the grade than the class. 2. How to retain the grading standard which was classified by producer was considered. The grading, though to be done by producers, was performed {{in such a way that}} suited the interests and convenience of middlemen, and it was altered at the retail level so that the early grading was not carried to the consumers. As a result the high quality of orange from the famous producing area and the <b>ordinary</b> <b>quality</b> from the other areas became indiscriminately at the retailer 2 ̆ 7 s shop. It was a common practice that only the name of famous producing area was retained but that of other areas were dropped out. This fact brought about the feeling of distrust from consumers against pricing. Then, there was no difference for the rate of market margin of orange of different quality for the middlemen, there was no difference in profit rate for high quality orange among different retailers but for the low quality one it had a great variation in profit rate. 3. The method of simplification of the grading sys t e m was considered. As mentioned above that grading was done to suit the interests and convenience of middlemen. Therefore, the analysis should be focused on market performance of these middlemen to simplify the grading. It should have two grades that were the 2 ̆ 2 excellent 2 ̆ 2 quality grade and the other, and had 3 sizes, namely, large (those of size 2 L and above), middle (size L, M), and small (size S and below) for assessing the present grading of the middlemen. 現在施行されている青果物の規格について検討した. 農産物は一貫した規格基準で出荷段階から最終消費段階まで流通するのが困難である,それ故,一般消費者は流通業者の経済活動に対し不信の念をいだく. 一方,生産者段階では規格区分のために多くの投下労働を必要とする. 以上のように規格を中心とする問題は多面的であり,かつ重要である. 本稿は以下の目的に沿って分析したものである. 第 1 の目的は,規格に関する実態を明確にすることである. 第 2 の目的は規格簡素化の方向性を示すことである. 温州みかんの追跡調査により得たデータを基礎にして,実態分析および計量分析(数量化理論による分析) を行う. 分析のプロセスは以下の通りである.
