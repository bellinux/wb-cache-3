5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, {{received}} a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber were {{also a part of}} this August assembly; these individuals influenced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E
5|$|Barbauld's {{pedagogy}} was fundamentally {{based on}} John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), {{the most influential}} pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain. Building on Locke's theory of the Association <b>of</b> <b>Ideas,</b> which he had outlined in Some Thoughts, philosopher David Hartley had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read Joseph Priestley's redaction of it). For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were {{thinking in terms of}} developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.|$|E

5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set <b>of</b> <b>ideas.</b> He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Ranbir Singh, the temple complex became the centre of Sanskrit teachings to {{a large number of}} Brahmin students. A {{translation}} centre was also established as part of the temple where books on philosophy and history in Arabic and Persian languages were translated by Muslim scholars into Sanskrit. Like wise, Pundits translated many scriptures into Hindi and Dogri languages. This initiative taken by Maharaja Ranbir Singh to bring amity between the Hindu and Muslim communities was praised by Sir Aurel Stein as in:order to facilitate the exchange <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> which the Maharaja in a spirit of true enlightenment desired to promote between the representatives of Hindu and Mohammedan scholars in his domain.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> that included game ideas for The War of the Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The War of the Worlds was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant strips {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> of respect and disrespect among American children used strips from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects could provide qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 study used the strips to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was behaving badly while researchers used an fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E
30|$|To exceed this limitation, a novel SystemC-based WSN {{simulator}} named IDEA 1 (hIerarchical DEsign plAtform for Wsn and Architectural Node exploration) is developed. A testbed of 9 sensor nodes {{has been}} built to validate the simulation results <b>of</b> <b>IDEA</b> 1. The deviation <b>of</b> <b>IDEA</b> 1 simulations and the experimental measurements is small enough to be acceptable by the general system-level simulations. The performances <b>of</b> <b>IDEA</b> 1 have also been compared with NS- 2 {{which is the most}} used simulator in Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) research [8]. With the HW/SW co-simulation feature, IDEA 1 provides more detailed information of sensor node operations than NS- 2, which can help designers to better analyze the energy dissipation of networks. Benefiting from the efficient simulation kernel of SystemC and our optimized model implementation, the simulation speed <b>of</b> <b>IDEA</b> 1 is much faster than NS- 2.|$|R

5|$|In all, the Renaissance {{could be}} viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> from antiquity, and through novel {{approaches}} to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.|$|E

Although both have the goal of improving education — IDEA for children with disabilities and NCLBA for all children — the two statutes take different approaches. IDEA focuses on the individual child, with an emphasis on developing an individualized education program (IEP) and specific services for children with disabilities, while NCLBA takes a more global view, with an emphasis on closing gaps in achievement test scores and raising the aggregate scores of all demographic groups of pupils to specific levels.
