5|$|On November 3, 2004, an <b>out-of-service</b> Red Line train rolled {{backward}} into the Woodley Park – Zoo / Adams Morgan station and hit an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled {{backward into}} the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an <b>out-of-service</b> Red Line train rolled {{backwards}} {{into the}} Woodley Park station, hitting an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. The rear car (1077) was telescoped by the first car of the standing train (4018). No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backwards into the station.

5|$|Along the Metrorail system, {{the tracks}} are mostly elevated. The three {{sections}} {{that are not}} are under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 just east of Culmer station, and {{the northern end of}} the line from just east of the Palmetto Expressway heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride on ground level for a brief amount of time. The platform at each Metrorail station is long enough to accommodate six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long enough to accommodate eight-car-long trains. In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening {{it is not uncommon for}} Miami-Dade Transit to link two <b>out-of-service</b> trains together before returning them to Lehman Yard. Trains are stored at the Lehman Yard just west of Okeechobee Station. There are extra tracks and a new test track, known as the Lehman Center Test Track, built at the Lehman Yard.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2013 at , an <b>out-of-service</b> KTM Class 92 SCS 20 derailed near Shah Alam station while {{returning}} to Sentul depot for maintenance. No one was injured. The train was heavily damaged and was subsequently written off.|$|E
25|$|On September 30, 2013, two Blue Line trains {{collided}} at Harlem (Congress Branch), injuring 33 people, {{after an}} outbound train {{was hit by}} an <b>out-of-service</b> train going the opposite direction on the same track. Earlier, the train had arrived at Forest Park, and went out of service. However, after the train pulled into the Desplaines Yard, it was left on. There were no passengers on the <b>out-of-service</b> train; {{the number of workers}} on it {{at the time of the}} crash was also an unknown. Also unknown was the total number of passengers on the outbound, in-service train. The investigation started shortly thereafter. Though service soon went back to normal, trains did not stop at the Harlem station until the late evening on Tuesday, October 1 to avoid interference with the scene and congestion.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017, the RAF and Royal Navy {{operated}} seventy-five Hawk T1 and twenty-eight Hawk T2. According to the Ministry of Defence, {{the planned}} <b>out-of-service</b> {{date for the}} Hawk T1 is 2030, with the aircraft selected {{to meet the requirements}} of the Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) programme beginning to replace the Hawk from 2027.|$|E
25|$|Retitled USNS Chepachet, she was {{transferred}} to the Military Sea Transportation Service for service in a noncommissioned status, reclassified as a transport oiler, and manned by a contract civilian marine crew. The vessel was placed <b>out-of-service</b> in July 1950, struck from the Naval Register on 4 January 1980 and transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal.|$|E
25|$|In the 2015 Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDSR), it {{was decided}} to retain some of the Tranche 1 {{aircraft}} {{to increase the number of}} front-line squadrons from five to seven and to boost the <b>out-of-service</b> date from 2030 to 2040 as well as implementing the Captor-E AESA radar in later tranches. It was announced that Typhoons would be deployed to Malta as security for the 2015 CHOGM.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, 1994, disgruntled {{computer}} analyst Edward J. Leary firebombed {{a crowded}} 4 train at Fulton Street. Car 1391 suffered interior damage, but was repaired {{and returned to}} service. A little {{more than three years}} later, however, on February 3, 1998, cars 1391–1395, while out of service, was rear-ended by another <b>out-of-service</b> train of R33s at the 239th Street Yard. All five cars suffered anticlimber damage, but were repaired and returned to service.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{problems}} with the Azipods forced NCL take the Norwegian Star <b>out-of-service</b> for two weeks in April2015, and cancel its repositioning cruise through the Panama Canal. In December 2016, {{problems with}} one of the Azipods delayed the Norwegian Stars departure from Singapore and forced the curtailing of additional itineraries. Azipod failures occurred again in January 2017 between Singapore and Bali, leading to further itinerary changes and then in February 2017, when the ship's Azipods failed off the coast of Victoria, Australia requiring it to be towed to Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|On November 3, 2004, an <b>out-of-service</b> Red Line train rolled {{backwards}} {{into the}} Woodley Park station and hit an in-service train {{that was at}} the platform servicing the station. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backwards into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 2004, the Chicago Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad, a new short line {{owned by}} RailAmerica, leased {{the western part}} of the line, from Crestline, Ohio, west to the Gary, Indiana, {{neighborhood}} of Tolleston, from CSX. It also obtained overhead trackage rights along the formerly <b>out-of-service</b> line from Tolleston, at the junction with the old Michigan Central Railroad (now CSX), northwest to Clarke Junction (also in Gary, just north of the Gary-Chicago International Airport), and then west along the former Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (now CSX) to Blue Island, Illinois. Norfolk Southern continues to own the line east of Crestline, Ohio, as well as the part west of Whiting, IN.|$|E
25|$|Although CSX {{no longer}} was interested, the state has plans to restore the {{remainder}} of the line for freight service. This would include rehabilitation of the Running Track and Terminal Yard from Bay Junction to Summer Street, as well as restoring {{the end of the line}} through the Boston Marine Industrial Park. Possibilities initially raised in mid-2009 included service to Conley Terminal or the Massport Marine Terminal via new spurs from Track 61. The City of Boston applied for $84M in TIGER funds in 2009, including $14M for expansion of Track 61. The existing <b>out-of-service</b> track paralleling Dry Dock Avenue through Black Falcon Cruise Terminal and the International Cargo Port Boston (totalling 2,860 linear feet) would have been rehabilitated, and 5,910 linear feet of new track constructed along Tide Street and Fid Kennedy Avenue into the Massport Marine Terminal. The application was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Looking to the west, the WNY {{acquired}} the Corry-Meadville {{line from the}} Northwest Pennsylvania Rail Authority in January 2002, for $1 and the cancellation of the authority's $1.9 million debt. The authority had borrowed {{the money in the}} 1990s from NORPA, then a subsidiary of the Delaware Otsego Corporation, to pay for the acquisition in conjunction with $1 million from the state. (Delaware Otsego financed the purchase to preserve a possible connection between its subsidiary New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway and CSX Transportation {{in the case of a}} Norfolk Southern Railway/Conrail merger.) The WNY bought NORPA in 2001, allowing it to cancel the debt. At the same time as it {{acquired the}} line, the WNY replaced OCTL as operator. Thanks to state and federal funding, the WNY began repairing the <b>out-of-service</b> parts of the line in August 2002, and by fall 2003 it had been sufficiently rehabilitated to allow full operations. In its agreement with WNY in which it sub-leased operating rights to WNY for the portion of the line from Corry PA to Hornell NY, NS retained overhead trackage rights for that portion of the line, allowing NS trains to enter or exit that portion of the Southern Tier Extension operated by the WNY at either Hornell (Southern Tier Line), Olean (Buffalo Line), Corry (Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad trackage rights), and Meadville (Meadville Line). This provided a bypass around Buffalo for freight including Upstate New York- and New England-bound Monongahela coal.|$|E
25|$|In Boston, the LRV {{situation}} {{was becoming a}} major political and public relations nightmare {{and led to the}} LRV fleet availability typically being less than 50% {{of the total number of}} cars on the property for the first few years of service. The MBTA was still accepting new cars from Boeing-Vertol, but the cars were falling out of service faster than the MBTA's maintenance staff could repair them. Additionally, the MBTA could not acquire replacement parts fast enough to repair the disabled LRVs. In a desperate effort to keep as many LRVs operating as possible, MBTA maintenance crews began cannibalizing some of the disabled cars for replacement parts. To help prevent the riding public from seeing the sheer number of brand-new, but heavily cannibalized LRVs, several of the cars were hidden around the system where the public was not likely to find them. A major newspaper story emerged when a reporter and a photographer managed to get into a section of the Green Line's subway which was not in use at the time and found it was full of cannibalized cars which had been abandoned in the tunnel. The MBTA had been towing the cars into the subway during the middle of the night when the subway was closed to the public. The story and photographs brought the problems with the LRV into the public eye for the first time. After the story broke, <b>out-of-service</b> LRVs began to appear in several storage yards which were easily viewed by the public, though this may have simply been due to the ever-increasing number of disabled cars.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after being}} taken into use, No. 158 lost braking power, killing one person when it {{landed on the}} pavement. The initial plan was to use the six trams to operate all {{services}} on the Kjelsås Line, with one vehicle in reserve, {{but this was not}} possible because of more <b>out-of-service</b> vehicles than estimated.|$|E
500|$|By March 1970, even as cars {{continued}} to be accepted, the DOT began considering modifying two cars under a test program. The DOT and Penn Central began holding meetings in May, deciding to modify one car of each propulsion type at first, followed by four additional cars. <b>Out-of-service</b> rates reached 40% and higher; In June, Senator Clifford Case of New Jersey began pushing the DOT to devote $5 million to the rebuild program to increase reliability. The official two-year demonstration program began on October 1. In December, a feasibility study of upgrading the cars for higher sustained speeds was initiated. By February 1971, top speed had been reduced further to [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{direct cost}} of the {{landslide}} was estimated at $200 million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). However, some estimates of the total cost reached as high as $400 million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). The D estimated the slide cost them $80 million in lost revenue (equivalent to $ million in [...] ), averaging $1 million for each day that the tracks were <b>out-of-service.</b> This figure included $19 million in payments to the Union Pacific {{for the use of}} their lines. The United States Geological Survey and the state of Utah have called the Thistle landslide the most costly ever in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Later in the year, Amtrak {{began an}} {{accelerated}} repair {{program on the}} unmodified cars, which had logged over [...] in revenue service, but very few cars were actually repaired. By the end of 1975, <b>out-of-service</b> rate was still 27.5%, and many trains ran with fewer cars than demand called for. In February 1976, Amtrak cut Metroliner service from 15 to 13 round trips {{because of the lack}} of serviceable cars. In August, Budd unveiled the SPV-2000, a Rail Diesel Car successor built with the Metroliner shell design. Although heavily marketed, the SPV-2000s were extremely unreliable and never achieved the widespread use of the Metroliners and Amfleets.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being only}} a {{tropical}} storm while passing by Puerto Rico, Eloise produced extreme amounts of rainfall on the island, peaking at [...] in Dos Bocas. Other totals of [...] were common. The heavy rains resulted in severe flash flooding which killed 34 people, mostly from drownings, and left $60 million in damages. Several hundred people were injured, and the storm forced over 6,000 residents from their homes. Dozens of towns and villages were flooded, though Utuado, {{with a population of}} 35,000 at the time, was hit the hardest. The situation in that town was described as a [...] "total disaster"; four housing developments were under water, and dozens of vehicles were washed away. The flood waters submerged thousands of miles of roads and put several bridges <b>out-of-service.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 2005, an <b>out-of-service</b> {{date for}} the Apache was {{forecast}} at 2030, but the Army is looking at a capability sustainment programme (CSP) that will extend their life to 2040. It was thought that updates would be necessary by 2017 because the US Army is to withdraw support for the AH-64D Block I on which the British Apaches are based, but US budget problems pushed this back to 2019 or 2020. A decision will be taken in 2014 {{on the extent to}} which Britain will adopt the Block III upgrades of the AH-64E - the options range from abandoning the capability altogether to buying brand new Block III helicopters but Boeing believe it is most likely that Britain will remanufacture, putting the existing engines and avionics into new airframes.|$|E
500|$|In the 2013 {{video game}} , a prequel to the Arkham series, {{there are several}} {{references}} to The Killing Joke. When Batman enters a carnival-esque room, Joker tells him he got {{a great deal on}} an <b>out-of-service</b> amusement park, [...] "You should have seen the look on the real estate agent's face when we shook hands on the deal!", alluding to Joker's conning a theme park entrepreneur into granting him the rights of a run-down amusement park early in the graphic novel and then proceeding to murder him via Joker toxin. In a level featuring a psychiatric interview with Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Joker is playable as the Red Hood, walking through the chemical plant that will end with him becoming the Joker, as well as earlier beating up several patrons at a Comedy Club due to very poor reception towards a joke he made. The name of the achievement for defeating the Joker in the ending of the game [...] "Perhaps sooner, perhaps later" [...] was a reference to Batman's talk with [...] "Joker" [...] {{in the beginning of the}} graphic novel. While promoting the game, Troy Baker, who voices the Joker in the game, recites a monologue from the graphic novel.|$|E
2500|$|On May 2, 1970, an <b>out-of-service</b> [...] train {{collided}} with another GG train in revenue {{service on the}} Queens Boulevard Line. The revenue-service train was switching from the southbound express track to the local track (it had been rerouted around the <b>out-of-service</b> train). Two people died and 71 were injured in the worst subway collision since the 1928 Times Square derailment. Following the 1970 accident, New York Magazine highlighted {{the state of the}} subway system in a lengthy expose, in which it concluded that the subway's condition was getting worse compared to previous years.|$|E
2500|$|At 4:27am on November 29, 2009, a {{collision}} occurred between two <b>out-of-service</b> trains at the Falls Church rail yard in Fairfax County, Virginia. [...] According to Metro, three rail cars {{were believed to}} be damaged beyond repair. Three Metro employees with minor injuries were taken to a local hospital. The NTSB planned to launch an investigation of the incident.|$|E
2500|$|On February 25, 1951, the CTA {{opened the}} Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway, {{connecting}} the Milwaukee Avenue elevated route (formerly Logan Square) with the Loop on a fast, efficient and more direct routing {{through the heart}} of the city. With opening of the Dearborn Subway, the old elevated alignment between Evergreen and Marshfield Avenues was decommissioned, used only for moving <b>out-of-service</b> rail cars. The north section of this connection between Evergreen Avenue and Lake Street was subsequently demolished in the 1960s, leaving the Lake Street Branch-to-Douglas Branch section or the [...] "Paulina Connector" [...] still in existence.|$|E
2500|$|The first LRVs entered {{service on}} the [...] "D" [...] Branch in December 1976 but were {{immediately}} beset with problems. Certain cars frequently derailed on tight turns in the Riverside, Boston College and Lechmere yards. Battery trays, air conditionersmounted under the cars, continually drawing in dirt and debris from under the car when in the tunnelsand air compressors all suffered numerous failures; the plug-style doors had trouble sealing properly; and traction motors failed sooner than expected. Desperate for reliable rolling stock, the MBTA launched an overhaul program to extend the availability of its older PCC cars. A total of 15 cars, primarily <b>out-of-service</b> wrecks and parts cars, were rebuilt to as-new condition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the Tornado F3 as an effective platform up to its planned <b>out-of-service</b> date of 2010, the Ministry of Defence initiated the Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP). This project, announced on 5March1996, involved many elements, including the integration of ASRAAM and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, and radar upgrades to improve multi-target engagement. Additionally, pilot and navigator displays would be improved, along with the replacement of several of the onboard computer systems. The CSP would see the removal of a non-standard state of aircraft; various upgrades, in particular to the Foxhunter radar, had led to a situation described as [...] "fleets within fleets". The Foxhunter radar was a source of difficulties in the upgrade programme, in particular the integration of the new AMRAAM missile.|$|E
2500|$|This depot {{contains}} a major bus {{overhaul and repair}} facility/shop for various type of buses, a major [...] "reserve storage" [...] facility for <b>out-of-service</b> buses, and a storage facility for decommissioned and wrecked buses awaiting scrapping. The latter set of buses are stripped of usable parts such as windows and engine components, as well as reusable fluids such as motor oil and fuel, before the remaining shells and unsalvageable parts are sold for scrap. The scrapping program began in summer 2008. Under the MTA, the shop was upgraded with a new concrete floor. The facility underwent further renovations in the 2010s, replacing the maintenance building's roof and improving ventilation and pollution controls including containment of fuel spills. The upgraded facility opened on August 13, 2015.|$|E
2500|$|On December 27, 1980, St. Louis {{television}} station KTVI reported receiving calls from supposed witnesses of another stunt landing. The alleged parachutist, {{who claimed to}} be a retired professional stuntman, was said to be wearing a Santa Claus costume when he jumped off an airplane around 8:00a.m. CST, parachuted onto the arch, grasped the monument's beacon, and used the same parachute to glide down unharmed. KTVI said it was told the feat was done as an act of homage to Swyers, and [...] "apparently was a combination of a dare, a drunk, and a tribute." [...] On the day after the alleged incident, authorities declared the jump a hoax. A spokesperson for the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said no calls were received about the jump until after it was broadcast on the news, and the Federal Aviation Administration said the two calls it had received were very similar. One caller also left an <b>out-of-service</b> phone number, while the other never followed up with investigators. Arch officials said they did not witness any such jump, and photos provided by the alleged parachutist were unclear.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 SAL's {{passenger}} ships {{made only}} three transatlantic crossings, and from 1971 onwards the only crossings made were repositioning cruises. In June 1972 the Swedish American Line purchased the expedition cruise ship [...] via their Panama-based subsidiary United Cruising Co. Unlike other SAL passenger vessels, the Lindblad Explorer was registered in Panama, not Sweden. Increased operational costs of Swedish-flagged ships forced {{the company to}} start negotiations with Swedish trade unions for re-flagging the Gripsholm and Kungsholm. The negotiations failed however, and 22 March 1975 the company decided to abandon passenger traffic despite protests from the company's United States offices, according to whom the ships would have continued to be highly profitable even under the Swedish flag. The Gripsholm and Kungsholm were taken <b>out-of-service</b> and laid up in August 1975. The Kungsholm was sold to Flagship Cruises in October {{of the same year}} for only 65 million Swedish krona, a half of what SAL had paid for her nine years earlier. Flagship maintained her under the name Kungsholm for cruising under Liberian flag. The Gripsholm found a buyer in November when she was sold to Karageorgis Lines, Greece, becoming their MS Navarino. The Lindblad Explorer however stayed under SAL's ownership. At the end of 1975 SAL withdrew from Atlantic Gulf Services.|$|E
2500|$|Union Station is {{laid out}} with a double stub-end configuration, with 10 tracks coming into the station {{from the north and}} 14 from the south. Because {{passenger}} trains do not pass through Union Station, all passengers traveling through Chicago must change trains to reach their final destination. There are 2 through tracks to allow <b>out-of-service</b> equipment moves between the north and south side, including one with a platform to allow extra long trains to board. Between the north and south sides of the station is a passenger concourse. [...] Passengers can walk through the concourse to get from any platform to any other without stairs or elevators. [...] Odd-numbered platforms (1–19) are on the north half of the station, and even-numbered platforms (2–30) on the south half. [...] The north tracks are used by Amtrak for the Hiawatha Service and the Empire Builder, and by Metra for the Milwaukee District West, Milwaukee District North, and North Central Service routes. The south tracks are used for all of the other Amtrak and Metra services. Two station management structures (known as glasshouses), one {{on each side of the}} terminal, monitor train-to-track assignments and the flow of traffic in and out of the station.
