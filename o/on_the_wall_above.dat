25|$|A raised wooden {{platform}} {{supports the}} pulpit, carved with some classical motifs such as rectangular, rounded lozenges and foliation, {{some of it}} gilded, echoing the wall behind it. It has two front piers that resemble antae. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the pulpit is a Palladian Tiffany stained glass window depicting the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple framed by gilded moldings and flanked by pairs of fluted Corinthian pilasters. Bronze statues of angels are on either side.|$|E
500|$|In {{the centre}} of the ground floor is the Staircase Hall {{described}} in the Buildings of England series as [...] "one of the great architectural spaces of Liverpool". [...] A broad staircase rises between two pairs of Corinthian columns to a half-landing, and narrower flights climb from that on each side to the upper floor. On the ground floor {{on each side of the}} staircase are display cabinets holding the city's silver. On the half-landing is a statue of George Canning dated 1832 by Francis Chantrey, and hanging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> this is a portrait of Queen ElizabethII by SirEdward Halliday.|$|E
500|$|The south porch {{contains}} a water stoup {{that was said}} miraculously never to dry up; the water was traditionally regarded as having healing powers. There is a second entrance {{on the north side}} through a 15th-century arched doorway decorated with carved human heads. Two verses from Psalm 84 (in Welsh) are written <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the doorway: [...] "For one day in thy Courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness." [...] These are the only surviving portions of the Biblical texts that once decorated the internal walls.|$|E
60|$|The men, of course, {{were very}} much exposed while engaged in this operation, for the people whom they were besieging would gather <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above,</b> and shoot spears, darts, and arrows at them, and throw down stones and other missiles, as {{you see in the}} engraving.|$|R
5000|$|... {{a shot of}} rich {{young people}} {{lounging}} around in a party, with a marble table and expensive paintings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> them, that is placed opposite a series of bodies/patients from an asylum, sprawled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and all in uniform. One is in a strait jacket.|$|R
50|$|Other decorations {{include a}} {{repetition}} of Joakim Skovgaard’s annunciation scene from Church of the Holy Ghost around the entrance doors, {{as well as a}} relief by Thomas Bærentzen entitled <b>The</b> Suffering Mankind. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> windows there are fluttering angels and citations from the Gospel of Luke painted by Carl Budtz Møller in 1910.|$|R
500|$|Eddowes' {{body was}} found in Mitre Square in the City of London, three-quarters of an hour after Stride's. The throat was severed and the abdomen was ripped open by a long, deep, jagged wound. The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed. A local man named Joseph Lawende had passed through the square with two friends shortly before the murder, and he {{described}} seeing a fair-haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes. His companions were unable to confirm his description. Eddowes' and Stride's murders were later called the [...] "double event". Part of Eddowes' bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Some writing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the apron piece became known as the Goulston Street graffito and seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews, but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece, or was merely incidental. Such graffiti were commonplace in Whitechapel. Police Commissioner Charles Warren feared that the graffito might spark anti-semitic riots and ordered it washed away before dawn.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{would be}} {{known about the}} film except that Owen {{discussed}} it in correspondence with her friend, Carrie Dunlap. Dunlap was from Illinois and served as campaign treasurer for Ruth's father William Jennings Bryan. In her letters to Dunlap, Owen expresses great joy in her film, quoting, “I can scarcely believe the film is mine when I see it ‘projected’ <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> our fireplace.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} is signed, inscribed and dated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the mirror: [...] "Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434" [...] ("Jan van Eyck was here 1434"). The inscription {{looks as if}} it were painted in large letters on the wall, as was done with proverbs and other phrases at this period. Other surviving van Eyck signatures are painted in trompe l'oeil on the wooden frame of his paintings, so that they appear to have been carved in the wood.|$|E
50|$|Flags {{are mounted}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> honour boards and chairs {{are located in}} each corner of the room. Wreaths, framed {{photographs}} of the reigning monarch and a visitor's book {{are to be found}} on a table in the centre of the room. The room is carpeted, the windows are shaded with venetian blinds and the plaster ceiling is decorated with a grid-like pattern.|$|R

30|$|Apple snail {{eggs were}} {{collected}} from the trunks or stems of <b>the</b> plants or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> water in rural paddy fields, lotus ponds, and streams in Ya’an city, Sichuan Province, southwest China, in May 2014. The eggs were dried in an oven at lower than 50  °C and then powdered with a grinder to avoid destructing the components in the eggs. The egg powder was sifted and added to the diet at different proportions. The powder content protein, total lipid, total carbohydrate, ash and moisture are 15.05, 1.96, 0.41, 57.26, 5.55  % respectively.|$|R
2500|$|Most of the {{decoration}} of the church was either removed by the civil authorities, looted, damaged or destroyed during the turmoil of the era of La Reforma in the mid-19th century. [...] The church then became a customs warehouse, and as late as 1944 the convent was a military gaol; {{but the use of}} the church has since been restored to the Franciscans and the Santiago panel has been returned to its original location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the altar.|$|E
2500|$|Built in brick (in a Flemish bond pattern) {{with some}} stone dressings, {{the church has}} a stuccoed {{southern}} frontage, facing Carlton Hill; {{none of the other}} elevations are easily visible. [...] A deep central recess is flanked by two prominent wings with entrance doors and large stone pilasters, above which is a pediment with an embedded clock. [...] The large crucifix above the entrance is a recent addition. [...] The Georgian-style front elevation, which was improved in 1957 by L.A. Mackintosh (whose personal monogram is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the left entrance door), has been described as [...] "strangely bleak".|$|E
2500|$|Subscribers {{received}} programme listings, {{reviewing the}} day's schedule, {{that could be}} posted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> their receivers. The [...] "newspaper issue" [...] began with a news bulletin and newspaper article summaries. The afternoon schedule comprised [...] "short entertaining stories", [...] "sporting intelligence", and [...] "filler items" [...] of various kinds. There were hourly news summaries {{for those who had}} missed the earlier bulletins. The evening schedule consisted of theatrical offerings, visits to the opera, poetry readings, concerts, lectures (including repeats of Academy lectures by notable literary figures), and linguistic lessons (in English, Italian and French).|$|E
50|$|During 1997, {{the centre}} saw a minor refurbishment. An updated logo was {{introduced}}, along with new signage to complement. The food court was remodelled and introduced food decorations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> food outlets, palm trees, new {{tables and chairs}} {{as well as the}} opening of Hungry Jack's. Lincraft was also relocated when McEwans closed down. However, it, itself has closed down {{to make way for a}} new Harris Scarfe in October 2009. Best & Less moved into Lincraft's old retail space. The Reject Shop also moved from opposite Coles to The Market area.|$|R
5000|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{anterior}} <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> abdomen, {{except in}} the pubic region, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lateral <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> iliac crest, it is scanty, and here the transversalis fascia is more closely connected with the peritoneum.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} {{coat of arms}} {{was designed}} especially for the chapel and placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> gallery. It dates the year of completion as 1509, although the papal confirmation was only received years later.|$|R
2500|$|St Paul's at {{the time}} of its completion, was adorned by {{sculpture}} in stone and wood, most notably that of Grinling Gibbons, by the paintings in the dome by Thornhill, and by Jean Tijou's elaborate metalwork. It has been further enhanced by Sir William Richmond's mosaics and the fittings by Dykes Bower and Godfrey Allen. [...] Other artworks in the cathedral include, in the south aisle, William Holman Hunt's copy of his painting The Light of the World, the original of which hangs in Keble College, Oxford. In the north choir aisle is a limestone sculpture of the Madonna and Child by Henry Moore, carved in 1943. The crypt contains over 200 memorials and numerous burials. Christopher Wren was the first person to be interred, in 1723. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> his tomb in the crypt is written in Latin: Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice ("Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you").|$|E

60|$|The {{summer sun}} was sinking {{and a red}} glow was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> Aurelia's head when she moved again, upon the {{shutting}} of the door, while supper was being taken by the gentlemen in the outer room.|$|E
5000|$|Agostino Ciampelli [...] (29 August 1565 - 22 April 1630) was an Italian {{painter of}} the Baroque period. He trained with Santi di Tito in Florence, and painted in Rome under Clement VIII, {{including}} a Crucifixion for Santa Prassede and a Saint Giovanni Gualberto in its sacristy; Angels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> choirstalls in the apse of Santa Maria in Trastevere; frescoes of the Stoning of Saint Vitale in San Vitale and further frescoes {{in the little}} church of Santa Bibiena; and The Visitation in Sant Stefano di Pescia. At the Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano, Ciampelli frescoed <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> canons' sacristy, the [...] "Sala Clementina".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> nave display {{paintings}} {{showing the}} Stations of the Cross and a memorial tablet honouring the first Parish Priest Fr Hayes. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> exterior <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> window height along each {{side is a}} steel strap extending {{the length of the}} stone work.|$|R
50|$|In {{its heyday}} in the 1920s, Hempstead House {{revealed}} {{a taste for}} extravagance. In the Entry Foyer was an organ made of oak. The pipes still visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> were merely for show—the music reverberated through openings in the floors. Medieval tapestries once hung <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> and oriental carpets covered the floor. The sunken Palm Court once contained 150 species of rare orchids and other plants. An aviary housed exotic birds in ornate cages among the flowers. The walnut-paneled Library was copied from the palace of King James I; relief portraits of literary figures still decorate the plaster ceiling. The Billiard Room featured a gold leaf ceiling, hand-tooled leather wall covering, and carved oak woodwork from a 17th century Spanish palace.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the chair}} beside {{the table and}} {{immediately}} facing the door sat Yvonne Lady Dewhurst. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> her head a hand unused to calligraphy had traced in clumsy characters the words: [...] "Liberté! Fraternité! Egalité!" [...] and below that [...] "ou la Mort." ...|$|E
60|$|The pier has, as usual, two stages; {{the upper}} and {{narrower}} for a public promenade, the lower and broader one for business. Two rough collier-lads, strangers to the place, are lounging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above,</b> and begin, out of mere mischief, dropping pebbles on the group below.|$|E
6000|$|A kind of cry {{came from}} Flambeau <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above.</b> [...] "My God," [...] he exclaimed in French, [...] "I {{know what this}} place is now! Why, it's {{the back of the}} street where old Hirsch lives. I thought I could {{recognize}} the back of a house as well as the back of a man." ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of Fox's West Coast Theatre in Long Beach, ca. 1926. The large theatre is {{at center}} and its façade is facing {{slightly to the}} left. It is a light-colored building with stucco <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> entryway at center is an arch-shaped alcove with a statue of a person inside. Movie posters are hung <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>wall</b> near <b>the</b> bottom of the building. A marquee can be seen above the main doors. Two fire escapes can be seen, one at left and one at right. Legible signs include, from left to right: "West Coast Imperial Theatre", "Barrymore Sea Beast", "Theatre", "Marion Davies 'Beverly of Graustark' Fanchon & Marco's 'Dancelogue Idea'", and "West Coast"...|$|R
50|$|The {{church of}} All Saints {{dates from the}} 13th century. A ‘Grant of Arms’ of the Fisher family {{displayed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tower <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> arch. There are memorial tablets to the Fisher family of which Geoffrey Fisher became Archbishop of Canterbury in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} {{was sold in}} Hotel Drouot in Paris in 1890 as by Hals or a son to Schiff and was bought by the Rijksmuseum in 1897 from F. Kleinberger of Paris. The painting is signed and dated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> tankard.|$|R
60|$|Gurth {{paused for}} a time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> {{the point where the}} secret passage came out {{on the face of the}} rock, and having asked many {{questions}} as to how it was that they were so well prepared for Llewellyn and his followers when they made the attack, he commended Wulf very strongly for his conduct in this matter.|$|E
60|$|There {{were small}} sprigs of golden aspen leaves and crimson oak leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> {{the foot of}} Wilson's bed. Beneath them, on pegs, hung a rifle. And on the window-sill stood a glass jar {{containing}} columbines. They were fresh. They had just been picked. They waved gently in the breeze, sweetly white and blue, strangely significant to the girl.|$|E
60|$|Hetty {{was only}} thirty-three, {{and she had}} not yet outlived the little pang that visited her {{whenever}} the head of youth and beauty leaned upon her for consolation. But one glance in her mirror always served as an instantaneous pain-killer. So she gave one pale look into the crinkly old looking-glass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the gas-stove, turned down the flame a little lower from the bubbling beef and potatoes, {{went over to the}} couch, and lifted Cecilia's head to its confessional.|$|E
5000|$|In 1853 the chancel {{was torn}} {{down and a}} new one built in the current shape. The {{platform}} extending into the church was removed and ten new pews added. A richly carved elevated pulpit was built {{to one side and}} a lectern placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other. Carved wooden benches for clergy were built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides and an altar placed against <b>the</b> rear <b>wall.</b> An altar rail was also added at that time. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> were inscribed <b>the</b> Ten Commandments and the Creed. The central circle in the ceiling was painted glass lit from windows above. [...] It has since been plastered over. In 1890 and 1891 the current brass pulpit and lectern replaced the previous wood ones.|$|R
5000|$|... the jetty breastsummer (or bressummer), <b>the</b> sill <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> {{projecting}} <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> rests; <b>the</b> bressummer stretches {{across the}} whole width of <b>the</b> jetty <b>wall</b> ...|$|R
60|$|The white-robed rowers bent {{to their}} oars, and the swift boat shot forward up the Nile through a double line of ships of war, {{all of them}} crowded with soldiers. Abi looked at these ships which Pharaoh had {{gathered}} there to meet him, and thought to himself that Kaku had given wise counsel when he prayed him to attempt no rash deed, for against such surprises clearly Pharaoh was well prepared. He thought it again when <b>on</b> reaching <b>the</b> quay of cut stones he saw foot and horse-men marshalled there in companies and squadrons, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> hundreds of other men, all armed, for now he saw {{what would have happened}} to him, if with his little desperate band he had tried to pierce that iron ring of watching soldiers.|$|R
