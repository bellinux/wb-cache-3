5|$|In 2004, {{independent}} Apple resellers filed {{a lawsuit}} against Apple alleging the company used misleading advertising practices by using unfair business practices that harmed the resellers' sales while boosting Apple-owned outlets, in effect by favoring its own outlets over those of its resellers. The lawsuit claimed that Apple favored company-owned stores by providing significant discounts unavailable to independent dealers. The complaint alleged Apple's acts in favoring its own stores constituted breach of contract, false advertising, fraud, trade libel, defamation, and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. , Apple reached settlements with all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs,</b> including the bankruptcy trustee for one reseller that failed, while the former principal of that company appealed the bankruptcy court's approval of the settlement.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{became a}} subject of intense news coverage. The origin of the poorly stored radioactive source was traced to KSE, which was charged with possessing radioactive substances without permission and was fined 15,000 baht (approx $450). Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants (EnLAW), a non-governmental advocacy group, later filed a class action lawsuit against KSE {{on behalf of the}} victims, and also against the OAEP in the Administrative Court. The Administrative Court later ruled in 2003 in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs,</b> ordering the OAEP to pay 5,222,301 baht (approx $155,000) as restitution. KSE was ordered by the Civil Court to pay a total of 640,246 baht (approx $19,000).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{personal injury}} litigation as melodrama. It compares <b>the</b> bipolar roles <b>of</b> melodramatic heroine and villain with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> and defendant in adversarial court proceedings. It draws analogies between the stereotypical feminine characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heroine and those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> in litigation. This paper argues that although, in theory, any individual plaintiff can comply with <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal injury narrative, in practice <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> role are paradoxical {{and result in}} subtle discrimination against women. The legal injury narrative also replicates existing gender inequalities and power systems in Australian society...|$|R

30|$|Besides {{the three}} {{procedural}} classes, we {{will focus on}} four outcomes that can occur in these types of cases: lawsuit accepted, lawsuit partially accepted, lawsuit dismissed and lawsuit settled.

Lawsuit partially accepted occurs when the judge makes a decision giving partial gains to <b>the</b> plaintif—the <b>plaintiff</b> wins <b>the</b> suits but not the full amount requested. Lawsuit dismissed occurs when <b>the</b> trial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case is unfavorable to the plaintif—the judge makes a decision in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defendant and not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> (e.g., <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff’s</b> request was unfounded).
