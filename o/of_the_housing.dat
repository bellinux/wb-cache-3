5|$|The site, a {{steeply sloping}} {{hillside}} between a main railway line {{and one of}} Brighton's main roads, had been {{the home of a}} railway locomotive works and goods yard for more than a century.

From the 1960s, the area fell into decline: the works and goods yard were closed and demolished, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> was cleared. This left large areas of derelict land which attracted small-scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises. Proposals for redevelopment were made from the 1980s onwards; in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by Brighton and Hove City Council.

5|$|In 1971, Livingstone and {{his comrades}} {{developed}} a new strategy for obtaining political power in Lambeth borough. Focusing on campaigning for the marginal seats {{in the south of}} the borough, the safe Labour seats in the north were left to established party members. Public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of Prime Minister Edward Heath led to Labour's best local government results since the 1940s; Labour leftists gained every marginal seat in Lambeth, and the borough returned to Labour control. In October 1971, Livingstone's father died of a heart attack; his mother soon moved to Lincoln. That year, Labour members voted Livingstone Vice-Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Housing</b> Committee on the Lambeth London Borough Council, his first job in local government. Reforming the housing system, Livingstone and Committee Chairman Ewan Carr cancelled the proposed rent increase for council housing, temporarily halting the construction of Europe's largest tower blocks, and founded a Family Squatting Group to ensure that homeless families would be immediately rehoused through squatting in empty houses. He increased the number of compulsory purchase orders for private-rented properties, converting them to council housing. They faced opposition to their reforms, which were cancelled by central government.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, the U.S. Congress, {{then the}} {{governing}} {{institution of the}} District of Columbia, undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project, {{the first in the}} capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation. In 1946, Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital. Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped, and how. The RLA was not funded, however, until passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Housing</b> Act of 1949. A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings, overcrowding, and threats to public health (such as lack of running indoor water, sewage systems, electricity, central heating, and indoor toilets). Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods, but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding. Original plans called for the demolition of almost all structures in Southwest Washington beginning in 1950, but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|Since 1954, a {{year ahead}} of the 1955 general election, an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has been {{appointed}} to advise the executive on the number and geographical division of electoral divisions.

This is generally done just before a general election to review the boundaries of electoral divisions and recommend changes. In recent decades, the Committee has been chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and has had four other members who are senior public servants.

5|$|Water-power {{was first}} {{introduced}} to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719, but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power {{to the process of}} producing cotton in the 1770s. His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously, meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers. Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright's first mill, with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce; this system of production and workers' housing was copied throughout the valley. To ensure the presence of a labour force, it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills– sometimes developing a pre-existing community– with their own amenities such as schools, chapels, and markets. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> still exists and is still in use. Along with the transport infrastructure form part of the site.

The government of Trinidad and Tobago sent 190policemen, {{and the government of}} Anguilla sent 1,230cases of water. A committee of Caribbean nations realized the local governments could not provide the support that Grenada needed in its aftermath, and thus turned to international assistance. Within a day of Ivan passing to the south of Grenada, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) deployed 67,600gallons of water, 500rolls of plastic sheeting, four 10,000liter water bladder kits, and a water treatment kit; assistance from USAID totaled $6million (2004USD) within a few weeks of the storm's passage, primarily in aid for reconstruction and rehabilitation. In the weeks subsequent to the hurricane, the European Commission Humanitarian aid Office (ECHO) provided €3million (2004EUR). By a year later, housing redevelopments and disaster preparation problems continued after being impacted by Hurricane Emily; as a result, the ECHO provided €1.2million (2005EUR) to Grenada in September 2005. Nine months after the hurricane, Chinese officials provided assistance in reconstruction and handling foreign debts after meeting with the Grenadian Prime Minister; in 2007, Chinese officials funded {{the construction of a new}} $40million (2007USD) cricket stadium near St. George's.
