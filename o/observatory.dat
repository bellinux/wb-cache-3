5|$|The Students' <b>Observatory</b> was {{constructed}} in 1886 on the Berkeley campus, with the original funds provided by the California legislature {{in order for the}} <b>observatory</b> to provide practical training to civil engineers. Very quickly, the Students' <b>Observatory</b> became seen as a training ground for students studying astronomy, so that they would be better prepared to go on to use the facilities at Lick <b>Observatory.</b> This contributed to the separation of the departments of civil engineering and astronomy in the mid-1890s, with the Students' <b>Observatory</b> becoming the home of the Berkeley Astronomy Department.|$|E

The exhibition was inaugurated on 19 September 2014 at 11.00 am. The objective of the exhibition was to spread the knowledge regarding the astronomical <b>observatories</b> with large telescopes. In 1609, Galileo Galilei used telescope for astronomical purpose {{for the first time}} and since then the telescope <b>observatories</b> are becoming bigger and more advance. The exhibition provided information on basics of telescope, working of big <b>observatories,</b> amateur <b>observatories,</b> etc. Exhibition consisted of posters, models of some <b>observatories,</b> Jyotirvidya’s telescope setups, multimedia displays, short films, etc.Both day were busy with school students and residents and astronomy enthusiasts.
