40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{deployed}} the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) {{from the}} Space Shuttle payload bay during the STS- 48 mission in September, 1991. The 5700 kg satellite was decommissioned in December, 2005 and was maneuvered into a lower altitude orbit to shorten its on-orbit lifetime {{to reduce the}} probability of a debris producing accidental collision. The satellite reentered the Earth s atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean on September 24, 2011. Analysis by NASA s Orbital Debris Program Office using the ORSAT software predicted that approximately two dozen fragments from UARS would survive reentry to reach the ground. This presentation will discuss the reentry predictions made in the days prior to the reentry and compare the UARS reentry with other historical reentries. It will also present the results of the <b>ORSAT</b> <b>analysis</b> showing predicted surviving reentry object...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} energy costs, the use {{of waste}} fuels has become commonplace in the petroleum and petrochemical industries. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers Power Test Codes date back to 1915, but do not directly approach the subject of multiple fuels. Instead, the codes reference {{an article published in}} the ASME Transactions in August, 1956. In this paper, the efficiency calculations were based on a 'total' analysis of the stack gases using an <b>Orsat</b> type <b>analysis.</b> That approach has been updated in the current paper. Several important areas concerning the determination of boiler efficiency are discussed. The various heat and material balance equations used are discussed in detail. When multiple fuels are present, additional information is required, including fuel analyses and fuel rates. The fuel properties must be combined in an appropriate manner to determine the overall fuel properties. A total stack analysis is required for the indirect efficiency calculations. This analysis may be done either on-line or in the laboratory by chromatography. A method estimating the total stack analysis using only an oxygen analyzer and carbon monoxide analyzer is shown. Examples of multi-fuel efficiencies for four industrial boilers are presented and discussed. The testing program for determining efficiency models is discussed...|$|R
