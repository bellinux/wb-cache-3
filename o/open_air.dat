40|$|AbstractAn {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to test the brake power of Honda Model GX- 120 -four strokes-spark ignited engine. The producer gas was made from dry wood by the gasification process. The producer gas was used as a fuel for the engine. To study the effect of compression ratio and percentage of <b>opened</b> <b>air</b> inlet valve on break power, the compression ratio of 7. 5 : 1 and 9. 3 : 1 and percentage of <b>opened</b> <b>air</b> inlet valve of 30 % and 75 % were used. It was found that the brake power of compression ratio at 9. 3 : 1 with 75 % of <b>opened</b> <b>air</b> inlet valve was 1, 443. 6 Watts at 3, 800 rpm showed the highest break engine power because the high compression ratio was high, and the brake power was also high as the basic theory of an ideal Otto cycle...|$|R

5|$|Doro's album Fear No Evil was {{released}} in January 2009 and entered in many charts all over Europe. It was her last collaboration with guitarist Joe Taylor, who left to join Cycle of Pain.

5|$|Social {{amenities}} were rudimentary {{even before}} {{the formation of the}} Rhondda Urban District Council in 1897. Due to the geographic layout of the valleys, land was a scarce resource, and therefore leisure activities that took up little space, time and money were sought. This saw the popularity of activities such as greyhound races, cockfighting, <b>open</b> <b>air</b> handball courts (often attached to a public house), boxing booths, foot racing and rugby union.|$|E

5|$|The UK case of R. (Ghai) v. Newcastle City Council (2009) is {{therefore}} interesting {{for purposes of}} comparison. The claimant, an orthodox Hindu, applied to his local authority for land to be dedicated for traditional <b>open</b> <b>air</b> funeral pyres. The local authority refused the request, relying on subsidiary legislation that made it an offence to burn human remains other than in a crematorium. The claimant then applied for judicial review, submitting that the decision infringed his right to manifest his religion or belief which was protected by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The High Court found that the statutory interference with the claimant's right was justified as {{it was necessary for}} the protection of public morals and of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on grounds unrelated to Article 9, holding that <b>open</b> <b>air</b> pyres were permissible on a proper construction of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|The centenary of Parry's {{death was}} marked by an <b>open</b> <b>air</b> concert in Merthyr Tydfil's Cyfarthfa Park {{featuring}} performances of Parry's works.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Meticulous sealing of <b>opened</b> <b>air</b> {{cells in}} the petrous bone is {{necessary}} for the prevention of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulae after vestibular schwannoma surgery. We performed a retrospective analysis to determine whether muscle or fat tissue is superior for this purpose. METHODS: Between January 2001 and December 2006, 420 patients underwent retrosigmoidal microsurgical removal by a standardized procedure. The <b>opened</b> <b>air</b> cells at the inner auditory canal and the mastoid bone were sealed with muscle in 283 patients and with fat tissue in 137 patients. Analysis was performed regarding the incidence of postoperative CSF fistulae and correlation with the patient's sex and tumor grade. RESULTS: The rate of postoperative CSF leak after application of fat tissue was lower (2. 2 %) than after use of muscle (5. 7 %). Women had less postoperative CSF leakage (3. 4 %) than men (5. 6 %). There was an inverse correlation with tumor grade. Patients with smaller tumors seemed to have a higher rate of CSF leakage than those with large tumors without hydrocephalus. Only large tumors with severe dislocation of the brainstem causing hydrocephalus showed a higher incidence of CSF leaks. CONCLUSION: Fat implantation is superior to muscle implantation for the prevention of CSF leakage after vestibular schwannoma surgery and should, therefore, be used for the sealing of <b>opened</b> <b>air</b> cells in cranial base surgery...|$|R
