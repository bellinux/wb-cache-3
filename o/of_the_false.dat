5|$|Pacific populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>false</b> {{catshark}} {{were once}} {{regarded as a}} separate species, P. acrales. However, morphological comparisons have failed to find any consistent differences between P. microdon and P. acrales, leading {{to the conclusion that}} there is only one species of false catshark. The closest relatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>false</b> catshark are the gollumsharks (Gollum). Pseudotriakis and Gollum share a number of morphological similarities. Phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes has found that the amount of genetic divergence between these taxa is less than that between some other shark species within the same genus. This result suggests that the many autapomorphies (unique traits) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>false</b> catshark evolved relatively recently, and supports the grouping of Pseudotriakis and Gollum together in the family Pseudotriakidae.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>false</b> indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E

5|$|Other {{distinguishing}} features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>false</b> potto {{are in the}} dentition. Sarmiento notes, however, that captive specimens may develop abnormalities in the teeth and that some dental characters Schwartz uses are quite variable, sometimes even {{from one side of}} the same individual to another. The third upper molar (M3) is more reduced in the false potto than in any other prosimian, according to Schwartz, but Leon notes that western pottos also have a relatively small M3. The third upper premolar (P3) is also reduced, resembling the condition in the fork-marked lemurs (Phaner). Stump writes that small P3s are also common in western pottos, although the false potto's P3 is shaped differently. Groves notes that P1 is quite long, another point of similarity with the fork-marked lemurs. The lower premolars are compressed laterally in Pseudopotto, the cusps on the cheekteeth are higher, and the cristid obliqua (a crest connected to the protoconid cusp) is at a relatively buccal position (in the direction of the cheeks).|$|E
5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>false</b> catshark {{suggest a}} sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% {{of its total}} weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E
5|$|When the Bahraini {{uprising}} {{started in}} February 2011, Al-Wasat and al-Jamri covered {{both sides of}} the conflict. Al-Jamri was involved in reconciliation talks until 15 March when Saudi troops entered Bahrain. That day, Al-Wasat printing facility was destroyed. Its employees which already faced harassment by groups of youths had to work from home. The next month, the newspaper was charged by government to publishing fabricated news about the uprising and was suspended. Al-Jamri acknowledged his mistake, but said he was set up and downplayed the impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>false</b> news. He resigned from his position and the newspaper was allowed to publish the next day. He was subsequently charged and convicted of publishing false news. In August, Al-Wasat board of directors reinstated him back to his position.|$|E

5|$|With flabby {{muscles and}} a large oily liver, the false {{catshark}} is a slow-moving predator and scavenger {{of a variety of}} fishes and invertebrates. It has a viviparous mode of reproduction, featuring an unusual form of oophagy in which the developing embryos consume ova or egg fragments released by the mother and use the yolk material to replenish their external yolk sacs for later use. This species typically gives birth to two pups at a time. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>false</b> catshark. While neither targeted by fisheries nor commercially valuable, it is caught incidentally by longlines and bottom trawls, and its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to population depletion.|$|E

50|$|Cutting a deck {{of cards}} is a {{technique}} whereby the deck is split into two portions (the split point being randomly determined - often by a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience), which are then swapped - the effect being to make sure that no one is sure of which card is on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deck. <b>False</b> cuts are techniques whereby the performer appears to organise a fair cut, when actually a predetermined card (or cards) is organised to be located on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deck. <b>False</b> cutting techniques include: <b>the</b> <b>false</b> running cut, and <b>the</b> gambler's <b>false</b> cut.|$|R

5000|$|A false god is, in Abrahamic doctrines, a deity or {{object of}} worship that is {{regarded}} as either illegitimate or non-functioning in its professed authority or capability, and this characterization is further used as a definition <b>of</b> [...] "idol". <b>The</b> term is often used throughout the Bible to compare YHWH, interpreted by Jews and Christians, or Elohim/Allah, interpreted by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, as the only real God. For example, 2 Kings 17:30 (NLV) states, with reference to false gods, [...] "The men <b>of</b> Babylon made <b>the</b> <b>false</b> god Succoth-benoth. <b>The</b> men <b>of</b> Cuth made <b>the</b> <b>false</b> god Nergal. <b>The</b> men <b>of</b> Hamath made <b>the</b> <b>false</b> god Ashima".|$|R
