5|$|Article III has one section, {{confirming}} the principle <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. Unlike the U.S. federal Constitution, the Virginia Constitution explicitly provides that no branch may exercise powers that properly {{belong to the}} others. Separation between the branches of government is also listed as a {{right of the people}} in §5 of Article I.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{also argued}} that if the Electoral Act {{actually}} appeared to confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as the determination of disputes about election results is a non-judicial function. Also, the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers meant that non-judicial power cannot be conferred on a Chapter III Court such as the High Court.|$|E

5|$|Two of the judges, Justice Deane and Justice Gaudron, {{went further}} and {{suggested}} {{that the right to}} representation in some circumstances is founded in the Constitution. They said that Chapter Three of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature with the notion <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers, and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires that judicial process and fairness be observed.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based on the degree <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which {{the tips of the}} arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{cultural}} properties {{were originally}} in {{the ownership of}} Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and aristocratic or samurai families. Feudal Japan ended abruptly in 1867/68 when the Tokugawa shogunate {{was replaced by the}} Meiji Restoration. During the ensuing haibutsu kishaku ("abolish Buddhism and destroy Shākyamuni") triggered by the official policy <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> Shinto and Buddhism and anti-Buddhist movements propagating the return to Shinto, Buddhist buildings and artwork were destroyed. In 1871, the government confiscated temple lands, considered symbolic of the ruling elite. Properties belonging to the feudal lords were expropriated, historic castles and residences were destroyed, and an estimated 18,000 temples were closed. During the same period, Japanese cultural heritage was impacted by the rise of industrialization and westernization. As a result, Buddhist and Shinto institutions became impoverished. Temples decayed, and valuable objects were exported.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} the {{courtroom}} where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton {{is seen as a}} reference to the 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, which dealt with issues <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> church and state and the debate between creationism and evolution. The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant and the Piltdown Man. When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged {{at the end of the}} episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, Chief Wiggum is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a Pottery Barn in the new Heavenly Hills mall. A shot of the diggers in silhouette against the sunset is modeled after Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).|$|E
5|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the {{plaintiff}} {{argued that the}} 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the basic features of the Constitution by breaching the principle <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers by usurping judicial power, and contravening the rule of law. The Court rejected {{the application of the}} basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution, {{and the fact that the}} framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's basic features on the facts of the case. On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The book starts by {{quoting the}} First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from {{creating}} legislation that limits free speech or {{freedom of the}} press. The author analyzes {{the impact of this}} clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed that freedom of the press would serve as a form <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.|$|E
