5|$|Some {{research}} shows that <b>obese</b> people {{are less likely to}} be hired for a job and {{are less likely to be}} promoted. <b>Obese</b> people are also paid less than their non-obese counterparts for an equivalent job; <b>obese</b> women on average make 6% less and <b>obese</b> men make 3% less.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} period, {{insurance}} companies realized {{the connection between}} weight and life expectancy and increased premiums for the <b>obese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that <b>obese</b> people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, <b>obese</b> people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{that have}} focused on {{inheritance}} patterns rather than on specific genes have found that 80% of the offspring of two <b>obese</b> parents were also <b>obese,</b> in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight. Different people exposed to the same environment have different risks of obesity due to their underlying genetics.|$|E

5|$|By {{measure of}} mean {{body mass index}} (BMI) Nauruans are the most {{overweight}} people in the world; 97% of men and 93% of women are overweight or <b>obese.</b> In 2012 the obesity rate was 71.7%.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that in <b>obese</b> people, bariatric surgery (and {{especially}} gastric bypass surgery) can lead to resolution of the condition in over 95%.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{generally}} ranks highly {{among states}} in most health and disease prevention categories. In 2014, the United Health Foundation ranked {{the state as}} third-healthiest overall. Massachusetts has the most doctors per 100,000 residents, the second-lowest infant mortality rate, and the lowest percentage of uninsured residents (for both {{children as well as}} the total population). According to Businessweek, commonwealth residents have an average life expectancy of 78.4 years, the fifth-longest in the country. 37.2% of the population is overweight and 21.7% is <b>obese,</b> and Massachusetts ranks sixth-highest in the percentage of residents who are considered neither <b>obese</b> nor overweight (41.1%). Massachusetts also ranks above average in the prevalence of binge drinking, which is the 20th-highest in the country.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the <b>obese.</b> Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. <b>Obese</b> people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Out of all dog breeds {{it is the}} Labrador Retriever that is {{most likely}} to <b>obese.</b> This obesity has been {{attributed}} to a specific gene mutation. See the Obesity sub section below.|$|E
5|$|Potbelly sculptures are {{generally}} rough sculptures that show considerable variation {{in size and}} {{the position of the}} limbs. They depict <b>obese</b> human figures, usually sat cross-legged with their arms upon their stomach. They have puffed out or hanging cheeks, closed eyes and are of indeterminate gender.|$|E
5|$|Ricky Jarvis (McCulloch) is an <b>obese</b> {{man who has}} {{not left}} his house since he lost a hockey tournament; as {{the captain of the}} town's hockey team, he lost all his stamina in sex with a rival team's {{cheerleader}} the night before the final game.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj has various {{so-called}} Potbelly monuments representing <b>obese</b> {{human figures}} sculpted from large boulders, {{of a type}} found throughout the Pacific lowlands, extending from Izapa in Mexico to El Salvador. Their precise function is unknown but they appear to date from the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The boss {{characters}} of the game include Papu Papu, an <b>obese</b> and short-tempered chief of the native village; Ripper Roo, a demented kangaroo with razor-sharp toenails; Koala Kong, a muscular but unintelligent koala; and Pinstripe Potoroo, Doctor Cortex's tommy gun-wielding bodyguard.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{goal of the}} fat acceptance {{movement is}} to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and <b>obese.</b> However, some in the movement are also attempting to challenge the established relationship between obesity and negative health outcomes.|$|E
5|$|The series {{includes}} a homosexual character, Guillermo Almada (Juan Gil Navarro), {{who came out}} in the early episodes and later married his partner in a ceremony featuring guest appearances by Evangelina Salazar and Luis Brandoni. This was the first fictional same-sex marriage on Argentine television since it was legalized in 2010, reflected the growing acceptance of sexual freedom in Argentina. Another character, Patricia Longo, was an <b>obese</b> girl who was a victim of school bullying. Isabel Macedo had to be heavily made up to appear <b>obese</b> for the flashbacks. Patricia was initially the telenovela's villain, with the bullying her motivation for inflicting revenge on her former classmates. The episode in which she reveals her true identity was well received.|$|E
5|$|When George III died in 1820, the Prince Regent, then aged 57, {{ascended the}} throne as George IV, {{with no real}} change in his powers. By {{the time of his}} accession, he was <b>obese</b> and {{possibly}} addicted to laudanum.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black {{people are more likely to}} be <b>obese</b> than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but <b>obese</b> Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|According to film {{historian}} Laurent Bouzereau, Jabba the Hutt's {{death in}} Return of the Jedi was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan. Lucas decided Leia should strangle {{him with her}} slave chain. He {{was inspired by a}} scene from The Godfather (1972) where an <b>obese</b> character named Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) is garroted by an assassin.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 the WHO {{formally}} recognized obesity as {{a global}} epidemic. As of 2008 the WHO estimates that at least 500 million adults (greater than 10%) are <b>obese,</b> with higher rates among women than men. The percentage of adults affected in the United States as of 2014 is about 38% overall (35% of males and 40% of females).|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the <b>obese</b> may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both <b>obese</b> and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, <b>obese</b> workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge <b>obese</b> workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E
5|$|Oklahomans are in {{the upper}} half of Americans in terms of obesity prevalence, and the state is the 5th most <b>obese</b> in the nation, with 30.3 percent of its {{population}} at or near obesity. Oklahoma ranked last among the 50 states in a 2007 study by the Commonwealth Fund on health care performance.|$|E
5|$|Virginia has a mixed health record, and {{is ranked}} as the 26th overall healthiest state {{according}} to the 2013 United Health Foundation's Health Rankings. Virginia also ranks 21st among {{the states in the}} rate of premature deaths, 6,816 per 100,000. In 2008, Virginia reached its lowest ever rate of infant mortality, at 6.7 deaths per1,000. There are however racial and social health disparities, in 2010 African Americans experienced 28% more premature deaths than whites, while 13% of Virginians lack any health insurance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2009 survey, 26% of Virginians are <b>obese</b> and another 35% are overweight. 78% of residents claim to have exercised at least once in the past three months. About 30% of Virginia's 10- to 17-year-olds are overweight or <b>obese.</b> Virginia banned smoking in bars and restaurants in January 2010. 19% of Virginians smoke tobacco. Residents of Virginia's 8th congressional district share the longest average life expectancy rate in the nation, over 83 years.|$|E
5|$|While the {{detection}} of Mups excreted by other animals has been well studied, the functional role in the producing animal is less clear. However, in 2009, Mups were shown {{to be associated with}} the regulation of energy expenditure in mice. Scientists found that genetically induced <b>obese,</b> diabetic mice produce thirty times less Mup RNA than their lean siblings. When they delivered Mup protein directly into the bloodstream of these mice, they observed an increase in energy expenditure, physical activity and body temperature and a corresponding decrease in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. They propose that Mups' beneficial effects on energy metabolism occurs by enhancing mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Another study found Mups were reduced in diet-induced <b>obese</b> mice. In this case, the presence of Mups in the bloodstream of mice restricted glucose production by directly inhibiting the expression of genes in the liver.|$|E
25|$|Hypothyroidism is a {{hormonal}} {{cause of}} obesity, {{but it does}} not significantly affect <b>obese</b> people who have it more than <b>obese</b> people who do not have it. In a comparison of 108 <b>obese</b> patients with hypothyroidism to 131 <b>obese</b> patients without hypothyroidism, researchers discovered that those with hypothyroidism had only 0.077 points more on the caloric intake scale than did those without hypothyroidism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Obese</b> {{children}} and adolescents {{are more likely to}} become <b>obese</b> as adults. For example, one study found that approximately 80% of children who were overweight at aged 10–15 years were <b>obese</b> adults at age 25 years. Another study found that 25% of <b>obese</b> adults were overweight as children. The latter study also found that if overweight begins before 8 years of age, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe.|$|E
25|$|Children who are <b>obese</b> {{are likely}} to be <b>obese</b> as adults. Thus, they are more at risk for adult health {{problems}} such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. One study showed that children who became <b>obese</b> as early as age 2 {{were more likely to be}} <b>obese</b> as adults. According to an article in The New York Times all of these health effects are contributing to a shorter lifespan of five years for these <b>obese</b> children. It is the first time in two centuries that the current generation of children in America may have a shorter lifespan than their parents.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham is {{considered}} the European Union’s fattest city. 29% {{of the adult population}} are classified as <b>obese</b> while the European average is 14%. A quarter of Birmingham's 11- and 12-year-olds are considered <b>obese.</b>|$|E
25|$|CD36's {{association}} {{with the ability to}} taste fats has made it a target for various studies regarding obesity and alteration of lipid tasting. CD36 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in taste bud cells (TBC) of <b>obese</b> sand rats (P. obesus) compared to lean controls, implicating an association between CD36 and obesity. Although actual levels of CD36 protein were not different between the <b>obese</b> and control rat cells, Abdoul-Azize et al. hypothesize that the physical distribution of CD36 could differ in <b>obese</b> rat cells. Changes in calcium mediation have been associated with CD36 and obesity as well. Taste bud cells (more specifically, cells from the circumvallate papillae) containing CD36 that were isolated from <b>obese</b> mice exhibited a significantly smaller increase in calcium after fatty acid stimulation when compared to control mice: CD36 associated calcium regulation is impaired when mice are made to be <b>obese</b> (but not in normal weight mice), and this could be a mechanism contributing to behavior changes in the <b>obese</b> mice, such as decreased lipid taste sensitivity and decreased attraction to fats.|$|E
25|$|There is {{increased}} risk of complications for <b>obese</b> people going through total knee replacement. The morbidly <b>obese</b> should be advised to lose weight before surgery and, if medically eligible, would probably benefit from bariatric surgery.|$|E
25|$|The first {{problems}} {{to occur in}} <b>obese</b> children are usually emotional or psychological. <b>Obese</b> children often experience bullying by their peers. Some are harassed or discriminated against by their own family. Stereotypes abound and may lead to low self-esteem and depression.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that BMI had a good general {{correlation}} with body fat percentage, and noted that obesity has overtaken smoking as the world's number one cause of death. But it also notes that in the study 50% of men and 62% of women were <b>obese</b> according to body fat defined obesity, while only 21% of men and 31% of women were <b>obese</b> according to BMI, meaning that BMI was found to underestimate the number of <b>obese</b> subjects.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that 80% of the {{offspring}} of two <b>obese</b> parents were <b>obese</b> in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight. The percentage of obesity that {{can be attributed to}} genetics varies from 6% to 85% depending on the population examined.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1994 {{showed that}} 59.8% of American men and 51.2% of women had BMIs over 25. Morbid obesity—a BMI of 40 or more—was found in 2% {{of the men}} and 4% of the women. A survey in 2007 showed 63% of Americans are {{overweight}} or <b>obese,</b> with 26% in the <b>obese</b> category (a BMI of 30 or more). As of 2014, 37.7% of adults in the United States were <b>obese,</b> categorized as 35.0% of men and 40.4% of women; class 3 obesity (BMI over 40) values were 7.7% for men and 9.9% for women.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes and prediabetes are {{strongly}} linked to obesity and overweight. Nearly 50% {{of people with}} diabetes are <b>obese,</b> and 90% are overweight. 19 A chief risk factor for prediabetes is excess abdominal fat. Obesity increases one’s risk {{for a variety of}} other medical problems, including hypertension, stroke, other forms of cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and several forms of cancer. <b>Obese</b> individuals are at twice the risk of dying from any cause than normal-weight individuals. The prevalence of obesity and overweight have risen to epidemic proportions in the United States, where 67% of adults are overweight and, of these, approximately half are <b>obese.</b>|$|E
