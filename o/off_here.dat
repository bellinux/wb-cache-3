500|$|Describing {{the song}} as [...] "reggaeton-inflected" [...] the Los Angeles Times Gerrick D. Kennedy {{believed}} that [...] "All In My Head (Flex)", {{as well as}} another 7/27 track, [...] "Not That Kinda Girl," [...] "are the album's most infectious offerings". Spins editor, Brian Josephs, complimented the song's reggae production and the group's sensual performance; however, he had a negative view of Fetty Wap's appearance commenting that the rapper [...] "fails to come <b>off</b> <b>here</b> as much more than Default Guest Rapper". However, Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic felt that [...] "All In My Head (Flex) brings in the most exuberant rapper of our times, Fetty Wap, to very catchy effect." ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Shaar Murray {{likens the}} figure to a feminine ideal: [...] "Sometimes {{she is a}} spirit, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a woman as solidly, palpably physical as he is". [...] The figure first appears as [...] "Waterfall" [...] in [...] "May This Be Love", where she offers solace and hope, and as [...] "a soulful, loving sprite" [...] in [...] "Little Wing". [...] However, other writers {{have suggested that the}} figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity, which is clearly what she represents in Hendrix's later song [...] "Angel". Hendrix's brother, Leon, interpreted [...] "Little Wing" [...] (and [...] "Angel") as a general tribute: [...] "He wrote it for his girlfriends, our aunties, and especially for our mama, who looked over us from high above in the afterlife". [...] Hendrix's hand-written lyrics for [...] "Angel" [...] (with the note, [...] "Finished January 14, 1968") use the title [...] "My Angel Catherina (Return of Little Wing)", which suggests that he saw a connection between the two songs. [...] At the time, Hendrix had just finished a short tour of Scandinavia, where he had performed [...] "Little Wing" [...] in concert for the first time. [...] At some point he responded to a question, [...] "Love? I know a girl, Katerina, in Sweden." [...] In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: [...] "So like 'Little Wing' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes... She was a very sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more if I wanted it. And me with my crazy ass couldn't get it together, so I'm <b>off</b> <b>here</b> and there and off over there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Featured on {{the album}} is [...] "Erk Gah", a never before {{released}} Tim Hodgkinson composition that was performed live regularly by the band between 1976 and 1978, but never recorded in the studio. (Hodgkinson later recorded it in 1993 as [...] "Hold to the Zero Burn, Imagine" [...] on his 1994 solo album, Each in Our Own Thoughts {{with some of the}} former Henry Cow members and others.) Also featured for the first time is a never before released Fred Frith composition, [...] "March" [...] which the band used to end many of their concerts, and a cover of Phil Ochs's [...] "No More Songs", arranged by Frith and the band's requiem to Ochs who had committed suicide in 1976. [...] "Ottawa Song" [...] is from an earlier concert in Hamburg with Dagmar Krause and John Greaves sharing the vocals, and was included on this CD by accident after having gotten mixed up with the Stockholm and Göteborg tapes. It is the same performance of [...] "Ottawa Song" [...] that appears on , except for the introductory bassoon solo, which has been stripped <b>off</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{station at}} Stalden, at around 799 metres above sea level, extends in an s-shape along the southwestern {{edge of the}} village. For a long time, the station itself was of great importance, as the {{departure}} point of the Postbus line into the Saastal. [...] It was therefore equipped with a generously sized station building, the second largest on the line after the one in Zermatt. At {{the start of the}} 20th century, there were plans to build another railway line to Saas-Fee that would branch <b>off</b> <b>here</b> from the existing line; World War I, however, thwarted these plans. The importance of the station (which, since 1931, has had the official name Stalden-Saas) has decreased since the 1950s, as the departure point since then for the Postbus line has been Brig, not Stalden. Nevertheless, the buses still stop also at Stalden station, and form a connection there with the trains to Zermatt. Immediately adjacent to the railway tracks there is also the base station of the cable car to Staldenried. Since 1986, the two tracks at Stalden have been equipped with continuous rack rails, as there are inclines immediately before and after the station. In addition to the two platform tracks there is also a loading track for goods traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{claimed that}} he found slavery bothersome and {{time-consuming}} as an everyday institution to run. In an 1856 letter to his wife he maintained that slavery was a great evil, but primarily due to adverse impact that it had on white people:In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better <b>off</b> <b>here</b> than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.After {{the end of the}} Civil War, it was often claimed that Lee was in some sense opposed to slavery. In the generation following the war, Lee, though he died just a few years later, became a central figure in the Lost Cause interpretation of the war. The argument that Lee had always somehow opposed slavery helped maintain his stature as a symbol of Southern honor and national reconciliation. Douglas Southall Freeman's Pulitzer prize-winning four-volume R. E. [...] Lee: A Biography (1936), which was for a long period considered the definite work on Lee, downplayed his involvement in slavery and emphasized Lee as a virtuous person. Eric Foner, who describes Freeman's volume as a [...] "", notes that on the whole, Freeman [...] "displayed little interest in Lee’s relationship to slavery. The index to his four volumes contained 22 entries for 'devotion to duty', 19 for 'kindness', 53 for Lee's celebrated horse, Traveller. But 'slavery', 'slave emancipation' and 'slave insurrection' together received five. Freeman observed, without offering details, that slavery in Virginia represented the system 'at its best'. He ignored the postwar testimony of Lee’s former slave Wesley Norris about the brutal treatment to which he had been subjected." ...|$|E
