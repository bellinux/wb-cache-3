5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first dorsal fin is about even with the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fins, while the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of}} the total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E

5|$|The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endomembrane {{system is}} linked to the origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria.

The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted.
