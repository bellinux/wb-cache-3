5|$|Because of {{the quality}} of his {{maritime}} illustrations, Coggins was invited by publisher Doubleday to provide artwork for a children's book about the U.S. Navy; the author being Fletcher Pratt, the well known military historian. Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt's Naval Game, based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> inch to fifty feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy, a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April the squadrons {{were issued}} Hotchkiss machine-guns, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> per troop, which {{replaced}} the regiment's three Lewis guns. The second British {{attempt to take}} Gaza would be on 17 April, but {{the day before the}} brigade moved to Hareira, providing flank protection and preventing Turkish reinforcement from that direction. The regiment reached Shellal at 03:00, where they stopped to water their horses. At dawn hostile aircraft appeared overhead, which were engaged by the 11th Squadron, forcing them to fly at a higher altitude. By 09:00 the regiment was positioned overlooking Hareira, Sheria, and the Gaza-Beersheba rail line. Several times during the day they were machine gunned by hostile aircraft, but no casualties were sustained. That night at 22:00, as ordered, they returned to Shellal.|$|E
40|$|Since the Gravimetric Map <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 1 / 500 000 was {{published}} in 1987, the Geological Survey of Catalonia (SGC) published in 1989 the Geological and the Aeromagnetic maps <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 1 / 250 000.

Currently the Survey is developping a project of regional geological mapping <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 1 / 25 000 wich aim is to cover the entire area of Catalonia (about 31 879 sq. km), which is included into 301 sheets. The Survey is also involved in a project of detailed geological mapping of the highly populated, neighbouring area of Barcelona (about 3 180 sq. km.) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 1 / 10 000. Other projects the Survey is going on are the Structural Map <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 1 / 250 000 and a new edition of the Geological Map at the same scale. Either the hardware and software facilities, the topographic bases, and the edition and publication works are supplied by the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia (ICC).

5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend {{to remain in}} above average condition, despite the harsh {{environment in which they}} live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E

500|$|... "Our Father" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; some {{thought that it}} was dull, though Smits' performance received widespread critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that he was [...] "frustrated" [...] by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, [...] "I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of Dexter Morgan's world as I need to." [...] Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was [...] "an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the edge of my seat" [...] but that Smits as Miguel could improve [...] "even [...] great [...] like Dexter". The Australians Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, [...] "Dexter has gone from an eight to a six" [...] <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> to ten, saying that the show [...] "has lost its edge" [...] with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships. Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was [...] "not sure yet whether [...] good". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that [...] "the series has settled into a state of complacency" [...] and could not [...] "escape the feeling I've seen this before". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman wrote that [...] "the whiff of normalcy for Dexter" [...] gives viewers [...] "a magnificent tease" [...] and likened the fast-moving plot to [...] "the urgency of brilliance". TV Squad critic Debra McDuffee was [...] "pleasantly surprised by Smits" [...] and said that, thus far, [...] "season three is a good one". TV Guides Paula Paige, who was [...] "thrilled" [...] to see Smits join the cast, said, [...] "What the Dexter season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made up for in Jimmy Smits." [...] Daniel Fienberg, writing for Zap2it, said that the combination of Hall and Smits was [...] "as good as TV acting gets" [...] and that, in comparison to the second season's opening, [...] "the show's creative team appears to have done it again".|$|E

Syrett has stated that [...] "fraternal masculinity has, for at least 80 years, valorized athletics, alcohol abuse and sex with women." [...] Time magazine columnist Jessica Bennett has denounced fraternities as breeding [...] "sexism and misogyny that lasts long after college." [...] In her column, Bennett recounts that, while she was an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California, doormen at fraternity parties [...] "often ranked women <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> to 10, with only 'sixes' and up granted entry to a party." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Texas death-penalty statute {{required}} that the jury consider whether Barefoot would pose [...] "future dangerousness". [...] Along with other evidence, the prosecution called two psychiatrists who, answering hypothetical questions, testified that Barefoot was likely to remain a danger to society. Neither psychiatrist had examined Barefoot nor asked to do so, but each summarized their professional experience as equipping them {{to answer the questions}} accurately. One psychiatrist called Barefoot a [...] "criminal sociopath" [...] and said there was no treatment for this condition and that Barefoot was likely to commit acts of violence in the future. The other psychiatrist testified that Barefoot had [...] "a fairly classical, typical, sociopathic personality disorder." [...] He placed Barefoot in the [...] "most severe category" [...] of sociopaths, and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> to ten, Barefoot was [...] "above ten".

2500|$|Various luxury items {{dating from}} this period have been found at the site, namely African and Phocaean red slip, which had been traded {{all the way from}} the Mediterranean. Examining this pottery, Charles Thomas remarked that [...] "the {{quantity}} of imported pottery from Tintagel ... dramatically greater than that from any other single site dated to about 450–600 in either Britain or Ireland". Carrying on from this, he noted that the quantity of imported pottery from Tintagel was [...] "larger than the combined total of all such pottery from all known sites and, given that only about 5 per cent of the Island's accessible surface has been excavated or examined, the original total of imports may well have been <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> or more complete shiploads, with individual ships perhaps carrying a cargo of six or seven hundred amphorae." [...] This evidence led him to believe that Tintagel was a site where ships docked to deposit their cargo from southern Europe in the Early Medieval period.|$|E
2500|$|When {{reviewing}} the album, David Jeffries writing for AllMusic found [...] "Young, Wild & Free" [...] {{to have a}} more contemporary and friendly sound {{that the rest of the}} material on the album. Jeffries added that the single is [...] "polished, bright and sunshine material". In another album review, Michael Madden of Consequence of Sound [...] thought the track was one of the few songs to be good enough for a soundtrack, due to the [...] "smooth pop vocals of Bruno Mars and glitzy Hollywood production" [...] of the recording. The A.V. Clubs Chris Martins highlighted the single, for its [...] "sharp keys and lite Jackson 5 bounce", when comparing it to the other songs on the soundtrack which are all based on G-Funk. The song received a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Song at the 2013 ceremony and at the 2013 ASCAP Pop Music Awards it was awarded [...] "Most Performed Song". According to a list compiled by Billboard, which measured the [...] "inebriated energy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> (mildly buzzed) to 10 (totally stoned)" [...] of a song, [...] "Young, Wild & Free" [...] had a seven and the Billboard Staff commented that it could be appreciated not only by [...] "serious stoners" [...] but also everyone else, due to its playfulness.|$|E
