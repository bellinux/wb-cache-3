25|$|The first {{significant}} action {{was a free}} won by Dublin's Barry Cahill in the second minute. Cahill called forward his goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton to take a shot. Cluxton's attempt drifted {{to the left and}} wide. In the sixth minute Donegal's Christy Toye was hauled down by two Dublin players. Michael Murphy sent the resulting free wide. In the seventh minute Dublin's Alan Brogan shot spectacularly wide. A high challenge from Dublin's James McCarthy led to a yellow card in the eight minute. Colm McFadden scored the resulting free from inside the 45-metre line to give the <b>opening</b> <b>point</b> of the match to Donegal. In the tenth minute Dublin's Bernard Brogan ran through on the Donegal goal but his shot past Paul Durcan went to the left and wide. He made up for this two minutes later when he equalised by putting over Dublin's <b>opening</b> <b>point</b> from a free. The first 14 minutes of the match featured 12 frees. In the twenty-first minute Dublin's Bernard Brogan again attempted to score a point but his effort went to the right and wide. In the game's twenty-fourth minute Ryan Bradley restored Donegal's lead, evading the efforts of most of Dublin's players to send the ball between the posts and score the first point from play. One minute later, Bernard Brogan sent over a free to bring the game level again. In the twenty-ninth minute Kevin Cassidy sent Donegal into the lead again with a point from play via the outside of his boot. Colm McFadden added another point from play a minute later to send Donegal into a two-point lead for the first time. One minute after that, Alan Brogan sent another effort to the right and wide.

25|$|Kerry's Colm Cooper {{scored the}} <b>opening</b> <b>point</b> {{of the second}} half, with Cork's {{response}} consisting of several wides. Kerry captain Darren O'Sullivan then scored a dubious point which {{should not have been}} given as he bounced the ball twice before scoring. Kerry goalkeeper Diarmuid Murphy then preserved his team's four-point lead in the forty-seventh minute by saving Daniel Goulding's effort on goal. Donnacha O'Connor scored a free two minutes later to give Cork their first point for some time. Tadhg Kennelly was substituted for Donnacha Walsh. Goulding scored two more frees for Cork but Tommy Walsh followed up by scoring two frees for Kerry. Tomás Ó Sé scored what proved to be the final point of the match in the fifty-eighth minute. The remainder of the match consisted of wides and substitutes.|$|E

Kansas, however, was able to get on the board several times, jumping to a 17–0 lead before Virginia Tech scored its first points.

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to measure wind direction, such as the windsock and wind vane. Both of these instruments work by moving to minimize air resistance.

Jim English describes the respect behind Corkand Wexford's fifties rivalry.

Cork scored the <b>opening</b> <b>point</b> after just two minutes, while Christy Ring kept the scoreboard ticking over with some fine points. A palmed goal by Tom Ryan and a series of points from Nicky Rackard had Wexford ahead by 1-3 to 0-5 at the interval. With a strong breeze in their favour in the second half, Cork looked in a very strong position. Nicky Rackard had switched from full-forward to centre -forward to curb the long clearances of Vincy Twomey. By the tenth minute points from Tim Flood and Paddy Kehoe had Wexford 1-6 to 0-5 ahead. Ring and Twomey points cut the deficit to two and with four minutes left young Johnny Clifford trapped the ball on the end line, dribbled it along the ground and shot past Art Foley from a narrow angle.
