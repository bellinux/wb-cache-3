5|$|A 2002 {{research}} paper on machine vision by computer scientists Roman Goldenberg, Ron Kimmel, Ehud Rivlin, and Michael Rudzsky used Futurism's techniques of motion, as embodied by Dynamism <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dog</b> on a Leash, {{to illustrate the}} mathematical representation of periodic motion using {{a small number of}} eigenshapes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} expressed concern about unliveable conditions, with The Times of India reporting that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted a photograph <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> defecating on a bed in the Games Village. Secretary general of the Organising Committee Lalit Bhanot countered the complaints of poor sanitation when he claimed that cultural differences accounted for differing standards of cleanliness in India and the western world. He was subsequently ridiculed by both the Indian and international media.|$|E

5|$|Dynamism <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dog</b> on a Leash (Italian: Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio), {{sometimes}} called Dog on a Leash or Leash in Motion, is a 1912 painting by Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla. It {{was influenced by}} the artist's fascination with chronophotograpic studies of animals in motion. It is considered one of his best-known works, {{and one of the most}} important works in Futurism, though it received mixed critical reviews. The painting has been in the collection of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery since 1984.|$|E
5|$|In December 1903 Mark Twain, {{who opposed}} vivisection, {{published}} a short story, A Dog's Tale, in Harper's, written {{from the point}} of view <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> whose puppy is experimented on and killed. Given the timing and Twain's views, the story may have been inspired by the libel trial, according to Mark Twain scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin. Coleridge ordered 3,000 copies of A Dog's Tale, which were specially printed for him by Harper's.|$|E
5|$|Rescued by Rover {{is often}} {{considered}} to be the United Kingdom's first major fiction film. Some four hundred prints were sold at a price of £8 each, and they circulated for at least four or five years. The character of Rover the dog, played by Hepworth's family dog Blair, became a household name and is considered the world's first canine film star. This first appearance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> in a narrative based film caused the uncommon name of Rover to become popular for dogs.|$|E

5|$|The Brown Dog {{affair was}} a {{political}} controversy about vivisection that raged in England from 1903 until 1910. It involved the infiltration by Swedish feminists of University of London medical lectures, pitched battles between medical students and the police, police protection for the statue <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> a libel trial at the Royal Courts of Justice, {{and the establishment of}} a Royal Commission to investigate the use of animals in experiments. The affair became a cause célèbre that divided the country.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata, {{the great}} Hindu epic, narrates: a dog, {{with the help}} of a Rishi (sage) assumes various animal forms - {{starting}} from a dog to a tiger then to an elephant followed by a lion and a sharabha - terrorized every one in the hermitage of the Rishi. Eventually, Sharabha assumed a further fiercer form. In this fierce form he wanted to devour the Rishi. The Rishi then narrating the process of change in Sharabha’s development, as a result of his benevolence, cursed Sharabha to go back to his original form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> The epic does not relate Shiva to Sharabha.|$|E
5|$|Their {{sense of}} smell, while {{much better than}} that of humans, {{is not quite as}} good as that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> It is {{believed}} to {{play a key role in}} the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other common}} system defines [...] "dog years" [...] {{to be the}} actual {{calendar}} years (365 days each) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog's</b> life, and [...] "human years" [...] to be the equivalent age <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human being. By this terminology, the age <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 6-year-old <b>dog</b> is described as 6 dog years or 40–50 human years, a reversal from the previous definition.|$|R

5|$|Frank Williams was recaptured and {{was sent}} to a new camp without news of Judy's survival. However, stories began being told <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> helping {{drowning}} men reach pieces of debris on which to hold, and others recalled how the dog would bring them flotsam to keep them afloat. The dog would also allow men to hold onto her back while swimming them to safety. She had been found in the water by other survivors of the sinking, and once again hidden from the Japanese. Upon arrival at a dock, she was found by Les Searle who tried to smuggle her onto a truck with him. However, she was discovered by a Japanese Captain who threatened to kill her – whose order was countermanded by the newly arrived former Commander of the Medan camp and she was allowed to travel with Searle onto the new camp.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, {{was seen}} as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the {{southern}} stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents {{going out}} for a drive in a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow with the aid <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot {{at each other and}} mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} an unusual shape for a crocodilian, with a {{dome-shaped}} skull {{and a short}} smooth, concave snout with an upturned tip, the shape rather resembling the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> The upper jaw extends markedly further forward than the lower jaw. There are four pre-maxillary and fourteen to fifteen maxillary teeth {{on either side of}} the upper jaw and twenty-one or twenty-two teeth on each side of the lower jaw giving a total of about eighty teeth. The neck is relatively slender and the dorsal scutes are less prominent than in the smooth-fronted caiman (Paleosuchus trigonatus). The double row of scutes on the tail are small and project vertically. Adults are dark brownish-black with a dark brown head while juveniles are brown with black bands. The iris of the eye is chestnut brown at all ages and the pupil is a vertical slit.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of enduring overlordship from nearby Leinster, {{as compared to}} the more distant and anaemic overlordship of Munster, appears to have compelled the Dubliners to oppose the Leinstermen. The ensuing battle itself is recorded by both the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster and the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, which reveal that it was Domnall himself who marshalled the forces of Munster to victory. Considering Munster's weakened state, his triumph in Dublin was remarkable achievement. Unfortunately for Donnchad, however, he lost his life in the encounter; and according to the thirteenth-century ecclesiast Giraldus Cambrensis (died 1220×1223), the Dubliners added insult to injury by burying his corpse with that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> as a show of contempt to the Leinstermen. There is uncertainty as to when Domnall originally gained the kingship of Dublin. His father could have installed him as such upon assuming the Irish high-kingship, or perhaps following the aforesaid ousting of Gofraid Crobán in 1094although it is not impossible that Domnall mac Taidc was installed as king at this point instead. Another possibility is that Domnall had been appointed king not long before his victory over the Leinstermenperhaps upon his father's failing health in 1114or else not long after his successful defence of Dublin. Whatever the case, the evidence of Domnall's kingship indicates that Muirchertach Ua Briain was the third consecutive claimant to the high-kingship to appoint an intended successor to the kingship of Dublin.|$|E
