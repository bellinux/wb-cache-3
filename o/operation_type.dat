40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extended update functionality in temporal databases, {{as a vehicle}} for supporting simultaneous values semantics. A situation of simultaneous values of a single data item occurs when multiple values that are valid at the same time were assigned to a data item over the database history. In conventional temporal database models there is a fixed semantics to handle such a case; if the data item's type is an atom, then only one value is assigned, usually {{on the basis of the}} update time; if the data item's type allows for multiple values, then all the values persist. We show that various types of applications require support for different forms of simultaneous values semantics. The support of simultaneous values is achieved using an extended set of <b>operation</b> <b>types,</b> that consists of the conventional update <b>operation</b> <b>types</b> (insert, modify and delete) as well as additional types. The semantics of the update <b>operation</b> <b>types</b> is given, as well as the correctness of the model [...] . ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the fields}} of {{databases}} and transaction processing (transaction management), a schedule (or history) of a system is an abstract model to describe execution of transactions running in the system. Often it {{is a list of}} operations (actions) ordered by time, performed by a set of transactions that are executed together in the system. If order in time between certain operations is not determined by the system, then a partial order is used. Examples of such operations are requesting a read operation, reading, writing, aborting, committing, requesting lock, locking, etc. Not all transaction <b>operation</b> <b>types</b> should be included in a schedule, and typically only selected <b>operation</b> <b>types</b> (e.g., data access operations) are included, as needed to reason about and describe certain phenomena. Schedules and schedule properties are fundamental concepts in database concurrency control theory.|$|R

50|$|The EFB {{gets its}} name from the {{traditional}} pilot's flight bag, which is typically a heavy (up to 40 lb/18 kg or more) documents bag that pilots carry to the cockpit. The electronic flight bag is the replacement of those documents in a digital format. EFB weights are typically 1 to 5 pounds (0.5 to 2.2 kg), about the same as a laptop computer, and a fraction of the weight and volume of the paper publications. There are numerous benefits for using an EFB but specific benefits vary {{depending on the size of}} the <b>operation,</b> <b>type</b> of applications used, the existing content management and distribution system, the type of applications deployed. Some common benefits include: weight savings by replacing the traditional flight bag, reduced medical claims from handling traditional flight bags, reduced cost, and increased efficiency by reducing or eliminating paper processes.

5000|$|The {{blowback}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as [...] "simple", [...] "straight" [...] or [...] "pure" [...] blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading <b>operation</b> <b>type.</b> In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against {{the rear of the}} barrel, but is not locked in place. At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel {{while at the same time}} pushing the case rearward against the bolt. The expanding gases push the bolt assembly to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring. The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber. The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear. The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon fires from an open bolt). A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.|$|E
5000|$|Strong strict two {{phase locking}} (SS2PL) {{is a common}} {{mechanism}} utilized in database systems since their early days in the 1970s (the [...] "SS" [...] in the name SS2PL is newer though) to enforce both conflict serializability and strictness (a special case of recoverability which allows effective database recovery from failure) of a schedule. In this mechanism each datum is locked by a transaction before accessing it (any read or write operation): The item is marked by, associated with a lock of a certain type, depending on operation (and the specific implementation; various models with different lock types exist; in some models locks may change type during the transaction's life). As a result, access by another transaction may be blocked, typically upon a conflict (the lock delays or completely prevents the conflict from being materialized and {{be reflected in the}} precedence graph by blocking the conflicting operation), depending on lock type and the other transaction's access <b>operation</b> <b>type.</b> Employing an SS2PL mechanism means that all locks on data on behalf of a transaction are released only after the transaction has ended (either committed or aborted).|$|E

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the biomass-for-bioenergy supply chain, all operations from crop harvest to delivery in conversion facilities are identified in a cradle-to-gate life cycle inventory. Each operation is characterized by attributes related to energy use, economic cost and GHG emissions. Then, the mixed integer linear programming model is applied to define the strategic design with the maximal cumulative energy output, the maximal cumulative profit or the minimal cumulative GHG emissions determined through life cycle impact assessment. The approach is applied to a supply chain of low input high diversity biomass in Belgium. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} {{previous}} studies have interpreted differences in brain activation between arithmetic operation types (e. g. addition and multiplication) as evidence in favor of distinct cortical representations, processes or neural systems. It is still not clear how differences in general task complexity contribute to these neural differences. Here, we used a mental arithmetic paradigm to disentangle brain areas related to general problem solving from those involved in <b>operation</b> <b>type</b> specific processes (addition versus multiplication). We orthogonally varied <b>operation</b> <b>type</b> and complexity. Importantly, complexity was defined not only based on surface criteria (for example number size), {{but also on the}} basis of individual participants' strategy ratings, which were validated in a detailed behavioral analysis. We replicated previously reported <b>operation</b> <b>type</b> effects in our analyses based on surface criteria. However, these effects vanished when controlling for individual strategies. Instead, procedural strategies contrasted with memory retrieval reliably activated fronto-parietal and motor regions, while retrieval strategies activated parietal cortices. This challenges views that operation types rely on partially different neural systems, and suggests that previously reported differences between operation types may have emerged due to invalid measures of complexity. We conclude that mental arithmetic is a powerful paradigm to study brain networks of abstract problem solving, as long as individual participants' strategies are taken into account...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to review the {{clinical}} presentation of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas of the large bowel, to analyze the prognostic factors using univariate and multivariate methods, as well as the overall survival. We identified 24 cases at our clinic between 1991 and 2005, based on pathohistological analysis and standard diagnostic criteria established by Dawson et al. They accounted for 1, 2 % of all cases of the large bowel malignancies (24 / 2021) during this period. The following clinical information such as age, gender, symptoms, tumor localization, operation performed, histology grade, stage of disease, and adjuvant chemotherapy was obtained. Survival function was expressed by Kaplan-Meier curve and Log-rank test was performed for the difference in survival between two patient groups. Multivariate analysis was carried out using the Cox proportional hazard model. Overall mean survival time was 41, 91 months.
