5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> {{by using}} {{something}} other than a rectangular (cubic, etc.) grid. For example, if a plane is tiled with regular hexagons, those hexagons could be used as cells. In many cases the resulting cellular automata are equivalent to those with rectangular grids with specially designed neighborhoods and rules. Another variation would be to make the grid itself irregular, such as with Penrose tiles.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to distinguish between fully refined sugar produced from beet and cane. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> by isotope analysis of carbon. Cane uses C4 carbon fixation, and beet uses C3 carbon fixation, resulting in a different ratio of 13C and 12C isotopes in the sucrose. Tests are used to detect fraudulent abuse of European Union subsidies or {{to aid in the}} detection of adulterated fruit juice.|$|E
25|$|Value {{investing}} {{has proven}} to be a successful investment strategy. There are several ways to evaluate its success. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Many methods, which differ {{according}} to different regions, exist {{to stop a}} woman from turning into a Churel. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> to bury the body and fill the grave with thorns and pile heavy stones on top to stop the evil spirit from getting out. If a woman dies during pregnancy, her body is cut open to take the child out and both mother and child are buried in the same grave.|$|E

A more natural strategy {{is to build a}} system that has enough value without network effects, at least to early adopters. Then, as the number of users increases, the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base.|$|E
25|$|For the Abhidharmikas, {{truth was}} twofold {{and there are}} two ways of looking at reality. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> the way of {{everyday}} experience and of normal worldly persons. This is the category of the nominal and the conceptual (paññatti), and is termed the conventional truth (saṃvṛti-satya). However, the way of the Abhidharma, and hence the way of enlightened persons like the Buddha, who have developed the true insight (vipassana), sees reality as the constant stream of collections of dharmas, and this way of seeing the world is ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya).|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} ways to play six bells at a time (i.e., to ring three bells in each hand). <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> to pick two bells up as if one were Shelley ringing, then pick the third up between one's little and ring fingers (a 'triple Shelley'). All three bells ring {{together}} when ringing in a knocking motion. A second way is to pick up the third bell sideways so the clapper swings outward. Ringers with good control can then ring the first bell without ringing the third, allowing him or her to play three notes in one hand.|$|E
25|$|Scientist have {{discovered}} {{it is possible}} to determine, to some extent, the presence of these compounds in the grape before harvest. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> to measured with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers. Another method is through analysis of the glycosyl-glucose assay. Through this method glycosides from the grape juice are isolated and then hydrolysized to yield glucose. The amount of glucose produced is then quantified and tabulated in results that are expressed as amount of glycosides in micromoles per liter or per grape berry. The relationship between the presence of glycosides in wine grapes and the potential for quality in the resulting wine is not exact science but this remains an area of continuing research and development.|$|E

500|$|A {{magnetic}} dipole moment can be generated by two possible mechanisms.

[...] Another way is {{by a pair of}} magnetic monopoles of opposite magnetic charge, bound together in some way, called a [...] "Gilbertian" [...] magnetic dipole. [...] Magnetic monopoles remain hypothetical and unobserved, however. [...] Throughout the 1930s and 1940s it was not readily apparent which of these two mechanisms caused the neutron's intrinsic magnetic moment. [...] In 1930, E. Fermi showed that the magnetic moments of nuclei (including the proton) are Ampèrian. The two kinds of magnetic moments experience different forces in a magnetic field. [...] Based on Fermi's arguments, the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles, including the neutron, {{have been shown to be}} Ampèrian. [...] The arguments are based on basic electromagnetism, elementary quantum mechanics, and the hyperfine structure of atomic s-state energy levels. [...] In the case of the neutron, the theoretical possibilities were resolved by laboratory measurements of the scattering of slow neutrons from ferromagnetic materials in 1951.|$|E
