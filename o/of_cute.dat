25|$|In {{examining}} {{game play}} habits at Internet cafés, South Korea {{has seen a}} rise in female gamers publicly playing games such as Lineage, while in other Asian countries this kind of public female gaming has remained rare; similarly, games such as Tamagotchi {{are seen as a}} gender neutral in Japan, but have been regarded as girls' games in the West. In other cases, female trends in one country may be indicators of associated changes in others, {{as in the case of}} a rising number of female Lineage players in Korea having led to increased number of female Lineage players in Taiwan. In Japan the rise <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> culture and its associated marketing has made gaming accessible for girls, and this trend has also carried over to Taiwan and recently China (both countries previously having focused mostly on MMOs and where parents usually place harsher restrictions on daughters than on sons).|$|E
25|$|Because of {{this growing}} trend, {{companies}} such as Sanrio came out with merchandise like Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities that appeal to an older audience, such as Gudetama and Aggretsuko. These characters have enjoyed strong popularity as fans are drawn to their unique quirks {{in addition to their}} cute aesthetics. The 1980s also saw the rise <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> idols, such as Seiko Matsuda, who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls. The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old. No longer limited to teenagers, the spread of making things as cute as possible, even common household items, is embraced by people of all ages.|$|E

500|$|There {{were also}} a few {{positive}} reviews. One such review came from Fraser McAlpine of BBC, who opened, [...] "It's {{one of the fundamental}} laws of pop, anything which tips a nod to 'You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)' by Dead Or Alive is going to be worth a listen." [...] He continued, [...] "Even though this is just a song written {{from the perspective of a}} randy man watching a pole-dancer and bragging about how much money he has [...] in a manner which would make Akon blush, there's just something kind <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> about the whole thing." [...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is bouncing around like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet." [...] However, he noted that while pop music fans would appreciate it, hip hop listeners would likely dismiss it, and he added that [...] "t's not groundbreaking by any means".|$|E
500|$|Seekers has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly praised the suspenseful {{ending of the}} first book and thought readers would find great interest in the bears' struggle to survive. Booklist found {{the plot of the}} first book to have an [...] "interesting balance <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> anthropomorphic characterization and realistic attention to bear behaviors." [...] School Library Journal wrote [...] "from the first page, this story is exciting and refreshing" [...] and [...] "he plot is fast paced, and the author is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of these youngsters on their own." [...] Kirkus Review found that [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery." [...] However, the reviewer also felt that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot. In a review for the second and third books, Horn Book Review felt that readers might experience some confusion about the mountain, but they would still enjoy the fantasy adventure and the descriptions of the animals.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek {{described}} the episode as [...] "kind <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> tonight, {{and kind of}} flat in places, and kind of sad." [...] Pastorek {{said one of the}} most interesting aspects of [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] was the relationship between Michael and Dwight: [...] "After their respective failed romances with Holly and Angela, Michael and Dwight may be coming to the awkward realization that the most successful relationship in either of their lives is with one another, and that may be causing a little tension." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] was a [...] "solid offering", but felt it lacked any big moments and fit too much of a status quo mold he feels other recent episodes had fallen into. Fickett said it was [...] "fun to watch Michael squirm" [...] both when he thought he was in trouble, and when he was robbed credit for his good idea; he also liked when Jim encouraged Dwight not to take the fall for Michael, and when the others in the office rallied around Dwight when David Wallace gave Dwight credit for the success.|$|E

Also that year co-starred with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe {{in the drama}} film Cruel Intentions, a modern take on the 18th-century French novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The San Francisco Chronicle praised her performance as Annette Hargrove: [...] "Witherspoon is especially good in the least flashy role, and even when called upon to make a series <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> devilish faces, she pulls it off." [...] She also appeared in a music video by Marcy Playground for the film's soundtrack and starred with Matthew Broderick in Election {{which is based on}} Tom Perrotta's novel. For her portrayal of Tracy Flick, she received vast critical acclaim and won the Best Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics and the Online Film Critics Society, a first Golden Globe nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Witherspoon also received a rank on the list of 100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time by Premiere. Director Alexander Payne said of her, [...] "She's got that quality that men find attractive, while women would like to be her friend. But that's just the foundation.

500|$|The episode {{received}} several negative reviews. Andrew Billen, writing for The Times, lamented that Davies had [...] "forgotten that Doctor Who's main {{task is to}} send children scuttling behind sofas while entertaining their fathers with the odd philosophical idea, the occasional classical reference, a joke or two they would probably not wish to explain and a wee bit of space totty". Billen also criticised the writing and acting, but commended Tate for a [...] "toned down performance". Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal summarised it as [...] "a runaway Saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story". Blair found flaws with the comedy and the music in the episode, but was impressed with Tate's acting and Piper's cameo. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror criticised Tate and Tennant for overacting, and had concerns about the writing: [...] "It didn't exactly ooze tension. All {{we got in the}} way of terrifying space enemies was Sarah Lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny, a couple of security guards with guns and lots <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> little fat babies." [...] Ian Hyland of News of the World criticised the child-friendly storyline, comparing it to [...] "the back of a fag packet". He also criticised Tennant for appearing [...] "jaded" [...] and Tate for [...] "still shouting".|$|E
500|$|Reception to {{the novel}} was {{positive}} and many reviewers praised the realistic setting and behaviours of the main characters. Koelling [...] noted how the novel has a balance <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> anthropomorphic characterisation and also gives a realistic view of {{how hard it is}} for the bears to survive on their own. Koelling also recommended the novel to Warriors fans. Kirkus Reviews praised how [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery", but felt that there is little advancement of the plot due to the time introducing and developing the characters. Still, the reviewer felt that the novel would appeal the animal fantasy lovers for the its extreme detail. Publishers Weekly found the novel written more loosely than the Warriors series, but still appealing to readers as they follow the bears survival. Draper praised the fast pace and how Erin Hunter [...] "is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of these youngsters on their own". Matt Berman, writing for Half Moon Bay Review, praised the cliffhanger ending which would invite in more readers for the second novel, but felt that Warriors fans would be disappointed while [...] "animal lovers will find this story’s mix of anthropomorphism and realism appealing, and Hunter may find an entirely new audience".|$|E

Beyoncé appeared in the gym much to the delight of her young fans, who danced alongside her and took photos. Lauretta Charlton of Black Entertainment Television (BET) gave the video a positive review stating that [...] "It's impossible to watch without wanting to, well, move your body." [...] Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy showed great interest in the video and its message, stating that Beyoncé gets kids heart pumping, [...] "in more ways than one". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club added that [...] "if anything can help curb the nation's childhood obesity problem, it is the galvanizing power of Beyoncé Knowles dancing", and further praised how [...] " [...] bunch <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> kids [...] doing the Running Man and The Dougie in the cafeteria with Beyoncé." [...] A writer of Rap-Up described Beyoncé's dance moves in the video as [...] "hot". Mike Barthel of The Village Voice described the video as [...] "adorable" [...] and classified it as an [...] "important moment in the relationship between politics and culture". Barthel also praised the patriotic scene where Beyoncé and the kids wave the American flag, saying that [...] "It doesn't feel jingoistic, or pandering, or aggressive; it just feels celebratory, like they are actually kinda happy about America." ...|$|E
500|$|Further reviews {{tended to}} be negative. IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, {{explaining}} [...] "It's starting {{to feel as if}} Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe." [...] Fickett criticized Walter's science and [...] "silly ranting", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be [...] "dangerously close to self-parody." [...] Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained [...] "I really don't want any more of this. I'm tired of this formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there when it comes to Agent Dunham." [...] Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was [...] "wonky." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it [...] "a long hour of television." [...] Referring to Olivia's [...] "feminist" [...] speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, [...] "It's sort <b>of</b> <b>cute</b> how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show. But if they're going to focus on a character, it should be Walter — though we shudder to think how his flatulence will factor into the plot." ...|$|E
