5|$|When the US entered World War I in 1917, Marquis {{volunteered for}} the Army Medical Corps. While at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, for {{training}} in August, Marquis took the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the civil war site of the Battle of Chickamauga, in which his uncle, Birney Marquis, had fought with the 39th Indiana Infantry Regiment. This may be an early indication of Marquis' interest in writing books.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked with}} Corréard, Savigny {{and another of}} the survivors, the {{carpenter}} Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of planks. Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky. Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast {{on a number of}} occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the elements while crossing the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{his arrival in}} California in March 1868, naturalist John Muir {{set out for the}} Yosemite area, where he found work tending to the sheep owned by a local rancher, Pat Delaney. Muir's employment provided him with the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the area's plants, rocks, and animals; the articles and scientific papers he wrote describing his observations helped to popularize the area and to increase scientific interest in it. Muir {{was one of the first}} to suggest that Yosemite Valley's major landforms were created by large alpine glaciers, contradicting the view of established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of space travel gave scientists the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the comet at close quarters, and several probes were launched to do so. The Soviet Vega 1 started returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, {{and the first}} ever of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March, followed by Vega 2 making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the Giotto space probe, launched by the European Space Agency, made the closest pass of the comet's nucleus. There were also two Japanese probes, Suisei and Sakigake. The probes were unofficially known as the Halley Armada.|$|E
5|$|Though Parry {{had a great}} {{interest}} in music, he had no <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> it until there was a temporary closure of the Rough and Ready Iron Works. Some of his co-workers were also musicians, and they offered music lessons while the iron works was closed. Parry joined a music sight-reading class taught by one of the men. He continued to study harmony with another co-worker, and learned how to read and write while he was learning about harmony.|$|E

5|$|During this visit, Parry and {{his friends}} who had {{accompanied}} him to Wales travelled the country giving concerts of Parry's own works. They were well received throughout the land. Parry was offered the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> for a year under Dr Davies of Swansea, followed by a one-year scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music. He had to refuse both offers since he had a wife and child in the United States dependent on him for support. By 1865, Parry's musical ability had become well known in Wales and in the United States. A fund was established to support Parry and his family while he studied music; donations were received from both countries. Parry aided his own cause by giving concerts in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Nadia Kaabi-Linke {{was born}} in Tunis in 1978. She is of Russian-Ukrainian and Tunisian heritage, her father a sports {{academic}} and her mother a chemist. Kaabi-Linke was raised between Kiev and Tunis. She moved to Dubai when she was 12 when her father took a job there. Kaabi-Linke recalled the move as difficult, particularly in losing the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> modern dance. With her mother's encouragement, Kaabi-Linke began to draw. Later she studied painting at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts, graduated in 1999, and received her Ph.D. from the Sorbonne in 2008 in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. While in France, she met her German husband, Timo, who would later curate many of Kaabi-Linke's shows.|$|E
5|$|Parry's <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> music came in {{the form}} of a {{temporary}} closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E

5|$|The Bader International Study Centre (BISC) {{is housed}} in Herstmonceux Castle, East Sussex, England, which was donated to Queen's in 1993 by alumnus Alfred Bader. BISC is academically fully {{integrated}} with Queen's, although financially self-sufficient. Its mission is to provide academic programs for undergraduate students whose academic interests are oriented toward the United Kingdom, Europe and the European Union, continuing-education programs for executives and other professional or “special interest” groups, a venue for conferences and meetings, a base for international graduate students and other scholars undertaking research in the United Kingdom and Europe and as an enhanced educational, social and cultural environment for the local community, using the unique heritage of the castle.

5|$|There {{has been}} little <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> {{epidemiology}} in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, {{and the frequency of}} such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (Elephas maximus) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.|$|E
5|$|Busch {{studied for}} nearly four years at Hanover, despite initial {{difficulties}} in understanding the subject matter. A few months before graduation he confronted his parents with his aspiration to study at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. According to Bush's nephew Hermann Nöldeke, his mother supported this inclination. His father eventually acquiesced and Busch moved to Düsseldorf in June 1851, where, to his disappointment at not being admitted to the advanced class, he entered preparatory classes. Busch's parents had his tuition fees paid for one year, so in May 1852 he traveled to Antwerp to continue study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts under Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans. He led his parents {{to believe that the}} Academy was less regimented than Düsseldorf, and had the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> old masters. At Antwerp he saw for the first time paintings by Peter Paul Rubens, Adriaen Brouwer, David Teniers and Frans Hals. The pictures aroused his interest, but made him doubt his own skills. Eventually, in 1853, after suffering heavily from typhus, he abandoned his Antwerp studies and returned penniless to Wiedensahl.|$|E
