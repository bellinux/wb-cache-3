5|$|The Free State of Galveston (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Republic of Galveston Island) was a whimsical name given to the coastal city of Galveston in the U.S. state of Texas during the early-to-mid-20thcentury. Today, the term is sometimes used to describe the culture and history <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of {{production}} was approximately two million Reichsmarks, a rather high figure for German feature films <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> However, between 1940 and 1943, it grossed over 6.2 million Reichsmarks thus making it a blockbuster {{in contrast to the}} commercial failure of Der Ewige Jude.|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its target {{audience}} in 1915. At that time, {{it was not}} possible to screen stag films in public theaters due to the Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era,</b> A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, 1989, CHUM {{adopted an}} oldies format, drawing heavily on its {{previous}} Top 40 reputation {{to cater to}} the fans <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> music.|$|R
5000|$|Partial {{performances}} and recordings of most songs on OK Computer and some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> b-sides, including a long sequence featuring instrumental song [...] "Meeting in the Aisle." ...|$|R
2500|$|There are [...] "easter eggs" [...] {{scattered}} throughout a variety <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> documents and files, seeing their last appearance in MindVox-era texts, and Patrick Kroupa's parody of William Gibson's Agrippa.|$|R
5|$|At {{culturally}} conservative BYU, Romney remained {{isolated from}} {{much of the}} upheaval <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> He {{became president of the}} Cougar Club booster organization and showed a new-found discipline in his studies. During his senior year, he took a leave of absence to work as driver and advance man for eventually unsuccessful Senate campaign of his mother, Lenore Romney; together, they visited all 83Michigan counties. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in English with highest honors in 1971, giving commencement addresses to both the College of Humanities and to the whole of BYU.|$|E
5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|Bonded by Blood {{along with}} its labelmates Evile, Gama Bomb, and Municipal Waste {{are part of the}} thrash metal revival movement. These young bands are {{bringing}} the classism of the new wave of British heavy metal and the aggressiveness of hardcore punk to a new generation of fans. Even though the members of Bonded by Blood were not born when their favorite 1980s thrash metal bands released their debut albums, the music and fashion <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> {{had a profound impact on}} them.|$|E
50|$|Berger's own {{experiences}} teaching in North Carolina in the 50's showed the shocking American prejudice <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> Southern culture and influenced his humanistic perspective {{as a way}} to reveal the ideological forces from which it stemmed.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, Michael's {{first book}} was {{published}} - Going Places, {{a collection of short}} stories. The book established his {{reputation as one of the}} most brilliant <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> fiction writers; the stories are urbane, funny, and written in a private, hectic diction that gives them a remarkable edge.|$|R
2500|$|One of Albany's busiest {{neighborhoods in}} the 19th century, the area fell into decline during {{the third quarter of}} the 20th as {{citizens}} left the city for the suburbs. Instead of the wholesale demolition <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> urban renewal programs, the city government attempted to preserve and revitalize the area, ...|$|R
5|$|Buildings play a {{big role}} in gameplay, as they are used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain times like the defensive towers.|$|E
5|$|Cocaine {{was already}} so {{prevalent}} {{on the set}} (like many other film productions <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era)</b> that Aykroyd, who used far less than his partner, claims {{a section of the}} budget was actually set aside for purchases of the drug during night shooting. The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built on the set, for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, Aykroyd's girlfriend at the time, says most of the bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring any drug patrons desired.|$|E
5|$|During the Gorbachev Era, Brezhnev's {{rule was}} {{considered}} less successful {{than that of}} Joseph Stalin; in an opinion measurement poll only 7 percent chose the Brezhnev Era as good, while 10 percent picked the Stalin Era as good. Following {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union and Boris Yeltsin's subsequent market reforms, many Russians viewed the Brezhnev era with nostalgia; they missed the stability <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> which had subsequently been lost during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras.|$|E
50|$|Out of a re-purposed firehouse {{nestling}} in San Francisco's old Barbary Shore neighborhood, Gossage {{created the}} headquarters of his advertising agency (Freeman, Mander & Gossage). The building would become a salon where many <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> influential thinkers congregated, from John Steinbeck to Buckminster Fuller, Tom Wolfe to Stan Freberg.|$|R
50|$|There {{were about}} 3,000 ethnic Koreans in Hirakata in the pre-World War II period. In the 1930s Hirakata Koreans, fearful of keeping their own jobs, had {{negative}} attitudes towards Osaka-based Koreans who {{were looking for}} employment after having lost their jobs. Military construction {{was the most common}} job sector <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> Korean population.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Burgin Matthews wrote the album [...] "Elliott also reveals himself {{as one of}} the few truly {{enduring}} figures of the folk era, partly because his music is more honest, and as a result more timeless, than so much <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> music... With South Coast, Elliott's legend is irrevocably cemented." ...|$|R
5|$|He was an {{educational}} activist, {{member of the}} Commission of National Education and the initiator and president of Society for Elementary Textbooks. He was an opponent of king Stanisław II August in the 1770s and 1780s, and a major figure in the Polish politics <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> During the Great Sejm he was {{a leader of the}} Patriotic Party and the reform movement and eventually backed the King in many reform projects. An advocate of a pro-Prussian orientation, he helped conclude an alliance with Prussia in 1790. He co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, he {{finished}} his high school studies at the Far Eastern University. He worked towards a degree in liberal arts at the Educational Center of Asia (formerly Quezon College) in Manila. After graduation, Ople pursued a career in journalism. He became a desk editor at the Daily Mirror {{and the author of}} its Jeepney Tales column. Still in his twenties, Ople was one of the youngest newspaper columnists <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> Ople also established a public relations consulting firm.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the United States Mint began {{releasing}} {{a set of}} half-ounce $10 gold coins under the First Spouse Program with engravings of portraits of the First Ladies on the obverse. When a President served without a spouse, a gold coin is issued that bears an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> and a reverse image emblematic of themes of that President's life. This {{is true for the}} coins for Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James Buchanan's First Ladies, but not the coin for Chester A. Arthur's First Lady, which will instead depict suffragette Alice Paul.|$|E
50|$|Released on Mercury Records in 1970, Kingdom Come {{featured}} very fast-paced {{hard rock}} {{with high levels}} of distortion in the guitar and, in some cases, the bass, and extensive multi-tracking to further enhance the guitar sound. Though this style would become popular in later years, it was considerably different from the majority <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>eras</b> contemporary rock music.|$|R
50|$|The thrust {{stage is}} the {{earliest}} stage type in western theatre, first appearing in Greek theatres, and its arrangement was continued by the pageant wagon. As pageant wagons evolved into Elizabethan theatre, many <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> works, {{including those of}} Shakespeare, were performed on theatre with an open thrust stage, {{such as those of}} the Globe Theatre.|$|R
5|$|Jane's Attack Squadron is a 2002 combat flight {{simulator}} developed by Looking Glass Studios and Mad Doc Software {{and published by}} Xicat Interactive. Based on World War II, the game allows players to pilot fifteen reproductions <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> military aircraft and to carry out missions for the Axis or Allies. Although it contains dogfights, the game focuses largely on air-to-ground combat, hence the title.|$|R
5|$|Mycenaean civilization {{originated}} and {{evolved from}} the society {{and culture of the}} Early and Middle Helladic period in mainland Greece under influences from Minoan Crete. Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 BC) {{a significant increase in the}} population and the number of settlements occurred. A number of centers of power emerged in southern mainland Greece dominated by a warrior elite society, while the typical dwellings <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> were an early type of megaron buildings. Some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{technology}} school in Georgia was introduced in 1865 during the Reconstruction period. Two former Confederate officers, Major John Fletcher Hanson (an industrialist) and Nathaniel Edwin Harris (a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia), who had become prominent citizens {{in the town of}} Macon, Georgia after the Civil War, strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the industrial revolution that was occurring throughout the North. However, because the American South <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> was mainly populated by agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, {{a technology}} school was needed.|$|E
5|$|Delahaye {{was one of}} many gardener-botanists {{employed}} on European colonial voyages {{of scientific}} exploration in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Their duty was to assist with the collection, transport, cultivation and distribution of economic plants. They worked with the naturalists on these expeditions, but gave particular assistance to the botanists by collecting live plants and seed, as well as plant specimens for herbarium collections. They often maintained journals and records of their collections and made observations on the vegetation encountered during the voyage. On this particular expedition, Delahaye assisted the naturalist and botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière—who accumulated one of the largest herbarium collections <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> and published what was, in effect, the first Flora of Australia based on the collections he made on the New Holland (Australian) leg of the expedition. Delahaye also made numerous botanical collections of his own.|$|E
50|$|His résumé {{is filled}} with credits {{from some of the}} best-known titles of the 1960s and 70's, {{including}} Long Day's Journey Into Night, The Graduate, The Manchurian Candidate, Rosemary's Baby, Carnal Knowledge and Catch-22. Along the way, he forged close friendships with many <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> Hollywood elite, including Jack Nicholson, Roman Polanski and Warren Beatty, for whom he designed Reds and Dick Tracy.|$|R
50|$|Association football, {{the modern}} game, also has {{documented}} early involvement of women. In Europe, {{it is possible}} that 12th-century French women played football as part <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> folk games. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too. In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardized rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.|$|R
50|$|Marston {{introduced}} {{the idea to}} Gaines. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed Wonder Woman, whom he {{believed to be a}} model <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> unconventional, liberated woman. Marston also drew inspiration from the bracelets worn by Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a polyamorous relationship. Wonder Woman debuted in All Star Comics #8 (cover date Dec/Jan 1941/1942, released in October 1941), scripted by Marston.|$|R
5|$|Drawloom: The {{earliest}} confirmed drawloom fabrics {{come from}} the State of Chu and date c. 400 BC. Most scholars attribute {{the invention of the}} drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient Syria since drawloom fabrics found in Dura-Europas are thought to date before 256 AD. Dieter Kuhn states that an analysis of texts and textiles from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) proves that the figured fabrics <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> were also crafted {{with the use of a}} drawloom. The drawloom was certainly known in Persia by the 6th century AD. Eric Broudy asserts there is virtually no evidence of its use in Europe until the 17th century, while the button drawloom was allegedly invented by Jean le Calabrais in the 15th century. Mary Carolyn Beaudry disagrees, stating that it was used in the medieval Italian silk industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Model {{was posted}} to the 3rd Infantry Division, an elite {{formation}} of the Reichswehr and one that was heavily involved in testing the technical innovations <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> From 1928, he lectured in tactics and war studies for the basic General Staff training course, and in 1930 he {{was transferred to the}} Training Branch of the Truppenamt. He became known both for his enthusiastic support of military modernisation and for his complete lack of tact. In 1938, the year he became a major general (Generalmajor), he led a testfiring of the Mörser 18 on mocked-up Czech fortifications, which did not impress Hitler. As were many army officers at the time, Model was a supporter of the National Socialist government; his time in Berlin also brought him into contact with senior members of the Nazi regime. Closer relationships with Goebbels and Speer developed during the war.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the years {{following}} the Second World War that professional wrestling enjoyed its first golden age. Pat O'Connor, a one-time NWA and AWA World Heavyweight Champion, was one of the earliest stars <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> During the 1960s and 1970s, other wrestlers from New Zealand also travelled to the United States, where they enjoyed similar success in the National Wrestling Alliance and the World Wide Wrestling Federation. American wrestlers frequently toured New Zealand during this period and were well received by the public. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was also defended several times in the country; in 1984 Ric Flair won the title from Harley Race in Wellington and Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting in Auckland to unify the title with Australia's WWA World Heavyweight Championship in 2003.|$|E

5000|$|The band's {{greatest}} {{success was}} in the early 1980s. Though a part <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> productive punk rock scene, their music was distinctive for its morbid lyricism and often for its sophisticated arrangements, as heard, for example, on 1981's A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die. Desjardins's poetry has been described as [...] "wonderful bleeding collages of B-movie dementia, street crime, Mexican Catholicism and Dionysian punk spurt poetics." ...|$|R
50|$|Thomson's {{remaining}} poems rarely {{appear in}} modern anthologies, although the autobiographical Insomnia and Mater Tenebrarum are well-regarded and contain some striking passages. He admired and translated {{the works of}} the pessimistic Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837), but his own lack of hope was darker than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Leopardi. He is considered by some students of the Victorian age as the bleakest <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> poets. He died in London at the age of 47.|$|R
