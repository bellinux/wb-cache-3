5|$|Widening of the Kwinana Freeway with {{an extra}} {{southbound}} lane between Roe Highway and Armadale Road began in mid-2014. The project aims to increase the freeway's reliability, efficiency, and safety, as the current two-lane configuration is subject to {{a large proportion of}} heavy vehicles and severe peak hour congestion. The project also involves the realignment of ramps at Berrigan Drive and Armadale Road, construction of noise barriers and noise walls where required, and installation of components for intelligent transport systems – <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> communications, vehicle detection devices, and closed circuit cameras.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

Provided there was no additional substantial damage to the uncrossed <b>optic</b> <b>fibres</b> the rats were able to relearn an intensity discrimination and to learn or relearn an orientation discrimination, although optokinetic following was abolished. The results unequivocally demonstrate that the uncrossed <b>optic</b> <b>fibres</b> can mediate two kinds of visual discrimination. The area of retina giving rise to the uncrossed fibres was determined from the position of undegenerated retinal ganglion cells in each eye following section of the chiasma, and in one eye of 4 rats in which one optic tract was entirely or extensively destroyed. The ganglion cells giving rise to the uncrossed <b>optic</b> <b>fibres</b> occupy about 40 degrees of the temporal retina, corresponding to the binocular overlap in the visual field...|$|R

25|$|In {{the ideal}} situation, the {{detector}} could be implanted with the immobilized protein and queried by radio frequency, however this has currently been achieved only with amperormetric sensors. The general approach for fluorescent sensors is {{to attach the}} protein to one extremity of an <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> implanted under the skin whilst the other extremity {{is connected to the}} detection subsystem, which includes a path splitter (sliced fibre or dichroic mirror) to allow the fibre to transmit both the excitation and the emitted light, a filtered light source (in general, a laser), and a filtered photodetector (a CCD or a PMT). The information thus collected is then analysed with a computer.|$|E

To wire the spectacle which played to 110,000 people in attendance and some 3billion distant viewers around the world, redundant systems were connected throughout so that a single failure point could not halt the show. To complete the assignment, Jackson said one of the main factors was working within budget, which was not unlimited as it had been with Streisand.

30|$|Biosensors are in {{perspective}} the best analytical tools for reporting {{the occurrence of}} chemical signals in the plant–microbe interactions because generally, the effector molecules are released in trace amounts and localized in hot spots, and this makes problematic their detection with chemical methods. In the future, more studies {{should be made to}} compare results using different scales of investigation; there are unique opportunities in comparing single-cell studies based on sensitive, fluorescent biosensors in combination with advanced confocal laser scanning microscopy with larger samples such as soil extracts or slurries, and with whole plant–soil detection studies based on direct bioluminescence recorded under a sensitive camera.

2500|$|An {{exception}} to the usage of placing the <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> transdermally {{is seen in the}} previously mentioned fibre from Ingo Klimant's group (ruthenium-quenching by oxygen released by glucose-catalysed GOx): The sensor, in fact, was constructed by functionalizing a premade oxygen sensor with Glucose oxydase and inserting it into a glucose-sensing apparatus for amperometric sensors, in particular, a microdialysis catheter CMA 60 implanted transdermally and the sensor connected to its tygon tubing. This sensor was tested in a human volunteer and showed results par with current amperometric systems. The usage of a fibre was dictated by the pre-availability of this compared to a ruthenium-coated lens, which would have had achieved the same results, so this approach should be put in a category of its own alongside transdermal fibres and smart tattoos. However, the aim of the group is to create glucose-sensitive nanoparticles to be interrogated with a transdermal <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> and controlled magnetically. [...] As a consequence, the group is improving the oxygen sensing probe by investigating novel oxygen sensitive phosphorescent materials, nanoparticle formulation and the creation of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E

2500|$|... {{the longest}} {{distance}} over which {{quantum key distribution}} has been demonstrated using <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> is 148.7km, achieved by Los Alamos National Laboratory/NIST using the BB84 protocol.

The experiments suggest transmission to satellites is possible, due to the lower atmospheric density at higher altitudes. For example, although the minimum distance from the International Space Station to the ESA Space Debris Telescope is about 400km, the atmospheric thickness is about an order of magnitude less than in the European experiment, thus yielding less attenuation compared to this experiment.|$|E
