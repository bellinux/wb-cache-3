500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".|$|E
500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I think most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once we got that first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to [...] "the downside of [...] rejection of the term [...] ".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, it's a long, story," [...] he {{answered}} carelessly, [...] "and too conventional {{to be worth}} telling. Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> up, you know. Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> down. You're doing pretty well, I hear." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ouch! Quit! Awwww, quit, Carl.... Say, listen; here's what I {{wanted to}} tell you: How if you and me and Adelaide Benner and some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> down to the depot to meet Gertie, to-morrow? She comes in on the twelve-forty-seven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Yes, Mrs. Privett," [...] says Nancy. [...] "Now don't tell anybody, but I don't mind {{letting you}} know what the reason o't is. Last night, being Old Midsummer Eve, some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> to church porch, and didn't get home till near one." ...|$|E
60|$|Bill {{thanked the}} commodore, {{and the three}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> {{into a sort of}} {{forecastle}} which had been rigged up in the forward part of the vessel, where, after considerable arguing, we succeeded in getting so much food as satisfied our hunger, which was no small amount.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{seems to}} be their amiable intention, but at any rate we need none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> through with it alive. How long does your {{medicine}} take to work, Juanna?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I move two <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> {{on board}} and the rest stay here," [...] said Tom. [...] "Then, if there is trouble, the crowd to stay behind {{can come to the}} rescue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait?" [...] {{repeated}} Allan, in the blankest astonishment at his friend's excessive caution. [...] "What {{on earth}} does he mean? I'll be hanged if I wait. Where one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>goes,</b> the other goes too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, {{three days}} ago they {{followed}} your sister Laura and Jessie to a church fair the girls attended. They acted in such a rude fashion that both of the girls ran all the way home. All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> out to look for them, but we didn’t find them.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{thing that}} puzzles us," [...] said one. [...] "The white man came alone and told us he had seen tracks of caribou three days' journey back. As we had no meat and our fish was nearly done, six <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> {{to look for the}} deer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{in about}} a week the {{pneumonia}} got the best of Uncle Cal. They had the funeral over at Birdstail, and all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> over. I brought Marilla back home in my buckboard. Her uncle Ben and his wife were going to stay there a few days with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "When Earl {{comes back}} I'll ask my uncle {{to let the}} three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> over to the river," [...] said Randy. [...] "I've heard there are good chances there for wild goose, snipe, and plover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, on Thursday week, at Roland Hampton's wedding. Cecil and I and a {{whole lot}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> down in the morning to it, and Sydney is to be a bridesmaid. What {{are you going to do}} now, mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Charlie Ward. It isn't {{anything}} to fret about. Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> soon, and some travel the roads for their lifetime. What {{does it matter}} when we are under the nettles if {{it was with a}} short rope or a long one we were hanged? ...|$|R
60|$|Leaving the Story Girl and Peter to peel their potatoes, {{the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> home, where Aunt Janet, {{who had gone}} to the well and found the {{fragments}} of the old blue cup, gave poor Felicity a bitter scolding about it. But Felicity bore it very patiently--nay, more, she seemed to delight in it.|$|E
6000|$|When {{you were}} about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast, I was anxious, if not fearful; but feeling {{that you were the}} better judge, and remembering that [...] "nothing risked, nothing gained," [...] I did not interfere. Now, the {{undertaking}} being a success, the honor is all yours; for I believe none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> further than to acquiesce.|$|E
6000|$|... "So we thought. We tried it." [...] Mr. Calvin {{paused a}} moment. [...] "It broke us. The Trust could put milk upon the market more cheaply than we. It could sell still at a slight profit {{when we were}} selling at actual loss. I dropped fifty {{thousand}} dollars in that venture. Most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> bankrupt.* The dairymen were wiped out of existence." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{precautions}} {{well understood}} by both <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I <b>went</b> home.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, you've got to {{make your}} pick,' said Muriel. 'Turn your face to the wall, and say which one touches you. Go on--we shall only just touch your back--one <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> <b>Go</b> on--turn your face to the wall, and don't look, and say which one touches you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Naw, naw; I never zeen none; but, for {{all they}} zay, ah don't think none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>goes</b> such a brave way off. There's room for all, dead or alive. An' there's Christians ah've zeen--well, ef they'm not dead for gude, then neither aren't dumb animals, for sure." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} two <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> {{out into the}} country one way, and two another, {{to see what kind}} of a land we were in; and we soon found the country was very {{pleasant}} and fruitful, and a convenient place enough to live in; but, as before, inhabited by a parcel of creatures scarce human, or capable of being made social on any account whatsoever.|$|E
60|$|When {{all five}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> down the kitchen stairs again, Rupert leading, the two hosts {{bringing}} up the rear, we found {{the door of the}} prison again closed. Throwing it open we found the place again as black as pitch. The old lady, if she was still there, had turned out the gas: she seemed to have a weird preference for sitting in the dark.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] {{said the}} elder man, promptly, looking at Montgomery; {{and all three}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> towards the enclosure. [...] "I'm sorry to make a mystery, Mr. Prendick; but you'll {{remember}} you're uninvited. Our little establishment here contains a secret or so, {{is a kind of}} Blue-Beard's chamber, in fact. Nothing very dreadful, really, to a sane man; but just now, as we don't know you--" ...|$|E

Let me call the police. Stop," [...] he added, {{as she opened the}} door. [...] "If either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>goes,</b> it must be me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that is true, and if {{you have}} not yet slept on the ground, you could be the one to stay here. It makes no {{difference}} which two <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> on; but it seems important that one remain here in order to bring fresh food in the morning, thus making a pretext for entering the British lines." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} still writing in his hiding-place, and still {{dwelling}} on his grievances, hour after hour. A table and some shelves {{were covered with}} manuscript papers and with worn pens and a medley of such tokens. Touchingly and awfully drawn together, he and the little mad woman were side by side and, as it were, alone. She sat on a chair holding his hand, and none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> close to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the same}} day that we got rid o' the tiger we was sent aboard a Malay ship to flog one o' the men. He'n bin up to some mischief, an' his comrades were afraid, I s'pose, to flog him; and as the offence he had {{committed}} was against us somehow (I never rightly understood it myself), some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> aboard the Malay ship, tied him up, an' gave him two dozen.|$|E
6000|$|Next {{morning a}} score <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>went</b> with Hillyer, out of friendship, {{and helped him}} bury his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first {{assistant}} pall-bearer, Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are bitter enemies," [...] Wingate confessed, [...] "and {{shall be}} till one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>goes</b> down. We {{are a very}} terrible example of the evils of this age of restraint. In more {{primitive}} days we should have gone for one another's throats. One would have lived and the other died. It would have been, better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear child," [...] {{she said}} to Angela, [...] "you are not looking well; this {{business}} worries you, no doubt; it is the old struggle between duty and inclination, that we have most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gone</b> through. Well, there is one consolation, nobody who ever did his or her duty, regardless of inclination, ever regretted it in the end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems like an hour," [...] snapped Short. [...] "What's that? Did {{you hear}} that? He's firing! It's the machine-gun!
