In 2005 one of the stars of the film, Angela Douglas, unveiled a plaque at the precise location where filming took place, to commemorate the location filming, and it forms part of the North Wales Film and Television Trail, run by the Wales Screen Commission.|$|E

25|$|The second Juan Bautista de Anza {{expedition}} (1775–76), entering Alta California {{from the}} southeast (crossing the Colorado River near today's Yuma, Arizona) picked up Portolá's trail at Mission San Gabriel. De Anza's scouts found easier traveling in several inland valleys, rather than {{staying on the}} rugged coast. On his journey north, de Anza traveled the San Fernando Valley and Salinas Valley. After detouring to the coast to visit the Presidio of Monterey, de Anza went inland again, following the Santa Clara Valley to {{the southern end of}} San Francisco Bay and <b>on</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> east side of the San Francisco Peninsula. This became the preferred route (roughly today's U.S Route 101), and more closely corresponds to the officially recognized El Camino Real.|$|E
25|$|After {{shakedown}} {{training off}} the New England coast, Snook departed New London on 3 March 1943 and set sail for the Pacific. Following a 12-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, the submarine put to sea on 11 April {{and headed for}} the Yellow Sea and East China Sea for her first war patrol. Upon completion of mine planting in the Shanghai area, Snook continued <b>on</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coast of China to the Yellow Sea. On the afternoon of 5 May, she sighted two freighters standing out of Dairen and took up the chase. She trailed both until after nightfall, then fired a spread of three torpedoes that quickly sank Kinko Maru. The lead freighter continued, unaware of the attack, until someone on the sinking ship sounded a whistle. At that point, the freighter began a series of frantic maneuvers to dodge two of Snooks torpedoes, then opened fire with her guns, forcing the submarine to withdraw out of range, returning shortly after and firing three torpedoes, one of which hit Daifuku Maru amidships and sank her. Snook then resumed patrol.|$|E
25|$|After {{his victory}} in the {{qualification}} race, Vernay started from pole position with Ericsson starting alongside, with Mortara and Bottas on row two. Due to damage inflicted in his spectacular accident the previous day, Boyd did not start, thus leaving the grid at 28 cars. Once again, Ericsson made an awful getaway, with Bottas and Mortara both slotting in behind a fast-starting Vernay. Into Lisboa, Ricciardo got alongside Ericsson as they battled for fourth with the Australian brushing {{the wall and the}} two continued side-by-side into San Francisco, with Ricciardo again nudging the wall. Behind them, Vanthoor left his braking far too late for Lisboa, and mounted over Chilton, which caused the teenage Briton to retire on the spot. Ricciardo's clip with the wall caused a left-rear puncture, but he managed to carry <b>on</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill, until he crashed {{at the entrance to the}} Solitude Esses. His car rebounded off the wall, and into direct line of the rest of the field. No less than half a dozen cars impacted with the stricken car, and blocked the track which ultimately led to a red flag, and a race suspension. Also taken out in the incident were the third Carlin of Hartley, the Premas of Coletti and Zampieri, the Fortecs of Rosenzweig and McKenzie, and Ho. Imperatori was also involved, returning to the pits for a lengthy period, but returned to complete three laps towards the end. Vanthoor, with a damaged front wheel after his collision with Chilton, stopped just short of the accident site, and was thus able to continue in the race.|$|E

In the same newspaper, on the following day, Keith Watson commented that the episode [...] "was like watching Carry <b>On</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> Asteroids", but nevertheless stated that [...] "as dramatic cocktails go, [...] was out of this world", and gave the episode four stars out of five. The Times commented that the episode was [...] "good, salacious, knockabout fun", the best thing about Torchwood that [...] "everyday Cardiff hums alongside psychotic blowfish and time loops", and asked [...] "when extraterrestrial push comes to intergalactic shove, how could anyone object to a series that begins with a blowfish driving a sports car?". The Guardian stated that parts were [...] "very, very, funny" [...] and the episode was largely [...] "a hoot". However, The Daily Telegraph felt that the series fared better on BBC Three, but on BBC Two it was [...] "both far too pleased with itself and surprisingly amateurish".|$|E
500|$|On 4 October, C Company 3 RAR—under {{the command}} of Major Jack Gerke—attacked the long spur running east from the peak of Hill 355, known as Hill 220. Launching their assault at 09:00, the Australians quickly killed or drove off the {{defenders}} before pressing <b>on</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> spur and routing the remainder of a Chinese company. Reaching their objectives by 10:00, the Australians then {{took advantage of the}} initiative gained so far, pushing a platoon towards the summit of Hill 355. Amid heavy fighting, the Australians cleared the eastern slopes of Kowang-San by 12:00, despite having received no orders to do so. Thirteen Chinese were killed and three captured in the fighting, while Australian casualties included 11 wounded, one of whom subsequently died. Gerke was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his leadership. C Company withdrew {{to the rear of the}} 3 RAR position and were replaced by D Company, who occupied the position held by A Company [...] north of Hill 199. Meanwhile, led by a bagpiper, the Borderers made a simultaneous assault up the western face of Kowang-San, and fearing they may be caught between two attacks the Chinese defenders abandoned Hill 355, withdrawing northwest under heavy indirect fire.|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} day Lieutenant Chris Pearce's 13 Troop, 3 Commando, on patrol with a platoon of Rhodesian African Rifles under Lieutenant Ron Marillier, was fired upon {{on the bank of}} the Maura River in {{northern}} Mashonaland by about 70 ZIPRA, encamped in a strong defensive position on the side of a hill feature. [...] "We were going <b>on</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bank and all hell broke loose," [...] recalled Pearce. [...] "How we didn't take casualties I didn't quite know." [...] Pearce's 12 men were pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire and outnumbered by around six to one. Lance-Corporal Dennis Croukamp [...] "on his own initiative and with complete disregard for his own safety" [...] in the words of the official report, twice crawled forward to throw grenades at the enemy position to allow the troop to redeploy into better cover. Pearce unsuccessfully attempted to assault the enemy position, then gave covering fire to an abortive flank attack by Marillier's RAR men. The security forces then attempted one final assault just before nightfall, but this also failed due to the superior numbers of ZIPRA fighters. The cadres dispersed and evacuated the area during the night and were gone when a Rhodesian sweep took place the next morning.|$|E

500|$|Less than [...] up the trail, D Company {{came under}} machine gun fire from its right flank, which inflicted several casualties. Kennedy {{rejected}} Vandygriff's request {{to take a}} squad and knock out the gun, so the file got past {{the line of fire}} as best it could until M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle fire from the 3rd Platoon silenced the weapon. Farther up the trail another North Korean machine gun fired from the right along the trail and held up the advance until US artillery fire silenced it. The file of men left the trail-like road, which dead-ended, dropped over into a ravine on the left, and continued the climb. North Korean mortar fire killed two men and wounded eight or ten others in this phase of the ascent. At this time the 2nd Platoon leader collapsed from a kidney ailment and command passed to Vandygriff. Vandygriff led his platoon, now {{at the head of the}} company, <b>on</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gully and at about 17:00, came through a tunnel under a small ridge and the stone wall into the bowl-shaped summit of Hill 755, the southern arm of the Hill 902 crest. The 2nd and 3rd Platoons soon arrived, in that order. Near the top, Palmer received radio orders from Gay to come off the mountain; Gay had not known that Palmer had accompanied the attack.|$|E
