5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular <b>objects.</b> <b>For</b> example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E
5|$|In the Prose Edda, Sif {{is named}} {{as the mother}} of the goddess Þrúðr by Thor and of Ullr with a father whose name is not recorded. The Prose Edda also recounts that Sif once had her hair shorn by Loki, and that Thor forced Loki to have a golden {{headpiece}} made for Sif, resulting in not only Sif's golden tresses but also five other <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> other gods.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, its {{original}} provenance remains unknown. The relief was not archaeologically excavated, and thus {{we have no}} further information where it came from, or in which context it was discovered. An interpretation of the relief thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> which the date and place of origin have been established, on {{an analysis of the}} iconography, and on the interpretation of textual sources from Mesopotamian mythology and religion.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E
5|$|By the Early Dynastic Period in {{the late}} 4th {{millennium}} BC, Egyptian hieroglyphs and their cursive form hieratic were well-established written scripts. Egyptian hieroglyphs are small artistic pictures of natural <b>objects.</b> <b>For</b> example, the hieroglyph for door-bolt, pronounced se, produced the s sound; when this hieroglyph was combined with another or multiple hieroglyphs, it produced a combination of sounds that could represent abstract concepts like sorrow, happiness, beauty, and evil. The Narmer Palette, dated c. 3100 BC during the last phase of Predynastic Egypt, combines the hieroglyphs for catfish and chisel to produce the name of King Narmer.|$|E

5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Milky Way, {{there are}} no bright deep-sky <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> amateur astronomers in Serpens Caput, with nothing else above 10th magnitude. The {{brightest}} is NGC 5962, a spiral galaxy positioned around 28 megaparsecs distant with an apparent magnitude of 11.34. Slightly fainter is NGC 5921, a barred spiral galaxy with a LINER-type active galactic nucleus situated somewhat closer {{at a distance of}} 21 megaparsecs. A type II supernova was observed in this galaxy in 2001 and was designated SN 2001X. Fainter still are the spirals NGC 5964 and NGC 6118, with the latter being host to the supernova SN 2004dk.|$|E
5|$|Research in the 1960s by Eliécer Silva Celis on {{the rock}} art of Sáchica showed phytomorphic designs, masked human figures, {{singular}} and concentric rings, triangulated heads, and faces where the eyes and noses were drawn, but the mouths absent. The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures. The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at El Infiernito and is though {{to refer to a}} pre-Muisca origin. Radial structures drawn on the heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers. Feathers were precious <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> the Muisca and used by the xeques and caciques during the El Dorado ritual in Lake Guatavita.|$|E

5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt objects {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E

30|$|Again, the HRI <b>for</b> the {{lightweight}} <b>object</b> <b>for</b> the VACA was assumed as the optimum because we used optimum m 1 and m 2 values as the control parameters, and also provided additional compliance through variable admittance. These HRI were also intuitive and natural because the subjects used lightweight small-size object [18, 39]. We see as above {{that there is}} no statistically significant difference in HRI between lightweight and heavy <b>object</b> manipulation <b>for</b> the VACA. Hence, the HRI <b>for</b> the heavy <b>object</b> <b>for</b> the VACA can also be treated as intuitive and natural because these were calibrated with those <b>for</b> {{the lightweight}} <b>object</b> <b>for</b> the VACA. Thus, the results proved the effectiveness of the proposed natural and intuitive HRI calibration approach <b>for</b> heavy <b>object</b> manipulation with power-assist.|$|R

25|$|Papier-mâché was {{introduced}} into Mexico around the 17th {{century as a}} way to make <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> churches with its use most developed in central Mexico.

Since this time, the technique has been used to make a wide variety of <b>objects</b> <b>for</b> both ritual, festival and decorative use, mostly by poorer indigenous and mestizo communities. The paper and cardboard used is mostly waste paper, such as old newspapers and boxes, with decorative elements, such as crepe paper being new. Most shapes are created with molds, then painted with acrylics.|$|E
