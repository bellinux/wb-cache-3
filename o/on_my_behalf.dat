500|$|Regarding the situation, Gingrich said in January 1997, [...] "I did {{not manage}} the effort {{intensely}} enough to thoroughly direct or review information being {{submitted to the}} committee <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>behalf.</b> In my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements {{were given to the}} committee, but I did not intend to mislead the committee... I brought down on the people's house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government." ...|$|E
500|$|The inquest {{was opened}} by Leonard Gorodkin at Manchester Coroner's Court on 8 January 1993. Dr William Lawler, a Home Office pathologist, testified that Capper had {{suffered}} 75—80 per cent burns consistent with having had petrol thrown {{over her and}} set alight, and that her chance of survival had been minimal. [...] "It {{was clear from the}} outset that Suzanne was unlikely to survive. She suffered widespread burns that led to several complications internally." [...] Death was due to complications caused by these burns. The coroner said: [...] "It is clear that this young girl must have suffered a great deal of pain and had no chance of survival. But she did fortunately survive long enough to give information which led to the people mentioned being charged with her death." [...] To Capper's mother and stepfather the coroner said: [...] "I offer you, not just <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>behalf</b> but on behalf of the whole nation, my very deepest sympathy and condolences at this tragic happening to your young daughter." ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} that same day, Anthony Kiedis talked about Frusciante and if he would attend the ceremony. Kiedis stated, [...] "It would be a guess <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>behalf</b> {{on whether or not}} he’ll come. I can’t imagine that he would, but it’s a 'you never know' kind of thing. I haven’t talked to him in quite a while. I don’t know where he’s at these days. He’ll obviously be more than welcome, and embraced if he does. If he doesn’t, that’s cool too." [...] Flea also spoke about Frusciante by saying [...] "He left us so many great gifts. He’s a phenomenal musician and songwriter who gave so much to our band. All the feelings I have for him not being in the band any more... He really took us to a higher level."

500|$|Prior to {{the case}} {{reaching}} the high court, Lewis tweeted that Avicii was fully aware of his song being sampled on [...] "Collide", [...] "With regards to my song, Avicii was aware & agreeing publishing splits {{for himself and his}} manager. When Avicii sent his track out to have a song written over it I totally fell in love with this version and I think he's super talented." [...] Syco also responded to the claim, stating that Avicii was always going to work with Lewis, and that he would be credited on the song. In response, Avicii accused Lewis and her label of lying about working together, and tweeted [...] "Thanks for accusing me of lying and speaking <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>behalf.</b> Since we never met or even spoke, please let me and my manager know who told you that and what confirmation they gave you." [...] Hours before both Lewis's and Avicii's record labels were supposed to appear in the high court, Syco released a statement that both record labels had reached an agreement and that Avicii would appear as a featured artist on [...] "Collide", whilst Lewis would appear as the lead artist.

In light of his extensive criminal record, he received a 25-years-to-life sentence. Upon arriving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, he warned the warden, [...] "I'll kill the first man that bothers me", and was given a solitary job in the prison laundry room.

2500|$|The ANC has {{a growing}} list of {{constitutional}} failures. One of the most prominent relates to president of the ANC and of the Republic, Jacob Zuma, and his Nkandla homestead's security upgrades, valued at around R250 million. His swimming pool, for example, was termed a 'fire pool' and his amphitheatre an 'emergency meeting point', thus leaving the taxpayer to carry the costs. After the Public Protector released her report (Secure in Comfort) which found that Zuma must pay back the money spent on the non-security features, he refused to do so. In 2016 the Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma, as well as the National Assembly, had [...] "breached the Constitution" [...] and failed to uphold it. Zuma apologised to the nation as follows: “The matter has caused a lot of frustration and confusion for which I apologise <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>behalf</b> and on behalf of government.” However he claimed not to have asked nor known about the non-security upgrades, despite the media reporting on them almost daily.|$|E
2500|$|For this reason, on Sunday, November 30, 1941, Himmler {{placed a}} {{telephone}} call to Reinhard Heydrich, who, {{as head of the}} SD was also Jeckeln's boss. [...] According to Himmler's telephone log, his order to Heydrich was that the Jews on the transport from Berlin were not to be murdered, or in the Nazi terminology, [...] "liquidated" [...] (Judentransport aus Berlin. [...] Keine Liquidierung). [...] Himmler however only made this call at 1:30 in the afternoon that Sunday, and by that time, the people on [...] the train were dead. [...] What had happened was that there was no housing for the deported German Jews when they arrived in Riga, so the Nazis left them on the train. [...] The next morning, the Nazis ran the trainload of people down to the Rumbula station. [...] They took the people off the train, marched them the short distance to the crime scene and shot them all between 8:15 and 9:00a.m. [...] They were the first group to die that day. The Nazi euphemism for this crime was that the 1,000 Berlin Jews had been [...] "disposed of." [...] Thereafter, on December 1, and, in a personal conference on December 4, 1941, Himmler issued strict instructions to Jeckeln that no mass murders of deported German Jews were to occur without his express orders: [...] "The Jews deported into the territory of the Ostland are to be dealt with only according to the guideline given by me and the Reich Security Main Office acting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>behalf.</b> [...] I will punish unilateral acts and violations." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{spin-off}}, Bianca {{had fallen}} upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky {{embroiled in a}} drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fiancée Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why {{she did not want}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>behalf.</b> But on the other, it convinced me that Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as far as I was concerned, I certainly learned that. Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life when I was in EastEnders in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now – the cast has nearly all changed and going back would be worse than foolish." [...] In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to EastEnders and branded the show [...] "rubbish".|$|E
