40|$|Background: Regarding {{the close}} and {{continuous}} interaction of infertility staff with hopeless infertile couples {{and in the}} contrary the atmosphere of happiness especially in obstetric wards make a sense that considering anxiety and depression {{it would be a}} difference between these two wards. Objective: The objective of this study is the comparison of the rate of depression and anxiety between the two wards <b>of</b> infertility <b>and</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology.</b> Materials <b>and</b> Methods: This study is a descriptive-correlation study based on cross-sectional method. 199 individuals who were the staff <b>of</b> infertility <b>and</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> wards in four provinces enrolled in this study through stratified sampling. Data collection was done by demographic questionnaire, Spiel Berger and Beck depression inventory tests. Data were analyzed by SPSS software using ANOVA test. Results: The result showed the rate <b>of</b> anxiety in <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> staff <b>of</b> Isfahan center (54. 69 ± 13. 58) and depression rate had increased level in infertility staff of Shiraz center (14. 94 ± 10. 87). Overall, there was significant correlation between anxiety, depression and work place (p= 0. 047, 0. 008 respectively). According to ANOVA test, the mean value of anxiety level was higher in the staff <b>of</b> four <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> centers <b>and</b> one infertility center Conclusion: As long as we know that infertile couples have little chance for success rate <b>and</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> wards patients have little risk of failure in treatment, it could be mentioned that the anxiety and depression in the staff are not correlated with the client illnes...|$|R

2500|$|With Acu-Gen {{choosing}} not {{to publish}} proof of its claims and evidence of several women receiving inaccurate predictions, doctors {{are concerned about the}} test. [...] Among the scientific evidence cited by Acu-Gen's web site is a paper co-authored by Diana Bianchi, an expert on fetal DNA at Tufts University. The NPR story quoted Bianchi as saying, [...] "I think at the present time we need to be concerned whether the test is accurate or not", and [...] "I think it's caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware." [...] Another criticism has come from Sandra Carson, professor <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> and involved in research in sex selection. Carson says, [...] "Until Acu-Gen releases its data, there's no way to know the test's reliability. [...] Until that's out, I think it shouldn't be on the market." [...] Carson at that time was at the Baylor College of Medicine. [...] Dr. Charles Lockwood, chairman <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> at Yale School of Medicine, said that it is possible for fetal DNA to be found in maternal blood as soon as the placenta has developed, and that detection after five weeks [...] "is not impossible" [...] and the president of Acu-Gen said the suit was [...] "totally bogus".|$|E

2500|$|This discredited theory {{regarding}} the rarity of pregnancy from rape originated with Fred Mecklenburg in 1972.

He wrote that pregnancy resulting from rape is [...] "extremely rare", that during rape sexual intercourse is not always successfully completed, that the probability of rape coinciding with a woman's ovulation period is low, and that rape-induced trauma impedes ovulation. At times the theory has been reversed and it has instead been non-falsifiably claimed that cases of pregnancy distinguish [...] "real" [...] rape from other acts. This suggestion is also widely seen as being discredited.|$|E

Results: The bibliographic production of the three-year period 2010 - 2012 was published in 69 journals in Anesthesiology subarea and in 345 in <b>Gynecology</b> <b>and</b> <b>Obstetrics.</b> In Anesthesiology, 44 % were within the limits of impact factor of superior A 1, A 2 and B 1; in <b>Obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gynecology,</b> 42. 4 % were in those limits and strata.

2500|$|From the 1960s to the 1980s, {{alcohol was}} {{commonly}} {{used as a}} tocolytic, a method to stop preterm labor. The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, {{the chairman of the}} department <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> at Cornell University Medical College. Doctors recommended a small amount of alcohol to calm the uterus during contractions in early pregnancy or Braxton Hicks contractions. In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. [...] "Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued." [...] Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was [...] "a brutal procedure for all involved." [...] Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible. Such heavy intoxication is highly likely to contribute to FASD.|$|E
2500|$|Several trials on {{the safety}} and {{teratogenicity}} of nitrofurantoin in pregnancy have shown mixed results. A retrospective study in 2009 claimed that several birth defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, ophthalmic malformations, cleft lip and cleft palate, and atrial septal defect, were more common in neonates exposed to nitrofurantoin during pregnancy. A meta analysis of four out of twenty-two available studies {{on the safety}} of nitrofurantoin found no increased risk. A case-control study in 1998 found {{an increased risk of}} craniosynostosis after exposure to [...] "nitrosatable" [...] drugs. A more recent 2013 population-based cohort study which used women registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database and linked the subjects to a birth outcomes database, however, found no increased risk of major malformations in neonates born to women who took nitrofurantoin in early pregnancy. Many of the studies showing increased risk of nitrofurantoin had limitations and relied on patients' recall of the antibiotics they took during pregnancy rather than objective data, which may have led to recall bias. Nevertheless, in light of these conflicting data, the American College <b>of</b> <b>Obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gynecology</b> (ACOG) recommends using antibiotics only for appropriate indications and for the shortest effective duration.|$|E
