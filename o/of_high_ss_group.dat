40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} assess {{relationship}} between the severity of coronary atherosclerosis assessed by SYNTAX score (SS) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI. Methods: After accounting for exclusion criteria, a total of 291 patient with STEMI in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed were retrospectively included (216 male, 75 female; mean age 61. 6 + 14. 0 years). Total and differential leukocyte counts and other biochemical markers were measured at admission. Patients were categorized into tertiles {{on the basis of}} SS. Monitoring for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) was performed during the in hospital follow-up period. Results: The <b>SS</b> <b>high</b> <b>group</b> leukocyte (p= 0. 009), neutrophil (p= 0. 008), NLR (p= 0. 048), peak troponin (p< 0. 001), peak CK-MB (p= 0. 001) lactate dehydrogenase (p= 0. 005), aspartate aminotransferase (p= 0. 004) values were significantly higher compared with SSlow and SSmid <b>groups.</b> <b>SS</b> was increased, left ventricular ejection fraction was decrease (p< 0. 001) and left ventricular systolic diameter was increased (p= 0. 007). The in-hospital death rate and MACEs were greater in the <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> <b>group</b> than in the other groups (p< 0. 001 both of). Conclusion: We found that high NLR was significantly and correlated increased with <b>SS.</b> In addition, <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> were significantly associated with increased in-hospital MACE and in-hospital death. Further prospective studies assessing the predictive role of both SS and NLR in conjunction for risk stratification might improve risk prediction in patients with STEMI.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} in young animals the dynamics of calvarial bone healing when exposing a bone defect to continuous forces for up to 13 weeks. Six-week-old rabbits after a sagittal suture strip craniectomy were randomized for either of the following protocols: (1) no spring was applied (n = 7); (2) a titanium-molybdenum alloy (TMA) lower-force spring was inserted across the craniectomy gap (n = 9); (3) a stainless steel (SS) higher-force spring was applied (n = 8), or (4) sham operation (n = 8). Results showed that the surgically created calvarial bone gap was after 3 weeks kept widened both when a spring of lower force (TMA) and when a spring exerting a <b>higher</b> force (<b>SS)</b> was applied. At 6 weeks, none of the rabbits of the spring-exposed (2 and 3) groups had any bone bridging the gap, while bone bridging was visible in animals of the 2 groups (I and 4) lacking springs. Strikingly enough, in both spring-treated groups, the surgically created defect was still after 13 weeks incompletely bridged by bone, interposed by connective tissue, most evidently in those exposed to <b>higher</b> forces (<b>SS).</b> In contrast, a normal sagittal suture enclosed by lamellar bone was seen in both the sham and the strip groups. We conclude that exposing a surgically created calvarial bone defect to continuous mechanical forces delayed the bridging of the bone defect by at least 13 weeks, even if the force exerted by either spring was very low. In any case, when a <b>higher</b> force (<b>SS</b> <b>group)</b> was applied, the bone reunion was efficiently prevented. No side effects were recognized...|$|R

[URL] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} meibomian gland dropout and lipid layer thickness (LLT) in patients with and without Sjögren's syndrome dry eye (SS). Methods. : We recruited 11 participants with SS (males/females [M/F], 1 : 10; mean age = 56. 0 ± 9. 1 years) and 10 control subjects without dry eye (M/F, 3 : 7; mean age = 58. 5 ± 4. 7 years). All participants completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. The LLT was assessed using the Tearscope Plus based on the appearance of the lipid layer. Noninvasive tear break-up time (NITBUT) also was measured. The lower and upper lids were everted, and the meibomian glands were imaged using the infrared camera of the Keratograph 4. A meibomian gland dropout score due to gland loss was obtained. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test and correlations were determined using Spearman rank correlations. Results. : Of the SS participants, 100 % reported ocular and oral dryness symptoms in the AECC questionnaire. The <b>SS</b> <b>group</b> recorded a <b>higher</b> OSDI score (median = 48. 00, interquartile range [IQR] 23. 0 – 56. 2 vs. 2. 1, IQR 0. 0 – 2. 6; P < 0. 001), reduced LLT (median [IQR] = 15. 0 [15. 0 – 15. 0] vs. 60. 0 [45. 0 – 100. 0] nm; P = 0. 001), and lower NITBUT (median [IQR] = 3. 7 [2. 5 – 4. 2] vs. 9. 5 [6. 4 – 17. 6] sec; P < 0. 001) compared to the controls.
