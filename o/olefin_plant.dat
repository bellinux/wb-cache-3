40|$|An {{investigation}} of the cyclic elastic-plastic response of an <b>Olefin</b> <b>plant</b> heat exchanger subject to cyclic thermal and pressure loading is presented. Design by Analysis procedures for assessment of shakedown and ratcheting are considered, based on elastic and inelastic analysis methods. The heat exchanger tube sheet thickness is non-standard as it is considerably less than that required by conventional design by formula rules. Ratcheting assessment performed using elastic and stress linearization indicates that shakedown occurs under the specified loading when the non-linear component of the through thickness stress is categorized as peak stress. In practice, {{the presence of the}} peak stress will cause local reverse plasticity or plastic shakedown in the component. In non-linear analysis with an elastic-perfectly plastic material model the vessel exhibits incremental plastic strain accumulation for 10 full load cycles, with no indication that the configuration will adapt to steady state elastic or plastic action; i. e. elastic shakedown or plastic shakedown. However, the strain increments are small and would not lead {{to the development of a}} global plastic collapse or gross plastic deformation during the specified life of the vessel. Cyclic analysis based on a strain hardening material model indicates that the vessel will adapt to plastic shakedown after 6 load cycles.

40|$|Concerning {{reorganization}} of our countryls petrochemical complexes {{from the perspective}} of the competitive factors The bulk of the manufacturing process can be divided into three stages; olefin, monomer, and polymer. These plastics are the most commonly manufactured products in the petrochemical industry. When we think about the international competitiveness of the petrochemical industry, first, we must judge plant economics based on the following three points; economy of scale, economy of integration, and economy of range. While the capacity of <b>olefin</b> <b>plants</b> established after 1990 in East Asia and the Middle East were about 800, 000 tons, most of our countryls <b>olefin</b> <b>plants</b> are outdated and their production capacity is, at best, 500, 000 tons. It is clear that the competitiveness of our <b>olefin</b> <b>plants</b> is lower in the economy of scale. This is also true for monomer and polymer facilities. Furthermore, considering the easy access to crude oil in the Middle Eastern plants; the competitiveness of our plants is lower in the economy of integration. Next, a plant using naphtha can produce more varied chemical goods than a plant using ethane. Therefore, our naphtha plans are more competitive than the Middle Eastern ethane plants in the economy of range. But, Japanls economy of range has been overcome by overseas plant 2 ̆ 7 s economy of integration and economy of scale. When we think about the international competitiveness of the petrochemical industry, we must consider the location of the petrochemical complex. In the United States, most of the petrochemical complexes are conveniently located in Texas and Louisiana and linked mostly by pipe, which can be useful to the domestic petrochemical industry, which can be described as " the economy of network". On the contrary, our petrochemical complexes are too distantly located and can not all be connected by pipe. But our complexes are isolated and this diminishes competitiveness of our industry. Until 2004, our resin market was protected by a high tariff, but, now we can import cheaper petrochemical products made in East Asian and Middle Eastern plants. Domestic petrochemical production capacity should be reduced and investment in bigger overseas plants should be increased. At present, to benefit the national economy, we should decrease the domestic petrochemical production capacity, and expand imports from favorable overseas plants...|$|R

40|$|Olefins Plants show an {{intrinsic}} {{cost of the}} energy demand which derives from Process and Plant design. Few innovative changes have been implemented in the past decades. Such changes were mainly directed to increasing the throughput of the plant and its flexibility rather than to provide reduction on energy costs per unit of product. Looking at Olefins Plants from a different sight, i. e. the innovation of processes configuration and technologies, they offer a wide temperature interval which ranges from 800 - 850 degrees Celsius at the coils outlet to minus 125 - 130 degrees in the cold-box; pressure may rise up to 30 bar; standard process productions quote 500. 000 tons per year of ethylene. These figures put these plants in the ideal condition of being considered as an effective benchmark for all those research activities of approaching the energy efficiency problems {{by means of the}} adoption of new technologies or new process configurations. The process under study is a typical <b>olefin</b> <b>plant</b> that produces ethylene by thermal cracking of hydrocabons. This method proceeds by a free radical mechanism including initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The thermal cracking generates several valuable by-products including methane, propylene, butadiene, benzene, [...] . and also fuel oil and tar. These products are usually separated by a set of distillations at low temperature (down to about 100 K) and high pressure in order to separate the products with an acceptable purity. For low pressure plants, the low temperature is achieved in a cold box using a complex refrigeration system with three cascaded refrigeration cycles using methane, ethylene and propylene. The methane refrigeration system works between 136 K and 180 K : it is a classical system with one evaporator and one condenser. The ethylene refrigeration system operates between 172 K and 243 K: it includes three pressure levels. The propylene cycle works between 233 K and 319 K and includes 4 pressure levels. These three systems are linked to each other through their condensers: methane condenser is cooled by ethylene shich in turn is cooled by propylene and finally, cooling water is used to condense propylene. The goal {{of the study was to}} develop a method to help in identifying the process modifications required to reduce the energy consumption of the cold box and to maximize the efficiency of the integrated refrigeration system. Energy integration techniques have been used to target the minimum energy requirement of the process and to characterize the refrigeration system required. If the heat cascade and the corresponding composite curves (e. g. figure 2) give an indication of the refrigeration requirement of the process including all the possible heat recovery exchangers to be considered in the system, it does not give a proper answer to the definition of refrigeration requirement target. This is because, the energy requirement is expressed in terms of mechanical power required in the refrigeration rather than in terms of thermal energy. There was therefore a need for a tool able to target as well the optimal integration of the refrigeration system. The retrofit and the optimal integration of refrigeration systems is a complex task due to a large number of degrees of freedom. To solve such problem, the combined use of process modelling, optimisation based energy integration techniques and graphical representations appear to be a very useful tool.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Chemical {{spillage}} {{of equipment}} {{is possible in}} petrochemical processes. Occurrence of such event can result in firing and explosion and consequently would bring about some risks to the environment affected. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess environmental risks in <b>Olefin</b> <b>Plant,</b> Arya Sasol Petrochemical Company in order to identify environmental risks at producing source. Methods: The basic data was gathered through using the results of monitoring and measurement of ambient air pollutants and stack exhaust gases, safety review method and field observation. For determination the effects of hydrocarbons leakage from equipment on the environment, measuring BTEX in ambient air was performed as per EPA 0030 Standard method with using Gas Chromatography at 4 stations of the complex and a portable Testo 350 XL device was used for monitoring stack exhaust gases, from 9 stacks from May 2011 to April 2012. Assessment and risk management tool used in this study was the fault tree analysis method. The main part of the risk assessment in fault tree method is selecting a top event. According to the statistics of accidents and environmental aspects of ethane cracking operations, hydrocarbon leakage is detected as top event and then composition and relationship between risk factors is determined in the form of terminal event, intermediate event and the gate “and” and “or”. With qualitative and quantitative analysis of fault tree of this accident, the main causes of the accident and the likelihood of the top event was calculated for a year. Results: Comparing with other stations, it was found that benzene with concentration of 0. 37 mg/m 3 in autumn, toluene with concentration of 0. 13 mg/m 3 in spring, and ethyl benzene with concentration of 0. 09 mg/m 3 in autumn, and xylene with the concentration of 1. 01 mg/m 3 in autumn season had the highest concentration. The fault tree developed had 16 events (including final, intermediate, and initial), which were connected to each other with seven logic gates. The maximum error percentage in the terminal events was attributed to the hardware failures such as malfunction in equipment with 55. 55 percent followed by human and administrative errors in the next ranking. The highest percentage (22. 2 %) of the terminal events was related to the gasket unsuitable material; the main reason is due to the economic sanctions and the lack of effort to provide high quality products. Conclusion: Most likely occurrence of the final event was related to the gasket unsuitable material (2 × 10 - 2). Control action to prevent the occurrence of leakage could be supplying high quality gaskets and the failure is classified in the hardware failure category...|$|E

Ethane steam cracking furnaces are of fundamental importance to improve the overall yields of an <b>olefins</b> production <b>plant.</b> In this context, a model for an industrial steam cracking furnace application was developed using the equation-oriented dynamic simulator EMSO. In the proposed model, a multi-section plug flow reactor was coupled with cracking kinetics from literature. The simulations results are in good agreement with published and industrial design data. The model also provides detailed information which can be used for optimal run length. 1...|$|R
