When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on <b>our</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the universe.|$|E

25|$|Our {{ideas about}} God are {{important}} indicators {{of how we}} view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our {{vision of the world}} – and <b>our</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.|$|E

2500|$|While {{abstract}} metaphysics {{provides us}} with a world of beauty and purpose and various other [...] "highers", it condemns other key aspects of {{the world we live}} in as imaginary. The world of abstract metaphysics has no place for imperfect moral agents who (1) strive to learn about the world and then (2) act upon the world to change it for the better. Consequently, abstract metaphysics condemns us as illusionary, and declares <b>our</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the world as unimportant and purposeless. Where abstractions take priority, our concrete lives collapse into scepticism and pessimism.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this essay}} Dyson defined the key {{elements}} of the design process he undertakes. First, there is {{an examination of the}} life experiences and aspirations of the client. This assessment examines the motivations, both conscious and unconscious, that brought the client to call for a building. Secondly, there is an intersection of inner discernment with an outer, specific physical location. The given conditions of a building site are predetermined by unavoidable features, such as climate and topography. In the view of Dyson, the resulting form should express individuality of presence that shows this set of conditions. Thirdly, the design must also integrate the availability of economic resources, accessibility of building materials, and responsiveness to legal regulations. The outcome of the design process identifies human life with a given setting, creating a sense of place. In this created place we adopt an identity of belonging that in turn marks <b>our</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding world. Dyson noted: ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Sadoveanu's {{stories of}} the period often {{returned}} to a naturalistic perspective, particularly {{in a series of}} sketch stories and novellas which portray the modest lives of Romanian Railways employees, of young men drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, of Bovaryist women who playfully seduce adolescents, or of the provincial petite bourgeoisie. At times, they confront the morals of barely literate people with the stern authorities: a peasant obstinately believes that the 1859 union between Wallachia and Moldavia was meant to ensure the supremacy of his class; a young lower-class woman becomes the love interest of a boyar but chooses a life of freedom; and a Rom deserts from the Army after being told to bathe. In La noi, la Viișoara ("At <b>Our</b> <b>Place</b> <b>in</b> Viișoara"), the life of an old man degenerates into bigotry and avarice, {{to the point where he}} makes his wife starve to death. Sadoveanu's positive portrayal of hajduks as fundamentally honest outlaws standing up to feudal injustice, replicates stereotypes found in Romanian folklore, and is mostly present in some of the stories through (sometimes recurrent) heroic characters: Vasile the Great, Cozma Răcoare, Liță Florea etc. In the piece titled Bordeenii (roughly, [...] "The Mud-hut Dwellers"), he shows eccentrics and misanthropes presided upon by the dark figure of Sandu Faliboga, brigands who flee all public authority and whom commentators have likened to settlers of the Americas. Lepădatu, an unwanted child, speaks for the entire group: [...] "What could I do [...] wherever there are big fairs and lots of people? I'd have a better time with the cattle; it is with them that I have grown up and with them that I get along." [...] Romanticizing the obscure events of early medieval history in Vremuri de bejenie ("Roving Times", 1907), Sadoveanu sketches the improvised self-defense of a refugee community, their last stand against nomadic Tatars.|$|E
