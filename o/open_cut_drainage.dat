40|$|Peatlands are an {{important}} terrestrial carbon store. However, heightened levels of degradation in response to environmental change have resulted in an increased loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and an associated rise {{in the level of}} discolouration in catchment waters. A significant threat to peatland sustainability has been the installation of artificial drainage ditches. However, recent restoration schemes have pursued drain blocking as a possible strategy for reducing degradation, fluvial carbon loss and water discolouration. This paper investigates the effect of <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> <b>drainage</b> and the impact of drain blocking on DOC and colour dynamics in blanket peat soil–water solutions. Three treatments (intact peat, drained peat and drain-blocked peat) were monitored in an upland blanket peat catchment in the UK. DOC and colour values were significantly higher on the drained slopes compared with those of the intact peat, which in turn had greater DOC and colour values than the drain-blocked slopes. Consequently, drain blocking is shown to be a highly successful technique in reducing both the DOC concentration and level of discolouration in soil waters, even to values lower than those observed for the intact site, which suggests a process of store exhaustion and flushing may operate. The colour per carbon unit (C/C) ratio was significantly higher at the drain-blocked site than either the intact or the drained treatments, while the E 4 /E 6 ratio (fulvic acid/humic acid) was significantly lower at the blocked site compared to the two other treatments. The high C/C and low E 4 /E 6 ratios indicate that drain blocking also modifies the composition of DOC, such that darker-coloured humic substances become more dominant compared to the intact site. This implies disturbance to DOC production and/or transportation processes operating within the peat...|$|E

Between 1882 and 1981, a total of 7. 6 million ounces of gold and 360, 000 tonnes of copper were extracted using underground and later <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> mining methods. The mine closed in 1990 after the re-treatment of 28 Mt of tailings, which were placed into the <b>open</b> <b>cut.</b> Acid rock <b>drainage</b> (ARD) resulting from the exposure of sulphide-bearing waste at surface has heavily impacted the site and portions of the adjacent Dee River. The groundwater draining the mine site has low pH (2. 5 - 3. 5) and highly elevated concentrations of magnesium, sulphate, aluminium, iron, copper, zinc and various trace metals (Cd, Cr, Co and Ni). A groundwater flow model was developed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the seepage interception and pump-back system (SIS) currently in place. The calibrated groundwater flow model indicates that the backfilled (and flooded) Open Cut/Sandstone Gully (OCSG) represents the largest single source of ARD seepage (8. 0 L/s) on the site with tailings impoundments representing important secondary sources of seepage. An estimated 80 % of all seepage is collected by the seepage interception system (SIS). The remaining 20 % (or ~ 3 L/s) of ARD impacted seepage by-passes the SIS and enters the Dee River and underlying aquifer. A simplified load balance model was subsequently developed for the site to estimate the contaminant loads generated by the different mine waste units and by-passing the SIS. The flooded OCSG represents the largest single source of contaminant load. However, most of the seepage and associated load from this source is intercepted by the SIS. The results from the load balance model indicate that between 11 % and 25 % of the contaminants of concern (SO 4, Al, Cu, Fe Zn) by-pass the seepage interception system and report to the Dee River aquifer system. The model identified mine waste lying within the Shepherd’s catchment as the largest contributor to this by-pass load. The results of this load balance analysis will be used to assist in developing a closure and reclamation plan for the Mount Morgan mine site...|$|R

The Black Rock <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> was closed prematurely in 1965 due to instability in its western wall. Mining was stopped 40 feet short of its planned final depth of 520 feet, causing a significant quantity of high-grade ore not to be recovered.|$|R
