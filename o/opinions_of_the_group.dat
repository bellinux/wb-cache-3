5000|$|Work {{relevant}} to social influence in groups {{has a long}} history. Two early examples of social psychological research have been particularly influential. The first of these was by Muzafer Sherif in 1935 using the autokinetic effect. Sherif asked participants to voice their judgments of light movement {{in the presence of}} others and noted that these judgments tended to converge. The second of these was a series of studies by Solomon Asch, in which naive participants were asked to voice their judgments of the similarity of the length of lines after hearing the [...] "judgments" [...] of several confederates (research assistants posing as participants) who purposely voiced the same obviously wrong judgment. On about 1/3 of the cases, participants voiced the obviously wrong judgment. When asked why, many of these participants reported that they had originally made the correct judgment but after hearing the confederates, decided the judgments of several others (the confederates) should be trusted over theirs. As a consequence of these and other studies, social psychologists have come to distinguish between two types of social influence; informational and normative (see conformity). Informational influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the content of what they read or hear to accept an opinion; Sherif's study appears to be an example. Normative influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the knowledge that a majority of group members have a view. Normative influence {{should not be confused with}} compliance, which occurs when group members are not persuaded but voice the <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> majority. Although some of the participants in the Asch studies who conformed admitted that they had complied, the ones mentioned above who believed the majority to be correct are best considered to have been persuaded through normative influence.|$|E

30|$|As we know, expert {{information}} can be utilized, for example, in policy-making seminars and workshops. These forms of strategic collaboration, however, have their own problems which prevent the expert group from operating democratically. For example, as a principle, all the <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> should be looked after and taken seriously. However, a strong impact of some personalities can dominate the group discussion. Or some experts do not dare to bring all the honest opinions out of fear, or losing face, or fear of losing their jobs. The Delphi method was originally developed to address these kinds of group-thinking problems. This has made the Delphi teamwork a traditional and widely used method because this methodology allows anonymity of the experts [15, 16].|$|E

This project supports the hypothesis that assertiveness training might be an effective technique for influencing individual attitudes and behavior. The particular focus of this study is on four female students of a suburban high school in Los Angeles County, California. Counseling and training took place within a group setting. The following test instruments were used to measure change: A test devised by Alberti and Emmons (1975) for measuring self-concept was administered to the group before counseling. The Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (App. A) and the Rathus 30 -Item Schedule for Assessing Assertive Behavior were administered midway into the sessions. All three tests were given at the end of counseling. Observations were made weekly as to any changes that emerged within the group along with a questionnaire assessing the students??? <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> The test results indicate an improvement in self-esteem and assertiveness. Personal observations of interactions within the group seem to support these findings. With certain individuals, change can be noted within the group process more readily than with others. However, no concrete conclusions can be drawn from this study because {{of the size of the}} sample and the lack of a control group.

For this purpose, a Delphi study was made in 2014 related to the issues, technologies and variables which have a priority in the year 2032 regarding biodegradable packaging. Such matter was evaluated over the original data and the incidence of the number of experts was assessed: 9, 15, 22 and 24.

Amongst the key results, it can be observed that from the analysis with the 9 experts a common set of issues was presented, which remained constant for the other quantities of experts. In other words, increasing the number of experts did not present big changes on the priority issues. However, minor variations with 15 and 22 experts were obtained. As for expert competence "k" coefficient the results obtained with the 16 experts with a "k" coefficient {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 8, in four of the five groups, high percentages were obtained with the common core priority issues, while experts with a lower "k" coefficient of 0. 8 were placed in the five groups of high variation percentages, taking into account that they were given the same common core topics...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The first {{international}} summit on anastomotic leak {{was held in}} Chicago in October, 2012 to assess current knowledge {{in the field and}} develop novel lines of inquiry. The following report is a summary of the proceedings with commentaries and future prospects for clinical trials and laboratory investigations. BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leakage remains a devastating problem for the patient, and a continuing challenge to the surgeon operating on high-risk areas of the gastrointestinal tract such as the esophagus and rectum. Despite the traditional wisdom that anastomotic leak is because of technique, evidence to support this is weak-to-non-existent. Outcome data continue to demonstrate that expert high-volume surgeons working in high-volume centers continue to experience anastomotic leaks and that surgeons cannot predict reliably which patients will leak. METHODS: A one and one-half day summit was held and a small working group assembled to review current practices, opinions, scientific evidence, and potential paths forward to understand and decrease the incidence of anastomotic leak. RESULTS: RESULTS of a survey of the <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> demonstrated that the majority of participants believe that anastomotic leak is a complicated biologic problem whose pathogenesis remains ill-defined. The group opined that anastomotic leak is underreported clinically, it is not because of technique except when there is gross inattention to it, and that results from animal models are mostly irrelevant to the human condition. CONCLUSIONS: A fresh and unbiased examination of the causes and strategies for prevention of anastomotic leak needs to be addressed by a continuous working group of surgeons, basic scientists, and clinical trialists to realize a real and significant reduction in its incidence and morbidity. Such a path forward is discussed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiparametric {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (mpMRI) may {{have a role in}} detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in men with raised serum prostate-specific antigen levels. Variations in technique and the interpretation of images have contributed to inconsistency in its reported performance characteristics. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to make recommendations on a standardised method for the conduct, interpretation, and reporting of prostate mpMRI for prostate cancer detection and localisation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A consensus meeting of 16 European prostate cancer experts was held that followed the UCLA-RAND Appropriateness Method and facilitated by an independent chair. MEASUREMENT: Before the meeting, 520 items were scored for "appropriateness" by panel members, discussed face to face, and rescored. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Agreement was reached in 67 % of 260 items related to imaging sequence parameters. T 2 -weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion-weighted MRI were the key sequences incorporated into the minimum requirements. Consensus was also reached on 54 % of 260 items related to image interpretation and reporting, including features of malignancy on individual sequences. A 5 -point scale was agreed on for communicating the probability of malignancy, with a minimum of 16 prostatic regions of interest, to include a pictorial representation of suspicious foci. Limitations relate to consensus methodology. Dominant personalities are known to affect the <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> and were countered by a neutral chairperson. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus was reached on a number of areas related to the conduct, interpretation, and reporting of mpMRI for the detection, localisation, and characterisation of prostate cancer. Before optimal dissemination of this technology, these outcomes will require formal validation in prospective trials...|$|E
40|$|Surveys and {{interviews}} are common methods for gathering information useful {{for planning and}} evaluating programs. Recently, however, a group method for gathering such information has become increasingly popular. This method is the focus group interview. What is a Focus Group? Focus groups are a special type of group used to gather information from members of a clearly defined target audience. Unfortunately, many people confuse focus groups {{with a number of}} other group methods used for collecting information such as town meetings, public forums, nominal groups, advisory councils, hearings, and study circles. These, however, are not focus groups. Nor are committees or task forces charged with carrying out a particular assignment. Rather, a focus group isâ¦ â¢ composed of six to twelve people, â¢ who are similar in one or more ways, and â¢ are guided through a facilitated discussion, â¢ on a clearly defined topic, â¢ to gather information about the <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> members. The goal of a focus group is to promote self-disclosure among participants. Because a group, rather than an individual, is asked to respond to questions, dialogue tends to take {{on a life of its}} own. Participants âpiggy-back â on the comments of others and add a richness to the dialogue that could not be achieved through a one-on-one interview. Focus groups arose in the early 1940 âs as social science researchers were looking for alternatives to interviewer-dominated methods. One of the first uses of focus groups was to explore morale of U. S. troops during World War II. Later, focus groups were used extensively by the business community as a way to stay in touch with customers. It was not until recently that focus groups were embraced in the academic community...|$|E
40|$|Background: An {{important}} element in scenario-based architecture evaluation is <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> scenario profiles by stakeholders working in groups. In practice groups can vary in size from 2 to 20 people. Currently, there is no empirical evidence about <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>group</b> size on <b>the</b> scenario development activity. Goal: Our experimental goal was to investigate <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>group</b> size on <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> scenario profiles developed by different sizes of groups. Experimental design: We had 165 subjects, who {{were randomly assigned to}} 10 groups of size 3, 13 groups of size 5, and 10 groups of size 7. Participants were asked to develop scenario profiles. After the experiment each participant completed a questionnaire aimed at identifying their <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> activity. Result: <b>The</b> average quality score for group scenario profiles for 3 person groups was 362. 4, for groups of 5 person groups was 534. 23 and for 7 person groups was. 444. 5. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> scenario profiles for groups of size 5 was significantly greater than <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> scenario profiles for groups of size 3 (p= 0. 025), but {{there was no difference between}} the size 3 and size 7 groups. However, participants in groups of size 3 had a significantly better <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> activity outcome and their personal interaction with their group than participants in groups of size 5 or 7. Conclusion: Our results suggest that <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output from a group does not increase linearly with group size. However, individual participants prefer small groups. This means there is a trade-off between group output quality and <b>the</b> personal experience <b>of</b> <b>group</b> members...|$|R
