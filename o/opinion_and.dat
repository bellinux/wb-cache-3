40|$|<b>Opinions</b> <b>and</b> {{beliefs are}} {{essential}} {{ingredients in the}} diffusion of innovation. We present a framework to model and simulate diffusion processes of <b>opinions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs in interpersonal communication networks. We introduce an algorithm to create stylized networks with attributes of real world interpersonal communication networks. We also introduce a simple, but expandable model for simulating {{the dynamics of the}} diffusion processes of <b>opinions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs. We apply network multi-agent simulations to show the importance of local clusters of connected agents for keeping <b>opinions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs endemic in a social system. We also argue that due to the structure of interpersonal networks, these local clusters have the capability to propagate <b>opinions</b> <b>and</b> ideas into the entire system...|$|R

5|$|Although most justices were {{immediately}} convinced, Warren {{spent some time}} after this famous speech convincing everyone to sign onto the opinion. Justices Jackson and Reed finally decided to drop their dissent. The final decision was unanimous.

Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{formulated}} the Jay Treaty {{to normalize}} {{trade relations with}} Great Britain, remove them from western forts, and resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution; John Jay negotiated and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794.

5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's <b>opinion</b> <b>and</b> concluded {{that the cause of}} the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E

This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific <b>opinion</b> <b>and</b> is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer over time.|$|E

5|$|The vote {{share of}} the BJP was 31% of all votes cast, a low figure {{relative}} {{to the number of}} seats it won. This was the first instance since 1984 of a single party achieving an outright majority in the Indian Parliament and the first time that it achieved a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own strength.

5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public <b>opinion,</b> <b>and</b> plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public <b>opinion,</b> <b>and</b> the perception of lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was {{at the same time}} renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of {{evaluating}} {{a wide range of}} alternative plans to address the ship's problems (as well as other issues at San Jacinto), TPWD, working with many of the stakeholders at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, adopted a Master Plan that called for placing Texas into a permanent dry berth. After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004, the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their <b>opinion</b> <b>and</b> on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.|$|E
