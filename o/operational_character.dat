40|$|Estimating {{evolutionary}} {{relationships is}} basic to {{the objectives of}} systematics. Comparative data, structured as taxonomic characters, are usually the essential considerations on which such estimates are founded. Some taxonomic characters are more useful than others for structuring plausible estimates of evolutionary relationship. Thus, {{one of the primary}} challenges to the systematist is the construction of taxonomic characters most useful for this purpose. Since taxonomic characters are the result of action {{on the part of the}} systematist, they must be defined operationally. It is our hope, however, that these operationally defined characters will conform to an ideal that, itself, cannot be operationally defined insofar as the concept depends on history that is, usually, inherently unknowable. It is, nonetheless, essential to our conceptual methods that this ideal concept be well defined. Here we present a series of definitions leading to a clear ideal concept of true cladistic character. This series includes definitions of the concepts: evolutionary unit, qualitative taxonomic character, monophyletic group, divergent character, true cladistic <b>character,</b> <b>operational</b> cladistic <b>character,</b> and the post-factum ideal relation between an <b>operational</b> cladistic <b>character</b> and an estimate of cladistic history.

Even unentangled states may exhibit such quantumness, that is pointed out by the new task of local broadcasting, i. e. of locally sharing pre-established correlations: this task is feasible if and only if correlations are classical and derive a no-local-broadcasting theorem for quantum correlations. Thus, local broadcasting is able to point out the quantumness of correlations, as standard broadcasting points out the quantum character of single system states. Further, we argue that our theorem implies the standard no-broadcasting theorem for single systems, and that our operative approach leads in a natural way to the definition of measures for quantumness of correlations.

40|$|China has {{undertaken}} {{a series of}} comprehensive economic and banking reform programs {{over the past three}} decades. As part of the WTO agreement, the domestic financial sector is fully open to foreign investors from WTO member countries in 2006. To answer the challenges, the policy makers and management of SOCB have been introducing two major steps to improve the Competitiveness of the commercial banks: transfer the bad debts to asset management companies and inject foreign exchange reserves to capital. However, the qualitative study shows that the general performance of the state-owned commercial banks is unstable during this period. It is high time that the consequences and efficiency of the reform were examined on an objective basis. This research offers a careful and rigorous examination of the condition and determinants of banking efficiency and competitiveness in China, with the focus on the state-owned commercial banks. The key contribution {{of this study is to}} develop a comprehensive empirical framework to measure and explain the performance of the state-owned commercial banks during the crucial transitional period from 1998 to 2003. This research examines the banking market conditions on the basis of a synthesis of the traditional Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm and other alternative hypotheses. The thesis reveals that the state-owned commercial banks still dominate in both retail and business banking markets. The interest earnings remain the dominant source of commercial revenues. Due to the special relationship with government and their <b>operational</b> <b>characters</b> in the financial market, the state-owned commercial banks are not sensitive to monetary policy adjustments. The competition from other type of commercial banks has been strengthening, but the impact is rather limited. The main contribution of this study to the empirical literature on the Chinese banking market is the employment of the Data Envelopment Analysis to measure the efficiency of the state-owned commercial banks at provincial level, followed by a panel econometric investigation into the differences in banking efficiency across the stat-owned commercial banking groups as well as individual provinces. The results show that the level of banking efficiency was generally very low and there was a significant extent of input surplus among the provincial branches. The source of inefficiency is different among individual banking groups. The econometric study reveals that the SOCBs benefit from the concentrated market structure and strong complementary relationship with their traditional business areas. The empirical results have also shed light on further policy measures to enhance banking competition and performance in China...|$|R

Accordingly, we propose and characterize a new procedure to codify ordinal information. We also define a new measurement of the degree of dissensus among individual preferences based on the Mahalanobis distance. It is especially designed for the case of possibly correlated alternatives. Finally, we investigate a procedure to obtain a social consensus solution that also includes the possibility of alternatives that are correlated. In addition, we examine the main traits of the dissensus measurement as well as the social solution proposed.

In literature, two main sources of unequal exchange have been identified: differences in industrial specialization and differences in factors remunerations between countries.

The social distribution of benefits/losses of unequal exchange emerges as a pragmatic and historical question rather than a theoretical one. Recent empirical approaches based on the difference between nominal and PPP exchange rates could only partially capture the full extent of unequal exchange in world economy.

These controls consist of simple joints, handles, or even separate character selection windows. This research paper present an automated rigging system for quadruped characters with custom controls and manipulators for animation. The full character rigging mechanism is procedurally driven based on various principles and requirements used by the riggers and animators. The automation is achieved initially by creating widgets according to the character type. These widgets then can be customized by the rigger according to the character shape, height and proportion. Then joint locations for each body parts are calculated and widgets are replaced programmatically.

40|$|This {{monograph}} is {{the consequence}} {{of a variety of}} experiences. It reflects an interest in SMEs and entrepreneurship stretching back almost 17 years from the author's days in the fresh food industry. It reflects knowledge from a series of studies and projects in which the author has been engaged since commencement of an academic career in 1990. In particular, it reflects the findings of a five-year piece of doctoral research that the author conducted with 57 firms in Ireland and the UK between 1995 - 1999. The study seeks to identify the key determinants of SME marketing activity. The research objectives focused on determining a framework of marketing competencies for SMEs, the extent of formal marketing processes practised, and how SME marketing decisions are made. Further research objectives emerged (these were inductive in nature) that focused on determining the extent of the sales orientation in SMEs and on gaining insights into the use and character of the contact networks of the individuals who manage such enterprises. A syncretised qualitative methodology was developed for the study. The research approach was both deductive and inductive. The analytical strategy adopted a range of tools but was predominantly characterised by data reduction through detailed coding and the development of strict frameworks for analysis. The findings identified a spectrum of marketing competencies for SMEs. It existed at three levels - foundation, transitional and operational. It was shown that the sales orientation of SMEs is what determines their marketing character. A core spectrum of SME sales competencies was identified. It showed significant overlap with the marketing competency spectrum. It was concluded that, since the sales orientation determines the marketing competencies, it also shapes the marketing character of SMEs. The sample firms engaged in significant formal marketing practice, most notably marketing planning. Marketing practice and decisions were characterised by significant usage of personal contact networks. Contact networks were also rooted in a strong sales orientation. It was clear that many marketing decisions that are ostensibly <b>operational</b> in <b>character</b> become strategic or eventually effect strategic change in the marketing practices of SMEs. A holistic model of SME marketing was developed. The model is an integrated complex of the elements of SME marketing examined. Whilst the holistic model developed is entrepreneurial in character, it depicts the SME as a much more sophisticated marketing entity than has been suggested in any previous research...|$|R

With national, curriculum, evaluation and textbooks, how science education in French West Indies manage the challenge to take account this particularity of our territories? Based on this example and others, the aim of this communication is to present a science education theoretical background focus on contexts studies. During science teaching, learning effects due to different context like social, cultural or language could be described as contextual effects. But others micro-didactic effects of contexts could also be identified as linked with specificity of natural environment. These effects manifest a strain between a goal of teaching or learning and its implementation, when this stain is due in the educational process in different contexts involved. To ensure the quality of education, reference and quantify the effects of educational context seems to be necessary. it should be interested in the process leading to the emergence of these contexts. We propose a simplified model of these processes initially described as meetings of mechanisms operating within a network of transposition of designs. Then we question these processes by degree or forms of contextualization (low to high) and crossed these two approaches, giving an initial typology of contextualisation process. It then emerges the idea that these processes are constrained by resistances. We retain the following three: epistemological, social and educational. As these constraints are expressed in different ways according to disciplines, the data suggest the existence of disciplinary contextualization profiles. All these three approaches (network implementation, degree of contextualization, disciplinary profiles) are three tools for analyzing contextual phenomena which remain to test the robustness and <b>operational</b> <b>character</b> for the training analysis context...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{discover}} the <b>operational</b> <b>character</b> of gated communities in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on a small case study conducted in Iskandar Malaysia, an economic development region located in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia. In the case study, 12 housing developers were interviewed, involving 32 gated communities altogether. The investigation covered the identification of the governing document used in operating a gated community, the operational purposes and scopes, the arrangement for collection of maintenance fee, and the internal governance within the gated communities. Findings – From the analysis, it was found that two types of gated communities exist in the case study areas, namely the strata gated community scheme, and the gated community scheme (GACOS). The operational mechanism for the former is through a set of rules enforced by the government. Meanwhile, the latter is based on the arrangement set up either by the developer, where legal agreement is applicable, or through the consensus among homeowners. However, despite these differences, both mechanisms share the same intention, that is to operate the gated community based on cooperative-collective sharing arrangement. Research limitations/implications – Despite the vulnerability of GACOS enclosure components, the case study revealed that the number of GACOS is still bigger than the strata gated community scheme. Since this perspective is lacking in this paper, it is suggested that more studies are conducted to explain the reasons behind the indicated phenomenon. Originality/value – The most important contribution of the paper is to highlight the importance of gating experience that is heavily influenced by the local policy setting to determine the survival of a gated community; thus, demonstrating how different they are from each other...|$|E
40|$|As {{time goes}} on, {{due to the}} growing {{specialization}} and complication of problems, Enterprise Economy is coming to be a special branch of science which, from its beginning, has had an <b>operational</b> <b>character.</b> The difference, however, {{is not so much}} due to the latter feature but derives from its problems and methods. Nowadays Enterprise Economy is oriented toward the future, whereas previously it was aimed preferentially toward the past. As regards methods, the difference lies in the growing use of mathematical language which makes it possible to tackle problems formerly not accessible to exact scientific procedures. Nowadays it is focused on the problems of planning which are characteristic of it. By means of examples some short – and long-term planning problems are explained. Starting out from the analysis of COURNOT, of the planning of the "outlet/price" curve, a way is shown towards the methods of lineal and non-lineal programming. The new methods do not replace the marginal analysis which continues as the central instrument, still indispensable also in modern investigation. In an accounting system orientated towards the future, the centre of gravity of planning and planning control necessarily has to lie on the departmental side. A warning is expressed against assigning too much importance to calculating machines and not enough to the investigation of the economic possibilities of electronic equipment. Problems of long-term planning are briefly dealt with such as those discussed in investment theory, expounding the basic methods (capitalization, internal interest, annuities), rejecting as inapplicable more recent attempts {{to solve the problem of}} economical yield simultaneously with the problem of liquidity.

40|$|Defense date: 23 / 11 / 2009 Examining board: Marise Cremona (EUI, Supervisor), Bruno de Witte (EUI), Jörg Monar (College of Europe), Steve Peers (University of Essex) This thesis, {{starting}} from the premise that territorial borders retain their importance in public international law, examines in detail the EU's regulatory framework {{for the management of}} its external borders. It will argue that there are in fact two sets of external borders: those of the area in which the rules on the free movement of persons apply, and those of the Schengen area. The border crossing rights under the two corresponding sets of rules will be examined in detail. The focus will then shift to the broader Schengen rules for the management of the external borders. The thesis will discuss the rationale of the EU's interest in borders, the legislative acquis adopted, and the relation between legislation and executive action. An elaborate discussion on the organisation and functioning of the "European Border Agency" (Frontex) serves to illustrate the importance of operational cooperation in this area. A final chapter will look at the external dimension of this policy field. A distinction is made between the relations with third countries for the purpose of managing the external borders and the exportation of Community standards. Also in the external sphere, the objective of controlling irregular migration and the operational nature of EU action are prominent. It is concluded that the management of the external borders takes places in a much more complex and uncertain legal framework than is often assumed. Whilst border management should be a part or rather complement to a Common European Asylum and Migration policy if now risks to become a substitute for it. Even where legislation is adopted, it has a strong <b>operational</b> <b>character,</b> which carries risks in terms of accountability and legitimacy. The legislation in this area is both far-reaching and ill thought-through at the same time. From this lessons could be drawn for the broader cooperation between law enforcement authorities...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{we will see a}} {{pronounced}} increase in the speed at which payment transactions are executed and in the share of cross-border transactions, particularly in the euro area. Counterparty risks and liquidity needs connected with the transfer of funds continue to evolve and to provoke discussion. The fact that funds transfers occur and systems operate on a real-time and gross basis will significantly alter the <b>operational</b> <b>character</b> and technical solutions in this field. Systems following a daily timetable are being replaced by continuously operating systems, which will {{have a significant impact on}} banks' liquidity management. The trend toward immediate real-time payment transactions seems inevitable in the light of present trends. It is generally presumed that RTGS systems operating on a gross basis require more liquidity than netting systems. Liquidity needs depend on payment system structures and payment flows. An even flow of payments requires less liquidity than an uneven flow. Liquidity needs can be significantly reduced by choosing an appropriate payment system structure, taking measures to even out payment flows and agreeing on market practices. The pricing, collateral and reserve requirement policies of the central bank affect also the efficiency of alternative payment systems. Thus the overall efficiency of a gross or net system depends on many factors. Factors arguing for a gross system are differences in counterparty risks, lack of reciprocity, steady interday payment flows and stable liquidity needs, both within and between days. Factors favouring net systems are the existence of small and varying counterparty risks and structurally unsteady payment flows that result in large interday variations in liquidity, even though overnight variations may be moderate. Current, daily-oriented practices have focused on overnight liquidity needs. In a continuously operating environment, liquidity needs are continuously monitored across time-period borders. This means that banks' liquidity management will in the future operate under a new and broader time perspective. Significant liquidity needs and large counterparty risks are inherent parts of Finland's present funds-transfer solutions. Liquidity can be freed for other uses and counterparty risks reduced by changing the structures. The necessary changes have been agreed and soon we will see fundamental changes in Finnish payment systems. payment system settlement; gross settlement; RTGS; payment system counterparty risks; payment system liquidity needs...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} a {{relatively}} short period of popularity in the 1980 s– 1990 s, legal autopoiesis is not amongst the most debated theories in contemporary jurisprudence. On the methodological side, this loss of interest was, to some extent, predetermined by its sociological origins, metaphorical apparatus, the complexity of Niklas Luhmann’s theory of social systems and its stylistic density. 1 From the normative perspective, the gist of criticism and disapproval among legal scholars could be narrowed down to their scepticism towards the autopoiesis’ motto: law as a self-referential system. Taken superficially, the self-referential character of law breaks the ‘taboo of circularity’, 2 endangering in some sense the very idea of democratic governance. It would be a trivial task, however, to demonstrate that the closeness of the system of legal norms has an <b>operational</b> <b>character</b> and is intrinsically connected to its openness. This issue has been explicitly articulated by the founders of legal autopoiesis in their reply to accusations that autopoiesis is a revival of some type of autarchic solipsism of law I do not intend in this paper to trace the evolution of autopoiesis in law and its eventual decline. My primary objective is to offer dialectical account of the discussion about the essence of law, as takes place between legal positivism and non-positivism using autopoietic analysis of law as a means in support of legal positivism. I develop my arguments in 4 sections. After the introductory notes, which set the overall tasks of the paper, Section II provides a brief description of the theory of social systems, analysing the principle of autopoiesis and its repercussion on the system of law and highlights the main research agenda of exclusive positivism (I will also use the term exclusivism). Section III articulates in more details the main problems related to law’s incorporation of morality, providing a theoretical background for the theory of dialectical positivism (I will address the meaning of dialectics and dialectical positivism in Section IV), which is subsequently applied in Section IV to the issues of the indeterminacy of the law, legal interpretation and argumentation...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} opinion that {{problems}} of human environment should be incorporated {{in a system of}} management and planning of socio-economic development. Such incorporation gives the best frame for the treatment of these problems according to the requirements of the present time. The aim {{of this article is to}} present the way of incorporating environmental problems in the management system and especially in planning systems at urban and regional levels and conditions that ought to be fulfilled in order to make this incorporation effective. We assume the following organizational structure of the national economy. Decisions concerning environment are made along three organizational systems, that is: territorial system, sectoral system, and population. The territorial system consists of three levels: local, regional and national. Large urban-industrial agglomerations are units of regional level. The sectoral system consists of enterprises, industrial corporations and economic ministries. This system includes also cooperatives and social organizations. The third system consists of households. The biggest transformations of environment are caused by the sectoral system. What are the necessary conditions of incorporating environmental problems to management, urban and regional planning at the given organizational structure? The author defines sixteen such conditions. Among them are: 1) Plans of cities and regions ought to take into account guiding principles of the central programme of environment protection, which is a part of the integrated socio-economic programming. 2) It is indispensable to work out new instruments of environment protection planning. They are: quantification of environmental factors and linking data concerning the enviroment with regional statistic data, linking environmental criteria in decision models with technological, economic and social criteria, modelling antropogenic changes in the environment, including environmental factors in cost-benefit analysis. 3) It is indispensable to coordinate plans and activities of territorial and sectoral systems as far as environment development is concerned. 4) The decisive role in coordination of <b>operational</b> <b>character</b> should be given to regional organs of planning and management. 5) Prevention of environmental disturbance should be the main principle of environmental protection. 6) It is necessary to call into being an environmental inspection agency and give it regulatory authority. What way of incorporating environmental problems in the management systems would satisfy the necessary conditions of effective incorporation? The way presented below does not take all conditions into account. In order to ensure clarity of graphic presentation we limit ourselves to two conditions 3 and 4 which play an especially significant role in the author's conception therefore require emphasis.

40|$|Une méthodologie globale et cohérente de raisonnement de la {{valorisation}} du bois d'oeuvre d'une forêt donnée est développée. La méthodologie intègre les aspects techniques, économiques et stratégiques {{au niveau}} première transformation. Elle est développée en 5 étapes avec possibilités de feed-back : déterminer au plan technique quels types de produits peuvent être fabriqués, estimer la rentabilité par filière de première transformation (tranchage, déroulage, sciage), estimer la rentabilité par essence et par filière afin d'écarter celles nettement déficitaires, optimiser les procédés de transformation, sélectionner les filières en s'appuyant sur l'analyse économique et financière. Une étude de cas est réalisée sur une forêt au Cameroun. La poursuite de la recherche devrait s'attacher à obtenir une meilleure précision de l'évaluation de la ressource, intégrer des outils méthodologiques complémentaires, créer un support informatique et adapter la méthodologie à d'autres cas concrets. This work {{deals with the}} development of a methodology allowing to globally and consistently consider wood valorisation from a given forest resource. The methodology has been developed for the mostly encountered case in the Congo basin, where forest harvesting and wood processing activities are most often performed by the same company. This approach enables the integration of technical and economic specificity peculiar to each wood species and to logs quality, as weil as their consequences on productivity. Base on a well known of wood market, the competitiveness estimation of each kind of wood process by species and by production type, {{as well as in the}} specifie conditions of each project constitute a tool for decision making. This tool allows to structure the approach and simulate sorne of the strategie choices that have to be made. The proposed methodology is developing in five steps, with one or more possible feedback : The first step consists in analysing the technical consistence between the available resource and the products which can be produced : from the resource inventory (species, log quality [...] .) and from the corresponding wood properties, the type of wood products to be manufactured is deterrnined (technical requirements to be met related to intrinsic wood characteristics). The second step consists in performing a rough evaluation of the profitability of the targeted productions for each wood species. The aim is to eliminate non competitive productions and to deterrnine the processing costs of the remaining productions. The third step is a detailed estimation of the profitability by wood species and by production type. This enables the elimination of those of the species which should stay non competitive even after process optimisation. The fourth step corresponds to the use of methods for process optimisation. It is mainly based on the functional analysis concepts applied to wood processes. The fifth step allows the selection of the productions to be kept (slicing, peeling, softwoods sawing, hardwoods sawing [...] .), referring to economic and financial analysis of each type of them, completed by strategie aspects. In case of surrender of any type of production, a feedback allow to make a new evaluation ofthe allocation of the resource. The methodology is further applied to the concrete case of a 80 000 ha forest unit in eastern Cameroon. This work led to assess its <b>operational</b> <b>character</b> as a tool for decision making. Finally, the main limits and proposaIs for future research orientations are presented : absolute necessary increase in the accuracy ofresource evaluation (quantity and quality), development of a software for assistance and capitalisation, integration of recently developed methods and concepts from innovation management, from strategie decision making on marketed products, adaptation of the methodology to other types of forest sector organisation...|$|E
