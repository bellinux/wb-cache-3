5000|$|During the film, the {{audience}} dives deep into <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> children, who view every day, <b>the</b> poor representation <b>of</b> Latinos in <b>the</b> media. The {{children in the}} film claim that they {{have never seen a}} Hispanic superhero in the media and that all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonists</b> are white. One boy in the film refers to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonists</b> portrayed in <b>the</b> media as [...] "American". The boy calling all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonists</b> American shows <b>the</b> detachment that Latinos, and many other races or demographics, feel from the society and culture in America.|$|R

5|$|Thomas {{originally}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, featuring a male as the protagonist. He changed the gender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist</b> because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique. The original pilot script was darker in tone than the one filmed, and several details were changed. Although it ranked low in the ratings, the pilot was critically acclaimed and Bell's performance as the protagonist was praised.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Halo: The Flood {{cracked the}} Publishers Weekly Top Ten Bestsellers List for Paperbacks, but {{critical}} reception {{to the novel}} was less positive than Eric Nylund's Fall of Reach or other Halo novels. The repetitive fight scenes and dramatically different characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist</b> compared to Nylund's work were seen as major flaws, and Dietz's style of writing was alternatively praised and lambasted. The next Halo novel, , would serve {{to bridge the gap}} between Combat Evolved and its sequel, Halo 2.|$|E
5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist</b> of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E

5|$|After winning Miss India World, Chopra {{was cast}} as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), {{in which she was}} to make her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the {{production}} conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film Thamizhan as the love interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist,</b> played by Vijay. A review published in The Hindu was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|An {{announcement}} was made that Brosnan and director Martin Campbell will team up once again for a film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel, Across the River and into the Trees, in which Brosnan will play the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist,</b> Colonel Cantwell.

5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, Blue Shift is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Blue Shift does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist</b> and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{independent}} Hollywood producer Robert Lippert {{acquired the}} rights to Caligari from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called The Cabinet of Caligari, which was released in 1962. Screenwriter Robert Bloch {{did not intend to}} write a Caligari remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original Caligari except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist,</b> who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her psychiatrist, and he cures her {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh's seven-year-old son, Gautham Krishna, {{was chosen}} to play the younger version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist</b> in his Telugu cinema debut. According to Sukumar, Gautham looked like the actor did as a child. When the {{director}} approached Mahesh and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, Gautham Krishna was only six and they were apprehensive. His introduction scene was filmed silently by Peter Hein, since the boy was afraid of gunfire. Naveen Polisetty played a supporting role as Mahesh's friend in the film, and Vikram Singh was signed as an antagonist. Nassar, Pradeep Rawat, Kelly Dorji, Sayaji Shinde and Anu Hasan were cast in other supporting roles.|$|E

He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protagonist).</b> The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.|$|E
