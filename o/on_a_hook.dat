5|$|A {{civil war}} between Stephen and the Empress Matilda soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to rise up against Stephen, seizing Ludlow Castle. Stephen responded by taking an army into the Welsh Marches, where he {{attempted}} to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, Joce de Dinan, to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them. Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hook</b> thrown over the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained {{that he was the}} rightful owner of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself. Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around a few years {{before the end of the}} civil war in 1153. He ultimately left for the Levant, leaving Ludlow in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, and then, after Robert's death, his younger son, Hugh de Lacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hook</b> above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E

Styles defended the title against Abyss, Monty Brown, Sean Waltmanwho was {{revealed}} as the wildcard entrant earlier in the showand Jeff Jarrett's replacement Raven. In a King of the Mountain match, {{the objective is to}} climb a ladder and hang the championship belt <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hook</b> above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify. To qualify a wrestler must either pin or make another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. The match began with Waltman diving {{off the top of the}} penalty box onto Raven in the ring. Brown was the first to qualify by pinning Raven following his signature Pounce maneuver. Raven was then placed in the penalty box for two minutes. Waltman was later pinned by Brown following his signature Alpha Bomb, forcing Waltman to go to the penalty box. Raven was the next to qualify by pinning Styles on the outside of the ring following a Pounce by Brown. Styles was then forced to spend two minutes in the box. Later, Abyss pinned Brown after his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver, sending Brown to the box. Soon after, Styles qualified by pinning Abyss after forcing him through a table with his Spiral Tap maneuver. Waltman was the last to qualify by pinning Styles following his signature X-Factor maneuver off the top of a ladder.

25|$|A {{bolas spider}} is any of {{several species of}} orb-weaver spider that, instead of {{spinning}} the typical web, hunt by using a sticky 'capture blob' of silk {{on the end of}} a line, known as a 'bolas'. By swinging the bolas at flying male moths or moth flies nearby, the spider may snag its prey rather like a fisherman snagging a fish <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hook.</b> Because of this, they are also called angling or fishing spiders (although the remotely related genus Dolomedes is also called a fishing spider). The prey is lured to the spider by the production of up to three pheromone-analogues.|$|E

Today, artificial flies are tied {{with a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic materials (like mylar and rubber) to represent all manner of potential freshwater and saltwater fish prey to include aquatic and terrestrial insects, crustaceans, worms, baitfish, vegetation, flesh, spawn, small reptiles, amphibians, mammals and birds, etc.|$|E

25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hook.</b> Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|E

2500|$|Fly tying is {{a common}} {{practice}} in fly fishing, considered by many anglers {{an important part of}} the fly fishing experience. Many fly fishers tie their own flies, either following patterns in books, natural insect examples, or using their own imagination. The technique involves attaching small pieces of feathers, animal fur, and other materials <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hook</b> in order to make it attractive to fish. This is made by wrapping thread tightly around the hook and tying on the desired materials. [...] A fly is sized according to the width of the hook gap; large or longer flies are tied on larger, thicker, and longer hooks. The construction of tube flies is different in that the tier secures materials a tube rather than to a hook. These flies are rigged by passing the fishing line through the tube before attaching a hook.|$|E
