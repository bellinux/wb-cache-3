5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies.

5|$|Mutations in the TREM2 gene {{have been}} {{associated}} with a 3 to 5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>is,</b> as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.|$|E
