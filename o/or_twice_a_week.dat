5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered {{numerous}} samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence {{to be allowed}} to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games. Epstein rejected all of them; directing the merchandisers to Byrne instead, who was already in New York ensconced in The Drake Hotel on Park Avenue at 56th Street. Byrne rented expensive offices on Fifth Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were allowed to talk directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote the company name with use of his title. Eliot would later recall going to the Seltaeb office once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to draw $1,000 from petty cash.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{strategy}} of primal therapy has hardly {{changed from the}} early days. The therapy begins with an intensive three weeks of fifteen open-ended sessions with one therapist. After this, the patient joins group meetings with other patients and therapists once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> {{for as long as}} is needed. Private sessions are still available, though not every day. The length of time needed in formal therapy varies from person to person.|$|E
25|$|Sick with measles, Anna Vyrubova {{was arrested}} on 21 March 1917 and {{underwent}} five months of prison in the Peter and Paul Fortress, which included a medical examination to prove her virginity. The interrogation on her political role started on 6 May. Vyrubova admitted she saw Rasputin once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> but feigned a childish innocence. The investigator concluded that she was too naïve and unintelligent to have had any influence over the Tsarina.|$|E

25|$|The choir school {{continues}} {{and although}} originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls' Choir {{was founded in}} 2000 and sings once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick's Grammar School, which provides a secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils {{to be in the}} choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receive payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months' holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.|$|E

As with the reparation order, appointments must be kept (once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for {{the first three months of}} the order, and then weeks for the second three months, and fortnightly after that) and the young person must maintain a respectful and cooperative attitude.

2500|$|Braudel and Reynold {{have made}} a {{systematic}} study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. [...] Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> while daily markets were common in larger cities. Gradually over time, permanent shops with regular trading days began to supplant the periodic markets, while peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances– grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20–40 miles. Following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar– calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum [...] and coffee from the New World.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{supply in}} the Jordanian highlands, {{where most of the}} {{population}} lives, is generally intermittent. According to a 2008 study by the University of Michigan, water is delivered once a week in big cities like Amman and once every twelve days in some rural areas. According to a 2007 survey the mean rate of supply per week was 1.5 days in Madaba governorate, 2.9 days in Balqa governorate and 3.2 days in Zarqa governorate. In Amman, [...] according to the water distribution plan of Miyahuna, 8 out of 44 main distribution zones received continuous water supply [...] "except in emergency cases" [...] in 2012. Most other distribution zones were scheduled to receive water for either once a week for 24 hours <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for a total of 36–48 hours. To what extent actual supply follows the distribution program, especially during summer, is not clear. Since the Disi-Amman Conveyor became operational in summer 2013 the continuity of supply in Amman has increased.|$|E

There were, he urged, plenty of trout in the river near his father's ranch, though it was very seldom he had leisure to go after them. They wandered on some distance beside the water, which ran almost west toward the Pacific, and wherever the forest was a little thinner the slanting sunrays streaming between the serried trunks smote along it.

40|$|Background: Hypertrophic and {{contracture}} scars {{are common}} problems after burn injuries and cause functional and cosmetic deformities. A {{wide variety of}} treatments has been advocated for postburn pathologic scars regression. Unfortunately, the reported efficacy has been variable. Objectives: To investigate the use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), which mainly targets the fibroblasts in scar tissue, as an effective modality for scar treatment in burn patients. Materials and Methods: An experimental study with ESWT was performed in 16 patients with postburn scars contractures, hypertrophic scars, <b>or</b> keloids <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for 6 weeks. Digital photographs were obtained and visual analogue scales were completed before and after treatment. Results: Already after the first session, scars appeared more pliable, and color mismatch was less evident.

Conclusions: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is a feasible and cost‐effective treatment in the management of postburn pathologic scars...|$|R
40|$|From 1978 to 1985, 297 {{patients}} were entered in a double‐blind randomized trial comparing levamisole to placebo as adjuvant therapy of Dukes' C {{carcinoma of the}} colon. Therapy consisted of from two to five tablets of 50 mg levamisole (<b>or</b> placebo) <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> depending on bodyweight for 1 year. Levamisole was generally well tolerated, with only four reversible cases of agranulocytosis reported among 129 patients. The trial failed to show a benefit of levamisole on disease‐free survival (P = 0 · 53) or on survival (P = 0 · 35). There {{was no difference between}} the two treatment groups in terms of number of disease relapses, sites of relapse, or time to relapse. The proportion of patients still alive at 5 years was 51 per cent (standard error, 5 · 5 per cent) in the levamisole group versus 39 per cent (standard error, 5 · 4 per cent) in the placebo group.
