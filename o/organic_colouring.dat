40|$|The red {{shades of}} 13 icons (15 th- 17 th century) of the Cretan School of {{iconography}} are investigated in detail {{to identify the}} inorganic and <b>organic</b> <b>colouring</b> materials comprising the paint layers. Examination of sample cross-sections is performed with optical microscopy. Micro-Raman spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a photodiode array detector are employed for {{the identification of the}} inorganic and <b>organic</b> <b>colouring</b> materials, respectively. The results reveal the extensive use of coccid dyes by the Cretan painters: kermes (Kermes vermilio Planchon) is found in icons dated before the middle 16 th century and cochineal in icons created several decades after the discovery of the New World. Other dyestuffs detected in the historical samples are madder(possibly Rubia tinctorum L., according to HPLC profiles), soluble redwood and indigoid dyes. Organic dyes were used by the painters as exclusive colouring matters (or glazes) or in mixtures with inorganic pigments, such as red ochre. cinnabar, minium, azurite lead white and carbon black. Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) coupled to a negative electrospray ionization mode is employed to provide information on the identity of some unknown colouring components, of the aforementioned dyes, detected in the historical samples. The results suggest that (i) the type B compound (also known as Bra') is a dehydro-brazilein product and (ii) the deprotonated molecular ion of the type C compound corresponds to m/z = 243. Both compounds are commonly used as markers for the identification of soluble redwood in historical samples. LC-MS analysis of cochineal shows that the dcIV and dcVlI components are isomeric with carminic acid, as it has been recently suggested. Finally, LC-MS is employed to identify and record kermesic and flavokermesic acid in kermes and rubiadin in wild madder. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of synthetic {{dyes and pigments}} into commerce in the late 19 th century was a stimulating time for experimental scientists in their laboratory formulations and for artists in their usage. Nowadays, the period of pioneering syntheses and employment of synthetic <b>organic</b> <b>colouring</b> materials is highly intriguing for scientific research and for conservation purposes in heritage science. In this work, a combination of spectroscopic and chromatographic methods has permitted the elucidation of the chemical composition of 16 early synthetic organic pigment powders from the Lefranc experimental laboratory collection dating 1890 - 1914. It can be hypothesized that the most successful of these formulations could have been finalized in paint tubes and released onto the market, meaning that they may even be found in artworks from the same period.

40|$|White hybrid inorganic/organic {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) were fabricated by combining a novel <b>organic</b> <b>colour</b> converter {{with a blue}} inorganic LED. An organic small molecule was specifically synthesised to act as down-converter. The characteristics of the white colour were controlled by changing the concentration of the organic molecule based on the BODIPY unit, which was embedded in a transparent matrix, and volume of the molecule and encapsulant mixture. The concentration has a critical effect on the conversion efficiency, i. e. {{how much of the}} absorbed blue light is converted into yellow light. With increasing concentration the conversion efficiency decreases. This quenching effect is due to aggregation of the organic molecule at higher concentrations. Increasing the deposited amount of the converter does not increase the yellow emission despite more blue light being absorbed. Degradation of the organic converter was also observed during a period of 15 months from LED fabrication. Angular-dependent measurements revealed slight deviation from a Lambertian profile for the blue and yellow emission peaks leading to a small change in "whiteness" with emission angle. Warm white and cool white light with correlated colour temperatures of 2770 K and 7680 K, respectively, were achieved using different concentrations of the converter molecule. Although further work is needed to improve the lifetime and poor colour rendering, these hybrid LEDs show promising results as an alternative approach for generating white LEDs compared with phosphor-based white LEDs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Raw {{surface and}} ground waters used for {{drinking}} purposes can vary markedly in their {{chemical and biological}} composition. Inorganic content (such as salt, bicarbonate, clay and metal ions), organic content (natural organic matter and anthropogenic compounds, including pollutants) and micro-organisms present in raw water are key drivers for treatment processes that provide for safe and aesthetically acceptable drinking water. Conventional treatment at large scale water treatment plants (WTP) {{involves the use of}} inorganic coagulants to remove turbidity and colour, and more recently to maximise removal of organic compounds. The basis for the latter is to minimise the concentration of organics in treated water that leads to lower levels of disinfection by-products (post chlorination) and substrates for microbial growth in the water distribution system. Maximising removal of organic matter using inorganic coagulants is impacted by the character and concentration of the organics, the turbidity and alkalinity of the raw water. Removal of organics is also influenced by the type of coagulant used, its dose rate and the pH at which coagulation occurs. To date, few {{attempts have been made to}} model the relationships between raw water quality parameters and the use of coagulants and pH control reagents for removal of <b>organics,</b> <b>colour</b> and turbidity.

40|$|The {{removal of}} <b>colour,</b> <b>organics</b> and {{phosphorus}} from {{pulp and paper}} mill effluent {{and the development of}} colour of the wastewater were investigated. These contaminants are considered {{to be the most important}} due to their resistance over common treatment applied by the mill. Two approaches, adsorption and coagulation, were chosen for investigation of the removal of <b>colour,</b> <b>organics</b> and phosphorus from aqueous discharges of a bisulphite pulp and paper mill. Additionally, the colour generation induced by UV irradiation of the treated effluents was investigated. This study was carried out to explore the possibility of UV-induced colour development of the effluent over the long term and to characterize the colour producing species from the wastewater. Cheap and highly abundant brown coal (or lignite) was utilized as adsorbent for <b>colour,</b> phosphorus, and <b>organics</b> from the industrial effluent. Knowledge on the mechanism of brown coal adsorption, selectivity, the effect of pre-treatment and physical properties of brown coal is crucial for the future application of brown coal in the water industry. The mechanism of brown coal adsorption was investigated using various brown coal samples differing in physical and chemical composition and two model dye solutions, cationic (safranin) and anionic (alizarin red) dyes. The capacities of some brown coals (Loy Yang high Na and Yallourn) were higher than commercial coal-based activated carbon. However, the adsorption capacities of all brown coal samples for an anionic dye were very low, less than 3 % of that for activated carbon. This result reveals the potential of brown coal to remove positively charged contaminants from aqueous solutions and suggests cation-exchange as the major mechanism involved. Effects of brown coal pre-treatment, drying and washing, were investigated. The equilibrium adsorption data were analysed using the two most popular adsorption isotherms, Langmuir and Freundlich. The Langmuir isotherm fitted most adsorption data of brown coal better than the Freundlich isotherm, supporting the concept of monolayer adsorption and the role of chemical adsorption in the mechanism. When applied to actual wastewater from a magnesium bisulphite pulp and paper mill, brown coal exhibited multi-component adsorption of <b>colour,</b> <b>organics</b> and phosphorus from the solution. Brown coal showed an ability to remove phosphorus from the wastewater, which could not be achieved with activated carbon; yet brown coal had significantly lower adsorption capacities for <b>colour</b> and <b>organics</b> than did activated carbon. This can be explained by the nature of <b>organics</b> and <b>colour</b> that carried negative charge in the wastewater as indicated by the zeta potential analysis. Another powerful technique for organic removal, coagulation, was then chosen to significantly reduce <b>colour</b> and <b>organics</b> content of the effluent. Coagulation using trivalent salts was selected to efficiently remove <b>colour,</b> <b>organics</b> and total phosphorus in the treated and untreated wastewater solution. Selectivity of salt-induced coagulation was achieved and showed the following trend of removal efficiency: colour ~ total phosphorus > TOC. The removal of colour and total phosphorus from concentrated pulp mill effluents were above 90 %. The coagulation method was proven to be superior for the remediation of both treated and untreated effluent from pulp and paper industry. However, a small amount of <b>colour</b> and <b>organics</b> still persisted in the wastewater which may lead to colour development after treatment at the collecting discharge point. The Photometric Dispersion Analyzer (PDA) and Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) techniques were utilised to study the coagulation kinetics of the wastewater upon addition of salt. The involvement of fast aggregation and adsorption in the coagulation mechanism were revealed. The high critical coagulation concentration (CCC) and the significant role of trivalent salts in the coagulation process indicated the involvement of complexation reactions prior to coagulation. In coagulation, pH was also found to be a dominant factor affecting efficiency. The UV-induced colour generation of the effluent from pulp and paper industry was studied using UV-irradiation at 302 nm and 254 nm. Lignin derived compounds were suspected to be responsible for colour growth of pulp and paper wastewater. Three model compounds, lignosulfonic acid, humic acid and vanillin, were selected and studied as comparison. The yellowing rate of the wastewater solution was found to be similar to that of the model lignosulfonic acid solution supporting the occurrence of lignin compounds in the wastewater. The yellowing rate of humic acid was lower than the wastewater solution, but the yellowing rate for vanillin was significantly higher than that of the wastewater solution. The irradiation products were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), UV spectroscopy, Electrospray Mass Spectrometry (ES-MS), Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The mechanism of wastewater yellowing upon irradiation was suspected to mimic the mechanism of photo-yellowing of paper. The result also suggested that UV-induced chemical reactions may be important in the aqueous discharge of pulp and paper mill effluent that could potentially enhance its colour...|$|R

His palette is rather of a chill and covered colour combination which can occasionally light up, but always will be well-balanced in the picture square. His realistic sceneries become increasingly a two-dimensional line tangle and then change to open drip-colour surfaces. Only bit by bit he develops his very own forms, space and depth reappear with abstract techniques, he cites and combines his styles, materials and forms, easily combines his soft endless line in the late 60 s years with colour field painting. His often puzzling techniques which proves a masterly understanding of materials and surfaces is connected with an exact and clean implementation. Even where a picture seems torn or experimental, it is based on a planned, controlled action. Kubicek formulated in 1945 : „ I strive for law and order in colour, in space, work of the intellect in paint“ - which explains the clarity of his compositions. The Russian cultural officer Alexander Dymschitz in his infamous article about Formalism in 1948 compared Juro Kubicek’s work in a negative fashion with that of Pablo Picasso and Karl Hofer. These comparisons may be a little far fetched, but from the perspective of the art historians Juro Kubicek’s painting should be placed among that of his peers and friends in Berlin, like Heinz Trökes, Hans Thiemann, Hannah Höch or Jeanne Mammen...|$|R
40|$|<b>Organic</b> dyes and <b>colouring</b> textile {{agents are}} {{persistent}} pollutant {{materials that are}} difficult to decompose by microbiological treatment processes. Their oxidation through photocatalysis is an alternative way to prevent contamination of the environment. In this work, calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (HAP) was synthesized and doped with different amounts of titanium. The performance capability of prepared catalyst to degrade methylene blue dye (MB) in aqueous heterogeneous solutions has been demonstrated. The main parameters which govern the photocatalytic treatment efficiency, such as titanium amount in HAP, initial concentration of MB, amount of the catalyst added to solution, UV-irradiation period and bubbling oxygen have been investigated. Photodegradation of  MB is found to be effective with HAP/Ti 11 % in oxygenated medium. However, pH has no significant effect on the yield of discoloration.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} different methods for determining <b>organic</b> matter and <b>colour</b> in water. Most of organic compounds in water have a humic substance. These substances frequently form complexes with iron. Humic matter gives water a yellow-brownish colour. Water filtration through conventional sand filters does not remove <b>colour</b> and <b>organic</b> compounds, and therefore complicated water treatment methods shall be applied. The methods utilized for organic matter determination in water included research on total organic carbon, permanganate index and the bichromate number of UV absorption of 254 nm wave length. The obtained results showed the greatest dependence between water colour and permanganate index. However, UV adsorption {{could be used}} for organic matter determination during the operation of a water treatment plant and the start-up of plants as easy and fast methods.

40|$|Textile {{industry}} is {{considered as one}} of the largest generators of toxic chemical wastewater in Malaysia. Textile industries consume large volumes of water and chemicals for wet processing. Considering both volumes discharged and effluent composition, the wastewater generated by the textile {{industry is}} rated as the most polluting among all industrial sectors. The waste from the industrial wastewater can damage sewers and interfere with the operation of treatment plants. Textile wastewater includes a large variety of dyes and chemicals additions that make the environmental challenge for textile industry not only as liquid waste but also in its chemical composition. The biological treatment method has been proven effective and {{that can be used for}} various types of wastewater including recalcitrant chemical wastewater. Anaerobic technologies are a well-established technology that has significant advantages over other technologies available for textile wastewater treatment. Biological methods are generally cheap and simple to apply and are currently used to remove <b>organics</b> and <b>colour</b> from dyeing and textile wastewater. The aim of the project is to apply Bovine Rectal Bacteria (BRB) for treatments of textile wastewater with the removal of contaminants are focused on Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Sulphate (SO 4) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO.) It is expected that bovine rectal bacteria are able to remove the quantified contaminants in textile wastewater and thus promoting a green technology in wastewater treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a new}} inorganic pigment Bi 1. 5 Zn 0. 5 Ce 2 O 7 is reported. The pigment was prepared by conventional solid-state reaction (SSR), suspension mixing (SM) and precipitation reaction (PR) {{with the goal of}} creating an environmentally benign pigment. The selected samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Focusing on pigmentary applications, specific properties of the samples were evaluated, such as colour parameters and particle size distribution. Dark yellow hues were obtained by using SSR and SM after the application samples into the organic binder in mass tone. The PR method was found to be the most suitable for the formation of dark yellow shades in the ceramic glaze. Based on obtained results, Bi 1. 5 Zn 0. 5 Ce 2 O 7 could be considered as a perspective yellow pigment for <b>colouring</b> <b>organic</b> binder systems and ceramic glaze...|$|R
