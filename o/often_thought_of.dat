5|$|In {{addition}} to specific forms of poems, poetry is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{in terms of}} different genres and subgenres. A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics. Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.|$|E
5|$|The Bayreuth canon {{consists}} of those operas by the German composer Richard Wagner (1813–1883) {{that have been}} performed at the Bayreuth Festival. The festival, which {{is dedicated to the}} staging of these works, was founded by Wagner in 1876 in the Bavarian town of Bayreuth, and has continued under the directorship of his family since his death. Although it was not originally held annually, it has taken place in July and August every year since the 75th anniversary season in 1951. Its venue is the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which was built for the first festival. Attendance at the festival is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a pilgrimage made by Wagner aficionados.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} age of the figure are unclear. It is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an ancient construction, though the {{earliest}} mention of it dates to the late 17th century. Early antiquarians associated it, on little evidence, with a Saxon deity, while other scholars sought to identify it with a Celtic British figure of the Greek Hercules or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. The lack of earlier descriptions leads some modern scholars to conclude that it probably dates from the 17th century, and perhaps originated as political satire.|$|E

5|$|Kipandjikusmin {{later wrote}} to Ekspres {{magazine}} that his goal {{in writing the}} short story was to expose the corruption in Sukarno's government, focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so, yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed. He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin, writing that he had <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic heaven as being similar to the Javanese Kahyangan, with God being similar to Batara Guru. His depictions of Muhammad and Gabriel transforming into eagles were influenced by images of Christ as the Lamb of God. It was originally {{meant to be a}} serial, and Jassin had already received the second instalment by the time the controversy began.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting that it might not have been there at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to it across the ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} practising Catholics {{probably}} continued to reduce {{in the seventeenth}} century and the organisation of the Church deteriorated. Some were to convert to Roman Catholicism, as did John Ogilvie (1569–1615), who went on to be ordained a priest in 1610, later being hanged for proselytism in Glasgow and <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as the only Scottish Catholic martyr of the Reformation era. An Irish Franciscan mission in the 1620s and 1630s claimed large numbers of converts, but these were confined to the Western Isles and had little impact on the mainland. A college for the education of Scots clergy was opened at Madrid in 1633, and was afterwards moved to Valladolid. In 1653 the remaining five or six clergy were incorporated under William Ballantine as prefect of the mission. There were a small number of Jesuits active in Strathgrass from the 1670s. The Pope appointed Thomas Nicolson as the first Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694 and the situation of Catholicism began to improve. Nicholson divided Scotland into districts, each with its own designated priests and he undertook visitations to ensure the implementation of Papal legislation. In 1700 his Statuta Missionis, which included a code of conduct for priests and laymen, were approved by all the clergy. By 1703 there were 33 Catholic clergy.|$|E

25|$|These {{years of}} trench warfare in the West saw no major exchanges of {{territory}} and, as a result, are <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as static and unchanging. However, throughout this period, British, French, and German tactics constantly evolved {{to meet new}} battlefield challenges.|$|E
25|$|The New Covenant is {{a biblical}} {{interpretation}} originally {{derived from a}} phrase in the Book of Jeremiah, in the Hebrew Scriptures. It is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an eschatological Messianic Age or world to come and {{is related to the}} biblical concept of the Kingdom of God.|$|E
50|$|The {{song was}} copyrighted in 1937, {{as part of}} the Starlit Crown collection, and was renewed in 1965. It is <b>often</b> erroneously <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a folk hymn or as being in the Public Domain.|$|R

Howard left Hutchinson Tyres in August 1924 to set up HRD Motors, which survived for just over three years.|$|E
25|$|Superman {{has come}} to be seen as an American {{cultural}} icon. Superman is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as the first superhero. This point is debated by historians: Doctor Occult, an earlier creation of Siegel and Shuster, appeared in comic books two years earlier, and the Phantom and Mandrake the Magician had previously appeared in newspaper strips. However, there is no debate that Superman started the 20th century's craze for costumed adventurers.|$|E
25|$|During {{and after}} the Enlightenment, Western European {{cultures}} showed much interest in the Circassians, specifically their physical appearance, language and culture, portraying the men as especially courageous (a legend that became especially popular {{in the court of}} London during the Crimean War when they were allies with Circassia). Circassians were <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as being especially beautiful, having curly black hair, light eyes and pale white skin (generally somewhat close to their actual appearance), giving rise to the phenomenon of Circassian Beauties.|$|E

25|$|If a {{being is}} accidentally omnipotent, it can resolve the paradox by {{creating}} a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, {{it is possible for}} an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, {{of whether or not the}} being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power. On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.|$|E
25|$|Typology {{is based}} on a view of the world {{familiar}} from Plato's metaphysics called essentialism. Essentialism is the idea that the world is divided into real, discontinuous and immutable ‘kinds’. This idea is the basis for most typological constructions, particularly of stone artefacts where essential forms are <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as ‘mental templates’, or combinations of traits that are favoured by the maker. Variation in artifact form and attributes is seen {{as a consequence of the}} imperfect realization of the template, and is usually attributed to differences in raw material properties or individuals' technical competences.|$|E
25|$|Narrowing {{competition}} in existing markets. Where markets already exist, {{there is the}} propensity for the narrowing of competition, if certain PGS applications are accepted. The state – instead of absolving all responsibility (<b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as occurring in a neoliberal economy) – is tied {{with the task of}} carefully controlling the market. Product price fixing, supermarket consolidation, labour control, and profit-channelling are all potential issues. Within the UK, the Competition Commission is charged with investigating regulatory powers vis-à-vis markets and company mergers, to prevent (or at least temper) such problems.|$|E

25|$|A discrete-time {{random process}} {{involves}} {{a system which}} is in a certain state at each step, with the state changing randomly between steps. The steps are <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as moments in time, but they can equally well refer to physical distance or any other discrete measurement. Formally, the steps are the integers or natural numbers, and the random process is a mapping of these to states. The Markov property states that the conditional probability distribution for the system at the next step (and in fact at all future steps) depends only on {{the current state of}} the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.|$|E
25|$|The early {{versions}} of Windows are <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as graphical shells, mostly because they ran {{on top of}} MS-DOS and use it for file system services. However, even the earliest Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions; notably, having their own executable file format and providing their own device drivers (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound). Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through cooperative multitasking. Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allows it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce; data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of a shift in low positions, the thumb of the left hand moves up or down the neck of the {{instrument}} so as to remain in the same position relative to the fingers (though the movement of the thumb may occur slightly before, or slightly after, the movement of the fingers). In such positions, the thumb is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an 'anchor' whose location defines what position the player is in. In very high positions, the thumb is unable to move with the fingers as the body of the instrument gets in the way. Instead, the thumb works around the neck of the instrument to sit at {{the point at which the}} neck meets the right bout of the body, and remains there while the fingers move between the high positions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} a street {{was named after}} him in his {{hometown}} of Schellinkhout, but he is otherwise little known in his home country, where the name Jan Mayen is <b>often</b> <b>thought</b> to be <b>of</b> Norwegian origin.|$|R

50|$|A rate (or ratio) may <b>often</b> be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an output-input ratio, benefit-cost ratio, all {{considered}} in the broad sense. For example, miles per hour in transportation is the output (or benefit) in terms of miles of travel, which one gets from spending an hour (a cost in time) of traveling (at this velocity).|$|R
