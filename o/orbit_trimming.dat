The propulsion {{system is a}} high thrust, monomethyl hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide bipropellant system for larger maneuvers and a lower thrust hydrazine monopropellant system for minor orbital corrections during the mission. Of the bipropellant thrusters, four located on the aft, provide 490 newtons of thrust for course corrections, control of the spacecraft during the Mars orbital insertion maneuver and large orbit corrections during the mission; another four, located on {{along the sides of}} the spacecraft, provide 22 newtons for controlling roll maneuvers. Of the hydrazine thrusters, eight provide 4.5 newtons to control <b>orbit</b> <b>trim</b> maneuvers; another eight provide 0.9 newtons for offsetting, or [...] "desaturating", the reaction wheels.

This brought the number of propulsive maneuvers for VO- 1 to 23. Total accumulated operating time for the rocket engine was 2896 seconds, representing a total impulse of 3. 93 x 10 to the 6 th N-sec. The estimated propellant remaining was sufficient to operate the rocket engine for an additional 30 seconds. VO- 1 has completed more than 1700 days in space, 1400 days in orbit around Mars and {{more than two years}} of attitude control system operation with helium gas transferred from the propulsion system pressurant tank.

Modifications have been incorporated into the rocket engine to increase the cooling margin for the 2700 -second Mars orbit insertion burn. This capability has been demonstrated in both engine firings and subsystem tests. A new surface tension device has been developed to position the propellants (N 2 O 4 and MMH) over the tank outlets during zero-g flight.

40|$|Aerobraking {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} means of increasing the science payload for planetary orbiting missions and/or for enabling the use of less expensive launch vehicles. Though aerobraking has numerous benefits, large operations cost have been required to maintain the aerobraking time line without violating aerodynamic heating or other constraints. Two operations functions have been performed on an orbit by orbit basis to estimate atmospheric properties relevant to aerobraking. The Navigation team typically solves for an atmospheric density scale factor using DSN tracking data and the atmospheric modeling team uses telemetric accelerometer data to recover atmospheric density profiles. After some effort, decisions are made about the need for <b>orbit</b> <b>trim</b> maneuvers to adjust periapsis altitude to stay within the aerobraking corridor. Autonomous aerobraking would reduce the need for many ground based tasks. To be successful, atmospheric modeling must be performed on the vehicle in near real time.

40|$|The Cassini Grand Finale Mission, which {{consists}} of 22 ballistic orbits, will begin on April 22, 2017 after the last targeted Titan flyby. It will end on September 15, 2017 when the spacecraft dives into Saturn's atmosphere and be permanently captured. High volumes of unique science data from various onboard instruments are expected from the mission. To ensure its success and facilitate science planning, the trajectory dispersion needs to be controlled below 250 km (root-mean-square spatial deviation at the 68 th percentile level) for a few segments of trajectory in the mission. This paper reports the formulation and solution of this dispersion control problem. We consider various sources of uncertainties including flyby error, orbit determination error, maneuver execution error, thruster firing control error, and uncertainty in Saturn's atmospheric model. A non-linear Monte Carlo Trajectory Dispersion tool is developed and employed for the analysis.

40|$|The International Cometary Explorer (ICE) {{encounter}} with Comet Giacobini-Zinner took place 7 {{years after the}} spacecraft's original launch on 12 August 1978 as the International Sun Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE- 3), part of a three-spacecraft project to study {{the interaction between the}} solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere. Transfer to an interplanetary trajectory was performed via a 119 -km-altitute, gravity-assist, lunar swingby on December 1983. Navigation support during interplanetary cruise and comet encounter was provided by orbit determination utilizing radio metric data from the DSN 64 -meter antennas in Goldstone, California and Madrid, Spain. Orbit solutions yielding predictions of 50 -km geocentric delivery accuracy in the target aim plane were achieved during interplanetary cruise and at comet encounter using 6 -to- 12 -week data arcs between periodic attitude-change maneuvers. One-sigma two-way range and range rate residuals were consistently 40 meters and 0. 2 mm/s or better, respectively. Non-gravitational forces affected the comet's motion during late August and early September 1985 and caused a 2300 -km shift in the orbit of the comet relative to the spacecraft. This necessitated a final ICE <b>orbit</b> <b>trim</b> maneuver 3 days prior to encounter. Near-real-time assessment of two-way 2 -GHz (S-band) Doppler pseudo-residuals during the June and July 1985 trajectory change maneuvers aided in calibration of the spacecraft's thrusters in preparation for this final critical maneuver.

40|$|The Odyssey {{spacecraft}} {{has been}} in Mars orbit since October 24, 2001 and has nearly completed 61, 490 orbits. Navigation operational objectives include the following: Control the local mean solar time for science observations; {{for most of the}} mission, this varied from 3 : 45 pm to 5 : 20 pm. Currently, an <b>orbit</b> <b>trim</b> maneuver planned for November 10, 2015 will place Odyssey at 6 : 45 pm/ 6 : 45 am at equator crossings in order to observe early morning ground frost, fog and clouds. Initially, Odyssey was late by 42 minutes for an over-flight of the critical seven minutes of Phoenix's entry, descent and landing (EDL). Odyssey was successfully positioned for this over-flight using the Delta V from angular momentum desaturations (AMD). Similar results for the Mars Science Laboratory's EDL and Comet Siding Spring's minimum risk location will be presented. Odyssey has and continues to relay significant quantities of rover data. Navigation successfully models frequent AMD Delta Vs in order to generate accurate sixty-day trajectory predictions; a typical timing error is 25 seconds after 60 days. However, unexpected events, such as safe-mode entries with their larger and more frequent thrusting, severely impact that trajectory accuracy. Impacted trajectories can have timing errors ranging from a few minutes to ten-to-fifteen minutes after sixty-days. Other analyses (briefly stated) include: a) the offset of the orbital ground track pattern after an initial cycle of 30 days or 362 orbits and b) an operations environment of continuous thrusting if/when one of the three remaining reaction wheels fails...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology for accurate and flight-calibrated {{determination of the}} on-times of the Cassini spacecraft Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters, without any form of dynamic simulation, for the reaction wheel biases. The hydrazine usage and the delta V vector in body frame are also computed from the respective thruster on-times. The Cassini spacecraft, {{the largest and most}} complex interplanetary spacecraft ever built, continues to undertake ambitious and unique scientific observations of planet Saturn, Titan, Enceladus, and other moons of Saturn. In order to maintain a stable attitude during the course of its mission, this three-axis stabilized spacecraft uses two different control systems: the RCS and the reaction wheel assembly control system. The RCS is used to execute a commanded spacecraft slew, to maintain three-axis attitude control, control spacecraft's attitude while performing science observations with coarse pointing requirements, e. g. during targeted low-altitude Titan and Enceladus flybys, bias the momentum of reaction wheels, and to perform RCS-based <b>orbit</b> <b>trim</b> maneuvers. The use of RCS often imparts undesired delta V on the spacecraft. The Cassini navigation team requires accurate predictions of the delta V in spacecraft coordinates and inertial frame resulting from slews using RCS thrusters and more importantly from reaction wheel bias events. It is crucial for the Cassini spacecraft attitude control and navigation teams to be able to, quickly but accurately, predict the hydrazine usage and delta V for various reaction wheel bias events without actually having to spend time and resources simulating the event in flight software-based dynamic simulation or hardware-in-the-loop simulation environments. The methodology described in this paper, and the ground software developed thereof, are designed to provide just that. This methodology assumes a priori knowledge of thrust magnitudes and thruster pulse rise and tail-off time constants for eight individual attitude control thrusters, the spacecraft's wet mass and its center of mass location, and a few other key parameters...|$|R
40|$|The Cassini {{spacecraft}} dynamics-related telemetry during long Main Engine (ME) burns {{has indicated}} {{the presence of}} stable limit cycles between 0. 03 - 0. 04 Hz frequencies. These stable limit cycles cause the spacecraft to possess non-zero oscillating rates for extended periods of time. This indicates that the linear ME guidance control system does not model the complete dynamics of the spacecraft. In this study, we propose that the observed limit cycles in the spacecraft dynamics telemetry appear from a stable interaction between the unmodeled nonlinear elements in the ME guidance control system. Many nonlinearities in the control system emerge from translating the linear engine gimbal actuator (EGA) motion into a spacecraft rotation. One such nonlinearity comes from the gear backlash in the EGA system, which {{is the focus of}} this paper. The limit cycle characteristics and behavior can be predicted by modeling this gear backlash nonlinear element via a describing function and studying the interaction of this describing function with the overall dynamics of the spacecraft. The linear ME guidance controller and gear backlash nonlinearity are modeled analytically. The frequency, magnitude, and nature of the limit cycle are obtained from the frequency response of the ME guidance controller and nonlinear element. In addition, the ME guidance controller along with the nonlinearity is simulated. The simulation response contains a limit cycle with similar characterstics as predicted analytically: 0. 03 - 0. 04 Hz frequency and stable, sustained oscillations. The analytical and simulated limit cycle responses are compared to the flight telemetry for long burns such as the Saturn Orbit Insertion and Main Engine <b>Orbit</b> <b>Trim</b> Maneuvers. The analytical and simulated limit cycle characteristics compare well with the actual observed limit cycles in the flight telemetry. Both have frequencies between 0. 03 - 0. 04 Hz and stable oscillations.

The Termination experiment (extension of September [...] "Windmill" [...] experiment) design was expected to result in final loss of the spacecraft due to a negative power margin. This {{was not a problem}} since spacecraft power would have been too low to sustain operations {{in the next few weeks}} due to continuing solar cell loss.Thus, a final controlled experiment was designed to maximize mission return. This final, low altitude was necessary to study the effects of a carbon dioxide atmosphere.The final OTM took the periapsis to 139.7 km where the sensible drag on the spacecraft was very evident. The solar panel temperatures rose to 126 deg. C. and the attitude control system fired all available Y-axis thrusters to counteract the torques. However, attitude control was maintained to the end.The main bus voltage dropped to 24.7 volts after five orbits, and it was predicted that attitude control would be lost if the power dropped below 24 volts. It was decided to enhance the Windmill experiment by changing the panel angles for the remaining orbits. This was also a preplanned experiment option.At this point, the spacecraft was expected to survive only two orbits.Magellan continued to maintain communication for three more orbits, even though the power continued to drop below 23 volts and eventually reached 20.4 volts. At this time, one battery went off-line, and the spacecraft was defined as power starved.Communication was lost at 3:02 AM PDT just as Magellan was about to enter an Earth occultation on orbit 15032. Contact was not re-established. Tracking operations were continued to 11:00 AM but no signal was seen, and none was expected.
