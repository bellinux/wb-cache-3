We disagree with the basic premise, Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman (and she did have a one-night stand with Leslie on New Year’s Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We don’t want her already messy love life in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was killed wasn’t sure she was even queer and then left her for another woman). We don’t want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> whispers evil suggestions into {{the hearts of the}} people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E
25|$|At {{the formal}} {{presentation}} of the peace proposal by Krishna in the Kuru Mahasabha, at the court of Hastinapur, Krishna asked Duryodhana to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas and restore the status quo; or, if not, give over at least five villages, {{one for each of}} the Pandavas. Duryodhana said he would not give land even as much as tip of a needle to the Pandavas. Krishna's peace proposals were ignored & dismissed, and Duryodhana publicly ordered his soldiers, even after the warnings from all the elders, to arrest Krishna. Krishna laughed and displayed his divine form, radiating intense light. Lord Krishna cursed Duryodhana that his downfall was certain at the hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was sworn to tear off his thigh, to the shock of the blind king, who tried to pacify the Lord with as words to calm as he could find. His peace mission utterly insulted by Duryodhana, Krishna returned to the Pandava camp at Upaplavya to inform the Pandavas that the only course left to uphold the principles of virtue and righteousness was inevitable - war. During the course of his return, Krishna met Karna, Kunti's firstborn(before Yudhishthira) and requested him to help his brothers & fight on the side of dharma. However, being helped by Duryodhana, Karna said to Krishna that he would battle against Pandavas as he had a debt to pay.|$|E

40|$|Aim: <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} is to {{identify}} <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young suicide attempts. Method: 31 youngsters who have attempted to commit suicide were interviewed after 2 to 7 days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attempt and an interview form that was prepared by the researchers to examine <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> demographics and suicide attempts was used. Results: Girls' suicide attempts are twice as much as <b>the</b> boys'. 19 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases (61. 3 %) have attempted suicide before. The most frequent method is overdose medication. There rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> had suicide ideation before the attempt is 77. 4 %, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> had a suicide plan before the attempt is 48. 4 %, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> thought about <b>the</b> possible results <b>of</b> this attempt is 25. 8 %. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> talked about suicide thoughts is 38. 7 %. 12. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attempters had applied for help to a psycholog or psychiatrist. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> had self-destructivelrisky behaviors is 67. 7 %. In 83. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases an event that triggers the suicide attempt is found. When <b>the</b> reasons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suicide attempts are analyzed, it is seen that 74. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases think that they could not deal with the problems they have and that death is the only salvation. Discussion: Considering <b>the</b> high rate <b>of</b> suicide attempts in the young people who have previous suicide attempt or who have self-destructive-risky behaviors, they need to be approached more carefully and be taken under early psychiatric follow- up and treatment. Young suicide attempts generally occur rather impulsively, by <b>the</b> triggering effect <b>of</b> a negative life event without thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible results. The most common reason found in this study and supported by another study is to see death as a way of salvation by thinking that the problems cannot be coped with. As a result, as the young people are intolerant with problems and lack problem solving and coping skills, for treatment and prevention of suicides, problem solving skills and coping skills can be gained to the individuals...|$|R

2500|$|Rav and Samuel offered {{different}} {{explanations of}} the words in [...] "And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made He a woman."

In support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> said it was a face, [...] says, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me." [...] The one who said it was a tail explained the words, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me," [...] as Rabbi Ammi said, that humankind was [...] "behind," [...] that is, later, in the work of creation, and [...] "before" [...] in punishment. The Gemara conceded that humankind was last in the work of creation, for God created humankind {{on the eve of the}} Sabbath. But if when saying that humankind was first for punishment, one means the punishment in connection with the serpent, Rabbi taught that, in conferring honor the Bible commences with the greatest, in cursing with the least important. Thus, in cursing, God began with the least, cursing first the serpent, then the people. The punishment of the Flood must therefore be meant, as [...] says, [...] "And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle," [...] starting with the people. In support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> said that Eve was created from a face, in [...] the word , wa-yitzer is written with two yuds. But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the word , wa-yitzer as Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi said, [...] "Woe is me because of my Creator (yotzri), woe is me because of my evil inclination (yitzri)!" [...] In support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> said that Eve was created from a face, [...] says, [...] "male and female created He them." [...] But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the words, [...] "male and female created He them," [...] as Rabbi Abbahu explained when he contrasted the words, [...] "male and female created He them," [...] in [...] with the words, [...] "in the image of God made He man," [...] in [...] Rabbi Abbahu reconciled these statements by teaching that at first God intended to create two, but in the end created only one. In support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> said that Eve was created from a face, [...] says, [...] "He closed up the place with flesh instead thereof." [...] But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the words, [...] "He closed up the place with flesh instead thereof," [...] as Rabbi Jeremiah (or as some say Rav Zebid, or others say Rav Nahman bar Isaac) said, that these words applied only to the place where God made the cut. In support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> said that Eve was created from a tail, [...] says, [...] "God built." [...] But the one who said that Eve was created from a face explained the words [...] "God built" [...] as explained by Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia, who interpreted the words, [...] "and the Lord built the rib," [...] to teach that God braided Eve's hair and brought her to Adam, for in the seacoast towns braiding (keli'ata) is called building (binyata). Alternatively, Rav Hisda said (or some say it was taught in a Baraita) that the words, [...] "and the Lord built the rib," [...] teach that God built Eve after the fashion of a storehouse, narrow at the top and broad at the bottom so as to hold the produce safely. So Rav Hisda taught that a woman is narrower above and broader below so as better to carry children.|$|E

2500|$|A {{fiduciary}} is {{a person}} who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties (person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other asset for another person. One party, for example a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a fiduciary capacity to the other one, who for example has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. Likewise, asset managers—including managers of pension plans, endowments and other tax-exempt assets—are considered fiduciaries under applicable statutes and laws. [...] In a fiduciary relationship, one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice or protection is sought in some matter. [...] In such a relation good conscience requires the fiduciary to act at all times for the sole [...] and interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> trusts.|$|E
2500|$|Afw ( [...] {{is another}} term for {{forgiveness}} in Islam; it occurs 35 times in Quran, {{and in some}} Islamic theological studies, it is used interchangeably with ghufran. Afw means to pardon, to excuse for a fault or an offense. According to Muhammad Amanullah, forgiveness ('Afw) in Islam is derived from three wisdoms. First {{and the most important}} wisdom of forgiveness is that it is merciful when the victim or guardian of the victim accepts money instead of revenge. The second wisdom of forgiveness is that it increases honor and prestige <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> forgives. Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness, humiliation or dishonor. Forgiveness is honor, raises the merit of the forgiver in the eyes of Allah, and enables a forgiver to enter paradise. The third wisdom of forgiveness is that according to some scholars, such as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi, forgiveness expiates (kaffarah) the forgiver from the sins he or she may have committed at other occasions in life. Forgiveness is a form of charity (sadaqat). Forgiveness comes from taqwa (piety), a quality of God-fearing people.|$|E
