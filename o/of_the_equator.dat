30|$|<b>The</b> secular trends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{vertical}} component (Z) {{for the six}} Indian stations for quiet day annual means is shown in Fig. 3 (c). The Z-field decreased since 1958, reaching a minimum value around 1970, and then it increased again. The increase in Z from 1970 is more rapid at equatorial stations (denoting <b>the</b> southward migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dip <b>equator)</b> as compared with mid-latitude stations. <b>The</b> southward migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> was suggested by Srivastava (1992) and confirmed by Rangarajan and Deka (1991). <b>The</b> maximum speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southward migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> {{is estimated to be}} ~ 5 km/year during 1980 – 1990 (Deka et al., 2005). <b>The</b> southward migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> is also shown in Fig. 1 for different years from 1975 to 2005. Srivastava and Abbas (1977) have found a quasi-periodicity of ~ 80 years in <b>the</b> migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dip <b>equator.</b> In our analysis, the Z-field also completes a half-cycle in 40 years; hence, <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secular change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> ~ 80 years, attributable to the Gleissberg cycle (Gleissberg, 1965).|$|R
5|$|The northeastern Pacific {{hurricane}} basins {{are divided}} into two parts– eastern and central.

Both basins extend to the Arctic Circle at 66°N. When tropical cyclones cross from the Atlantic into the Pacific, the name of the previous storm is retained if the system continues to exhibit tropical characteristics; however, when hurricanes degenerate into a remnant low-pressure area, the system is designated with the next name on the rotating eastern Pacific hurricane naming list.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, 23tropical {{cyclones}} {{were observed}} in the western Pacific Ocean, north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equator</b> and west of the International Date Line. In that region of the world, cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118km/h (74mph) are known as typhoons. Of the 23 storms, 13 were tracked by the Hong Kong Observatory. Activity occurred from January to December, although {{the bulk of the}} storms formed from June to November.|$|E

50|$|From the North Pole, all fully visible constellations north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{celestial}} <b>equator</b> are circumpolar, {{and likewise}} for constellations south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> from <b>the</b> South Pole.

From mid-north latitudes (40-50°N), circumpolar constellations may include Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, Cepheus, Cassiopeia and the not well known Camelopardalis.|$|R
30|$|Another {{point to}} be {{considered}} here is <b>the</b> southern location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geomagnetic <b>equator.</b> During December solstice month, being local summer in the southern hemisphere, larger electron densities are expected in <b>the</b> regions south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geographic <b>equator</b> that has <b>the</b> potential to develop steeper ∇n, and thus enhance the EPI growth rate. We therefore explain the observed lower correlations of EPIs between Swarm A and C in the southern {{than those in the}} northern hemisphere by these two effects, low geomagnetic field and southern location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic <b>equator.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{geographical}} mile {{is defined}} to be <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> one minute <b>of</b> arc along <b>the</b> <b>equator</b> (one equatorial minute of longitude), so a degree <b>of</b> longitude along <b>the</b> <b>equator</b> is exactly 60 geographical miles, {{as there are}} 60 minutes in a degree.|$|R
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, a small {{low-level}} circulation {{was located}} along the northwest coastline of Borneo; {{at the same}} time a plume of cold air progressed southward through the South China Sea on the southeastern periphery of a ridge over the Far East. The vortex drifted southwestward, reaching open water by December 21. The northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation, and {{at the same time}} a portion of the air surge crossed the equator. The southerly flow turned eastward, then northward, and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex, resulting in rapid development of the low-level circulation, just a short distance north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equator.</b> By December 25, an area of scattered convection persisted about 370km (230mi) east of Singapore within an area of low wind shear, in association with the low-level circulation. Continuing slowly westward, the convection deepened and organized further, and at 1200UTC on December 26 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230km (145mi) east of Singapore, or 156km (97mi) north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equator.</b> This was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the equator.|$|E

5|$|The {{ecliptic}} forms {{one of the}} {{two fundamental}} planes used as reference for positions on the celestial sphere, the other being the celestial equator.
