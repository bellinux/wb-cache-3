5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>material</b> by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|E. Koken named Plesiosaurus limnophilus in 1887 {{based on}} {{isolated}} cervical vertebrae from outcrops of the Bückeberg Group in Lower Saxony.

All <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>material</b> {{is not particularly}} diagnostic, and has been partially lost; thus, they have been considered nomina dubia. Sachs et al. considered all of these to represent remains of Brancasaurus, {{with the exception of}} P. degenhardti, which was retained as a nomen dubium on account of lacking the distinctive cervical neural spines of Brancasaurus.|$|E

Another singer, Jacqui McShee, began performing with the two guitarists and, with the addition of Danny Thompson (string bass) and Terry Cox (drums), they formed the group, Pentangle.

5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>material</b> into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>material</b> is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E
