500|$|Desiring {{their own}} home stadium, in the early 1970s the Giants reached an {{agreement}} with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to play their home games at a brand-new, state-of-the-art, dedicated football stadium. Some New Yorkers were furious and Mayor John Lindsay had attempted to keep the team in the city by proposing to buy Yankee Stadium and renovate it at a cost of $24 million. Lindsay estimated that they brought $3 million to the city, and was anxious to keep that revenue, as well as satisfy New York Giant fans. Axthlem characterized the Giants fan base at the time as mostly [...] "white, suburban and fairly well to do, and its members drive cars to football games." [...] The battle became nasty with members of the New York City side claiming that the Maras [...] "complained of how inconvenient it was for them to park, or for them to get out to the neighborhood." [...] They claimed the Maras [...] "never really negotiated. They just listened...I think they were afraid if they asked for something, we might give it to them—and they wanted to keep us from offering a deal that they couldn't turn down." [...] In fact, the Maras had already made the agreement {{to move out of the}} city, even though Wellington was still placating the city. He felt this was a factor in the Mara's decision to move the stadium, as the attendees could drive to their New Jersey stadium as opposed to traveling through the Bronx to Yankee Stadium. The new stadium, which would become known as Giants Stadium, was to be built at a brand new sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The decision met with outrage from some New Yorkers, and the city's mayor John Lindsay sought legal action to prevent the team from playing in Yankee Stadium — <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> New York — and demanded a congressional investigation into the deal.|$|E

Thus the Biblical text in relation to Abraham and Ur of the Chaldees is in actuality a retrospective use of the term, used simply because at the time these Talmudic/Biblical texts were written down in the 6th century BC in Babylon, the Chaldean dynasty was then in power in Babylonia. The traditional identification with a site in Assyria (a nation in Upper Mesopotamia predating Chaldea by well over thirteen hundred years, and never recorded in historical annals as ever having been inhabited by the much later arriving Chaldeans) would then imply the much later sense of [...] "Babylonia".|$|E

In addition to asserting that [...] "Just as in Big Love, same-sex marriage is never more than one degree away of separation from polygamy," [...] she found that the series adds crucial insight {{to the understanding of}} marriages that exist between legal and cultural recognition. As she explains, [...] "These cases can be seen through the lens of ... Big Love, in which marriages are produced as the culturally real in the here and the now, even when legal recognition remains elusive." [...] By exploring the movement seeking to culturally legitimize same-sex marriage, she concluded Big Love served as a most powerful, unique allegory: [...] "Big Love plays on an even more decisive gap: polygamous marriages are not legal in Utah <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the country. Yet the point and the poignancy of the show is to depict a 'real-life' family. Bill Hendrickson and his three wives struggle with all of the daily trials of contemporary family life: parenting, finances, intimacy, and sex. The sympathetic portrayal of their family is as culturally real, although it suffers by virtue of its nonlegal recognition." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schiffman {{believes}} the passage in Nehemiah is a midrashic interpretation of Lev. 23:40, {{as do the}} Karaites. However, his view is that this interpretation was eventually rejected by [...] "Jewish tradition," [...] i.e., majority practice, {{in favor of the}} Talmudic interpretation of Lev. 23:40 as referring to waving the four species. In contrast to Schiffman, some commentators argue that the verse in Nehemiah cannot be referring to Lev. 23:40, since the language in Nehemiah has some differences from that verse. The pri eitz hadar (fruit of a beautiful tree) and the willow branches are omitted and two species of olive branches are added. [...] It remains unclear according to this interpretation where exactly the scribes in Nehemiah's day [...] "found written in the law" [...] that the Sukkah should be taken from the described species, as no such commandment appears in the books of Moses <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the Hebrew Bible. Alternatively, the blogger Beno Freedman has suggested that the expression [...] "pri etz hadar" [...] in Leviticus is actually a typo for [...] "pri etz hahar" [...] - fruit of the mountain tree, and is a general descriptor for the olive and willow branches specified immediately afterwards. This would explain why the [...] "hadar" [...] fruit is not mentioned in Nehemiah, and why the verse in Nehemiah mentions a specific instruction to [...] "go out to the mountain" [...] to fetch the materials for the Sukkah.|$|E

[...] In April 2011, Wikileaks revealed that a November 2008 U.S. Department of Defence document stated that Abdelrazik had admitted receiving $10 000 from alleged al-Qaeda financier Hassan Zemiri, who was captured in late 2001 in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. [...] However, none of these allegations have been proven {{in a court of}} law and Abdelrazik has never been charged with any crime, in Canada <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world.

5000|$|In 1806 the king, at {{the request}} of his son the prince of Wales, ordered an inquiry into rumours that the princess of Wales had given birth to a child. A number of men were {{suspected}} of having had a relationship with the princess (which was grounds for a charge of high treason), but it was Manby against whom the evidence was [...] "particularly strong". Manby was called before the commissioners of the inquiry and swore on oath that he never did [...] "at Montagu House, Southend, Ramsgate, East Cliff, <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else,</b> ever sleep <b>in</b> any house occupied by, or belonging to, HRH the Princess of Wales". The commissioners concluded that the main accusation against the princess was unfounded, but nevertheless they criticised her behaviour. The princess was defended by former attorney-general and future prime-minister Spencer Perceval, who dismissed the evidence of the princess's servants as 'hearsay representations'. The gifts and letters from the princess to Manby were evidence only of her gratitude for Manby having taken two of her charity boys on board the Africaine, and his frequent visits were to keep the princess informed of their progress. If jugs of water and towels were left in the passage when Manby visited it was proof, Perceval argued, of the servants' slovenliness and not of high treason. Perceval was ready to publish his defence {{in the form of a}} book when there was a sudden change of government, the princess was accepted at court, and the book was suppressed. After Perceval's assassination in 1812 the book was published and extracts, including Manby's testimony, were published in the Times.|$|R
