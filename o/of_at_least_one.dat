It listed an 63 percent chance <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> major hurricane striking the U.S. mainland. This included a 43 percent chance <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> major hurricane strike on the East Coast, including the Florida peninsula, and a 36 percent chance <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> such strike on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle westward.

5|$|As in the 2005 season, {{the team}} {{predicted}} it was highly probable {{that at least}} one major hurricane would directly impact the United States. The forecast suggested an 81%probability {{that at least one}} major hurricane would strike the U.S. mainland, a 64%chance <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States (including the Florida peninsula), and a 47%chance <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> major hurricane striking the Gulf Coast of the United States from the Florida Panhandle westward. The team also predicted that the potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was above average. A few months later, on April 4, 2006, CSU issued another forecast confirming its December predictions.|$|E

5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a natural hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> of the parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E
