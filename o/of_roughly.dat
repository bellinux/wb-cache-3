5|$|Newton's theorem {{describes}} {{only the}} effects of adding an inverse-cube central force. However, Newton extends his theorem to an arbitrary central forces F(r) by restricting his attention to orbits that are nearly circular, such as ellipses with low orbital eccentricity (ε ≤ 0.1), which is true of seven of the eight planetary orbits in the solar system. Newton also applied his theorem to the planet Mercury, which has an eccentricity ε <b>of</b> <b>roughly</b> 0.21, and suggested that it may pertain to Halley's comet, whose orbit has an eccentricity <b>of</b> <b>roughly</b> 0.97.|$|E
