Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so they could not be deployed as divisions, however their active duty status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before her}} launch, there was {{considerable}} discussion of Tritons role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> submarine's extended use. These included configuration {{to serve as a}} command ship (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced sonar scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine (SSGN), or a minelaying submarine. However, {{with the exception of the}} command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the Skeen Committee {{was set up}} {{to examine}} the <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indianisation of the Indian Army's officer ranks. As Cariappa {{was one of the most}} senior Indian {{officers}} with about 19 years of service, the committee held several discussions with him. He expressed his displeasure at the treatment of Indian officers in the Army. He stressed the discrimination shown toward Indian officers in terms of appointments, promotions, benefits and allowances to which British officers were entitled but Indians were not.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{steps were}} taken to better protect the tankers from attack, but losses {{continued}} to mount until, in April 1942, they were banned by the Navy from operating the north-east sea routes. The government and industry took steps to maximise {{the use of the}} railroads, increasing the amount of oil carried on them more than ten-fold, but there were shortages of rail tank cars, and the existing fleet of cars was in poor condition. Instead, the United States government began to examine <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of pipelines to fulfil the demand for petroleum in the north-east.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two active duty division headquarters were activated for training National Guard units; those of the 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate, so they could not be deployed as combat divisions. Instead, the headquarters units focused on full-time training.|$|E

5|$|By October 1963, {{according}} to Woods, {{the situation had}} become critical and some officials were beginning to examine alternative options, such as conventional fighter aircraft {{in the form of}} the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. By November1963, the RAF reportedly still found the P.1154 to be a suitable platform, while the Royal Navy appeared to be considering the F-4 Phantom II as being a better fit for its needs. In response, HSA elected focused its efforts on the RAF version. In late 1963, dissatisfied with the progress of the 'bi-service' model, the government examined three alternative <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> programme; to proceed with an RAF-orientated P.1154 while the Naval version would be delayed, pursue the development of a full dual-service P.1154 model with only limited differences between the services, or the complete termination of the program with the service's requirements to be re-appraised.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{scenarios}} follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and the story's divergence mainly depends on whether an idol passes or fails an audition, though {{this is not always}} the case. Some outcomes, such as failing to pass the first audition, can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternate ending to the plot. An audition marks the end of a chapter, after which the story will progress onto the next stage. In the game's stage mode, the player is able to freely customize a stand-alone performance, including <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> song, costume, accessories, choreography and camera positioning. Up to 16 players can participate via Wi-Fi in the stage mode by offering three types of cheers during one player's performance. If the game is played on a Nintendo DS with a camera, such as a Nintendo DSi or a later model, the camera may be used to scan QR codes found online or in magazines to obtain in-game items.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the {{committee}} met with Lutyens in January 1919 to discuss <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> memorial. Lutyens argued against {{the committee}}'s initial proposed location on Asylum Green in favour of Watts Park, which the committee agreed to. Lutyen's initial design consisted of a large ceremonial pillar with a substantial archway on either side, each archway supporting a soldier lying on a sarcophagus. This was rejected due to the likely cost and instead Lutyens suggested a single empty sarcophagus or cenotaph, supported by a plinth {{on top of a}} pillar, with pine cones mounted on urns standing on each side. This was agreed to at a public meeting in September and detailed work on the project began. The London firm of Holloway Brothers were selected as the contractor for the memorial; the project was completed to time at a total cost of £9,845.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the RTA (since re-branded as Sound Transit) began {{exploring}} alignment <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Northgate segment, {{with residents}} voicing {{their opposition to}} at-grade or elevated alignments {{in favor of an}} underground route. Following several rounds of public hearings in 2000, the Sound Transit Board narrowed down the routing options to a tunnel under 12th Avenue and an elevated alignment along Interstate 5 to the west of Roosevelt's commercial district, each with a station at Northeast 65th Street. Further discussion on the two remaining choices in 2004 led to divides in the Sound Transit Board; community and business groups in Roosevelt favored an underground alignment, while Seattle mayor Greg Nickels supported the elevated station, which was less costly and closer to the Green Lake neighborhood. On January 28, 2005, the Sound Transit Board unanimously approved an underground alignment with a station along 12th Avenue NE between NE 65th and 67th streets, citing a smaller-than-expected difference in cost compared to the elevated option.|$|E
5|$|In January 1986, a {{governmental}} committee {{was established to}} discuss <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> management of Malta's public records. It was decided that a stand-alone National Archives of Malta would be established, to be headquartered in Rabat in a building that once housed a hospital. In addition, the Banca Giuratale in Mdina was identified as suitable to house the records of Malta's courts {{from the beginning of}} the occupation of Malta by the Knights Hospitaller to the early period of occupation by the United Kingdom. In September 1987, the transfer of court records to the Mdina building began and was completed in October 1988. The transfer of all other records to the Rabat facility was not completed until July 28, 1989, and the official opening of the building did not occur until May 28, 1994, when Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, the fifth President of Malta, presided over the opening. At that time, the officer in charge was Joe Caruana.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Commissioner Perry had {{put forward}} three <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{future of the}} mounted police: the force could be absorbed into the Canadian military; the remit of the force could be reduced to simply {{policing}} the far north; or the force could be assigned a much wider role in public and secret policing across the whole of Canada. Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be unacceptable to Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for the force.|$|E

5|$|PortLINK is {{the most}} complex of the proposals, as it {{involves}} making decisions {{on the future of}} the Outer Harbor and Grange railway lines. The report proposes several different options for these lines. They could be electrified but remain as heavy rail, or they could be converted to light rail - with potential spurlines added to West Lakes and Semaphore. Light rail <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Grange railway line include converting the entire line to light rail, diverting it to West Lakes and closing the section beyond Albert Park station, or replacing it with new on-street routes to Grange and West Lakes. The PortLINK routes are very similar to a group of light rail extensions to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore that were announced in the 2008 South Australian Budget but then scrapped in the 2012 budget.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations {{began in}} 1917 {{with a group}} of New York {{academics}} who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> foreign policy of the United States in the interwar period. Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council’s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs. The Trilateral Commission was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller, who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.|$|E
5|$|The duo enlisted a music {{marketing}} startup company—TopspinMedia—to {{design their}} site, delivery <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> digitalmusic, and promotional webwidgets. Like {{the entirety of}} the recording process, the marketing was self-financed and controlled by the artists, with Topspin taking a portion of the money made from digital sales. This allowed the artists to control creative aspects of producing music as well as the overhead costs associated with marketing an album. The company used viralmarketing techniques to collect potential customers' e-mailaddresses and encourage them to post the album streaming on their blogs. By early November, the collected e-mail addresses amounted to 37percent of the album sales. Topspin has also created a Flickr pool encouraging users to upload screenshots of the widget posted to web sites. No advertisements were taken out for the album.|$|E
