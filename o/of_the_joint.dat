40|$|Abstract. AC 4 C cast {{aluminum}} alloy and zinc-coated steel were friction stir lap welded, and the microstructures and mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> were examined and analyzed. Experimental {{results show that}} the welding speeds {{have a significant effect on}} the tensile properties and fracture locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> at a rotational speed of 1500 rpm. When the welding speed is higher than 60 mm/min, <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> fracture in <b>the</b> zinc-coated steel base material and the tensile strength is equal to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zinc-coated steel; when the welding speed is lower than 60 mm/min, <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> fracture in <b>the</b> interface and the shear strength is about 50 MPa. <b>The</b> change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fracture locations is attributed to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> large quantity intermetallic compounds adjacent to <b>the</b> interface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> <b>The</b> composition and formation mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermetallic compounds and its effect on <b>the</b> mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> were discussed...|$|R
30|$|These {{characteristic}} responses {{arise from}} the nonlinear load–slip relationships and the cyclic stiffness degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nailed <b>joints</b> [2, 3]. That is, <b>the</b> cyclic decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responsive accelerations and/or <b>the</b> cyclic increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responsive slips cause <b>the</b> gradual decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equivalent linear stiffness. This transition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equivalent linear stiffness gradually decreases <b>the</b> resonant frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> as indicated in Figs.  4 and 8. During <b>the</b> early phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamic response, <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> respond once sensitively to higher frequencies when the transitional resonant frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> synchronize with those frequencies. After this early phase, however, <b>the</b> cyclic degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equivalent stiffness decreases <b>the</b> resonant frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> which results in a dull response to the higher frequencies. <b>The</b> cyclic degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equivalent stiffness, on the other hand, brings gradually <b>the</b> resonant frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> close to <b>the</b> lower frequencies, which causes their critical failures.|$|R

Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services.
