5|$|The {{carriage}} house, {{today the}} Ellwood House Museum's Education and Visitors Center, {{was built by}} Perry Ellwood as a multi-car garage. It had a grease pit for automobile repair work. On the second floor was an apartment for the Ellwood family chauffeur. The building originally had garage doors on both sides so cars could drive in one side and <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the structure. The original doors are on display inside the Ellwood House Visitors Center.|$|E
5|$|The design used a {{thin layer}} of {{aluminum}} to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
5|$|The path now skirts Pentire Point West {{and then}} Kelsey Head to reach Holywell Bay, another surfing beach. After passing round Penhale and {{crossing}} Penhale Sands the path enters Perranporth, then climbs <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> back onto {{a stretch of}} cliffs past Kligga Head {{to the village of}} St Agnes. Past St Agnes Head, a breeding ground for kittiwakes, lies the ruins of Towanroath Mine and the inlet at Chapel Porth. Next are the ruins of Wheal Charlotte mine and then Porthtowan village.|$|E

5|$|On 25 September, {{the same}} day the railway group returned, the brigade set out at 06:00 for Amman. Approaching from the north, they would be {{supported}} during the assault by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. At 10:30 the regiment, with a machine-gun section and an artillery section, was ordered to move forward {{to the left of the}} Canterbury Mounted Rifles. The Turkish defenders were in redoubts surrounded by barbed wire. McCarroll sent a squadron to attack from the west, which came under Turkish machine-gun fire. Covered by the artillery the squadron was gradually able to advance. At 15:30 the reserve squadron galloped forward, dismounted and came under machine-gun fire. The regiment and Canterbury Mounted Rifles pushed forward. The 4th Squadron succeeded in reaching a double redoubt, but just as they were about to charge, sixty of the defenders surrendered and others withdrew along the Wadi Amman. By now the Canterbury Mounted Rifles had galloped into the town and <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> capturing the Turkish defences there from the rear. The battle was over and the brigade captured 1,734 prisoners, twenty-seven machine-guns, five artillery pieces, 298 horses and other military supplies. That night the regiment camped in the Wadi Amman.|$|E
25|$|The {{soldiers}} {{went through}} the car park and <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> Some soldiers went out the southwest corner, where they shot dead two civilians. The other soldiers went out the southeast corner and shot four more civilians, killing two.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1944, Compton {{was shot}} through the {{buttocks}} while participating in Operation Market Garden, the Allies' ill-fated attempt to seize a number of bridges in the Netherlands and cross the Rhine River into Germany. The bullet traveled sideways, through {{one side of the}} buttocks and <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> After a partial recovery, he returned to E Company in time for the siege in the frozen Ardennes that became known as the Battle of the Bulge. In January 1945, Compton left E Company for another assignment.|$|E

25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is {{that they do not have}} a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
25|$|Johnson’s poke check {{could also}} be used to force {{turnovers}} and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the sideboards and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately make as if he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when thirty feet from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it rimmed around behind the opponent’s goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot and pick up the puck as it came <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
25|$|A Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor {{consists}} of two wire cages, one inside the other, {{often referred to as}} grids, that are placed inside a vacuum chamber. The outer cage has a positive voltage versus the inner cage. Typically, deuterium gas is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its ionization temperature, making positive ions. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly {{through the center of the}} device at high speeds and can fly <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, they feel a Coulomb force that directs them back towards the center. Over time, a core of ionized gas can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until they strike either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes can raise the temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes conduct mass and energy away from the plasma.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] {{addresses}} [...] "insecurity and {{the release}} that comes in admitting it". Jim Farber from New York Daily News opined that Madonna [...] "ponders either running from, or accepting the end of, her career", whereas Adam R. Holz of Plugged In found Madonna [...] "confront confusion, fear and change". Regarding the lyrics [...] "I walk this razor's edge / Will I stand or will I fall?", Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound expressed that: [...] "When the world that you made goes onto change without you, keeping up becomes a bigger and bigger risk. If you're Madonna, you take that risk no matter how {{likely you are to}} come <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> without stumbling." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{impact was}} a {{substantial}} news event reported and discussed online, in print, and on television. There {{was a genuine}} suspense because experts held widely differing opinions over {{the result of the}} impact. Various experts debated whether the impactor would go straight through the comet and <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> would create an impact crater, would open up a hole in the interior of the comet, and other theories. However, twenty-four hours before impact, the flight team at JPL began privately expressing a high level of confidence that, barring any unforeseen technical glitches, the spacecraft would intercept Tempel 1. One senior personnel member stated [...] "All we can do now is sit back and wait. Everything we can technically do to ensure impact has been done." [...] In the final minutes as the impactor hit the comet, more than 10,000 people watched the collision on a giant movie screen at Hawaii's Waikiki Beach.|$|E
500|$|While his adjutants {{were trying}} to wake Frederick, his generals, most of whom had not slept and had kept their horses saddled and weapons ready, {{organized}} the Prussian resistance. Keith had anticipated an Austrian attack and organized a slashing counterattack on the Austrians holding the Prussian battery. Maurice von Anhalt-Dessau, another of Frederick's able generals, funneled the awakening troops to Keith. Combined, this action briefly retook the Prussian battery south of Hochkirch, {{but they could not}} hold it in the face of Austrian muskets. At 6:00, three more Prussian regiments rushed Hochkirch itself, while Prince Maurice continued directing stragglers and reinforcements into the counterattack. [...] The Prussians swept through the village, <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> and fell on the battery at bayonet point. By that point, though, most Prussian order and cohesion had been lost. The Austrians, supported by their appropriated Prussian guns, which had not been spiked, wrought havoc on the attackers. Keith was hit mid-body and knocked out of his saddle, dead as he fell.|$|E

500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
2500|$|The process above {{does not}} work against a rook pawn.

2500|$|Nintendo Life's Conor McMahon, {{gave the}} game 7/10 {{summarizing}} that [...] "Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water {{has been put}} through a wringer of doubt and speculation in the run up to its release, but manages to come <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> still just as drenched with atmosphere and intrigue as ever. Innovation should give fans that spark of renewed excitement, while newcomers are eased into an excellent horror adventure with {{plenty of time to}} learn the mechanics.

Murat sent Belliard to demand Hohenlohe's surrender, which the Prussian {{declined}} again. By this time some of Lannes' infantry were on the field. Together with Grouchy and Lasalle (but not Beaumont), there were only 4,000 to 5,000 French confronting the Prussians. At this time, Massenbach was allowed to return to the Prussian lines. Completely deceived by the French, Massenbach reported to Hohenlohe that their enemies were now between them and Stettin. Murat asked for a head-to-head parley with Hohenlohe which was granted. The marshal lied to Hohenlohe on his [...] "word of honor" [...] that he was surrounded by 100,000 French in the corps of Lannes, Soult, and Bernadotte.|$|E
