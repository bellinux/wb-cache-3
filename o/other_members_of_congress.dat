5|$|In 2014, Gillibrand {{published}} {{her first}} book, Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World. The candid memoir was notable {{in the media}} upon release due to whisperings of a future presidential run as well as revealing a culture of sexism in the Senate, including specific comments made to her by <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> about her weight and appearance. Off the Sidelines debuted at number 8 on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction.|$|E
5|$|More than 40years {{before the}} {{creation}} of the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, as the world's first national park. Between 1872 and 1886, the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park's natural features and wildlife, or to deal with poaching, vandalism and other destructive activities. Over the next decade, special interest groups such as concessionaires, railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands. The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances, was complicit with special interest groups. Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource, and along with <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> believed that only the military could effectively protect the park. A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department, thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park.|$|E

25|$|Pombo and his {{political}} action committee RICH PAC was among a dozen leaders in the House of Representatives reportedly under investigation {{as part of the}} corruption and influence-peddling scandal centered around disgraced Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and his policy issues, including Indian gaming. Pombo had accepted more money from Abramoff than had any <b>other</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> ($500,000). Fundraisers organized by Indian gaming interests and tied to the 2005 MLB All-Star Game are among those activities under scrutiny.|$|R

25|$|The 1797 {{impeachment}} of Senator William Blount of Tennessee stalled {{on the grounds}} that the Senate lacked jurisdiction over him. No <b>other</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> has ever been impeached. The Constitution does give authority to the Senate and House, so that each body may expel its own <b>members.</b> (see List <b>of</b> United States senators expelled or censured and List of United States Representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded). Expulsion removes the individual from functioning as a representative or senator because of their misbehavior, but unlike impeachment, expulsion cannot result in barring an individual from holding future office.|$|R
25|$|Church is also {{remembered for}} his voting {{record as a}} strong {{progressive}} and environmental legislator, and he {{played a major role}} in the creation of the nation's system of protected wilderness areas in the 1960s. In 1964, Church was the floor sponsor of the national Wilderness Act. In 1968, he sponsored the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and gained passage of a ten-year moratorium on federal plans to transfer water from the Pacific Northwest to California. Working with <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> from northwestern states, Church helped establish the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area along the Oregon-Idaho border, which protected the gorge from dam building. He was also the primary proponent in the establishment of the Sawtooth Wilderness and National Recreation Area in central Idaho in 1972.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Paul joined 32 <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in {{opposing}} {{the renewal of}} the 1965 Voting Rights Act, originally passed to remove barriers to voting participation for minorities. Paul has indicated {{that he did not}} object to the voting rights clauses, but rather to restrictions placed on property rights by the bill. He felt the federal interference mandated by the bill was costly and unjustified because the situation for minorities voting is very different from when the bill was passed 40 years ago. Many of Texas' Republican representatives voted against the bill, because they believe it specifically singles out some Southern states, including Texas, for federal Justice Department oversight that makes it difficult for localities to change the location of a polling place or other small acts without first receiving permission from the federal government. The bill also mandated bilingual voting ballots upon request, which Paul objected to on the grounds that one of the requirements of gaining United States citizenship is ability to read in English, and that as it currently stands it often forces large expenditures to prepare materials that are in some cases never used.|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, the {{non-profit}} National Legal and Policy Center filed an ethics complaint against Rangel and <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> for trips, taken in 2007 and 2008 to Caribbean islands. [...] The trips had been sponsored by Carib News Foundation, a New York non-profit funded by corporations with interests before Congress and the Ways and Means Committee. [...] This, {{combined with the}} duration of the trips, seemed to violate House rules. [...] The Ethics Committee agreed the following month to investigate the matter.|$|E

5000|$|Senator Baucus, {{chairman}} of the Senate Finance Committee, received over $3 million from the health and insurance industries from 2003 to 2008, more than any <b>other</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> The Republican Ranking Member on the Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, received more than $2 million since 2003. Commentator Jack Cafferty and representatives from the Physicians for a National Health Program and Campaign Money Watch have argued that this lobbying creates {{a conflict of interest}} for the Senators. Baucus disputes the allegations, referring to a 2007 meeting reported on by The Wall Street Journal in which he told medical lobbyists [...] "you should worry about me coming after you." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Hutchison {{received}} more {{campaign contributions from}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> large oil and gas corporations than any <b>other</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> In 2005, Hutchison voted against prohibiting oil leasing in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and has supported legislation promoting drilling in the refuge in 2002 and 2003. In 2005 she also voted against including oil and gas smokestacks in the Environmental Protection Agency's mercury regulations. In 1999, she voted to remove funding for renewable and solar energy, although she has more recently stated she supports the development of alternative energy sources. The League of Conservation Voters gave Hutchison ratings ranging from 0% to 12% during her time in the U.S. Senate.|$|R

They were protesting the alleged role of Sudan's {{government}} in ethnic cleansing in Darfur.

2500|$|In November 2011, 60 Minutes {{alleged that}} Pelosi and several <b>other</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> had used {{information}} they gleaned from closed sessions {{to make money}} on the stock market. The program cited Pelosi's purchases of Visa stock while {{a bill that would}} limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report [...] "a right-wing smear." [...] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, Pelosi voted for the bill and lauded its passing. Of Representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they [...] "shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all." ...|$|R
