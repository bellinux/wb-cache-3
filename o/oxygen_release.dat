25|$|The diving reflex is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes, and which is found in all air-breathing vertebrates. It optimizes respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain which allows staying underwater for extended periods of time. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins, muskrats), but exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered specifically by chilling the face and breath-hold. The most noticeable effects are on the cardiovascular system, which displays peripheral vasoconstriction, slowed pulse rate, redirection of blood to the vital organs to conserve <b>oxygen,</b> <b>release</b> of red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but the apnea, bradycardia, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals as a neural response.|$|E

50|$|An SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) value below 90% causes hypoxia (which {{can also}} be caused by anemia). Hypoxia due to low SaO2 is {{indicated}} by cyanosis, but oxygen saturation does not directly reflect tissue oxygenation. The affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen may impair or enhance <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> at the tissue level. Oxygen is more readily released to the tissues (i.e., hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen) when pH is decreased, body temperature is increased, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is increased, and 2,3-DPG levels (a byproduct of glucose metabolism also found in stored blood products) are increased. When the hemoglobin has greater affinity for oxygen, less is available to the tissues. Conditions such as increased pH, decreased temperature, decreased PaCO2, and decreased 2,3-DPG will increase oxygen binding to the hemoglobin and limit its release to the tissue.|$|E

50|$|By itself, {{hemoglobin}} has sigmoid-like kinetics. In selectively binding to deoxyhemoglobin, 2,3-BPG stabilizes the T state conformation, {{making it}} harder for oxygen to bind hemoglobin and more likely to be released to adjacent tissues. 2,3-BPG is part of a feedback loop that can help prevent tissue hypoxia in conditions where it is most likely to occur. Conditions of low tissue oxygen concentration such as high altitude (2,3-BPG levels are higher in those acclimated to high altitudes), airway obstruction, or congestive heart failure will tend to cause RBCs to generate more 2,3-BPG, because changes in pH and oxygen modulate the enzymes that make and degrade it. The accumulation of 2,3-BPG decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Ultimately, this mechanism increases <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> from RBCs under circumstances where it is needed most. This release is potentiated by the Bohr effect, in which hemoglobin's binding affinity for oxygen is also reduced by a lower pH and high concentration of carbon dioxide. In tissues with high energetic demands, oxygen is rapidly consumed, which increases the concentration of H+ and carbon dioxide. Through the Bohr effect, hemoglobin is induced to release more oxygen to supply cells that need it.|$|E
50|$|Release {{of energy}} from {{hydrogen}} fusion potential: In other similar chain of transformations {{beginning at the}} dawn of the universe, nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This resulted in hydrogen representing a store of potential energy which can be released by nuclear fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) snow-avalanches, or when water evaporates from oceans and is deposited high above sea level (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena on Earth. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by green plants as chemical potential energy, when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and <b>oxygen.</b> <b>Release</b> of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action.|$|E

This study investigated the variation of root <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> rate, {{and the effect of}} photosynthesis during day and night periods on the rate of <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> from the roots of Acorus calamus Linn in a model CW. The maximum <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> rate was recorded to be in the range of 215. 2 - 750. 8 Î¼molg- 1 h- 1 and this occurred at 15 : 00.

The oxygen concentration at the root surface ranged from 20 to 450 [mu]M (atmospheric saturation = 280 [mu]M) between darkness and saturating light, and the oxic shell surrounding the roots varied from about 0. 5 to 5 mm in thickness.

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} presented to explain the grossly biphasic <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> kinetics observed when hemoglobins are studied with the oxygen pulse technique [Gibson (1973) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 70, 1 - 4]. Hypothesis I suggests that the two phases result from cooperativity, with the fast phase being <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> from the low affinity (T) state and the slow phase being <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> from molecules that have switched to the high affinity (R) state. Hypothesis II suggests that the biphasic curves are due to a large (factor of 20 - 30) difference in <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> from {{the two types of}} subunits within deoxyhemoglobin. In order to experimentally discriminate between these two hypotheses, we reinvestigated the oxygen pulse reaction for hemoglobin Kansas (alpha 2 beta 2 102 Asn leads to Thr) in the absence and presence of inositol hexaphosphate, since recent high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance studies have shown that this allosteric cofactor stabilizes hemoglobin Kansas in T even when fully liganded [Ogawa, Mayer, and Shulman (1972) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 49, 1485 - 1491]. The results of these studies clearly favor hypothesis I over hypothesis II as being the correct interpretation for the oxygen pulse results. However, we have found evidence that suggests that <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> and binding in T are surprisingly faster than previously observed. Furthermore, within T, there is some spectral and kinetic heterogeneity for <b>oxygen</b> <b>release</b> from adult hemoglobin and hemoglobin Kansas. The magnitude of this kinetic heterogeneity in T appears to be about the same as that seen in the high affinity, R, state. The exchange of hypothesis II for hypothesis I more strongly favors views of cooperative oxygen binding involving both types of subunits, as required if the allosteric model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux [(1965) J.

40|$|The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) {{instrument}} {{on board}} the Curiosity Rover has detected O 2 and HCl gas releases from all analyzed Gale Crater sediments, which are attributed {{to the presence of}} perchlorates and/or chlorates in martian sediment. Previous SAM analog laboratory analyses found that most pure perchlorates and chlorates release O 2 and HCl at different temperatures than those observed in the SAM data. Subsequent studies examined the effects of perchlorate and chlorate mixtures with Gale Crater analog iron phases, which are known to catalyze oxychlorine decomposition. Several mixtures produced O 2 releases at similar temperatures as Gale Crater materials, but most of these mixtures did not produce significant HCl releases comparable to those detected by the SAM instrument. In order to better explain the Gale Crater HCl releases, perchlorates and chlorates were mixed with Gale Crater analog saponite, which is found at abundances from 8 to 20 wt % in the John Klein and Cumberland drill samples. Mixtures of chlorates or perchlorates with calcium-saponite or ferrian-saponite were heated to 1000 deg C in a Labsys EVO differential scanning calorimeter/mass spectrometer configured to operate similarly to the SAM oven/quadrupole mass spectrometer system. Our results demonstrate that all chlorate and perchlorate mixtures produce significant HCl releases below 1000 deg C as well as depressed <b>oxygen</b> peak <b>release</b> temperatures when mixed with saponite. The type of saponite (calcium or ferrian saponite) did not affect the evolved gas results significantly. Saponite/Mg-perchlorate mixtures produced two HCl releases similar to the Cumberland drilled sample.
