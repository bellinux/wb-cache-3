The kangaroo faces left, except when used on aircraft or vehicles, when the kangaroo should always face in the direction of travel. Low visibility versions of the roundel exist, with the white omitted and the red and blue replaced with light or dark grey.|$|E

25|$|While many simpler {{operating}} systems support a limited range <b>of</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> accessing storage systems, {{operating systems}} like UNIX and Linux support a technology {{known as a}} virtual file system or VFS. An operating system such as UNIX supports {{a wide array of}} storage devices, regardless of their design or file systems, allowing them to be accessed through a common application programming interface (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them, through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers.|$|E
25|$|Great Calva {{is mainly}} covered in heather, which makes walking {{relatively}} difficult. From the north west an {{approach can be}} made from Orthwaite, following a bridleway between Great Cockup and Little Calva to the col between Knott and the summit. Alternatively Great Calva can be climbed up the pathless south ridge from Skiddaw Forest, which creates a number <b>of</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> starting points. The Skiddaw House supply road follows Dash Beck up from Peter House Farm, or a good track runs alongside the Caldew from the road at Mosedale. Access is also possible up the Glenderaterra valley from the south, starting either from the Gale Road car park or the vicinity of Threlkeld.|$|E
25|$|The {{convergence}} of content, technology, and broadband access allows consumers to stream television shows and movies to their high-definition television {{in competition with}} traditional service providers (Cable TV and Satellite Television). The research company SNL Kagan expects 12 million households, roughly 10%, to go without cable, satellite or telco video service by 2015 using Over The Top services. This represents a new trend in the broadcast television industry, as the list <b>of</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> watching movies and TV over the Internet grows every day. Research also shows that even as traditional television service providers are trimming their customer base, they are adding Broadband Internet customers. Nearly 76.6 million U.S. households get broadband from leading cable and telephone companies, although only a portion have sufficient speeds to support quality video streaming. Convergence devices for home entertainment will likely play a much larger role {{in the future of}} broadcast television, effectively shifting traditional revenue streams while providing consumers with more options.|$|E

25|$|The council {{maintained}} {{control by}} forbidding its affiliates from competing in matches against unaffiliated bodies without permission, {{and with the}} threat of excluding from the council any leagues, players or clubs who defied its rules. This meant that leagues could face exclusion if they played representative matches against un-affiliated leagues or their clubs without permission. It also meant that players who broke the ANFC's transfer rules by switching to an un-affiliated league without a clearance would be banned from affiliated leagues. Any penalties imposed by the council were inherently valid only within the council-affiliated competitions, and there was nothing to stop a league or player from ignoring council rules and carrying on in an unaffiliated system – and the Victorian Football Association spent much of its history operating in this manner – however, by virtue of the council's size, the number <b>of</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> unaffiliated leagues and players was sufficiently small to encourage most competitions to adhere to council rules and remain affiliated.|$|E
25|$|That said, {{the score}} does allow the {{interpreter}} {{to make choices}} on how to perform a historical work. For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), {{it is not known}} exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part (only a figured bass symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range <b>of</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during fermatas (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the TAVR {{reverted to}} the old title of the Territorial Army, with the Order of Battle being subject to minor reorganisation, with the 1st Battalion {{transferring}} A (Royal Scots) Company to the 2nd Battalion and the 2nd Battalion transferring its No.2 (Royal Highland Fusiliers) Company to the 1st Battalion. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} Cold War, the 1st Battalion of 52nd Lowland Volunteers, now based entirely in Glasgow and the West of Scotland, and the 2nd Battalion, based primarily in Edinburgh, the Lothians and Borders, trained for the NATO reinforcement role, with 1/52 LOWLAND's MILAN platoon tasked with direct support to the British Army of the Rhine. In 1984 however, the 1st Battalion also raised two Home Service Force Companies and the 2nd Battalion raised a further one, which trained exclusively for the home defence role, they were eventually disbanded in 1992 as part <b>of</b> <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> Change. The 1st Battalion also had its D (Cameronians) Company disbanded and the 2nd Battalion had its No.1 (Royal Scots) Company disbanded.|$|E
