People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. [...] "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> {{when you sit down}} and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E
500|$|Lopez was {{surprised}} by the enormous media coverage, declaring in an interview: [...] "It was a nice dress. I had no idea it was going to become such a big deal." [...] Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career, saying that the media now had confidence in her own work, after the death of Gianni Versace. She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success. The next day she [...] was everywhere and people were talking about her in that dress. It was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> like the one that Gianni [...] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes-pins." [...] The dress has been referred to many times as [...] "notorious" [...] and [...] "infamous" [...] because of its boldness.|$|E

500|$|The ending, {{in which}} the pirates are each {{shot to death by}} American snipers, {{reflects}} the resolution of the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009, where U.S. Navy SEALs rescued the captain after three snipers simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each. They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending. Travis Fickett of IGN said, [...] "It's one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where South Park feels the need to give voice to a side the media is ignoring—and points out that things aren't quite as cut and dry [...] as we might like." [...] The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted. A U.S. Navy SEAL ordering another to [...] "not hit the white ones" [...] has also been described as an indictment of the American approach to foreign policy.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} the song was {{nominated}} in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Jon Wiederhorn from MTV News, the shots of the video are [...] "evocative and artistic, resembling {{a cross between a}} foreign film and a Chanel advertisement." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News said that Lee's disconnection in the video shows a [...] "distressed and emotionally wrought heroine." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised the video saying that Lee looked like a [...] "teen-misery titan" [...] and that she [...] "tiptoed through a marble castle of pain". He also concluded that she could have borrowed the dress from Stevie Nicks. During an interview with Spin in 2011 Lee said that it was weird for her to watch the old videos of the band including the one for [...] "My Immortal". She explained, [...] "Just watching our oldest videos, it's weird. I definitely remember watching 'My Immortal,' like, 'That was not some dream where it was really somebody else.' I've totally had a couple <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments.</b> It's cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|E

500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn You Inside Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn You Inside Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not someone I want to hang out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. We love the idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E
500|$|CNN's Lisa Respers France {{said the}} episode {{failed to meet}} her expectations. She was {{concerned}} that Mercedes' plot may lead towards the character becoming unlikeable, and criticized Holly's sudden departure. Though she enjoyed Sunshine's return, seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes' solo, she noted [...] "all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "quirky mixed bag, packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional (or musical) oomph.". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "C". He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show: the under-use of its supporting cast members, and the [...] "maniacal behavior" [...] of Sue. McNutt wrote, [...] "not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst, but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary. This episode was not {{a step in the}} right direction so much as it was an escalator to nowhere: A week from now, the chances of any of this resonating in the show itself is slim to none." [...] He felt that Mercedes has become a prop, rather than a character, and criticized the episode for attributing her blame for the marginalization the writers have subjected her to.|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} been flooded with [...] "hyperbolic praise," [...] and deemed [...] "the next big thing" [...] by {{multiple}} media outlets. Before recording the follow-up to its debut, the band released the acoustic EP/DVD My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue. The EP was the band's first charting on the Billboard 200 at number 153. From Under the Cork Tree {{was recorded in}} Burbank, California, and served as {{the first time the}} band had stayed in California {{for an extended period of}} time. The group lived in corporate housing during the making of the album. In contrast to Take This to Your Graves rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on From Under the Cork Tree. It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on Grave. Stump felt that this process was much more [...] "smooth" [...] as every member was able to focus on his individual strengths. He explained: [...] "We haven't had any <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll read me lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.' It's very natural and fun." [...] Despite this, the band had great difficulty creating its desired sound for the album, constantly scrapping new material. Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin Down." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of the {{television}} broadcast were highly positive, praising its close attention to detail in parodying the original film. Jason Hughes of TV Squad found the episode to be [...] "incredibly ," [...] going on to note, [...] "As much as we fans love the films, we know they're not perfect, and that they're downright ridiculous in places. Family Guy managed to point out virtually all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> in this parody." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found the episode to have [...] "a lot of solid laughs", and admired the show for [...] "throwing itself into these outsized movie parody things". Critics of the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases gave the episode high praise {{for its ability to}} accurately reflect the original film. Cindy White of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, noting that it [...] "lives up to its predecessor and, like the film it spoofs, arguably exceeds it in some ways". John Scott Lewinski of Wired praised the faithfulness to the original film, saying that it [...] "becomes clear that MacFarlane and his writers are legit Star Wars fans". Adam Rosenberg of MTV Movies Blog called the episode [...] "hilarious" [...] and Paul Semel of Metromix praised the episode for featuring [...] "some very ribald humor", and [...] " [...] the original movie with some rather insightful moments". In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed [...] "Something, Something, Something, Dark Side" [...] as being a [...] "pretty entertaining parody, and a safe way to wrap things up." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number six on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "almost as good as the first , but much better than the third [...]" [...] He added that the episode is [...] "a bit bizarre on paper, but it works", and noted that you need to be a fan of the Star Wars franchise to understand the jokes.|$|E

2500|$|Clarke and Lexa's {{relationship}} {{had a significant}} impact on the LGBT community. Dalene Rovenstine of Entertainment Weekly stated that the series [...] "has featured unexpected twists (a baby in space! a human harvest chamber! cannibals!), the shocking deaths of multiple main characters, and amounts of blood and gore you wouldn't expect to be approved on network TV. But none <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> have created a stir quite like [...] when [...] locked lips." [...] The kiss was trending on Twitter after it aired, and many fans created artwork of the characters and couple as the series progressed; others engaged in cosplay of Lexa (dressing up like the character), with some receiving input from Debnam-Carey and Rothenberg.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2009 that a reimagining of the 1983 miniseries V created by Kenneth Johnson, had been picked up by ABC. Cast member Mitchell noted that the show would do service to the most iconic moments from the original franchise. Executive producer Scott Peters later confirmed that the new series would incorporate memorable elements of the original, including [...] "the huge ships [...] the red uniforms" [...] seen in the pilot, as: [...] "we are well aware <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> and looking to put our own little spin on them to tip our hat to the old audience." [...] Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted of the reimagining: [...] "We tried to put our own [...] We're ... {{a little bit different}} than their execution of it. It wasn't so much latex mask as it is real flesh and blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media {{selected}} [...] "Someone like You" [...] as {{a song of}} the day, {{claiming it}} served as a reaffirmation of popular music: [...] "Sometimes, pop music can still break your heart." [...] Writing for BBC Online, Ian Wade noted that the [...] "final track Someone Like You, just voice and piano, is an actual thing of beauty, placing the listener in one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where you feel you're {{in the presence of}} a future standard." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that [...] "the piano melody is gorgeous and combined with Adele's heartfelt reading of her words, the effect is highly emotional. You can imagine it being both honked through by talent show contestants and transcended by veterans alike." [...] Lamb went to write that the song is one of the [...] "top songs of 2011" [...] and that [...] "romantic pain has rarely been so utterly beautiful." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters called the song an [...] "absolute magic" [...] and praised Adele's performance by saying, [...] "Though it is unquestionably her finest vocal showcase to date, it is less remarkable for its more powerful moments than for the small ones where her voice dips, with rueful melancholy on the line 'I heard that your dreams came true' or cracks on the 'I beg' in the chorus, like she's startled at the revelation of her own vulnerability." [...] He further called her vocal performance of the song [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "finally worthy of her talents".|$|E
