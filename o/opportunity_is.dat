40|$|Abstract. Systematic {{analysis}} {{and understanding of}} error recovery can provide hospitals with the necessary information to improve their resilience. Because errors will always crop up and 100 % safety can never be achieved, health care systems {{should be able to}} prevent patient harm by timely and effective error recovery. In this paper we identified absent, missed and failed recovery opportunities in 56 medication errors, of which 52 resulted in severe patient harm or patient death. At least one recovery <b>opportunity</b> <b>was</b> present in nearly all of the medication errors. In the set of 52 full-blown accidents 127 recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> identified. Of these, 94 recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> planned recovery opportunities; 33 recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> unplanned recovery <b>opportunities.</b> For these recovery opportunities the underlying failure factors were identified and classified according to the Eindhoven Classification Model. The majority of the failure factors underlying the planned recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> organisational failure factors; the majority of the failure factors underlying the unplanned recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> human failure factors. From this study it can be concluded that accidents can be used as an alternative data source to near misses for the {{analysis and}} understanding of error recovery. ...|$|R

25|$|Many of the NEP {{policies}} {{strive for}} equality of results rather than equality of opportunity, with NEP proponents justifying the concentration on results rather than opportunity as {{by pointing out}} that measuring equality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> difficult or impossible.

25|$|The {{past and}} present {{directors}} of the museum have been enabled {{from time to time}} to carry out systematic excavations whenever <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.|$|E
25|$|Created in 2005 {{as a part}} of the Northeast Ohio Collegiate Entrepreneurship Program (NEOCEP), a Kauffman Campuses Initiative, and {{sponsored}} by the Burton D. Morgan and Ewing Marion Kauffman, the department is focused on supporting and highlighting entrepreneurship within the student body. This is done through a series of classes, symposia, Winter Term programs, grants, and fellowships available at no cost to current students and in some cases, recent alumni. One such <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> the Creativity and Leadership Fellowship, a one-year fellowship for graduating seniors that includes a stipend of up to $30,000 dollars to advance an entrepreneurial venture.|$|E

25|$|A loss of <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> {{another kind}} of loss that is {{represented}} in Albee’s play. Agnes has lost the opportunities of youth, of having another child. Agnes’s sister Claire has lost her opportunity at married life, having children, doing something with her life other than getting drunk. Julia, Agnes and Tobias’s daughter, has lost several marriages {{and the opportunity to}} have children. She has also lost her room, symbolic of having lost her childhood. Julia has also lost a brother, who died in his youth. This loss Agnes mourns as a loss of love. After the death of the child, Tobias and Agnes no longer attempted to have more children. This eventually led to the loss of their sexual life together.|$|E
25|$|After the {{interval}} act is over, {{when all the}} points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce {{the results of their}} vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> taken by each country to show their spokesperson {{standing in front of a}} backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the Eiffel Tower or an Italian presenter might be seen with the Colosseum in the background.|$|E
25|$|Leto Atreides, {{on hearing}} {{news of this}} assignment, realizes {{that there must be}} a trap, but the <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> too {{valuable}} to decline. He arranges his trusted advisors, including Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, Mentat Thufir Hawat, Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, and troubadour-soldier Gurney Halleck, to prepare for any eventuality. Meanwhile, Reverend Mother Mohiam accuses Leto's concubine, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, of defying their secret centuries-long breeding program, aimed to produce a male Bene Gesserit they call the Kwisatz Haderach who would have mental powers to see throughout time and space. Jessica had been ordered to produce a daughter to continue the program, but out of love for Leto she had given him a son, Paul Atreides. Jessica has since trained Paul in the Bene Gesserit ways, and Mohiam is reluctantly impressed by the boy.|$|E

500|$|Elliott {{became the}} men's {{athletic}} director at the University of Iowa in 1970, succeeding Forest Evashevski. [...] He came to Iowa {{in the midst of}} a feud between athletic director Forest Evashevski and football coach Ray Nagel. [...] Evashevski resigned in May 1970, and Elliott was hired to replace him. [...] On accepting the job, Elliott noted: [...] "It's difficult to leave a town where you’ve lived for 13 years (Ann Arbor, Michigan), but the <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> so good at Iowa with the people and the school that no one could pass it up." ...|$|E
500|$|Buckland {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the ending, but blamed Frank. He felt {{that given the}} water theme, and closely tied together tragic parent-child theme, Anderton should have ended the film by taking Agatha in his care if Spielberg wanted a happy ending. Especially since [...] "Anderton kidnaps Agatha from the precog pool just as his son was kidnapped from a swimming pool" [...] and because Anderton could act as a [...] "substitute parent for Agatha, and Agatha...a substitute child for Anderton." [...] This <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> missed however, when the precogs are sent to the remote island, and Anderton reunites with his wife; an ending which Buckland finds more [...] "forced" [...] than the [...] "more authentic" [...] path he feels he noticed.|$|E
500|$|Rallies {{in support}} of the Jena Six were held in Jena on September 20, 2007, the date upon which Bell was {{scheduled}} for sentencing. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 demonstrators attended the rally that day, severely overtaxing the facilities of the small town. Protesters took buses from such distant cities as Los Angeles and Washington, DC. Because of the congestion on the roads leading to Jena, many protesters left their vehicles and continued into town on foot. Attendees included civil rights activists Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and Martin Luther King III, and rappers Mos Def and Salt-n-Pepa. Rapper-actor Ice Cube attended and financially supported the rally. Darryl Hunt, an African American who was wrongfully convicted of the rape and murder of a young white newspaper reporter in 1984, was scheduled as a keynote speaker. The demonstrators were addressed by Darryl Matthews, General President of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, who said, [...] "It is sobering to know that in 2007 Martin Luther King's dream of equal treatment, respect, fairness and <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> still not realized." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Rick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute {{stated that}} on [...] "education, training, employment, and social services, the Ryan budget would spend 33% less" [...] than Obama's budget plan {{over the next}} decade. In particular, the Ryan plan {{tightened}} eligibility requirements for Pell Grants and froze the maximum Pell Grant award at the then-current level. According to an analysis by the Education Trust, this {{would have resulted in}} more than 1 million students losing Pell Grants over the next 10 years. Additionally, under Ryan's plan, student loans would have begun to accrue interest while students were still in school. Ryan stated that his education policy is to [...] "allocate our limited financial resources effectively and efficiently to improve education". Jordan Weissmann of The Atlantic said that Ryan's vision on education policy is to [...] "cut and privatize". National Education Association President Dennis Van Roekel criticized Ryan's positions on education in 2012 saying: [...] "By selecting Ryan, Romney has doubled down on his view that <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> only for those who can afford it or are willing to game the system. He’s shown yet again that he is more willing to help the rich get richer than ensuring middle class families get ahead." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Sickels {{augmented}} his scouting {{report on}} Kinsler by reporting that he was: a good athlete, not super-toolsy, but strong for his size with speed a notch above average. His swing looked short, quick, and sharp. Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. [...] "Long swings" [...] usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I think he has enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands. His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed is a bit better than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> there. Overall, he is a solid all-around player who makes the most of his natural ability.|$|E
500|$|Three of {{the four}} {{activities}} are [...] "revamped versions" [...] of other activities from the main game. Genki Apocalypse is a shooting minigame similar to the main game's Super Ethical Reality Climax, where the player travels through rooms shooting enemies and targets (such as Ethical and Money Shot targets) to earn money. Accidentally shooting the Sad Panda targets reduces the player's earnings. Unlike Super Ethical Reality Climax, Genki Apocalypse has a jungle theme, including shark-infested waters. The second activity, Super Ethical PR <b>Opportunity,</b> <b>is</b> based on the main game's Escort minigames, but the player instead escorts Professor Genki himself. The Genki Mobile car features flamethrowers around its periphery, for when Genki demands carnage en route. The car is unlocked upon finishing the activity. The third activity, Sexy Kitten Yarngasm, is a cross between the main game's Tank Mayhem activity and the Katamari series where the player rolls a destructive ball of yarn around the streets. The player must destroy {{a certain amount of}} property within a time limit. Upon completing the activity, the player unlocks Yarnie (the ball of yarn) as a vehicle. In the last activity, the new Sad Panda Skyblazing, the player dons a Sad Panda costume and jumps from a helicopter, falling through fire rings into Ethical balloons and onto rooftops to kill costumed mascots with a chainsaw. There are two instances of each activity on the map, and finishing each activity unlocks new costumes, support characters, and vehicles. The pack was released three months following the game, on January 17, 2012.|$|E
