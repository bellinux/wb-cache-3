5|$|Though {{during the}} 1970s most <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Highway was {{bypassed}} by freeways and expressways, the old two-lane road remained a famous roadway. In 1971, Steven Spielberg {{made his first}} feature-length film, Duel, along Sierra Highway, near Acton. The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck's game. It prominently shows the desert portions <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Highway. With Duels status, one of the trucks used in the film {{is still on the}} road and {{in the process of being}} restored. The current owner has driven the truck along Sierra Highway for nostalgia, enjoying the terrified looks he receives from passing motorists who recognize it. Other movies have since been filmed in the vicinity, including scenes in The Terminator.|$|E
5|$|Based on outcrop analysis, the {{crystalline}} basement composed of granitic and monzonitic rocks, {{dates to the}} Cretaceous, the oldest dated sample being 91.2 ± 2 million years old.

5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, co-founder <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> On-Line, deliberately {{made the}} Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E

5|$|The last STTT, {{formed around}} 2nd Battalion, The Light Infantry, left Sierra Leone {{at the end}} of September 2001. Approximately 8,500 SLA {{personnel}} were trained by the STTTs, which were replaced by the International Military Assistance and Training Team (IMATT)—an organisation formed of personnel from countries including Australia, Canada, and the United States, with the UK providing the largest contingent as well as an infantry company for force protection. The STTTs also formed a small special forces unit within the SLA—the Force Reconnaissance Unit (FRU)—to provide a morale boost and to give soldiers something to which they could aspire. Later in 2001, the British Army advised the Sierra Leonean government on a merger <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone's armed forces into a unified command, which became the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone Armed Forces in early 2002. In 2008, the permanent British contingent in Sierra Leone was reduced to 100 personnel. British soldiers remained in Sierra Leone as of 2013, continuing to form part of the IMATT, whose size has further reduced in accordance with the increased capabilities of the Sierra Leone armed forces.|$|E

Along the way Bond meets and {{falls in love with}} {{one of the members of}} the smuggling gang, Tiffany Case. Much of Fleming's background research formed the basis for his non-fiction 1957 book The Diamond Smugglers.

5|$|Traversing the {{extremes}} of California, from the Mojave Desert to the Sierra Nevada, El Camino Sierra has been advertised {{to the world as}} a highway to showcase the natural beauty of California as far back as 1910. Though most <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Highway was bypassed in the early 1970s with freeways, the road is still well known. The portion through the San Gabriel Mountains is noted as the primary filming location for the film Duel.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{exiting the}} mountains, Sierra Highway enters the Antelope Valley {{and serves as}} one of the main streets of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Rosamond. The highway runs {{parallel}} to the modern Route14 and the railroad, becoming a frontage road. Just shy of Mojave the freeway portion of Route14 ends, while the frontage road becomes a dirt path and eventually terminates. From this point, the canonical route <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Highway joins State Route 14, passing through downtown Mojave.|$|E
25|$|By 1964, the Wilderness Act {{protected}} portions <b>of</b> the <b>Sierra</b> as primitive {{areas where}} humans are simply temporary visitors. Gradually, 20 wilderness areas were established to protect scenic backcountry <b>of</b> the <b>Sierra.</b> These wilderness areas include the John Muir Wilderness (protecting the eastern slope <b>of</b> the <b>Sierra</b> {{and the area}} between Yosemite and Kings Canyon Parks), and wilderness {{within each of the}} National Parks. Because of the Wilderness Act and the rocky terrain in the area, plans to construct two trans-Sierra highways across this portion <b>of</b> the <b>Sierra</b> Escarpment, State Route 168 and State Route 190, were abandoned; the two highways each remain split as discontiguous segments on either side <b>of</b> the <b>Sierra.</b>|$|R

5|$|Aniru Sahib Sahib Conteh {{was born}} on 6 August 1942, {{in the town of}} Jawi Folu, Eastern Province, Sierra Leone, the son of a farmer and chief of the village. He moved to Freetown, the capital <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone, after his mother died while he was in his teens. Conteh studied {{chemistry}} and biology at Fourah Bay College and began teaching after receiving his BSc. In 1968, he began studying medicine in Nigeria at the modern University of Ibadan, graduating in 1974. Conteh spent the next four years employed by the Ibadan Teaching Hospital. He returned home to Sierra Leone in 1979. Conteh married and raised a family with his wife Sarah, producing several sons and daughters.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Barbara was the easternmost landfalling Pacific {{hurricane}} on record. As {{the first}} hurricane of the 2013 Pacific hurricane season, Barbara developed from a low-pressure area while located southeast of Mexico on May28. It headed slowly north-northeastward and strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} early on the following day. After recurving to the northeast, Barbara intensified into a Category1 hurricane on May29 and made landfall in Chiapas at peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983mbar (hPa; 29.03inHg). When the hurricane made landfall, {{it was the second}} earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966. Barbara then moved across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and dissipated within the mountainous terrain <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Madre de Chiapas on May 30.|$|E
5|$|Massaquoi {{was born}} in Gendema in the Pujehun District of {{southern}} Sierra Leone in 1912 (others give 1904), the daughter of Momolu Massaquoi, who in 1922 became Liberia's consul general in Hamburg, Germany, and Massa Balo Sonjo. At birth, she was given the name Fatima Beendu Sandimanni, but dropped the Beendu before it became part of her records. Her paternal grandfather was King Lahai Massaquoi of the Gallinas, and her paternal grandmother was Queen Sandimannie (or Sandimani) <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone's aristocratic Vai family. She was also the great-great-granddaughter of King Siaka of Gendema who ruled over the Gallinas in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Newton often openly mocked {{the captain}} by {{creating}} obscene poems and songs {{about him that}} became so popular the crew began to join in. He entered into disagreements with several colleagues that resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced {{to work on a}} plantation in Sierra Leone near the Sherbro River. After several months he came to think <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence. Newton claimed the only reason he left was because of Polly.|$|E
5|$|Nicolls {{had many}} such grand schemes for trade between Britain and its colonies, but these all failed to materialise.

On 3 November 1828 Captain William Bate replaced Nicolls as commandant on Ascension. Nicolls was given the substantive rank of major before leaving, on 8 May 1828.|$|E
5|$|RAF Chinooks {{have been}} widely {{deployed}} in support of British military engagements, serving their first wartime role in Operation Corporate, the Falklands War, in 1982. Chinooks were used in Operation Granby in the 1991 Gulf War, attached to large peace-keeping commitments in the Balkans, the continued British presence in Afghanistan, and in Operation Telic in the 2003 Iraq War. They provide routine supply and support missions to the British military, notably in Operation Banner in Northern Ireland. The helicopter has also been of use in military humanitarian missions and the extraction of civilians from warzones, such as the evacuation <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone in 2000, and the evacuation from Lebanon in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The highway was {{constructed}} between 1935 and 1938, originating at SR 82 in Whetstone and heading south into Sierra Vista. From there, it turned east for a stretch {{and then turned}} south following its current route to Bisbee. At this time, {{the section of the}} route corresponding to the current routing was paved, while the northern section was still a gravel road. The northern section was improved in 1942. Between 1961 and 1963, SR 90 took over the segment of SR 92 north <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Vista, leaving SR 92 to the section south of the city and east to Bisbee. Since then, the routing has not been modified.|$|E
5|$|The overall British {{operation}} was mostly completed by September 2000. The RUF began to disarm after political pressure, and later economic sanctions, were exerted on Liberia—which had supported the RUF {{in exchange for}} conflict diamonds smuggled out <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone. The Sierra Leonean government eventually signed a ceasefire with the RUF that obliged the latter to enter the Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) process. By September 2001, when the British training teams were replaced by an international force, the DDR process was almost complete. British forces continued {{to be involved in}} Sierra Leone by providing the largest contribution of personnel to the international training team and advising on a restructuring <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone's armed forces. A small force was deployed to the area in 2003 to ensure stability while several indictments and arrests were made by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The success of British operations in Sierra Leone vindicated several concepts, including the retention of high-readiness forces. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was keen to see Western interventions in other conflicts, and—along with France—supported the creation of several European Union Battlegroups for the purpose. As it happened, political opposition and later British commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq prevented further British operations in Africa.|$|E
5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement {{in the weeks}} and months prior to the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated in the creation of Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a lack of confidence in the military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake <b>of</b> <b>Sierra</b> Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E
