5|$|There {{are over}} two hundred events held {{throughout}} {{the year in the}} borough, including firework festivals, dragon boat racing, beach volleyball, handball and motocross, and the annual carnival in mid-August, which attracts around 70,000 people each year. Weymouth is the only port in the world to have hosted the start <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tall</b> Ships' Races three times—in 1983, 1987 and 1994; the 1994 race attracting 300,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|Spurred by {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion {{refurbishment}} a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the Merseyside Maritime Museum completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by Merseyside County Council had previously been located in the pilotage building and a salvage shed nearby. Also in 1986 work began on {{the largest of the}} dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the mezzanine level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to 'sales day at Harrods'.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a boom in}} {{skyscraper}} {{construction in}} Chicago from 1888 onwards. By 1893, Chicago had built 12 skyscrapers between 16 and 20 stories tall, tightly clustered {{in the center of}} the financial district. Chicago's skyscrapers, however, were constrained by the contemporary limits of steel-frame design and the muddy sub-soil in the city, which together limited most of their skyscrapers to around 16 or 17 stories. Chicago's skyscrapers rapidly became tourist destinations for the views of the wider city they provided from their upper floors and as attractive sites in their own right. Tourists were advised to hire cabs for street tours of the skyscrapers – by lying back in the cab, they would be able to safely take in the tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> buildings.|$|E

25|$|Man on a Balcony, {{with its}} monumental {{architecture}} of semi-abstract elements, {{is an open}} declaration {{of the principles of}} Cubist painting.

25|$|By {{the time}} of the 1925 World Series the right field {{pavilion}} had also been double-decked, and the angling right field wall and its scoreboard were reconstructed to align with the low right field wall, about 8 feet inside of it. This also resulted in the unique inward-pointing 90° angle in center field. Both versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> fence had the effect of keeping the neighbors in the adjacent row houses from watching the games for free.|$|E

25|$|A statue {{was created}} for Logan Circle, Philadelphia in 1926, {{designed}} by Alexander Stirling Calder. It does not depict Shakespeare himself, but rather the figures of Touchstone the jester from As You Like It, representing comedy, and Hamlet, representing tragedy. Touchstone is lounging with his head tilted laughing, his feet hanging over the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> stone pedestal and his left arm resting on Hamlet's legs. Hamlet is seated, brooding, his knife dangling over Touchstone's body. The opening lines of the famous All the world's a stage speech from As You Like It are inscribed on the pedestal beneath the figures.|$|E

25|$|Often a tree will be {{associated}} with oracles. The oak of Dodona was tended by priests who slept on the ground. Forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> oaks of the old Prussians were inhabited by gods who gave responses, and so numerous are the examples that the old Hebrew terebinth of the teacher, and the terebinth of the diviners may reasonably be placed in this category. Important sacred trees are also the object of pilgrimage, {{one of the most}} noteworthy being the branch of the Bo tree at Sri Lanka brought thither before the Christian era. The tree spirits will hold sway over the surrounding forest or district, and the animals in the locality are often sacred and must not be harmed.|$|E
25|$|At St Stephen's (1871), {{the tower}} has an {{accompanying}} stair turret that {{rises to the}} level below the tall upper belfry window. At that level, both the tower {{and the top of}} the turret are encircled by a battlement, as if the tower itself might well end there, as it does at St Paul's, Redfern. But it does not; it rises, somewhat narrower, and visually reduced by the clever play of overlapping forms. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> windows on the four sides is set into a slightly projecting plane, with its own gable, very similar in form to that which Blacket often used around doors. These rise like dormers between the broaches, overlapping the meeting of the spire and the tower, so the horizontal definition between the two occurs only at the corners. Unfortunately, in the 1990s the large poppyhead {{on the top of the}} spire became unsafe and was removed which has lessened the visual impact.|$|E

Common grasses here are needlegrass and needle-and-thread grass.|$|E

500|$|The {{first study}} showed infants a toy car that moved down an {{inclined}} track, disappeared behind a screen, and then reemerged {{at the other}} end, still on the track. The researchers created a [...] "possible event" [...] where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an [...] "impossible event." [...] In this situation, the toy mouse {{was placed on the}} tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car seemed to go through the mouse. [...] Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall. [...] The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for habituation patterns on the disappearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> carrot behind the wall (impossible event). Infants as young as 3½ months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more habituation at the possible event. This indicated that they may have been surprised by the impossible event, which suggested they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (object permanence) but also its location. The same was true <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> carrot in the second experiment. [...] This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.|$|E
500|$|The {{improved}} front-end layout {{applied to}} the first batch of [...] "Eastleigh Arthurs" [...] (Nos.E448E457) ensured continuous fast running on flat sections of track around London, although their propensity for speed was sometimes compromised over the hilly terrain west of Salisbury. The inside bearings of the Drummond [...] "watercart" [...] tenders proved problematic, as they were {{too small for the}} load carried and suffered from water ingress. The retention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> Drummond cab prevented use away from the Western section of the Southern Railway. Despite these problems, their operational reliability prompted the management to arrange the visit of No.E449 Sir Torre to the Darlington Railway Centenary celebrations in July 1925. No.E449 also recorded speeds of up to [...] on the South West Mainline near [...] in 1929. This proved that with the right components, Urie’s original design could perform well.|$|E
500|$|The [...] tall Faith, to {{the right}} of Charity, is holding a Eucharistic chalice; the [...] tall Charity is holding a {{cornucopia}} and a brazier (or flaming vase); and the [...] tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer. The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of Abundantia, Ceres, and Juno, all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands. Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the [...] "immediacy" [...] of the trope of lying in state, which was otherwise dominant on Quattrocento wall tombs.|$|E
