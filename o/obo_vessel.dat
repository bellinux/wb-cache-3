The test results cover three merchant ship designs, including one <b>OBO</b> <b>vessel</b> and two RO/RO vessels, having installed horsepower rangj. ng from 24, 000 to 37, 000 SHP. Limited discussion is presented on the relative effectiveness of installing a highly skewed propeller “ersus adding additional structural reinforce– ment on a vessel to reduce excessive “ibration. Some economic factors {{that should be considered}} by a ship owner contemplating a highly skewed propel– ler for a new ship design are pre– se”ted...|$|E
5000|$|The OBO carrier {{quickly became}} popular among {{shipowners}} {{around the world}} and as of today several hundreds of this type of vessel have been built. The ship type had its glory days in the early 1970s. In the 1980s, {{it became clear that the}} type required more maintenance than other vessels. Also, it was expensive to [...] "switch" [...] from wet to dry cargoes, and it took valuable time. If you had carried oil, you could switch to carrying ore or other dirty bulk cargoes, but not grain or other clean bulk cargoes. As the 1970s-built <b>OBO</b> <b>vessels</b> become older, most of them were used either as pure tankers or as pure ore carriers.|$|R
