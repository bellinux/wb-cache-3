25|$|Enamel {{does not}} contain collagen, as found in other hard tissues such as dentin and bone, but it does contain two unique classes of {{proteins}}: amelogenins and enamelins. While the role of these proteins is not fully understood, {{it is believed that}} they aid in the development of enamel by serving as a framework for minerals to form on, among other functions. Once it is mature, enamel is almost totally without the softer <b>organic</b> matter. <b>Enamel</b> is avascular and has no nerve supply within it and is not renewed, however, it is not a static tissue as it can undergo mineralization changes.|$|R

The aim of this research activity is to assess the prospects of exploitation of such insulating materials inside electromechanical devices intended to operate in presence of gamma photonic fields as in the frame of nuclear plant dismantling or, in general, of the manipulation of radioactive products. Suitable specimens, insulated by the considered enamel, have been set-up using enameled wire exposed to gamma photonic irradiation within a panoramic irradiator endowed with Co 60 gamma sources. These pre-aged specimens have been subjected to electrical aging tests up to the enamel breakdown condition, chosen as end-point criterion, in order to study the electrical performances of the considered wires.

40|$|Enamel {{crystallites}} form in {{a protein}} matrix located proximal to the ameloblast cell layer. This unique organic extracellular matrix is constructed from structural protein components biosynthesized and secreted by ameloblasts. To date, three distinct classes of enamel matrix proteins have been cloned. These are the amelogenins, tuftelin, and ameloblastin, with recent data implicating ameloblastin gene expression during cementogenesis. The <b>organic</b> <b>enamel</b> extracellular matrix undergoes assembly {{to provide a}} three-dimensional array of protein domains that carry out the physiologic function of guiding enamel hydroxyapatite crystallite formation. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have surveyed these three known enamel gene products {{for their ability to}} direct self-assembly. We measured the capacity of the enamel gene products to direct protein-to-protein interactions, a characteristic of enamel proteins predicated to be required for self-assembly. We provide additional evidence for the self-assembly nature of amelogenin and tuftelin. Ameloblastin self-assembly could not be demonstrated, nor were protein-to-protein interactions observed between ameloblastin and either amelogenin or tuftelin. Within the limits of the yeast two-hybrid assay, these findings constrain the emerging model of enamel matrix assembly by helping to define the limits of enamel matrix protein-protein interactions that are believed to guide enamel mineral crystallite formation...|$|E

In this work the PD evolution is monitored both for conventional and corona resistant enamels subjected to different voltage waveforms at different amplitudes. Suitable twisted pair specimens insulated by the considered enamels have been prepared and tested.

Pulsed and sinusoidal voltage waveforms have been applied having different amplitudes.

Twenty pregnant rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, irradiated, selenium and selenium/irradiated. The selenium and selenium/irradiated groups received 0. 3 mg/ kg of sodium selenite at 18 days of pregnancy. The rats of the irradiated and selenium/ irradiated groups received a single dose of 4 Gy of X rays on the abdominal region at the 19 th day of pregnancy.

40|$|Healthy dental enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized human tissue. Though acellular, nonvital, and without {{capacity}} for turnover or repair, it can nevertheless last a lifetime. Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a collective term for failure of normal enamel development, covering diverse clinical phenotypes that typically show Mendelian inheritance patterns. One subset, known as hypomaturation AI, is characterised by near-normal volumes of <b>organic</b> <b>enamel</b> matrix but with weak, creamy-brown opaque enamel that fails prematurely after tooth eruption. Mutations in genes critical to enamel matrix formation have been documented, but current understanding of other key events in enamel biomineralization is limited. We investigated autosomal-recessive hypomaturation AI in a consanguineous Pakistani family. A whole-genome SNP autozygosity screen identified a locus on chromosome 15 q 21. 3. Sequencing candidate genes revealed a point mutation in the poorly characterized WDR 72 gene. Screening of WDR 72 in a panel of nine additional hypomaturation AI families revealed the same mutation in a second, apparently unrelated, Pakistani family and two further nonsense mutations in Omani families. Immunohistochemistry confirmed intracellular localization in maturation-stage ameloblasts. WDR 72 function is unknown, but as a putative β propeller {{is expected to be}} a scaffold for protein-protein interactions. The nearest homolog, WDR 7, is involved in vesicle mobilization and Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis at synapses. Vesicle trafficking is important in maturation-stage ameloblasts with respect to secretion into immature enamel and removal of cleaved enamel matrix proteins via endocytosis. This raises the intriguing possibility that WDR 72 is critical to ameloblast vesicle turnover during enamel maturation...|$|E

30|$|Corrosion is {{a natural}} {{destructive}} phenomenon where pure metals interact with the environment to form non-desirable metallic compounds. Protection of metals from corrosion {{is one of the}} major economic issues. Mild steel (MS) is an important metal which is widely applied in oil wells, constructional materials, automobiles and many other industries due to its excellent mechanical properties and low cost [1]. Hydrochloric acid solutions (approximately 0.5 – 1  M) are widely used in several industrial processes, some of the important fields of application being acid pickling of steel, chemical cleaning and processing, ore production and oil well acidification [2]. Corrosion of MS when exposed to aggressive acids, such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid results in such damage that needs either repair or replacement of the part leading to huge loss of resources. Corrosion of MS is worth investigating because such corrosions cause damage to pipelines, bridges, marine structures and construction materials bringing heavy economic losses worldwide. Corrosion is also one of the major concerns in the durability of materials and structures; and studies are continuously carried out to develop effective methods for corrosion control [3]. There are a number of methods for corrosion control but the choice depends on economics, safety requirements and technical considerations. Mitigation of MS corrosion is achieved through such means as galvanisation, <b>organic</b> coating (<b>enamel,</b> polymer, oils etc.) and using corrosion inhibitors [4, 5, 6] which form film by adsorbing on the metal surface. The organic corrosion inhibitors although proved to be the best for the protection of MS, but they are restricted in some cases because of their toxicity. Therefore, the best means of protection is to adapt an inhibitor which is eco-friendly, easily soluble and effective at low concentration. The class of organic compounds which satisfy these conditions are drugs and their derivatives which are highly water soluble.|$|R

In this study, FT-Raman spectroscopy was used to evaluate chemical changes in enamel structure irradiated with Nd:YAG and Er:YAG lasers. Methods. We used 15 freshly-extracted, non-carious, human molars that were treated as follows: No treatment was carried out in group A (control group); Group B was irradiated with Er:YAG laser for 10 seconds under air and water spray; and Group C was irradiated with Nd:YAG laser for 10 seconds under air and water spray. After treatment, the samples were analyzed by FT-Raman spectroscopy. Results. The carbonate content evaluation with regard to the integrated area under the curve (1065 / 960 cm– 1) exhibited a significant reduction in its ratio in groups B and C. The organic content (2935 / 960 cm- 1) area exhibited a significant decrease after laser irradiation in group B and C. Conclusion.

40|$|The Netherlands, 30 % of the 11 -year-old {{children}} {{showed signs}} of erosive wear. At age 15 this prevalence increased to 44 % [El Aidi et al., 2010]. Erosive wear starts {{at a young age}} and, if unchecked, may com-promise the long-term prognosis of the dentition; there-fore early diagnosis and prevention of erosive tooth wear is necessary. The best way to limit dental erosion is to prevent con-tact between acids and tooth tissue. The role of saliva in this process is still not fully clear. Saliva can protect tooth tissue in several ways. Factors like salivary flow, pellicle and buffer capacity contribute to this protective role of saliva. After intake of acidic food or drinks saliva acts as a diluting agent, clearing the remnants of acids in the mouth. In earlier research it was found that a high salivary flow rate results in a better clearance of acids in the mouth [Järvinen et al., 1991]. The pellicle is a layer of proteins, which is derived from saliva and can form a diffusion barrier. The pellicle is be-lieved to protect the enamel and dentine against erosion [Wetton et al., 2007; Jager et al., 2011; White et al., 2012]. The formation of pellicle is influenced by several factors: the protein content in the <b>organic</b> matrix of <b>enamel</b> itself, and therefore its electronic charge [Lubarsky et al., 2012...|$|R
40|$|Collagen and {{amelogenin}} are {{two major}} extracellular organic matrix proteins of dentin and enamel, the mineralized tissues comprising a tooth crown. They both are present at the dentin-enamel boundary (DEB), a remarkably robust interface holding dentin and enamel together. It is believed that interactions of dentin and enamel protein assemblies regulate growth and structural organization of mineral crystals at the DEB, leading to a continuum {{at the molecular level}} between dentin and <b>enamel</b> <b>organic</b> and mineral phases. To gain insight into the mechanisms of the DEB formation and structural basis of its mechanical resiliency we have studied the interactions between collagen fibrils, amelogenin assemblies, and forming mineral in vitro, using electron microscopy. Our data indicate that collagen fibrils guide assembly of amelogenin into elongated chain or filament-like structures oriented along the long axes of the fibrils. We also show that the interactions between collagen fibrils and amelogenin-calcium phosphate mineral complexes lead to oriented deposition of elongated amorphous mineral particles along the fibril axes, triggering mineralization of the bulk of collagen fibril. The resulting structure was similar to the mineralized collagen fibrils found at the DEB, with arrays of smaller well organized crystals inside the collagen fibrils and bundles of larger crystals {{on the outside of the}} fibrils. These data suggest that interactions between collagen and amelogenin might play an important role in the formation of the DEB providing structural continuity between dentin and enamel...|$|R

The Y chromosome promotes both tooth crown enamel and dentin growth, whereas the effect of the X chromosome on crown growth seems to be restricted to enamel formation. Enamel growth is decisively influenced by cell secretory function and dentin growth by cell proliferation. It is suggested that these differential effects of the X and Y chromosomes on growth explain the expression of sexual dimorphism in various somatic features. These include tooth crown and root size, crown shape and the number of the teeth, and under the assumption of genetic pleiotropy, torus mandibularis, statural growth, and sex ratio.

40|$|Objective This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} fluoride varnishes on the progression of tooth erosion in vitro. Material and Methods: Forty-eight enamel and 60 root dentin samples were previously demineralized (0. 1 % citric acid, pH 2. 5, 30 min), leading to a baseline and erosive wear of 12. 9 and 11. 4 &# 181;m, respectively. The samples were randomly treated (6 h) with a 4 % TiF 4 varnish (2. 45 %F-, pH 1. 0), a 5. 42 % NaF varnish (2. 45 %F-, pH 5. 0), a placebo varnish and no varnish (control). The samples were then subjected to erosive pH cycles (4 x 90 s/day in 0. 1 % citric acid, intercalated with artificial saliva) for 5 days. The increment of the erosive tooth wear was calculated. In the case of dentin, this final measurement was done with and without the demineralized <b>organic</b> matrix (DOM). <b>Enamel</b> and dentin {{data were analyzed using}} ANOVA/Tukey&# 8217;s and Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn tests, respectively (p< 0. 05).

30|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} {{substance}} {{in the body and}} forms a solid, tough and wear-resistant surface for malaxation (Chai et al. 2009). In the mature state, it contains up to 98  % of inorganic phase (Table  3). Other components of enamel include remnants of the organic matrix and loosely bound water molecules. Interestingly, from the mechanical point of view, dental enamel was found to be a “metallic-like” deformable biocomposite, because enamel was found to have a similar stress–strain response to that of cast alloy and gold alloy, all of which showed work-hardening effect (He and Swain 2007). The crystals of biological apatite of enamel are much larger as evidenced by higher crystallinity (reflecting greater crystal size and perfection) demonstrated in their X-ray diffraction patterns than those of bone and dentine. Besides, enamel apatite has fewer ionic substitutions than bone or dentine mineral and more closely approximates the stoichiometric HA (Boskey 2007). The <b>organic</b> phase of <b>enamel</b> does not contain collagen. Instead, enamel has two unique classes of proteins called amelogenins and enamelins. While the role of these proteins is not fully understood yet, it is believed that both classes of proteins aid in the enamel development by serving as a framework support (Avery 2001; Nanci 2012; Margolis et al. 2006). The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts not only for its strength but also for its brittleness. Dentine, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support (Avery 2001; Nanci 2012). Shark enameloid is an intermediate form bridging enamel and dentine. It has enamel-like crystals of fluoridated biological apatite associated with collagen fibrils (Lowenstam and Weiner 1989; Rey et al. 2006; Prostak et al. 1993; Dahm and Risnes 1999; Carr et al. 2006; Enax et al. 2014). Due to the presence of fluorides, biological apatite of shark enameloid shows both higher crystal sizes and a more regular hexagonal symmetry if compared to non-fluoridated biological apatite of bones and teeth (Daculsi et al. 1997). Similar correlation between the presence of fluorides and crystal dimensions was found for enamel (Vieira et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is {{the name}} given to a {{clinically}} and genetically heterogeneous group of enamel biomineralisation defects with Mendelian patterns of inheritance. Enamel quantity and/or quality are affected, with inappropriate retention of enamel matrix proteins in the most cases, resulting in hypoplastic and/or hypomineralised phenotypes. AI most commonly occurs in apparent isolation from other co-segregating clinical abnormalities ('non-syndromic AI'). Instances of AI forming part of a diverse range of syndromes are recognised, but poorly described ('syndromic AI'). To date, reported {{studies have focused on}} the X-linked and dominant forms of non-syndromic AI which relate to two enamel matrix proteins (AMELX and ENAM) and more recently a cellular protein of unknown function (FAM 83 H). Only four mutations in 3 genes (ENAM, KLK 4 and MMP 20) have been described for autosomal recessive non-syndromic AI. This study aims to gain new insight into the genetic basis and phenotype of autosomal recessively inherited hypomineralised AI, both syndromic and non- syndromic forms, through genetic analysis in consanguineous families. A whole-genome SNP autozygosity screen in a non-syndrmoic AI family of Pakistani origin identified a new locus on chromosome 15 q 21. 3. Sequencing. candidate genes in multiple families revealed four different mutations in the poorly characterised WOR 72 gene which resulted in autosomal recessive non-syndromic AI (chapter Ill). Deciduous teeth - VI - extracted as part of clinical care from one individual with homozygous WOR 72 mutations, revealed normal enamel rod architecture, yet with abnormal inter-rod enamel revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Energy-dispersive X- ray (EOX) spectra were characterised by normal carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) peaks, excluding the possibility of retention of enamel matrix protein. However, transverse microradiography (TMR) revealed mineral content values significantly lower when compared to normal teeth, indicating hypomineralisation (chapter Ill). A whole-genome SNP autozygosity screen in a family, with syndromic AI and hypohidrosis identified a second locus on chromosome 11 p 15. 5 - q 13. 1. Sequencing the exons of every gene within the linked region revealed a missense mutation in the STlM 1 gene, which is a calcium ion sensor protein (chapter IV). Analyses of extracted permanent and exfoliated deciduous teeth from the proband patient (VII: 3) in family P 21 confirmed reduced mineral (as determined by TMR) and increased <b>organic</b> content in <b>enamel</b> (determined by EOX). SEM revealed poor quality enamel prisms which were obscured by an amorphous material. This amorphous material was removed by incubation with a-chymotrypsin, but not by incubation with lipase, which was consistent with the inappropriate presence of protein in the enamel. Western blot analyses of protein extracted from the affected enamel indicated the presence of albumin. The dentine was characterised by abnormal morphology on SEM. The only other clinical abnormality identified was hypohidrosis. In particular, there was no apparent involvement of other ectodermal tissues. 1 }].
