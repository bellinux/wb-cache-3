5|$|Makemake (45.79AU average), {{although}} {{smaller than}} Pluto, {{is the largest}} known <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classical Kuiper belt (that is, a Kuiper belt object not in a confirmed resonance with Neptune). Makemake is the brightest <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kuiper belt after Pluto. It was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008. Its orbit is far more inclined than Pluto's, at 29°.|$|E

5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen months later, Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} a second <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same region, Pallas.

5|$|Makemake (minor-planet {{designation}} 136472 Makemake) is a dwarf {{planet and}} perhaps the largest Kuiper belt <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classical population, with a diameter approximately two thirds that of Pluto. Makemake has one known satellite, S/2015 (136472) 1. Makemake's extremely low average temperature, about , means its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices.|$|E

5|$|Many {{groups are}} {{simultaneously}} groups {{and examples of}} other mathematical structures. In the language of category theory, they are group objects in a category, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> category of sets.|$|E

5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky after the Sun.

50|$|For {{the idea}} of listening, objects can be {{considered}} auditorily as compared to visually. The objects {{that are able to}} be experienced by sight and by sound can be thought of in a venn diagram, with mute and visible <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vision category, with aural and invisible <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sound category, and aural and visible <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overlapping category. <b>Objects</b> that do not fall into a specific category can be considered beyond the horizons of sound and sight.

5|$|The moons of Haumea are too faint {{to detect}} with telescopes smaller than about 2 metres in aperture, though Haumea itself has a visual {{magnitude}} of 17.5, {{making it the}} third-brightest <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kuiper belt after Pluto and Makemake, and easily observable with a large amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|With over 400 active volcanos, Io is {{the most}} geologically active <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, {{some of which are}} taller than Earth's Mount Everest. Unlike most {{satellites}} in the outer Solar System (which have a thick coating of ice), Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E

5|$|All {{versions}} of Perl do automatic data-typing and automatic memory management. The interpreter knows {{the type and}} storage requirements of every data <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program; it allocates and frees storage for them as necessary using reference counting (so it cannot deallocate circular data structures without manual intervention). Legal type conversions — for example, conversions from number to string — are done automatically at run time; illegal type conversions are fatal errors.|$|E
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E

5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the Sun and the only <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any hard <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
40|$|During image {{acquisition}} in machine vision, due to limited {{depth of field}} of lens, {{it is possible to}} take clear image of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene which are <b>in</b> focus only. <b>The</b> remaining <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene will be out of focus. A possible solution to bring clear images of all <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene is image fusion. Image fusion is a process of combining multiple images to form the composite image with extended information content. This paper uses three band expansive higher density discrete wavelet transform to fuse two numbers of images focusing different <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same scene and also proposes three methods for image fusion. Experimental results on multi focused image fusion are presented in terms of root mean square, peak signal to noise ratio and quality index to illustrate the proposed fusion methods...|$|R
