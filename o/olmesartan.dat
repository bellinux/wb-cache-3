25|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} {{valsartan}} and <b>olmesartan,</b> are metabolized {{in some way}} by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of losartan to EXP 3174 and the slow metabolizing of valsartan and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and <b>olmesartan</b> is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
25|$|Around 14% of orally {{ingested}} losartan is metabolized to its 5-carboxylic acid metabolite EXP 3174. As mentioned before, candesartan cilexetil and <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil are inactive ester prodrugs {{that are}} completely hydrolyzed to their active forms by esterases during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. These three metabolites are more potent AT1 receptor antagonists than their prodrugs. The other ARBs {{do not have}} active metabolites.|$|E
25|$|Candesartan and <b>olmesartan</b> {{have the}} highest {{affinity}} for the AT1 receptors, followed by irbesartan and eprosartan.

50|$|The usual {{recommended}} {{starting dose}} of <b>olmesartan</b> is 20 mg once daily. The dose {{may be increased}} to 40 mg {{after two weeks of}} therapy, if further reduction in blood pressure is desirable. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have greater effect, and twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily. No adjustment of dosage is typically necessary for advanced age, renal impairment, or hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics), <b>olmesartan</b> should be initiated with caution; consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose in such cases. If blood pressure is not controlled by Benicar alone, a diuretic may be added. Benicar may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Benicar may be administered with or without food.|$|E

40|$|Current {{hypertension}} guidelines recommend {{using two}} antihypertensive agents when blood pressure (BP) control is not achieved with one single agent. Objective: This {{study was designed}} to assess the antihypertensive benefit of the <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12. 5 mg combination versus <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, up-titration, multicentre, multinational, phase III study. Following a 2 -week single-blind placebo run-in phase, 846 hypertensive patients with mean seated systolic BP (SeSBP) of 160200 mmHg and mean seated diastolic BP (SeDBP) of 100120 mmHg were randomized (1 : 2 ratio) to receive double-blind treatment with <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg or <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg for 8 weeks (phase A). At week 8, patients not reaching BP goal (< 140 / 90 mmHg; < 130 / 80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus) were up-titrated from <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg or from <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg for an additional 8 weeks (phase B). Patients on goal continued their initial treatment. The primary efficacy parameter was the change in mean SeDBP during phase A. Results: <b>Olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg reduced mean SeDBP significantly more (- 18. 9 mmHg) than <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg (- 15. 8 mmHg) after 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (difference: - 3. 1 mmHg, p < 0. 0001). <b>Olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg also reduced mean SeSBP significantly more than <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg (- 5. 4 mmHg, p < 0. 0001). As a result, BP goal rates at week 8 were significantly higher with <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg than with <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg (58. 5 % vs 44. 3 %; odds ratio 1. 88; 95 % CI 1. 32, 2. 54). During phase B, mean BP reductions were greater in patients up-titrated from <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg than in those continuing on <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg (SeDBP: 9. 3 mmHg vs 0. 5 mmHg; SeSBP: 12. 4 mmHg vs 0. 5 mmHg). Similarly, mean BP reductions were greater in patients up-titrated from <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg than in those continuing on <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg (SeDBP: 8. 0 mmHg vs 0. 3 mmHg; SeSBP: 12. 1 mmHg vs 0. 4 mmHg). In patients not on goal at week 8, addition of HCTZ 12. 5 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg or up-titration from <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg brought additional patients to goal at week 16 (38. 8 % vs 36. 9 %). All treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion: The <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg combination is superior to <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil 40 mg monotherapy in reducing SeDBP and SeSBP and increasing BP goal rates after 8 weeks.

40|$|Background/Aims: Blockage of the renin-angiotensin II system (RAS) {{prevents}} or delays albuminuria in diabetic patients. The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of the angiotensin receptor blocker <b>olmesartan</b> on albuminuria in a murine model of diabetic nephropathy. Methods: Male db/db diabetic mice were fed with placebo or 20 mg/kg <b>olmesartan</b> by daily gavage for 12 weeks. Conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes were treated with glucose, angiotensin II, <b>olmesartan</b> or p 38 inhibitor s 8307 in different experimental conditions after differentiation. Results: <b>Olmesartan</b> reduced albuminuria in db/db mice without change in body weight and glycemia. The increase of apoptotic cells and decrease of podocytes in the diabetic glomerulus were prevented by <b>olmesartan.</b> Moreover, <b>olmesartan</b> restored silent mating type information regulation 1 (SIRT 1) expression in diabetic glomeruli. Furthermore, <b>olmesartan</b> treatment suppressed p 38 phosphorylation but did not restore adenosine 5 ‘-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in the diabetic glomerulus. In vitro study revealed that <b>olmesartan</b> prevented angiotensin II/p 38 /SIRT 1 induced podocyte apoptosis, but it only slightly prevented high glucose/AMPK/SIRT 1 induced podocyte apoptosis. In addition, the p 38 inhibitor s 8307 reversed SIRT 1 expression and angiotensin II induced podocyte apoptosis.

40|$|Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, is {{clinically}} {{used as an}} {{immunosuppressive agent}} in organ transplantation, but its use is limited due to its marked nephrotoxicity. The present study investigated the effect of <b>olmesartan</b> (angiotensin receptor blocker) on tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. A total of 24 rats were divided into four groups, which included control, tacrolimus, tacrolimus + <b>olmesartan,</b> and <b>olmesartan</b> groups. Tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity was assessed biochemically and histopathologically. Tacrolimus significantly increased BUN and creatinine level.

40|$|Hypertension is {{the leading}} cause of stroke, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. One of the key {{regulators}} of blood pressure is the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). <b>Olmesartan</b> medoxomil, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), counteracts some of the primary effects of the RAAS by selectively and irreversibly binding to the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT 1 -R). The pharmacokinetic profile of this ARB allows for the convenience of one a day dosing. The pharmacodynamic profile of <b>olmesartan</b> is favorable because it is neither metabolized by, induces, nor inhibits the CYP 450 isozyme system. The metabolism of the prodrug to the active form occurs in the gut by the enzyme arylesterase. No further metabolism and a lack of interaction with the CYP 450 isozyme system leads to very few drug interactions with <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil. Studies have been conducted to compare <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil to other angiotensin receptor blockers. The efficacy of <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil has been compared to other classes of antihypertensive agents. Results of all trials have proven non-inferiority of <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil to other antihypertensive agents; some studies have shown superior blood pressure control provided by <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil when starting dosages are evaluated. Overall, <b>olmesartan</b> medoxomil has the potential to facilitate the achievement of blood pressure goals, enhance compliance with a once daily dosing regimen, and is associated with minimal side effects. <b>Olmesartan</b> medoxomil has been proven to be a safe and effective antihypertensive drug when compared to other ARBs and other antihypertensive agents...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Angiotensin II {{receptor}} blockers (ARBs), including <b>olmesartan</b> and candesartan, {{are widely}} used antihypertensive agents. Many clinical {{studies have demonstrated that}} ARBs have organ-protecting effects, e. g., cardioprotection, vasculoprotection and renoprotection. However, the effect of prolonged <b>olmesartan</b> monotherapy on lipid metabolism in patients with hypertension is less well studied. We performed a retrospective observational study to compare the effects of <b>olmesartan</b> with those of candesartan, focusing on lipid metabolism and renal function. Methods We used data from the Clinical Data Warehouse of Nihon University School of Medicine obtained between Nov 1, 2004 and Feb 28, 2011, to identify cohorts of new <b>olmesartan</b> users (n = 168) and candesartan users (n = 266). We used propensity-score weighting to adjust for differences in all covariates (age, sex, comorbid diseases, previous drugs) between <b>olmesartan</b> and candesartan users, and compared serum chemical data including serum triglyceride (TG), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), potassium, creatinine and urea nitrogen. The mean exposure of <b>olmesartan</b> and candesartan users was 126. 1 and 122. 8 days, respectively. Results After adjustment, there were no statistically significant differences in all covariates between <b>olmesartan</b> and candesartan users. The mean age was 60. 7 and 61. 0 years, and 33. 4 % and 33. 7 % of <b>olmesartan</b> and candesartan users were women, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in mean values for all laboratory tests between baseline and during the exposure period in both <b>olmesartan</b> and candesartan users. In <b>olmesartan</b> users, the reduction of serum TG level was significant in comparison with that in candesartan users. Other parameters of lipid profile and renal function showed no statistically significant difference in the change from baseline to during the exposure period between <b>olmesartan</b> and candesartan users. Conclusions In this study, we observed a more beneficial effect on lipid metabolism, a reduction of serum TG, with <b>olmesartan</b> monotherapy than with candesartan monotherapy. However, there were no clinically significant changes in the levels of all test parameters between baseline and during the exposure period with both drugs. These results suggest that the influence of <b>olmesartan</b> or candesartan monotherapy on lipid metabolism and renal function is small, and that they can be safely used in patients with hypertension. </p...|$|E
