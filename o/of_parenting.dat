Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E

MethodsWe evaluated the QOL <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> asthmatic and healthy children aged between 8 and 16, using the generic WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. We also evaluated the internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha (αC), in order to determine whether the tool had good validity for the target audience. ResultsThe study included 162 individuals with a mean age of 43. 8 ± 13. 6 years, of which 104 were female (64. 2 %) and 128 were married (79. 0 %). When assessing the QOL, the group <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> healthy children had higher scores than the group <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> asthmatic children in the four areas evaluated by the questionnaire (Physical, Psychological Health, Social Relationships and Environment), indicating a better quality of life.

40|$|This {{case-control study}} {{compared}} the caregiving experience of adult daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> {{with and without}} dementia who resided in the community. A synthesis of diverse theoretical perspectives, developed by the researcher, provided direction for this study. The data used in the analysis were drawn from the 1991 - 92 Canadian Study of Health and Aging. A representative sample of 106 daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia and 45 daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> without dementia provided information regarding the context, stressors, and the level and correlates of depressive symptomatology associated with provision <b>of</b> care to <b>parents.</b> Daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia tended to be slightly older, single or widowed, co-resided with their parent and used more formal care services when compared to daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> without dementia. Differences between groups were also found regarding the stressors they experienced while providing care. More specifically, daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia assisted with more personal and instrumental care. Their parent's functional status was more impaired and they contended with more behavioural disturbances and experienced greater burden than daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> without dementia. There were no statistical differences between groups with respect to mean scores on the CES-D scale. However, fully one quarter <b>of</b> daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia and one fifth <b>of</b> daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> without dementia achieved scores indicative {{of at least a}} mild level of depressive symptomatology. Finally, self-reported health, health interferences, the need for additional formal care services and feelings of caregiver burden were associated with depressive symptoms for both groups of daughters. In addition, for daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia, depressive symptoms were associated with the provision of personal care tasks, behavioural disturbances and the functional status <b>of</b> <b>parents.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

25|$|Fostering {{resilience}} {{in children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} children’s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience. Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience. Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.|$|E
