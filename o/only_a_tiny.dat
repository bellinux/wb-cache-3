5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue to the rear floor of the mouth is called the plica sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an {{underdeveloped}} structure consisting of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> outgrowth {{on the floor of the}} mouth. The point where the plica sublingualis attaches to the rear floor of the mouth marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|E
5|$|Scientists will {{probably}} never be certain {{of the largest and}} smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed. This is because <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E

50|$|This crater is {{distinctive}} for {{an interior}} floor that is level and nearly featureless. It {{is marked by}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craterlets, with <b>a</b> single small craterlet near the north-northeast inner wall. The rim and inner wall has been worn and rounded by impacts, although <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craters lie across the rim. Attached {{to the outside of}} the western rim is a crater pair, with the larger of the two designated Kircher D. A small, cup-shaped crater lies on the narrow neck of ground between Kircher and Wilson.|$|R
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E
5|$|Yerkes' first {{acquisition}} in London was the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE). The {{company had}} parliamentary permission {{to build a}} deep-level tube railway from Charing Cross to Hampstead and Highgate, but {{had been unable to}} raise the finance, selling <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of the shares available. Robert Perks, a solicitor for a number of railway companies and Member of Parliament for Louth, had suggested the CCE to Yerkes and the American's consortium bought the company for £100,000 (approximately £ today) on 28 September 1900.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the social}} status of nobles, officials, farmers, and artisan-craftsmen were {{considered}} above the station of the lowly registered merchant, wealthy and successful businessmen acquired huge fortunes which {{allowed them to}} rival the social prestige {{of even the most}} powerful nobles and highest officials. Slaves were {{at the bottom of the}} social order, yet they represented <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> portion of the overall population. Retainers attached themselves to the estates of wealthy landowners, while medical physicians and state-employed religious occultists could make a decent living. People of all social classes believed in various deities, spirits, immortals, and demons. While Han Daoists were organized into small groups chiefly concerned with achieving immortality through various means, by the mid 2nd century CE they formed large hierarchical religious societies that challenged imperial authority and viewed Laozi (fl. 6th century BCE) as a holy prophet.|$|E
50|$|The oval-shaped Anders G intrudes {{slightly}} {{into the}} southeast rim of Anders. There is <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> double-crater formation {{attached to the}} exterior of the northeast rim, and a short valley cuts into the northern wall. The interior floor is relatively flat, and is marked <b>only</b> by <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> crater on the eastern wall.|$|R
25|$|There exist both continuous-wave and pulsed OPOs. The {{latter are}} easier to build, since the high {{intensity}} lasts <b>only</b> for <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of <b>a</b> second, which damages the nonlinear optical material and the mirrors less than a continuous high intensity.|$|R

5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.|$|E
5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> {{fraction of the}} power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required {{a return to the}} facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

50|$|The outer rim of Katchalsky is {{not quite}} circular, with outward bulges {{to the east and}} north, giving it a flat side along the northeastern edge. The rim is not {{markedly}} eroded, and the interior contains <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craterlets.|$|R
