5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} positions {{require a}} bachelor's degree or similar {{in a natural}} <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> science as well as laboratory experience in general, organic, and analytical chemistry.

5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|Metal borides {{are used}} for coating tools through {{chemical}} vapor deposition <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> vapor deposition. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties {{to those of the}} bulk boride.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined}} by an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E

5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all.

5|$|Schnaufer {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} of war by the British Army in Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. According to Schumann, {{he was taken to}} England for interrogation. In this account British authorities were especially interested in knowing whether his achievements had been made under the influence of methamphetamine or other stimulating psychoactive drugs which induce temporary improvements in either mental <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> functions or both. He was released later that year in November following a bout of diphtheria.|$|E

Although the centaurs share a reddish or neutral coloration with many SDOs, their nuclei are bluer, indicating a fundamental chemical <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> difference. One hypothesis is that comet nuclei are resurfaced as they approach the Sun by subsurface materials which subsequently bury the older material.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|To add {{enforcement}} to the 15th Amendment, Congress passed {{an act that}} guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans; Grant signed the bill, known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31, 1870. This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans. This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation, bribery, <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Warning signals do not {{necessarily}} require that a species actually possesses chemical <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> defences to deter predators. Mimics such as the nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous coral snake species, have essentially piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The evolution of a warning signal by a mimicking species that resembles a species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Within 100 {{years of}} the {{appearance}} of Mendeleev's table in 1869 {{it has been estimated}} that around 700 different periodic table versions were published. As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have been shaped, for example, like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate, octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1524, Bucer {{concentrated}} on the main issue dividing leading reformers, the eucharist. In this dispute, he attempted to mediate between Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. The two theologians disagreed on whether the body and blood of Christ were physically present within the elements of bread and wine during {{the celebration of the}} Lord's Supper. Luther believed in a corporeal <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> real presence of Christ; and Zwingli believed Christ's body and blood where made present by the Holy Spirit. By late 1524, Bucer had abandoned the idea of corporeal real presence and, after some exegetical studies, accepted Zwingli's interpretation. However, he did not believe the Reformation depended on either position but on faith in Christ, other matters being secondary. In this respect he differed from Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect <b>or</b> <b>physical</b> damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E
