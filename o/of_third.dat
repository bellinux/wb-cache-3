5|$|A disappointing opening {{sequence}} of the 1980–81 season was followed by six wins in six games in September, and Bremner won his second Manager of the Month award. The good results continued {{for the rest of}} the campaign, and Rovers were promoted in third place. He signed Celtic's Colin Douglas for the challenge <b>of</b> <b>Third</b> Division football, but otherwise remained loyal to his promotion squad for the approaching 1981–82 season. Another strong September, six wins seeing the club rise to second in the table, won Bremner the Third Division Manager of the Month award. However a lean spell would follow, and from November to February Doncaster failed to win in the league. Results again picked up with only two defeats in the last 14 games, and they ended the campaign in 19th spot, three points above the relegation zone.|$|E

Upon returning to the show in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence <b>of</b> <b>Third</b> World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E

5000|$|Breathing gas management: The {{breathing}} {{gas supply}} must last the diver until {{out of the}} overhead environment. There are several strategies for gas management. The most common protocol is the rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds,</b> in which one <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the initial gas supply is used for ingress, one third for egress, and one third to support another team member {{in the case of}} an emergency. This is a very simple method, but is not always sufficient. UK practice is to adhere to the rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds,</b> but with an added emphasis on keeping depletion of the separate air systems [...] "balanced," [...] so that the complete loss of any single gas supply will still leave the diver with sufficient gas to return safely. The rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> makes no allowance for increased air consumption that the stress caused by the loss of an air system may induce. Dissimilar tank sizes among the divers are also not allowed for by the rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds,</b> and a sufficient reserve should be calculated for each dive. UK practice is to assume that each diver is completely independent, as in a typical UK sump there is usually nothing that a buddy can do to assist a diver in trouble. Most UK cave divers dive solo. US sump divers follow a similar protocol. The rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> was devised as an approach to diving Floridas caves - they typically have high outflow currents, which help to reduce air consumption when exiting. In a cave system with little or no outflow it is prudent to reserve more air than is provided by the rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> {{is applied}} by {{aligning}} a subject with the guide lines and their intersection points, placing the horizon {{on the top}} or bottom line, or allowing linear features in the image to flow from section to section. The main reason for observing the rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> is to discourage placement of the subject at the center, or prevent a horizon from appearing to divide the picture in half. Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, authors of the book An Introduction to Film Analysis: Technique and Meaning in Narrative Film state that the use <b>of</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> is [...] "favored by cinematographers {{in their effort to}} design balanced and unified images" [...] (page 40).|$|R

5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices of real estate west <b>of</b> <b>Third</b> Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E
