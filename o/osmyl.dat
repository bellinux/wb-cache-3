40|$|Although Absorption Edge Spectroscopy {{has been}} widely applied to the {{speciation}} of actinide elements, specifically at the LIII edge, understanding and interpretation of actinide edge spectra are not complete. In that sense, semi-quantitative analysis is scarce. In this paper, different aspects of edge simulation are presented, including semi-quantitative approaches. Comparison is made between various actinyl (U, Np) aquo or hydroxy compounds. An excursion into transition metal osmium chemistry allows us to compare the structurally related <b>osmyl</b> and uranyl hydroxides. The edge shape and characteristic features are discussed within the multiple scattering picture {{and the role of}} the first coordination sphere as well as contributions from the water solvent are described...|$|E
40|$|The syntheses and redox {{properties}} of trans-dioxoosmium(VI) Schiff-base Complexes are described. The crystal structure of trans-[OsVIO 2 (3 -t-Bu-saltmen) ] has been determined: C 28 H 38 N 2 O 4 Os, space group P 21 /c, a = 11. 918 (6) Å, b = 10. 416 (1) Å, c = 23. 53 (1) Å, β = 102. 91 (3) °, Z = 4, R = 0. 062 for 3651 observed Mo Kα data. The measured <b>osmyl</b> Os-O bond distances are 1. 722 (8) and 1. 760 (7) Å; other than this, the molecule conforms well to idealized C 2 symmetry. Both electrochemical oxidation and reduction of trans-dioxoosmium(VI) Schiff-base complexes are irreversible in acetonitrile. © 1988 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
