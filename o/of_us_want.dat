25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{has been}} quoted: [...] "Politics is like {{football}} for me. Labour is my team {{and even if}} you don't like a striker you don't give up supporting the whole team. Labour is the lesser of two evils. What else should we have? Anarchy? Someone has to be responsible." [...] Prior to the 2005 general election, Gallagher stated that he was still supporting the Labour government partly because of his concern that [...] "Phil Collins is threatening to come back and live here. And let's face it, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> that".|$|E
500|$|Clash {{resigned}} from Sesame Workshop on November 20, 2012, and {{released a statement}} saying, [...] "Personal matters have diverted {{attention away from the}} important work 'Sesame Street' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately." [...] Sesame Workshop also released a statement: [...] "Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want,</b> and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has {{resigned from}} 'Sesame Street.'" [...] They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash's understudy and would take over his roles on the show.|$|E

500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage {{might be a good}} thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Other songs {{allude to}} darker themes {{of fear and}} {{personal}} insecurities. Beyoncé noted that the album displayed [...] "sides of [...] {{that only a few}} people had seen", adding that [...] "all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> happiness... sometimes {{you have to take the}} insecurities to get to the secure place. And all of those things I feel happy to express". Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold forth on the most important issues in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers are spending more time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... I suspect the writers are aware that ultimately what all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and it feels so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going {{to be some kind of}} subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sometimes {{you talk}} pure nonsense,' said Gerald to Birkin. 'As {{a matter of}} fact, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wants</b> our throat cut, and most other {{people would like to}} cut it for us--some time or other--' ...|$|R

60|$|We got {{together}} {{every time we}} could because each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wanted</b> to pump the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew {{from the heart of}} May Martha Mangum--rather a mixed metaphor; Goodloe Banks would never have been guilty of that. That is the way of rivals.|$|R
2500|$|Down manager James McCartan {{paid tribute}} to Cork [...] "Because I do feel Cork were deserving winners on the day. We've no qualms about that at all". He also {{expressed}} pride in his own players. Down forward Danny Hughes said: [...] "Well, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to be one-hit wonders. There {{are a lot of}} young lads that came in this year, and there is a great development squad coming through. But we know these days don't happen every year, making All-Ireland finals. Hopefully this will make them hungrier, going forward into next year".|$|E

[...] The vote was bipartisan in both its support and its opposition. [...] Two of the committee's liberal Democrat members voted against the bill and another Democrat simply voted [...] "present" [...] rather than for either side. [...] Three Republicans {{voted in favor of}} the bill. [...] After the passage of the resolution, Senator Corker stated that [...] "None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> the U.S. mired down in another conflict, so the committee has significantly limited the president’s original authorization." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a post-show {{interview}} clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani {{said about}} {{their status as}} instrumentalists, [...] "I mean, I think we discussed singing for half a second, {{and then it just}} kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn't go back to it because we were comfortable enough." [...] Drummer Chris Hrasky added, [...] "I think we just liked the idea of a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't think any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us." ...|$|E
5000|$|Every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wants</b> to take beautiful, striking, {{extraordinary}} pictures. Every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{is struggling}} with his own style.

Let us find a new common denominator in the struggle, not to follow our own standards of invention. Don’t cover—discover! ...|$|R

5000|$|Throughout their marriage, the O'Neals mostly lived apart, {{and they}} had no children. [...] "We {{discussed}} these things before we were married," [...] says Hamilton.

We wanted to be 100 percent of whatever we were." ...|$|R
2500|$|During the {{recording}} of her previous album, Under the Pink (1994), Amos's longtime professional and romantic relationship with Eric Rosse, who co-produced {{a considerable amount of}} her pre-Pele work, disintegrated. That loss, combined with a few subsequent encounters with men during the Under the Pink promotional tour, forced Amos to re-evaluate her relationship with men and masculinity. Amos explained, [...] "In my relationships with men, I was always musician enough, but not woman enough, I always met men in my life as a musician, and there would be magic, adoration. But then it would wear off. All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to be adored, even for five minutes a day, and nothing these men gave me was ever enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|After The Little Heroes {{had broken}} up Roger Hart (as Roger Wells) became a writer and {{meditation}} trainer. His books on meditation include: Happy to Burn: Meditation to Energise Your Spirit (Lothian 1997) and Love & Imagination. His first novel, Levin's God (2004), was published by Fremantle Arts Centre Press. The Sydney Morning Heralds reviewer, Juliette Hughes, felt the book was [...] "like the reminiscences of an old rock-dog" [...] and his writing was [...] "prolific and specific and sometimes tells more than some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to know, but keeps us turning those hundreds of pages just {{to find out what}} happens to everyone". John Taylor became a film maker and graphics designer. He won an AFI award for The Huge Adventures of Trevor, a Cat in the category of Best Short Animation in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2017, Thune {{became the}} center of media {{attention}} for his response to the mass murder in Las Vegas. [...] "It sounds like [...] used conversion kits and other things, you know, to make the weapons more lethal," [...] Thune said. [...] "We’ll look at the facts when we get them all in here. I think a lot <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> {{to do everything we can}} to prevent tragedies like that from happening again. You know - it's an open society. And when somebody does what he wants to do - it's going to be hard to prevent anything. But I think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions. To protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said — get small.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Cumberland Vane, airily, [...] "you didn't {{believe in}} religion, you see--so {{we thought you}} were safe at any rate. You went further in your {{language}} than most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wanted</b> to go; no good in just hurting one's mother's feelings, I think. But of course we all knew you were right, and, really, we relied on you." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wanted</b> to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|R
40|$|For {{the final}} assignment, our group chose to add normal mapping and shadow volumes. We chose these topics {{for a couple}} {{different}} reasons. For normal mapping, one the group members had some background in normal mapping and the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wanted</b> to learn how it worked and how to implement it. Similar for shadow volumes, we wanted {{to learn more about}} how it worked and try it out for ourselves...|$|R
2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us." [...] In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want to}} do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,' [...] " [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross — and, by extension, Walker — was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E

5000|$|The {{jury found}} him guilty of six counts. [...] "I think that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to find him}} guilty," [...] {{one of the jurors}} said, [...] "But there was just too much {{evidence}} on most of the counts." [...] He was also found guilty of trying to escape from the police. He faced a maximum sentence of fifteen years and four months in prison, and was sentenced to ten years.|$|R
5000|$|Newton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} [...] "I remember all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wanting</b> to write a hardcore record the kids were going to hate."

60|$|We {{could not}} gainsay this, and as not one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to kill the}} animal or let her go, Jones had his way.
