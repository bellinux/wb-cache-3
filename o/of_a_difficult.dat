5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E

That same year, Stackpole traveled to Mexico City to see Rivera working on some of his 124 frescoes in the courtyard of the Secretariat of Public Education. Returning with a small Rivera painting, Stackpole gave it to San Francisco Arts Commission president William Gerstle (who was initially unimpressed), and began a several-year effort to bring Rivera to work in California.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic primary for the 2010 United States Senate {{election}} in Pennsylvania {{took place on}} May 18, 2010, when Congressman Joe Sestak defeated incumbent Arlen Specter, {{which led to the}} end of Specter's five-term Senatorial career. Just {{prior to the start of}} the primary campaign, after serving in the Senate as a Republican for 29 years, Specter had switched to the Democratic Party in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> primary challenge by Pat Toomey; Sestak was ultimately defeated by Toomey in the general election. Political observers and journalists described the race between Specter and Sestak as one of the bitterest and most watched of all the 2010 primary elections.|$|E

5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> situation.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{arrived for}} the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona {{for his first}} major {{international}} competition since Menzies' appointment under heavy media scrutiny following his non-improvement at the Australian Championships. On {{the first night of}} competition Thorpe defeated Hackett in the 400m freestyle in a time 2.5s outside his world record, making him the first to win three world titles in the same event. After his relatively slow 400m, he was again under pressure in the 200m freestyle after van den Hoogenband led at the 100m mark ahead of world record pace. Thorpe managed to respond and retain his world title, and gained some relief after his sprint training yielded his first medal in the 100m freestyle at a global competition; he finished third in 48.77s. In all three freestyle events however, he had swum slower than his times under Frost. He ended his individual campaign on a promising note with his experiment with the 200m individual medley, setting a new personal best of 1min 59.66s to claim silver. Thorpe again anchored the 4×200m freestyle team to retain the world title along with Hackett, Nicholas Sprenger and Craig Stevens, with a reduced margin over the Americans, who finished less than two seconds in arrears. Michael Klim's injuries left the relay teams weakened, with Thorpe anchoring the 4×100m freestyle team to fourth, At the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> year in the water, his standing had fallen in the eyes of Swimming World, who rated him fourth in the world. He was again named as Australian Swimmer of the Year, jointly with Hackett.|$|E

25|$|With another World War looming, 1939 was the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> period, not just for Pinchon and other artists, but {{for the vast majority}} of the world's nations. Pinchon was deeply saddened by the human folly that would lead to such a turn of events. Neither he nor anyone else could have imagined the human loss and destruction that would be unleashed on Rouen. Yet despite the carnage that followed, hope and optimism had not entirely vanished. The 30th Salon des artistes rouennais went ahead as scheduled, with its opening on 19 May 1940; however, due to the gravity of the situation, it was closed two days later. The first bombardment of the city began on June 5, followed by a mass exodus. On June 8 at 10:00p.m. the first German tanks rolled in on la route de Neufchatel, very close to the Pinchon residence.|$|E
25|$|At the 1998 Paris Motor Show, the two-seat, 2.5 m (98in)-long Smart City Coupe (later named Smart Fortwo) was launched. This was the {{beginning}} of a new car brand and one of the more radical vehicle concepts to hit the European market since the bubble cars of the 1950s. It was also {{the beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> period for Smart. The City Coupe had stability problems that were discovered only immediately prior to launch. These forced a package of alterations to be made that were both expensive and compromised the car’s handling, ride and gear shift. Public concerns over the car's stability, combined with Smart’s elitist marketing and the sheer radicality of the car’s design, proved damaging to initial sales. Production projections were slashed from 200,000 per year to 80,000, close to disastrous for a new brand with just one product.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the rape {{allegations}} were made in March 2006, Mike Nifong {{was in the midst}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> Democratic primary election campaign to keep his position as Durham County District Attorney, facing strong opposition. It was understood that if Nifong lost the primary, he would very likely lose his job. Some commentators have opined that Nifong's prosecution of the Duke lacrosse players and his many statements to the media were driven by his political strategy to attract African-American voters. The primary was held on May 6, 2006, and Nifong won by a slim margin of 883 votes. Results showed Nifong won the primary on the basis of strong support from the black community. Nifong {{went on to win the}} general election in November 2006, although by a lower margin than usual for Democratic candidates in Durham County at that time.|$|E

25|$|Another {{occurrence}} capped Kansas State's 38–35 comeback victory November 21, 2015, over Iowa State. Kansas State had rallied from a 35–14 halftime {{deficit to}} pull to within one touchdown. With 1:31 left, Iowa State having possession on first {{down and the}} Wildcats having just one time out remaining, the Cyclones chose instead to run the ball before fumbling the ball away; Kansas State would tie the game on the ensuing possession. On Iowa State's next series, starting with 50 seconds remaining, the Cyclones again chose to run a play rather than take a knee and send the game into overtime, but quarterback Joel Lanning was sacked on second down and lost possession of the ball, ultimately leading to a game-winning field goal by the Wildcats. Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads' play-calling in the final 90 seconds of the game, the culmination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> 2015 season for ISU, ultimately led to his firing.|$|E
25|$|Entering the 1969–70 season, Chappell hit four {{hundreds}} {{to earn a}} {{place on}} an Australian A trip to New Zealand. Scoring 519 runs at 57.70, he was the dominant batsman of the tour and with the Test team failing in South Africa, he only needed a solid start to the next season to force his way in to play against England in the 1970–71 Ashes Series. After acting as twelfth man in the first Test, he was selected to bat at number seven for the second match, the first Test played at Perth's WACA ground. During an historic century on debut, he teamed with Ian Redpath to add 219 runs and haul Australia out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> situation. Just days after the Test, he belted 102 in two hours against the English in a tour match. However, the dream start affected Chappell, who struggled {{for the rest of}} the series, apart from a score of 65 in the last Test. In the main, he was getting out by playing too many big shots early in his innings.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cold War, an American {{political}} consensus {{began to}} emerge suggesting that democratic transition should be actively supported – a consensus only more firmly established following the dissolution of the Soviet Union when the United States found itself in less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> position balancing security concerns and promotion of its ideals. This was based in part on democratic peace theory, which added a security element to democracy promotion. The Middle East was not excluded from this discussion, with some calling for increased American democracy promotion as a means of encouraging more peaceful relations with Israel and moderating extremists, while not {{going so far as to}} destabilize friendly autocratic regimes. The assumption that a positive relationship exists between democratic governance and peace which was prominent in the 1990s faced some inconsistency in the Middle East, however, because regimes that engaged to some extent in the peace process with Israel (and in the case of Jordan successfully reached a peace agreement) at the same time slowly and half-heartedly pursued democratization and allowed little opening to opposition movements who resisted negotiation with Israel.|$|E

500|$|The main cast {{includes}} Eddie Cibrian, who {{was cast}} as Nick Dalton, the central {{character in the}} series.
