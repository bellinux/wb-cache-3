40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{education}} phenomenon of nonresidential African American fathers as boys across educational policy. These fathers give narratives of their lived education experiences as children through various education reforms. Described {{in the research}} are restrictive learning environments, education socialization, and the cross-generational impact on males who become nonresidential African American fathers. The research draws on looking back at lived education experiences during various education reforms. Retrospective research performed in medicine when researchers look backwards from an outcome to discover new information. The findings help to identify factors not captured in an initial study. Through social justice theory narrative analysis will inform the researcher of unsuspecting <b>occurrences</b> <b>or</b> <b>phenomenon</b> part of education reforms designed to close learning gaps. Retrospective research analyzes education reform policies with negative outcomes of a group in order to adjust policies and pedagogy to increase academic achievement among African American males. The findings suggest education agents interpret and practice at the campus level impact the no solutions were in place to partner with NRAAFs to insure the academic and social success of their children when education reform policies were implemented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{diagnostics}} of ball bearings under time varying speed conditions. Compared to classical demodulation techniques, time-frequency approach allows {{to take into account}} transient <b>occurrence</b> <b>or</b> non-stationary <b>phenomena</b> along the timeline. Among the different time-frequency approaches available the simplest is the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). From a practical point of view, its implementation in an industrial environment has a main drawback: the industry usually needs a scalar value as output (like a semaphore: green, yellow and red light) to assess the bearing condition, while time-frequency approaches produce a bi-dimensional map that needs to be interpreted. The authors suggest to combine the information gathered by spectral kurtosis and energy distribution for the automatic selection of a filtering band that could extract from the STFT map the most informative component in time domain, reducing the complexity of the output to a mono-dimensional vector. A simple check if the output exceed a given threshold can then be used to obtain a scalar valu...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the current}} {{magnitude}} of the introduction of these social phenomena {{in the form of}} violence, which are manifested in the form of organized crime, followed by acts of vandalism against humanity and their benefits, we are focused that through this conference however to perceive and define the forms of their appearance legally. - To clarify and be more specific, my paper will focus on the following definitions: - What is radicalism-which is the legal definition of it? - What is extremism – which is the legal definition of it? - How is the politico-legal definition of these phenomena in the institutional mechanisms of the Republic of Kosovo defined? - What is their criminal phenomenology? - When can the extreme and radical behavior be considered as criminal offenses (prohibited) ? - What are the defensive policies to prevent these acts of violence? Based on appearances of these phenomena in the society, especially in recent years in several world countries, interest has arisen to raise this issue in scientific and institutional range. Despite the seriousness and danger that appear to humankind and national security of the country and the region, a clear and widely definition regarding radicalization and violent extremism is still missing. Also, we still don’t have any clear explanation on how to face these phenomena. - There has been a necessity on creating opportunities concerning scientific and legal definitions of the above concepts, in order to know at which stage the appearance of these phenomena the society needs to react. - These and other questions, which will be presented in the framework of the presentation of a scientific paper in this conference, shall be evaluated by the staff in charge of the College AAB, provided that work which will be processed, to be appropriate to the aims of the conference which is being organized The research paper, aims to legally define these <b>occurrences</b> <b>or</b> <b>phenomena</b> that are currently present and they manifest themselves in violent acts. Specifically {{in the context of this}} topic, it will be the clarification that international countries should create relationships not only by the legal but also of preventive policies. The aim of creating these relationships is winning the battle against this scourge, gaining the mind of the younger generations, with the aim of ensuring dialogue instead of conflict, understanding instead of creating wars, as well as ensuring the future instead of the past...|$|R

It has two objectives; {{to find out}} the types of lexical cohesion in scientific article of A Review gender Differences in Human Brain by Zeenat F. Zaidi and to describe how the use of lexical cohesion make the sentences find are cohesiveness. In collecting the data, the researcher presents all sentences which contain lexical cohesion devices. Next, the researcher classifies the sentences containing lexical cohesion devices and then explained their relation in the text. The data analysis result shows that lexical cohesive devices found in article A Review Gender Differences in Human Brain by Zeenat F Zaidi are Repetition, Antonymy, Synonymy, Meronymy, Hyponymy, Collocation. The number of repetition is about 60 <b>occurrences</b> <b>or</b> 14, 5 %, then, the number of synonymy is about 12 <b>occurrences</b> <b>or</b> 2, 9 %, and next, the number of antonymy is about 226 <b>occurrences</b> <b>or</b> 54, 6 %, after word, the number of hyponymy is about 8 <b>occurrences</b> <b>or</b> 1, 9 %, after that, the number of meronymy is about 29 <b>occurrences</b> <b>or</b> 7, 0 %, and the last, the number of collocation is about 79 <b>occurrences</b> <b>or</b> 19, 1 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Ecological niche {{modeling}} integrates known {{sites of}} <b>occurrence</b> of species <b>or</b> <b>phenomena</b> with data on environmental variation across landscapes to infer environmental spaces potentially inhabited (i. e., the ecological niche) to generate predictive maps of potential distributions in geographic space. Key inputs {{to this process}} include raster data layers characterizing spatial variation in environmental parameters, such as vegetation indices from remotely sensed satellite imagery. The extent to which ecological niche models reflect real-world distributions depends {{on a number of}} factors, but an obvious concern is the quality and content of the environmental data layers. Methods We assessed ecological niche model predictions of H 5 N 1 avian flu presence quantitatively within and among four geographic regions, based on models incorporating two means of summarizing three vegetation indices derived from the MODIS satellite. We evaluated our models for predictive ability using partial ROC analysis and GLM ANOVA to compare performance among indices and regions. Results We found correlations between vegetation indices to be high, such that they contain information that overlaps broadly. Neither the type of vegetation index used nor method of summary affected model performance significantly. However, the degree to which model predictions had to be transferred (i. e., projected onto landscapes and conditions not represented on the landscape of training) impacted predictive strength greatly (within-region model predictions far out-performed models projected among regions). Conclusion Our results provide the first quantitative tests of most appropriate uses of different remotely sensed data sets in ecological niche modeling applications. While our testing did not result in a decisive "best" index product or means of summarizing indices, it emphasizes the need for careful evaluation of products used in modeling (e. g. matching temporal dimensions and spatial resolution) for optimum performance, instead of simple reliance on large numbers of data layers. </p...|$|R
