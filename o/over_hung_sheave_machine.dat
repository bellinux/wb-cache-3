60|$|Thus it {{happened}} that Captain Bunting finished his meal in peace, and went on {{his way up the}} wild ravine, without being aware of the presence of so dangerous a spectator.

60|$|The first {{bustle of}} {{installation}} <b>over,</b> time <b>hung</b> heavy on his hands. July loomed distant, as in some future century; Antonia's eyes beckoned him faintly, hopelessly. She {{would not even}} {{be coming back to}} England for another month.|$|R

50|$|The HOSSACK front {{suspension}} system consists of 2 wish-bones, an upright and steering linkage. Similar components are found {{on the front of}} all racing cars, the only significant difference being in the up-right which has its geometry rearranged. The wish-bones look and work exactly like their racing car equivalent. The up-right performs the same task as its racing car equivalent but has its axle rotated through 90 degrees and <b>over</b> <b>hung.</b> The steering link does the same job as its name sake in car suspension. There is a handle bar pivot but this carries none of the suspension loading and only has to handle the weight of the rider’s upper half. The spring/damper element can been run in several different positions to achieve different conditions as is also common in the racing car world.|$|R
