25|$|No {{matter how}} we view it, {{it remains a}} fact that we charged a non-English-speaking alien with {{criminal}} tax evasion on the first tax returns he filed in this country.

25|$|London {{is not a}} battlefield. Those innocents {{who were}} murdered...were not victims of war.

We {{need to be very}} clear about this. On the streets of London {{there is no such thing}} as a war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is not a war.

The point of departure is Jeremy Waldron’s notion that foreign consensus is <b>our</b> law; such <b>law</b> exists outside of a legal system, depends on its moral merits and hence brings some of the central positivist commitments into question. The article maintains that even if foreign consensus were <b>our</b> <b>law,</b> this would not undermine legal positivism, and—moreover—that foreign consensus is actually not <b>our</b> <b>law.</b> In so doing, it advances an account of foreign law as a facultative theoretical authority that is best explained by the positivist idea of judicial law making...|$|R

[...] He then attacked Conway, who refused to appeal the 2014 federal court opinion that Kentucky's defense of marriage amendment violated the federal constitution: [...] "Jack Conway's failure to do his job and defend <b>our</b> <b>laws</b> in Kentucky disqualifies him from being elected to the office of Governor." [...] Conway responded that he [...] "used the discretion given to me by statute to inform Gov. Beshear and the citizens of the Commonwealth that I would not waste the scarce resources of this office pursuing a costly appeal that would not be successful." [...] Bevin contended that Conway's decision cost Kentucky taxpayers $2.3 million, citing the cost of private attorneys that Beshear hired to defend the amendment in Conway's place.|$|E

A young woman who had taken part in the protests {{at the time of}} the rape said a year later, [...] "A welcome change is that the taboo on {{discussing}} rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes." [...] She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere.

[...] She added, [...] "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries.

500|$|During George II's reign British {{interests}} expanded {{throughout the}} world, the Jacobite {{challenge to the}} Hanoverian dynasty was extinguished, {{and the power of}} ministers and Parliament in Britain became well-established. Nevertheless, in the memoirs of contemporaries such as Lord Hervey and Horace Walpole, George is depicted as a weak buffoon, governed by his wife and ministers. Biographies of George written during the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century relied on these biased accounts. Since {{the last quarter of the}} twentieth century, scholarly analysis of surviving correspondence has indicated that George was not as ineffective as previously thought. Letters from ministers are annotated by George with pertinent remarks and demonstrate that he had a grasp of and interest in foreign policy in particular. He was often able to prevent the appointment of ministers or commanders he disliked, or sideline them into lesser offices. This academic reassessment of George II, however, has not totally eliminated the popular perception of him as a [...] "faintly ludicrous king". His parsimony, for example, may have opened him to ridicule, but his biographers observe that parsimony is preferable to extravagance. Lord Charlemont excused George's short temper by explaining that sincerity of feeling is better than deception, [...] "His temper was warm and impetuous, but he was good-natured and sincere. Unskilled in the royal talent of dissimulation, he always was what he appeared to be. He might offend, but he never deceived." [...] Lord Waldegrave wrote, [...] "I am thoroughly convinced that hereafter, when time shall have wore away those specks and blemishes which sully the brightest characters, and from which no man is totally exempt, he will be numbered amongst those patriot kings, under whose government the people have enjoyed the greatest happiness". George may not have played a strong role in history, but he was influential at times and he upheld constitutional government. Elizabeth Montagu said of him, [...] "With him <b>our</b> <b>laws</b> and liberties were safe, he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his people and the respect of foreign governments; and a certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence in these unsettled times... His character would not afford subject for epic poetry, but will look well in the sober page of history." ...|$|E
