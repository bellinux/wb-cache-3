5|$|When wide {{receiver}} Kelvin Kirk suffered a concussion in a July 1977 {{game against the}} Ottawa Rough Riders, Allison was forced to substitute as a {{wide receiver}}. After playing five regular season games with the Argonauts in 1977, Allison {{was traded to the}} Calgary Stampeders for Rudy Linterman. He played in four games for the Stampeders during the 1977 season. Allison tore his Achilles tendon in September when he was hit while standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> and the injury ended his season.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad {{took part}} in blowing up railway tracks on the {{stretches}} around Støren Station, but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted with shock that London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim. He was uneasy about being set <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet {{at the end of the}} month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station Quail. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway. He was in Troms at the time of the German capitulation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Tasci {{attracted}} interest from clubs around Europe. Stuttgart's league rival Hamburger SV as well as foreign clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus reportedly expressed their desire to sign him. This move was denied by his agent; he said that Tasci would stay at Stuttgart only. On 15 July 2010, Tasci expressed his desire to stay at the club. After being excluded from the opening game of the season, he made his first appearance in a 3–2 loss against Borussia Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club in the Europa League group stage matchday one in a 3–0 win over Young Boys. He then suffered a thigh problem that kept him out for a long time. In late November, Tasci returned to training with a bandage on his right knee. Once again, he was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> after experiencing ongoing problems with his thigh injury despite reporting himself fit. He returned to the field on 19 December 2010 in the match against Bayern Munich, which Stuttgart lost 5–3. Despite his injury, Tasci would go on to make 26 league appearances. He continued to attract interest from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Tottenham, Málaga and Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E

In 2005, Hagen was chosen as Vice President of the Storting, and held the position until he left parliament in 2009. In 2006 he stepped down as party leader in favour of Siv Jensen. Part of the decision not to run for re-election (which he had made in 2007) apart from reaching the age of pension, was because Hagen had felt that he had been put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> after retiring as party leader. He also said that he wanted more relaxation, and to work as a consultant. After ending his high-profile political career, he started working for the PR agency Burson-Marsteller in 2009, where he became among the company's highest paid lecturers.|$|E

25|$|Crabtree {{partially}} {{recovered from}} his ankle sprain {{enough to play}} at Kansas, where he amassed 70 {{yards and two touchdowns}} off of 9 receptions in a 63-21 Tech victory. The Red Raiders then upset #1 Texas 39-33. Down 33-32, Tech drove down into the Longhorns' territory with 8 seconds left in the game. Quarterback Graham Harrell threw to Crabtree in double coverage inside the 10-yard line. Crabtree grabbed the pass, shook a defender <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> and ran into the endzone for the game-winning touchdown with a second left in the game. As the Red Raiders won, Crabtree finished with 127 yards and a touchdown off of 10 receptions. In Oklahoma State game, Crabtree recorded 89 yards and three touchdowns on eight catches. He extended his streak of at least five receptions and a touchdown catch to 13 games, placing him in a tie for second-longest all time. In these three games, he hobbled off the field at times after making catches. He used the bye week before the Oklahoma game to fully recover from the injury.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} crosses the {{sideline}} during general play a line-out is formed {{with the team}} that did not put the ball into touch throwing it in, unless it was kicked into touch from a penalty kick, {{in which case the}} team kicking to touch throws in. If the ball is kicked directly (does not bounce first) over the sideline by a team member who is outside his 22-metre line, the line-out is formed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> perpendicular to where that player kicked it. The same rule applies if the ball is moved (passed, knocked, kicked or run) back inside the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker. Once a tackle, scrum, line-out, ruck or maul occurs inside the 22 or the ball is moved there by the opposition a player can kick it directly into touch with the line-out forming where the ball crossed the sideline. If the ball bounces before crossing the sideline or is carried across by a player the line-out is formed where the ball crossed the line. However, a line-out can never take place within five metres of the ingoal area, and is always moved back to a mark five metres out.|$|E

To complement their roster, the Sharks picked up Luke Aston, James Hunter and Reuben Te Rangi. The Sharks had a difficult season {{with a host of}} players being in and out because of different injuries.

25|$|During {{his title}} reign Fuerza Guerrera began a long running storyline feud that quickly drew big crowds {{as the two}} talented young wrestlers worked a series of very highly thought off matches. On December 14, 1990 Fuerza Guerrera and Octagón were {{involved}} in a three way Luchas de Apuesta ("bet match"), round robin tournament along with Huracán Ramírez where their masks were on the line. In the end Guerrera managed to defeat both Octagón and Ramírez, forcing the two to face off with their mask on the line. Guerrera sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> and watched Octagón defeat Ramírez and unmask him after the match per Lucha Libre traditions. On December 15, 1991 Guerrera and Octagón were once again involved in an Apuesta match where each could potentially lose their mask. The two teamed up to take on El Hijo del Santo and Black Shadow, Jr. in a Relevos suicida match, where the losing team is forced to wrestle each other with their mask on the line. Fuerza Guerrera pinned El Hijo del Santo to keep both his and Octagón's mask safe, while Hijo del Santo would go on to unmask Black Shadow, Jr. On February 15, 1992 Fuerza Guerrera became the first ever CMLL World Welterweight Champion when he defeated El Khalifa in the finals of a 4-man tournament. Guerrera only held the title for 22 days before losing it to America.|$|E
