40|$|Background/Objectives: Perceptions that {{fruit and}} {{vegetables}} are expensive are more common among the socio-economically disadvantaged groups and are linked to poor dietary outcomes. Such perceptions may be exacerbated in countries recently affected by natural disasters, where devastation <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetable crops has resulted in increase in prices <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetables. Examining the associations <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetable affordability and children 2 ̆ 7 s diets can offer insights into how the high prices <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetables might {{have an impact on}} the diets of children. Subjects/Methods: We analysed the data from 546 socio-economically disadvantaged mother–child pairs to assess the relationship between maternal perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetable affordability and the diets of their children. Results: Fruit consumption was lower among children whose mothers felt the cost <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> was too high. Maternal perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetable affordability were not associated with any other aspect of child 2 ̆ 7 s diet. Conclusions: Our results suggest a possible role for maternal perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> affordability in children 2 ̆ 7 s diet, though further research is warranted. <br /...|$|R

5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
