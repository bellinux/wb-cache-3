40|$|A {{family farm}} model {{was used in}} order to study the {{economic}} importance of pasture utilization in sheep breeding and cattle fattening during the summer period. The model was based on real technological, organizational and economic conditions of a farm in the hill and mountain regions of eastern Serbia. The economic competitiveness of different ways of pasture utilization was studied based on the processing price of green feed obtained from pastures. Under the given economic conditions, a higher processing price of feed may be expected in cattle fattening. Thus, from the economic standpoint farms involved in cattle fattening would have a justifiable production. However, due to the changing market conditions {{it was necessary to}} determine the processing prices at different price levels of <b>fattened</b> cattle, <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and the production value per breeding ewe. A special diagram was constructed enabling a rapid and easy determination of the processing price of feed in practice taking into account different market conditions of sheep breeding and cattle fattening. In addition using the same diagram it was possible to determine the relationship between the production value per breeding ewe and the price of fattened cattle at different price levels of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> inducing the same processing price of pasture feed...|$|R

40|$|There are {{currently}} no validated animal models or suitable biomarkers {{with which to}} ascertain the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in equine, bovine or ovine species during conditions of endotoxemia. This has resulted in approval of only one NSAID, flunixin meglumine, for controlling inflammation due to endotoxemia in bovine and equine animals, while none are approved in <b>ovine</b> <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> this claim. This study aims to investigate biomarkers with which to test efficacy of NSAIDs in these species. To this end, the effects of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation on gene expression were investigated. Whole blood from each species was cultured and stimulated with LPS, after which RNA was extracted at various times. RNA was analyzed via quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine differential expression of biomarkers. Results indicated up-regulation of cluster of differentiation 1 (CD 1) gene in bovine and serum amyloid A (SAA) gene in ovine cultures. Down-regulation of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD 4) gene and Caspase 1 was seen in bovine, and of CD 1 in equine cultures. This work demonstrates that LPS stimulation alters expression of these genes in these species. These genes may be useful biomarkers for inflammation which could serve as markers for NSAID efficacy...|$|R

40|$|Study was {{conducted}} to assess beef cattle production, management practices and marketing system in Lume district, East Shoa Zone, Oromia. Traditional, semi-intensive and intensive beef cattle production and marketing system were considered for the study. For this purpose 120 respondents were included based on discussions with district livestock experts, 1 kebele for intensive; 2 kebeles from semi-intensive fattening systems were purposively selected as {{they are the only}} kebeles practicing intensive and semi-intensive fattening in the district. From the traditional system, three kebeles were randomly selected. Structured and semi-structured questioners were used to collect data from sampled households. In addition the performance of beef animals and chemical composition of major feedstuff were evaluated on eleven purposively selected feedlots and households (2 intensive feed lots, 3 semi-intensive and 6 from traditional). Major feed resources used from the 11 households involved in body weight monitoring were collected and chemical composition determined. From the interviewed households, 100 %, 85 %, 75 %, 63 %, and 55 % of them use crop residues, aftermath grazing, grazing from communal, roadside and riverside areas, respectively. The majority of the respondents (82. 5 %) provided additional supplement for their cattle during dry season. Traditional fatteners commonly used noug cake (72. 2 %) and local brewery by-product (70 %) as the main sources of feed. During wet season the major feed resources was grazing (76. 3 %) while during the dry seasons, tethering (49. 1 %, free grazing (41. 6 %) and cut and carry system (1. 6 %) were the main feed resources. The majority (82. 5 %) of the farmers supplement cattle during dry season which was provided once a day (44. 2 %), twice a day (21. 7 %) and whenever available (34. 2 %). Traditional fatteners mainly use their own <b>animal</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> from their herds. The semi-intensive and intensive fatteners purchase fattening animals from another source. The most preferred <b>animal</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> was old oxen (56. 7 %) in the traditional fattening system while young bull (20. 8 %) was used in semi- commercial and intensive fatteners. Cattle were fattened once, twice and trice a year under traditional, semi-intensive, intensive production systems, respectively. In all production systems, decision of ending fattening period was made based on live weight change. The average length of fattening period was 3 - 4, 3, 3 months for traditional, semi-intensive and intensive system, respectively. At the market places, the main buyers of beef cattle were local traders (74. 2 %) in traditional and semi-intensive systems. According to the respondents, reasons for prices variation were involvement of number of traders (75. 8 %), road and transportation accessibility (15 %) and proximity to urban (9. 2 %) places. The determinants of price of animals (purchased/sold) were breed (29. 2 %), weight (28. 3 %), and color (26. 7 %) and age (15 %). The majority of the producers (95. 4 %) in traditional fattening system and semixviii intensive fatteners (100 %) sold their fattened cattle in eye ball estimation at market place, while fatteners in intensive system used live weight to sell their cattle. The majority of the respondents (55 %) relay on the information they get from brokers. More than three-fourth of the fatteners in all production systems sell their fattened beef (100 %) during holidays. The crude protein content of the feedstuff ranged from 3. 79 to 29 %. The average daily gain increased (P< 0. 01) with increasing levels of intensification which was 0. 4 kg, 0. 53 kg, 0. 91 kg for traditional, semi-intensive and 0. 91 kg, respectively. The weight gain <b>for</b> intensive <b>fattening</b> was significantly higher than the other two systems. Major constraints that hindered the performance of cattle fattening activity were feed and water shortages, marketing and disease problems. In conclusion, in order to improve the performance of beef cattle, especially under traditional production system, {{there is a need to}} supply adequate feed in terms of quality and quantity which could promote the frequency of fattening. Appropriate marketing system should be developed so that farmers can benefit from their business. ====Global Affairs Canad...|$|R

40|$|This PhD-research {{was focused}} on the {{development}} and evaluation of innovative scaffold-based bone tissue engineering concepts for the treatment of large volume bone defects, which still represent a major challenge in orthopaedic and reconstructive surgery. Two different types of bone tissue engineering constructs were investigated and successfully applied to regenerate critically-sized segmental bone defects in <b>ovine</b> <b>animal</b> models. The results outlined in the PhD thesis represent a significant contribution to potential future clinical translations of bone tissue engineering concepts from bench to bedside...|$|R
40|$|Natugrain® TS is {{an enzyme}} {{preparation}} that contains endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase and endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase, produced by two genetically modified strains of Aspergillus niger. This product is currently authorised {{for use in}} piglets (weaned), poultry species and ornamental birds as a zootechnical additive under the functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant is now seeking for the extension of its use as a zootechnical additive <b>for</b> pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a dose range of 560 to 840  TXU (thermostable xylanase units) and 250 to 375  TGU (thermostable glucanase units) per kg feed. Since the product has been demonstrated to be  safe in piglets at the maximum recommended dose, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) considers that this conclusion can be extended to pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> provided that the same maximum dose applies. In two long-term trials, Natugrain® TS significantly improved {{the performance of the}} pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at the minimum recommended dose (560  TXU and 250  TGU/kg feed). In a balance trial, the metabolisable energy content of the diet was significantly improved by the addition of Natugrain® TS in feed at the minimum recommended dose. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Natugrain® TS at the minimum recommended dose (560  TXU and 250  TGU/kg feed) {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening...</b>|$|R
40|$|Probiotic LACTINA® is a feed {{additive}} consisting of six strains of lactic acid bacteria. In 2007 the European Food Safety Authority was requested {{to evaluate the}} safety and efficacy of the additive when used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: gut flora stabilisers) in diets <b>for</b> chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> piglets and pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> At that time the FEEDAP Panel was able to conclude only on the safety for the environment. EFSA is now requested to assess the safety <b>for</b> the target <b>animals</b> and consumers, and {{the efficacy of the}} additive when added in diets <b>for</b> chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at 5 x 108 - 9 x 109 CFU/kg feed and for piglets at 9 x 108 - 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The identity of the six strains was established. As no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected and as five of the strains qualify for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment, their use is presumed safe for target species and consumers. The Enterococcus faecium strain is not a recognised pathogen <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> and as the additive did not adversely affect growth of chickens or piglets, Probiotic LACTINA® is considered safe for the target species up to 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections. The metabolic pathways of E. faecium are well known. Since no other harmful metabolites are expected and the additive does not contain excipients of concern, it is considered safe for consumers. Probiotic LACTINA® showed a potential to increase the body weight of suckling piglets when used at approximately 5 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The Panel could not conclude on the efficacy of Probiotic LACTINA® when used in diets <b>for</b> chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> or weaned piglets...|$|R

40|$|Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is {{the trade}} {{name for a}} feed {{additive}} based on viable spores of a strain of Bacillus subtilis. This species is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to establishing safety for the target species, consumers and the environment. This approach requires the identity of the active agent to be established and the absence of toxigenic potential and resistance to antibiotics of human or veterinary clinical significance to be demonstrated. EFSA considered these issues and reported the results in a previous opinion {{on the use of the}} product in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The applicant is now requesting the authorisation of the additive in diets <b>for</b> turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and turkeys reared for breeding at a dose of 1 × 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs. In the course of the former assessment, safety for users was also examined. In the view of the FEEDAP Panel, the use with these additional avian species will not introduce hazards not already considered. Therefore, in the current assessment, the FEEDAP Panel has considered only the efficacy data <b>for</b> turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and turkeys reared for breeding. Based on results of three trials carried out in turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> the Panel concluded that B. subtilis PB 6 has the potential to improve the zootechnical performance parameters at the dose of 1 × 108 CFU/kg feed. This conclusion can be extended to turkeys reared for breeding...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to {{complete}} its former opinion on the maximum residue limits (MRL) of Clinacox 0. 5 % (diclazuril) <b>for</b> turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and chickens reared for laying. The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) assessed the supplementary information supplied by the applicant on the diclazuril impurity/metabolite R 070016 {{and concluded that the}} compound is devoid of genotoxic activity. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel {{is in a position to}} adopt the already proposed ADI for diclazuril (1. 7 mg diclazuril per person per day). The metabolic fate of diclazuril in chicken and turkey is qualitatively similar, diclazuril being the marker residue in tissues. At a zero withdrawal time, the theoretical consumer exposure to the total residues from both chickens and turkeys represents about 13 % of the ADI. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that applying a withdrawal period of zero day would not compromise consumer safety. Consequently, no MRLs are required for chickens and turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening...</b>|$|R
