5|$|The text {{suggests}} variations to the Saguna meditation, such as perceiving {{the union}} of a golden disc with four-faced golden Purusha, imagining a lustrous inner self inside <b>oneself</b> <b>and</b> then oneness with it, and other variations. Verses 9.43–44 state that the inner self, whether meditated upon as Nirguna or Saguna, is one and the same.|$|E
5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding <b>oneself</b> <b>and</b> one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E

5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory hypothesizes that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to <b>oneself</b> <b>and</b> others, or hyper-systemizing, which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching <b>oneself,</b> <b>and</b> hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E
5|$|On several {{occasions}} {{over the course}} of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for <b>oneself</b> <b>and</b> one's family. When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war. During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom. Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murdersthe shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft IIIin time to have prevented the killings. He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} new {{religious}} movements in East Asia, and some {{with millions of}} followers: Chondogyo, Tenrikyo, Cao Đài, and Seicho-No-Ie.

25|$|This principle, however, is {{more often}} used {{in the sense of}} the {{microcosm}} and the macrocosm. The microcosm is <b>oneself,</b> <b>and</b> the macrocosm is the universe.

25|$|In the Mahayana world view, {{there are}} also pure lands which lie outside this {{continuum}} and are created by the Buddhas upon attaining enlightenment. Rebirth in the pure land of Amitabha {{is seen as an}} assurance of Buddhahood, for once reborn there, beings do not fall back into cyclical existence unless they choose to do so to save other beings, the goal of Buddhism being the obtainment of enlightenment and freeing <b>oneself</b> <b>and</b> others from the birth–death cycle.|$|E
25|$|Even among Chinese Buddhist {{schools that}} are non-devotional, Guanyin is still highly venerated. Instead of being seen as an active {{external}} force of unconditional love and salvation, the personage of Guanyin is highly revered as the principle of compassion, mercy and love. The act, thought and feeling of compassion and love is viewed as Guanyin. A merciful, compassionate, loving individual {{is said to be}} Guanyin. A meditative or contemplative state of being at peace with <b>oneself</b> <b>and</b> others is seen as Guanyin.|$|E
25|$|In Mahayana Buddhism, another {{important}} foundation for moral action is the Bodhisattva ideal. Bodhisattvas are beings which {{have chosen to}} work towards the salvation of all living beings. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, this path of great compassion is promoted as being superior {{to that of the}} Arhat because the Bodhisattva is seen as working for the benefit of all beings. A Bodhisattva is one who arouses a powerful emotion called Bodhicitta (mind of enlightenment) which is a mind which is oriented towards the awakening of <b>oneself</b> <b>and</b> all beings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that listening to oneself eating results in a more pleasurable eating experience. Maximising the sensory experience of eating can result in increased oral intake and is potentially valuable in improving nutritional status in at-risk patients. Objective This pilot study investigates the association between listening {{to the sound of}} <b>oneself</b> eating <b>and</b> the consequences on enjoyment of eating. Design Prospective, randomized, controlled, cross-over trial of 10 fit, adult volunteers. Participants were timed eating a standardised amount of bread, and were randomized to eat in silence or whilst listening to their own amplified chewing and swallowing. Measurements of pulse and blood pressure were recorded throughout the procedure. Subjective pleasure scores were documented and the procedure repeated in the alternate study arm. Results There was no significant relationship demonstrated between listening to <b>oneself</b> chewing <b>and</b> the enjoyment of eating. Conclusion Although this small pilot study was unable to demonstrate a significant relationship between listening to <b>oneself</b> chewing <b>and</b> enjoyment of eating, other {{evidence suggests}} that distraction techniques have a beneficial effect on dietary intake. Such techniques can be applied in a clinical setting and further work in this area has valuable potential. </p...|$|R
