5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium {{was much}} smaller than the sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and its body mass is {{estimated}} to have been about 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> on the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E

5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights to reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
5|$|The basement, and {{for part}} of the home's history, the main living area, is {{accessed}} via a staircase {{at the back of the}} first-floor hall.

5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, at the price <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> and tear on the wings.|$|E

5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E
5|$|In {{her second}} season {{of service in}} 1846, Great Britain {{successfully}} completed two round trips to New York at an acceptable speed, but was then laid up for repairs {{to one of her}} chain drums, which showed an unexpected degree <b>of</b> <b>wear.</b> Embarking on her third passage of the season to New York, her captain made a series of navigational errors that resulted in her being run hard aground in Dundrum Bay on the northeast coast of Ireland. There was no formal inquiry but it has been recently suggested that it was mainly due to the captain not having updated charts, so that he mistook the new St John's light for the Calf light on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs <b>of</b> <b>wear,</b> even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E

5|$|Since the Second World War, most {{but not all}} Commonwealth {{countries}} have created their own honours systems and no longer participate in the British honours system. This began soon after the Partition of India in 1947, when the new countries of India and Pakistan introduced their own systems of awards. The VC {{was replaced by the}} Param Vir Chakra (PVC) and Nishan-e-Haider (NH) respectively. Most if not all new honours systems continued to permit recipients of British honours to wear their awards according to the rules of each nation's order <b>of</b> <b>wear.</b> Sri Lanka, whose defence personnel were eligible to receive the Victoria Cross until 1972, introduced its own equivalent, the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya medal. Three Commonwealth realms—Australia, Canada and New Zealand—have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the Victoria Cross with their own. The only Commonwealth countries that still can recommend the VC are the small nations, none of whose forces have ever been awarded the VC, that still participate in the British honours system.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{slowness}} {{of making}} a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ionaccumulation approach {{that proved to be}} formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto—and become part of—an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a noble metal (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature solders, slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.|$|E

5|$|The molar is {{plane and}} hypsodont: the crowns are {{relatively}} {{high and the}} main cusps are about {{as high as the}} other parts of the crown, as they are in Holochilus. Most other oryzomyines have bunodont and brachydont molars, in which the crowns are lower and the cusps are higher {{than the rest of the}} crown. As in closely related species, the front part of the molar is relatively simple, lacking an anteroloph, an additional ridge that is well-developed in most oryzomyines. A shallow anteromedian flexus is present, superficially dividing the front cusp (anterocone). Uniquely, the anterior mure, which connects the anterocone to the rest of the crown, is absent; although this structure is sometimes missing in young individuals of other oryzomyines, it usually develops as a result <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> in adults. The two cusps on the middle part of the molar, the paracone and the protocone, are broadly connected. The median mure, which connects the middle to the back pair of cusps, is attached to the back of the paracone. A complete mesoloph is present, descending from the median mure slightly behind the paracone. The configuration of the paracone–median mure–mesoloph complex is unique to Carletonomys. The two posterior cusps, the hypocone and the metacone, are connected at the back margin of the molar. Unlike in most oryzomyines, no posteroflexus is present, so that the metacone is situated directly at the back margin.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} change that {{happened}} during the growth of Limusaurus is {{the complete loss of}} teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, eight in the maxilla, and eleven in the lower jaw (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, as well as the sixth in the lower jaw have all been lost (34 teeth total), although the sockets are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, usage of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any marks <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> or resorption. As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all of the teeth are missing. CT scanning shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in the adult maxilla; all of the sockets in the lower jaw have fused into a single, hollow canal, {{and the rest of the}} tooth sockets have been obliterated.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E
40|$|Restroration <b>of</b> <b>worn</b> parts {{is a key}} {{technique}} in remanufacturing engineering. It is also a popular research topic {{in the domain of}} sustainable manufacturing. To tackle the difficult problem of obtaining a reference model for repair <b>of</b> <b>worn</b> parts, this paper proposed a novel approach to regenerate the vertices over the worn cavity. After {{a brief description of the}} repair process, this paper focuses on the optimal energy model establishment. Based on the energy model the vertices <b>of</b> the <b>worn</b> cavity can be regenerated. Error calculation of the vertices recreated to the original model is proposed to search the shortest distance. These algorithms proposed were implemented in the repair system through Visual C++ 6. 0. Several examples <b>of</b> <b>worn</b> parts are presented to illustrate the feasibility of the method. The testing result shows that the vertex regenerated through the optimal energy model can satisfy the requirement of accurate geometry regeneration for repair <b>of</b> <b>worn</b> parts. Finally, conclusions are drawn and further research work is discussed...|$|R

5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a {{creeping}} barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.|$|E
