60|$|The {{conduct and}} motives of Mr. M'Dougal, {{throughout}} the whole of this proceeding, have been strongly questioned by the other partners. He has been accused <b>of</b> availing <b>himself</b> <b>of</b> a wrong construction of powers vested in him at his own request, and of sacrificing the interests of Mr. Astor to the Northwest Company, under the promise or hope <b>of</b> advantage to <b>himself.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{decision}} {{holding that}} this action could be maintained {{either by the}} tribe, or an individual member thereof on behalf <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> and all others who should come in and contribute, would be contrary to the policy and practice which have been long established in our treatment of the Indian tribes. They are regarded as the wards of the state, and, generally speaking, possessed of only such rights to appear and litigate in courts of justice as are conferred upon them by statute.|$|E

5000|$|The {{movement}} {{interprets the}} prophecised Second Coming of Jesus as being {{of a person}} [...] "similar to Jesus" [...] (mathīl-i ʿIsā), rather than that of Jesus <b>of</b> Nazareth <b>himself.</b> Mirza Ghulam Ahmad professed that the prophecy in traditional religious texts were greatly misunderstood to interpret that Jesus <b>of</b> Nazareth <b>himself</b> would return.|$|R

Lysippos had often used the contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as Apoxyomenos, Hermes and Eros. Lysippos' sculpture, {{famous for its}} naturalism, {{as opposed to a}} stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.|$|E

5|$|As {{these forces}} gather, the god Heimdallr will stand and blow into his horn, Gjallarhorn, which will awaken the gods. The gods will meet {{and hold a}} thing. Odin will ride to the well Mímisbrunnr and will consult Mímir on behalf <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> and his people. Yggdrasil, the cosmological tree, will shiver and all beings will be fearful. The gods and the einherjar will don their war gear and advance to Vígríðr. Odin, wearing a golden helmet, a coat of mail, and brandishing his spear Gungnir, will ride in the front.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E

5|$|Battered, Battleship Division Nine steamed {{into the}} {{anchorage}} of the Grand Fleet {{later that day}} to the tremendous cheering of {{the men on the}} assembled British warships.

5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in a bedroom {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
5|$|Captain Lang is a fully matured character, {{serious and}} calm in his demeanor, yet {{definite}} and energetic when strength was needed. Very good attitude as an officer.

Captain Lang possesses an exemplary concept of service, has initiative and talent for improvisation to a large degree, well rooted in the National Socialist ideas.|$|E
