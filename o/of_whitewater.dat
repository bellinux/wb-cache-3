5|$|Today, the Klamath is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} river {{as well as an}} important source of water for agriculture. It includes many of the longest free-flowing stretches of river in California, including excellent stretches <b>of</b> <b>whitewater.</b> However, dams and diversions in the upper basin have often caused water quality issues in {{the lower half of the}} river. Environmental groups and native tribes have proposed broad changes to water use in the Klamath Basin, including the removal of some dams on the river to expand fish habitat. They put forth their concerns in what is now the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement, a water management plan signed by local communities, governments, tribal groups, environmentalists, and fishermen. The proposal has been endorsed by the U.S. Department of the Interior but has not been authorized by the United States Congress.|$|E

25|$|A sea kayak or touring kayak is a kayak {{developed}} for the sport of paddling on open waters of lakes, bays, and the ocean.

25|$|Studies are {{underway}} on {{the extension of}} Highway 417 through the Ottawa Valley region from its current terminus at Arnprior to Petawawa. From Arnprior to Haley Station and from Meath to Petawawa, the proposed freeway route largely follows the existing alignment — in these areas, the current highway route largely avoids existing communities, and thus {{a second set of}} lanes can be easily added alongside the existing route. Within the township <b>of</b> <b>Whitewater</b> Region, however, a new alignment is planned several kilometres east of the existing road in order to bypass communities such as Cobden.|$|E
25|$|During World War II Riding Mountain National Park {{was home}} to the Whitewater labour camp for German prisoners-of-war. Operating from 1943 to 1945, the camp {{was built on the}} {{northeast}} shore <b>of</b> <b>Whitewater</b> Lake, approximately 300 kilometres (190mi) north-west of Winnipeg. The camp consisted of fifteen buildings and housed 440 to 450 prisoners of war. The decision to have a prisoner of war labour project in Riding Mountain National Park {{was the result of a}} fuelwood shortage in the winter of 1942 and 1943. To free up men for the war effort it was decided that prisoners of war would be employed. Following the end of the war and the achievement of a fuelwood surplus, the camp closed in late 1945. In 1945 an advertisement appeared in the Tribune soliciting the sale of the government-owned buildings. The camp has since been dismantled.|$|E

2500|$|However, opponents {{assert that}} the upper San Joaquin River, already {{straight}} jacketed by dams (Mammoth Pool, No. 6, Redinger, Kerckhoff, Friant, and scores more on tributaries) will not provide sufficient discharge to fill the reservoir except in very wet years.
