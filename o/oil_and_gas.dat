40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In fiscal year 2005, federal and Native American lands supplied about 35 percent of the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> 26 percent of the natural gas produced in the United States.

In this context, Congress asked GAO to review DOE's R&D activities for <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> provide information on (1) how much has been appropriated during the past 10 years, (2) how DOE expended these appropriations and its reported results to date, (3) the potential future results from continuing DOE-sponsored research in <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> technologies, <b>and</b> (4) the factors that could be considered when determining the federal government's role in <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> R&D. ...|$|R

Furthermore, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts slower growth in U.S. <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> consumption {{in the coming decades}} until 2035.

5|$|Fluor {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company.

In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.|$|E

Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012.

A recent GAO report noted important criteria for the Department of Energy (DOE) to consider in evaluating its <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> R&D efforts [...] including the likelihood that industry would perform the research without federal funding. The Office of Management and Budget has raised similar concerns. In this context, GAO was asked to review (1) how much U.

40|$|In {{order that}} Western-European {{countries}} (WECs) can remain economically stable, they must maintain uninterrupted and adequate supplies of energy: at present, these largely {{take the form}} of crude <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas.</b> The analysis of stocks held by WECs and movements of crude <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> from other regions to Western Europe have highlighted the need for a well-defined Western European security energy-supplies policy embracing all WECs. If an energy crisis then occurred, resources could be pooled so that no single country, within the European Community, could be held to ransom. The detailed movements of crude <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> from exporting countries to individual WECs have been established, along with the crude-oil and natural-gas movements within the European Community itself. Stock levels for crude <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> for WECs have also been itemised along with estimated days-forward consumption for each country. As a result, the requirements to be included in security policy for crude <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>gas</b> for Western Europe have become much easier to determine. ...|$|R
