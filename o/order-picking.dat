40|$|Graduation date: 1987 This paper {{addresses}} the <b>order-picking</b> {{problem in a}} warehouse and establishes some criteria for the planning, design, and improvement of a warehouse layout to increase the <b>order-picking</b> efficiency. A simulation model has been developed to study the effect of warehouse layout on the <b>order-picking</b> throughput. Three major design elements of the warehouse layout are considered: crossing aisles, picking aisles orientation, and dock location. The system throughput is {{measured in terms of}} the traveling and waiting time of the picking vehicles. The results indicate that the <b>order-picking</b> efficiency can be substantially improved by orienting the picking aisles perpendicular to the dock, placing or locating the crossing aisles parallel to the dock and by locating the dock on the longitudinal side of the warehouse...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{customer}} orders {{with high}} product variety in small quantities are often received and requested for timely delivery. However, the <b>order-picking</b> {{process is a}} labour-intensive and costly activity to handle those small orders separately. In such cases, small orders are often grouped into batches so that two or more orders can be served at once to increase the picking efficiency and thus reduce the travel distance. In this paper, an <b>order-picking</b> operations system (OPOS) is proposed to assist the formulation of an <b>order-picking</b> plan and batch-handling sequence. The study integrates a mathematical model and fuzzy logic technique to divide the receiving orders into batches and prioritise the batch-handling sequence for picking, respectively. Through the proposed system, the <b>order-picking</b> process can be managed as batches with common picking locations to minimise the travel distance, and the batch-picking sequence can be determined as well.

40|$|Warehousing {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{viewed as a}} non-value-adding activity {{but in recent years}} a number of new developments have meant that supply chain logistics have become critical to profitability. This paper focuses specifically on <b>order-picking</b> which is a key factor affecting warehouse performance. Order picking is the operation of retrieving goods from specified storage locations based on customer orders. Today’s warehouses face challenges for greater responsiveness to customer orders that require more flexibility than conventional strategies can offer. Hence, dynamic <b>order-picking</b> strategies that allow for changes of pick-lists during a pick cycle have attracted attention recently. In this paper we introduce an interventionist routing algorithm for optimising the dynamic <b>order-picking</b> routes. The algorithm is tested using a set of simulations based on an industrial case example. The results indicate that under a range of conditions, the proposed interventionist routing algorithm can outperform both static and heuristic dynamic <b>order-picking</b> routing algorithms...|$|E
40|$|An {{aggregate}} {{model of}} an <b>order-picking</b> workstation is proposed for an automated warehouse with a goods-to-men <b>order-picking</b> system. A key {{aspect of the}} model is that the various stochasticities {{that contribute to the}} workstation performance are not modelled in detail. Rather, these are aggregated into a single effective process time distribution, which is calculated from arrival and departure times of products at the workstation. Two model variants have been developed namely for workstations processing products and orders in first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and non-FCFS sequence. Both model variants have been validated using data obtained from an operating <b>order-picking</b> workstation. The use of aggregate models in practice is then elaborated...|$|E

Stochastic bounds are deduced for the cycle time, which corresponds to the order flow time. These bounds are shown to be adequate and aid in setting targets for the throughput of the storage area. The paper thus complements existing literature, which mainly focuses on optimizing the operations in the storage area.

40|$|There {{is hardly}} any other task in {{material}} flow systems where {{the material to}} be moved and the corresponding information flow is as closely connected as in <b>order-picking</b> systems. <b>Order-picking</b> offers a large potential for rationalisation and automation especially within the material flow chain from production to delivery. The ranges of possible solutions {{on the one hand}} and the requirements on the other hand are more differentiated than in any other material flow system. Characteristic for <b>order-picking</b> are increasing labour costs and an often great physical strain for workers. Permanently increasing product ranges in line with changes in demand, a trend towards smaller order batches, the demand for short-term deliveries and increasing customer requirements show the complexity of this field. Therefore, <b>order-picking</b> often presents an unclosed gap, as far as automation is concerned. This is closely related to the fact that necessary information could not yet be provided upfront. By appl ying new optimisation methods for automatic processing of customer orders, all necessary information can be made available at the time of request. This is the key for the efficient rationalisation of <b>order-picking</b> systems and the integration of material handling systems.

An important aspect of {{inventory management}} involves the storage of stock in a warehouse, and the effect that product location within the facility has on warehouse operations.

The aim of the procedure is to improve <b>order-picking</b> efficiency measured by {{the time it takes to}} fill the orders. We consider several approaches, presenting two greedy heuristic algorithms that exploit important features of an order history. Simulated annealing is used to further improve these solutions.

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} competitiveness on {{the global}} markets enforces {{the need for a}} fast and reliable delivery. This task is possible to perform by improving the <b>order-picking</b> systems. The implementation of automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) is not always profitable. In the warehouses where the <b>order-picking</b> is performed in accordance with the principle of picker-to-part rule, the picking efficiency optimization includes among others: the warehouse layout, the storage policy, the routing heuristic, the way of zoning, the order-batching method, and the sequencing of pick-lists. In the paper the impact of the storage policy on the <b>order-picking</b> times is checked. 	Methods: The influence of storage based on Heskett’s cube-per-order index (COI) on the average <b>order-picking</b> times is analyzed. The items based on increasing values of COI index are divided on classes. To determine the demand for items the analytical function proposed by Caron is used. 	Results: In the paper the benefits of storage based on COI index are compared with random storage and storage based only on picking frequency. It is assumed that the bin, to which the picker collects items has limited capacity – some orders has to be divided on smaller pick-lists. The analysis was performed using simulation tools. Additionally, the algorithm (taking into account different sizes of picker’s bin) for order-batching is presented. 	Conclusions: The analysis shows that the COI-based storage is particularly effective when the size of items increases. The COI-based curve is less skewed than the curve based only on picking frequency. The choice of storage policy should be carried out together with routing heuristic. The use of batching algorithm significantly increases the effectiveness of the <b>order-picking</b> process, but the optimal size of picker’s bin (and batch) should be optimized with consideration the sorting process...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} basic warehousing activities, namely: movement, information storage and transfer, {{as well as}} connections between typical warehouse operations (reception, transfer, assigning storage position and put-away, <b>order-picking,</b> hoarding and sorting, cross-docking, shipping). It presents a classification of the warehouse <b>order-picking</b> systems in terms of manual labor on offer as well as external (marketing channels, consumer’s demand structure, supplier’s replenishment structure and inventory level, total production demand, economic situation) and internal (mechanization level, information accessibility, warehouse dimensionality, method of dispatch for shipping, zoning, batching, storage assignment method, routing method) factors affecting the designing systems complexity. Basic optimization considerations are described. There is a literature review on the following sub-problems of planning and control of orderpicking processes. A layout design problem has been taken in account at two levels — external (facility layout problem) and internal (aisle configuration problem). For a problem of distributing goods or stock keeping units the following methods are emphasized: random, nearest open storage position, and dedicated (COI-based, frequency-based) distribution, as well as class-based and familygrouped (complimentary- and contact-based) one. Batching problem can be solved by two main methods, i. e. proximity order batching (seed and saving algorithms) and time-window order batching. There are two strategies for a zoning problem: progressive and synchronized, and also a special case of zoning — bucket brigades method. Hoarding/sorting problem is briefly reviewed. <b>Order-picking</b> routing problem will be thoroughly described in the next article of the cycle “Warehouse <b>order-picking</b> process”. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} parts-to-picker warehouses with remotely located <b>order-picking</b> workstations. More specifically, we deduce mathematical expressions for the order flow times, which are defined as the time between release and completion of a customer order in the warehouse. To this end, we model an <b>order-picking</b> workstation as a polling system so that order flow times correspond to cycle times in the polling system. The <b>order-picking</b> policy of each order picker handling one order {{at a time to}} avoid picking errors is captured by a specific service discipline, which, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, has not been studied before. As this service discipline does not satisfy the so-called branching property, we establish stochastic bounds for the order flow times. These bounds are shown to be adequate and aid in setting targets for the throughput of the storage area, which, in turn, is the input rate of the workstations. As research on parts-to-picker warehouses has traditionally focused on optimizing operations in the storage area, we believe our results are complementary to those established in literature...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{key element}} of the {{evaluation}} of warehouse operation is the average <b>order-picking</b> time. In warehouses where the <b>order-picking</b> process is carried out according to the "picker-to-part" rule the <b>order-picking</b> time is usually proportional to the distance covered by the picker while picking items. This distance can by estimated by simulations or using mathematical equations. In the paper only the best described in the literature one-block rectangular warehouses are considered. 	Material and methods: For the one-block rectangular warehouses there are well known five routing heuristics. In the paper the author considers the return heuristic in two variants. The paper presents well known Hall&# 39;s and De Koster&# 39;s equations for the average distance traveled by the picker while completing items from one pick list.

40|$|This article {{continues}} “Warehouse <b>order-picking</b> process” {{cycle and}} describes order-picker routing sub-problem of a warehouse <b>order-picking</b> process. It draws analogies between the orderpickers’ routing problem and traveling salesman’s problem, shows {{differences between the}} standard problem statement of a traveling salesman and routing problem of warehouse orderpickers, and gives the particular Steiner’s problem statement of a traveling salesman. Warehouse layout with a typical order is represented by a graph, with some its vertices corresponding to mandatory order-picker’s visits and some other ones being noncompulsory. The paper describes an optimal Ratliff-Rosenthal algorithm to solve order-picker’s routing problem for the single-block warehouses, i. e. warehouses with only two crossing aisles, defines seven equivalent classes of partial routing sub-graphs and five transitions used to have an optimal routing sub-graph of a order-picker. An extension of optimal Ratliff-Rosenthal order-picker routing algorithm for multi-block warehouses is presented and also reasons for using the routing heuristics instead of exact optimal algorithms are given. The paper offers algorithmic description of the following seven routing heuristics: S-shaped, return, midpoint, largest gap, aisle-by-aisle, composite, and combined as well as modification of combined heuristics. The comparison of orderpicker routing heuristics for one- and two-block warehouses is to be described in the next article of the “Warehouse <b>order-picking</b> process” cycle. </p...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{available}} for the automated <b>order-picking</b> of goods that are packed in pouches. Pouches are produced and stored on a chain to simplify subsequent handling operations. In the <b>order-picking</b> zone, the chain is automatically fed forward by a cover band drive, cut into single pouches, and dispensed to fulfill customer orders. The approach is very promising but {{has not yet been}} put into practice since there is still a lack of rules for a proper dimensioning. This thesis discusses the design aspects concerned with the new <b>order-picking</b> method. Detailed analytical, simulative, and experimental analyses are conducted and used to derive the missing tools for the dimensioning. The special loads that occur inside the pouch chain during the feed process are analyzed, a pouch test strategy that is applicable to any case of application is developed, and a mathematical model for the evaluation of pouch and pouch chain guidance design is derived. General design aspects of the cover band drive are discussed, and a simulation model is developed for the analysis and evaluation of the mechanics of and inside the drive. In particular, this model allows for the calculation of cover band pretension variations due to the inhomogeneous and compliant pouch chains which are affecting an undisturbed feed movement. A cover band test rig is developed and used to verify the dimensioning tools. Apart from this verification, further aspects, such as the positioning accuracy of the pouch cross seals for cutting, are analyzed experimentally. Recommendations for the dimensioning of a picking device are given. Based upon the key performance figures elaborated this way, design aspects regarding an entire picking system are examined.

40|$|Order picking {{has long}} been {{identified}} as the most labour-intensive and costly activity for almost every warehouse; the cost of order picking {{is estimated to be}} as much as 55 % of the total warehouse operating expense. Any underperformance in order picking can lead to unsatisfactory service and high operational cost for its warehouse, and consequently for the whole supply chain. In order to operate efficiently, the orderpicking process needs to be robustly designed and optimally controlled. This paper gives a literature overview on typical decision problems in design and control of manual <b>order-picking</b> processes.

40|$|Class-based storage policy {{distributes}} products among {{a number}} of classes and for each class it reserves a region within the storage area. The procedures reported in the literature for formation of storage classes primarily consider <b>order-picking</b> cost ignoring storage-space cost.

40|$|In recent years, growing {{national}} and international competition {{as well as the}} increasingly exacting demands of the consumer have led to greater product diversity and ever shorter product life cycles while the size of production lots decreased at the same time. As a result of this development, the importance of flexible automated assembly in the production of small and medium-sized lots is growing apace. In most of the flexible assembly systems workpieces are mostly stored in workpiece-specific feeding systems which are normally integrated in an assembly station and they go on causing a major proportion of all breakdowns in automated assembly systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} develope a sorting and <b>order-picking</b> cell that is decoupled from and independent of the assembly system for delivering different workpieces in a highly flexible manner. After identifying the major requirements and constraints governing workpiece delivery in flexible assembly systems, scientific facts and solutions for a feeding system that would simultaneously convey and sort a variety of workpieces was also developed as a process by which workpiece-specific magazines for flexible positioning and sorting systems could be designed automatically. To describe the behaviour of workpieces in a magazine cavity during the magazining process, a mathematical approach was developed in which a computer simulation is used to determine the boundaries for adjusting device parameters such as maximum oscillation amplitudes and magazine tilt angles. Next, the processes and components that had been developed were assembled in an auto-mated sorting and <b>order-picking</b> cell.

While some 20 years ago a logistic planner had to consider and to evaluate approximately five system-variants, the variety of technical solutions has almost increased explosively {{in the last few}} years furthermore, current solutions show a more complex process behaviour and the interrelations between the different parts of a heterogeneous structured overall system are much more dynamical.
