5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} a transit of Mercury and a transit <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> does occur, but extremely infrequently. Such an event last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, {{and again on}} 29 March 224,508. The simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> is currently possible, but very rare. The next solar eclipse occurring during a transit <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> will be on 5 April 15,232. The last time a solar eclipse occurred during a transit <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> was on 1 November 15,607 BC. The day after the Venerean transit of 3 June 1769 there was a total solar eclipse, which was visible in Northern America, Europe and Northern Asia.|$|E
5|$|From September 1610, Galileo {{observed}} that Venus exhibited {{a full set}} of phases {{similar to that of the}} Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in Ptolemy's geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases <b>of</b> <b>Venus,</b> therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.|$|E

The existence of lightning in the atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> has been controversial since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes.

5|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of a transit <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> {{was made by}} Jeremiah Horrocks from his home at Carr House in Much Hoole, near Preston in England, on 4 December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar then in use in England). His friend, William Crabtree, also observed this transit from Broughton, near Manchester. Kepler had predicted transits in 1631 and 1761 and a near miss in 1639. Horrocks corrected Kepler's calculation for the orbit <b>of</b> <b>Venus,</b> realized that transits <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> would occur in pairs 8 years apart, and so predicted the transit of 1639. Although he was uncertain of the exact time, he calculated that the transit was to begin at approximately 15:00. Horrocks focused {{the image of the}} Sun through a simple telescope onto a piece of paper, where the image could be safely observed. After observing for most of the day, he was lucky to see the transit as clouds obscuring the Sun cleared at about 15:15, just half an hour before sunset. Horrocks's observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size <b>of</b> <b>Venus,</b> as well as to make an estimate of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun— the astronomical unit. He estimated that distance to be 59.4millionmiles (95.6Gm, 0.639AU)– about two thirds of the actual distance of 93millionmiles (149.6 million km), but a more accurate figure than any suggested up to that time. The observations were not published until 1661, well after Horrocks's death.|$|E

5|$|The {{preceding}} pair of transits {{occurred in}} December 1874 and December 1882; the following pair {{will occur in}} December 2117 and December 2125. The oldest film known is the 1874 Passage de Venus, showing the 1874 Venus transit of the sun. Historically, transits <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> were important, because they allowed astronomers to determine {{the size of the}} astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Horrocks in 1639. Captain Cook's exploration of the east coast of Australia came after he had sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to observe a transit <b>of</b> <b>Venus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{troposphere}} on Venus contains 99% of {{the atmosphere}} by mass. Ninety percent {{of the atmosphere}} <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> is within 28km of the surface; by comparison, 90% of the atmosphere of Earth is within 10km of the surface. At a height of 50km the atmospheric pressure is approximately equal to that at the surface of Earth. On the night side <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> clouds can still be found at 80km above the surface.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{atmosphere}} <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> {{can be measured}} from Earth when the planet crosses the sun in a rare event known as a solar transit. The last solar transit <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> occurred in 2012. Using quantitative astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were able to analyse sunlight that passed through the planet's atmosphere to reveal chemicals within it. As the technique to analyse light to discover information about a planet's atmosphere only first showed results in 2001, {{this was the first}} opportunity to gain conclusive results in this way on the atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>Venus</b> since observation of solar transits began. This solar transit was a rare opportunity considering the lack of information on the atmosphere between 65 and 85km. The solar transit in 2004 enabled astronomers to gather a large amount of data useful not only in determining the composition of the {{upper atmosphere}} <b>of</b> <b>Venus,</b> but also in refining techniques used in searching for extrasolar planets. The atmosphere of mostly CO2, absorbs near-infrared radiation, making it easy to observe. During the 2004 transit, the absorption in the atmosphere as a function of wavelength revealed the properties of the gases at that altitude. The Doppler shift of the gases also enabled wind patterns to be measured.|$|E
50|$|Tesserae are {{regions of}} heavily {{deformed}} terrain on Venus, characterized {{by two or}} more intersecting tectonic elements, high topography, and subsequent high radar backscatter. Tesserae often represent the oldest material at any given location and {{are among the most}} tectonically deformed terrains on Venus's surface. Diverse types of tessera terrain exist. It is not currently clear if this is due to a variety in the interactions <b>of</b> <b>Venus's</b> mantle with regional crustal or lithospheric stresses, or if these diverse terrains represent different locations in the timeline of crustal plateau formation and fall. Multiple models of tessera formation exist and further extensive studies <b>of</b> <b>Venus's</b> surface are necessary to fully understand this complex terrain.|$|R

40|$|Implications for {{the origin}} and {{evolution}} of the terrestrial planets are drawn from a comparison <b>of</b> the <b>Venus,</b> earth and Mars atmosphere volatile inventories. Attention {{is given to the}} possible loss of an appreciable amount <b>of</b> water from <b>Venus,</b> in light <b>of</b> recent evidence for a 100 -fold deuterium enrichment. Ar- 40 and He- 4 abundances suggest that outgassing has been inefficient for much <b>of</b> <b>Venus's</b> lifetime, in keeping with evidence for a lower level of tectonic activity on Venus than on the earth. Attention is also given to Venus's CO 2 geochemistry. The picture now emerging is that <b>of</b> a <b>Venus</b> that began to evolve along a path {{similar to that of the}} earth, but suffered a catastrophic, runaway greenhouse effect early in its lifetime. How early the castastrophe occurred may be suggested by the presently low inventories of radiogenic argon and helium in its atmosphere...|$|R
