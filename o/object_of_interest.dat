5|$|Kepler-4b {{was named}} {{because it was}} the first planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of its star, Kepler-4. The star was, in turn, named for the Kepler Mission, a NASA satellite whose purpose is to discover Earth-like planets in a section of the sky between constellations Cygnus and Lyra using the transit method. Using this method, Kepler notes small and steady decreases in a star's brightness that are measured as a planet crosses in front of it. Initially, Kepler-4b was detected as a transit event by the Kepler telescope and considered a Kepler <b>Object</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interest</b> with the designation KOI 7.01.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b {{is one of}} {{the first}} five planets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is a Hot Jupiter that orbits a subgiant star that is more massive, larger, and more diffuse than the Sun is. Kepler-5 was first flagged as the location of a possibly transiting planet, and was reclassified as a Kepler <b>Object</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interest</b> until follow-up observations confirmed the planet's existence and many of its characteristics. The planet's discovery was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010. The planet has approximately twice the mass of Jupiter, and is about 1.5 times larger. It is also fifteen times hotter than Jupiter. Kepler-5b orbits Kepler-5 every 3.5 days at a distance of approximately 0.051 AU (7.6 Gm).|$|E
5|$|NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{which was}} {{launched}} in March 2009, collected photometric data continuously over a four-month period in a small area of sky, using a 0.95m Schmidt telescope. When the data collected during this period was analyzed, 1235 planetary candidates were identified amongst the observed 150,000 stars; all of these planetary candidates were suspected of transiting their host stars, in which the planetary body periodically crosses in front of and slightly dims its host star. Because the data collected on the transits of KOI-98 (later known as Kepler-14b) seemed very clearly to indicate a planet, Kepler identified KOI-98 early on in its mission. Data on the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> was forwarded to the Kepler Follow-up Program for a follow-up investigation.|$|E

5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E

5|$|The Kepler spacecraft's {{first days}} of science {{activity}} revealed a series of transit events, in which some body (such as a planet) crosses in front of, and therefore dims, its host star. Such objects {{were taken from the}} Kepler Input Catalog and reclassified as Kepler <b>Objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interest.</b> Kepler-5 was one <b>of</b> these <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> and was given the designation KOI-18.|$|R

25|$|Cogan occulomotor apraxia {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} of development. Affected children have difficulty moving their eyes only to a new visual target, so they will turn their head past the target to “drag” the eyes to the new <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> then turn the head back. This tendency becomes evident in late infancy and toddler years, and mostly improves with time. This contrasts to the oculomotor difficulties evident in children with A-T, which are not evident in early childhood but emerge over time. Cogan’s oculomotor apraxia is generally an isolated problem, or {{may be associated with}} broader developmental delay.|$|E
25|$|Toothed {{whales are}} capable of making {{a broad range of}} sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three {{categories}} of sounds can be identified: frequency-modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds, and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function, and through burst-pulsed sounds, though {{the nature and extent of}} that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are used for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Toothed whale biosonar clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.|$|E
25|$|Compared with Henry's {{first two}} wives, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, Blount's {{importance}} to history was negligible. However, she was certainly {{more important than}} any other mistress the king had during his first marriage. Blount was the mother of Henry's only acknowledged illegitimate child, and {{at one point in the}} 1520s it was suggested that her son should be named the King's legal heir. Although nothing came of these plans, and Blount had little to do with her son's upbringing, the fact that she was the mother of such an important child made her an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to many of her contemporaries.|$|E

25|$|Optical {{microscopy}} and {{electron microscopy}} involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E
25|$|The girl’s development, Freud argued, is more complicated. Generally, as with males, {{the first}} <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{is also the}} mother figure {{and for the first}} four years and beyond a girl remains {{attached}} to her mother. However, when the female child learns about “castration” it sparks disappointment and she blames her mother for her lack of a penis. Because of this, the girl gives up masturbation and in turn shifts focus from her mother to her father. By abandoning masturbation the girl can no longer be active, thus displaying a passive nature. The father then assists her by smoothly transitioning her towards a more feminine path. Furthermore, the girl’s affection towards her father will also influence her to emulate her mother’s feminine qualities and eventually adopt more gender-typed behaviours.|$|E

25|$|Wide-field multiphoton {{microscopy}} {{refers to}} an optical non-linear imaging technique tailored for ultrafast imaging in which a large area of the object is illuminated and imaged {{without the need for}} scanning. High intensities are required to induce non-linear optical processes such as two-photon fluorescence or second harmonic generation. In scanning multiphoton microscopes the high intensities are achieved by tightly focusing the light, and the image is obtained by stage- or beam-scanning the sample. In wide-field multiphoton microscopy the high intensities are best achieved using an optically amplified pulsed laser source to attain a large field of view (~100µm). The image in this case is obtained as a single frame with a CCD without the need of scanning, making the technique particularly useful to visualize dynamic processes simultaneously across the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> With wide-field multiphoton microscopy the frame rate can be increased up to a 1000-fold compared to multiphoton scanning microscopy.|$|E
25|$|When {{there are}} many degrees of freedom, one method of {{visualizing}} the mode shapes is by animating them using structural analysis software such as Femap or ANSYS. An example of animating mode shapes {{is shown in the}} figure below for a cantilevered -beam as demonstrated using modal analysis on ANSYS. In this case, the finite element method was used to generate an approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in order to solve a discrete eigenvalue problem. Note that, in this case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface (for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies). Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom and hence as many natural frequencies and mode shapes, provides a good approximation for the first natural frequencies and modes. Generally, only the first few modes are important for practical applications.|$|E
25|$|From {{its origins}} in the Persian and Ottoman empires of the 19th century the Bahá'í Faith was able to gain {{converts}} elsewhere in Asia, Europe, and North America by the early 20th century. John Esslemont performed the first review of the worldwide progress of the religion in 1919. `Abdu'l-Bahá, son of {{the founder of the}} religion, then set goals for the community through his Tablets of the Divine Plan shortly before his death. Shoghi Effendi then initiated systematic pioneering efforts that brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world and converts from more than 2000 tribes and peoples. There were serious setbacks in the Soviet Union where Bahá'í communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories ceased to exist. However plans continued building to 1953 when the Bahá'ís initiated a Ten Year Crusade after plans had focused on Latin America and Europe after WWII. That last stage was largely towards parts of Africa. Wide-scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa particularly was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. There was diplomatic pressure from northern arab countries against this development that was eventually overcome. Starting in the 1980s with Perestroyka the Bahá'ís began to re-organize across the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc. While sometimes failing to meet official minimums for recognitions as a religion, communities of Bahá'ís do exist from Poland to Mongolia. The worldwide progress was such that the Encyclopædia Britannica (2002) identified the religion as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity. It has established Bahá'í Houses of Worship by continental region and been the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and support of diverse non-Bahá'í notable people from Leo Tolstoy to Khalil Gibran to Mohandas K. Gandhi to Desmond Tutu. See List of Bahá'ís for a list of notable Bahá'ís.|$|E

25|$|The Mask of Life's descent ends in Mahri Nui, an {{underwater}} city originally part of Voya Nui before it broke off and {{sunk into the}} sea. Upon sight, it becomes an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to the Matoran villagers {{as well as the}} Barraki: six former warlords sent to the Pit (a prison that sits on the lip of the city) after their crimes as part of the League of Six Kingdoms. But after the Pit was damaged in the Great Cataclysm, they escaped into the surrounding ocean and were mutated by its mutagen waters. Believing the mask can change them back so they can rule the Kingdoms once again, the Barraki battle one another for possession of the Ignika. Meanwhile, the Toa Inika continue their descent through the stone cord, where they battle mutated incarnations of the Piraka, Vezon and an army of murderous Zyglak. Upon reaching the depths of the sea, the Mask of Life transforms the heroes into the water-breathing Toa Mahri, complete with new masks and weapons. The team engage with the Barraki and their aquatic Rahi armies upon arrival, but {{in the midst of the}} battle, Matoro is imprisoned in the Pit by a robotic Maxilos guard that reveals itself as Makuta Teridax, who possessed the robot after his essence followed the Toa through the stone cord. He informs Matoro that Mata Nui's life can only be saved if the Toa shatter the cord, and although not trustful in the villain's words, he relays the information to his team-mates. They agree and evacuate Matoran from both locations before proceeding to destroy the cord; sending Voya Nui plummeting into the ocean and demolishing Mahri Nui in the process. But by the time the Toa Mahri retrieve the Ignika, Mata Nui dies. Believing there's still hope, Matoro - the one person who can touch the Ignika without becoming cursed - races towards a hole in the seabed with it before Voya Nui descends to close it, leaving his team to continue fighting the Barraki. Once in, he falls through a waterfall in what resembles a large cave and hears a voice from inside the mask telling him to put it on. In doing so, Matoro learns of the Ignika's history and how to use it to resurrect Mata Nui. Now knowing it was his destiny to sacrifice himself to save the universe, Matoro uses the sentient mask's powers to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and make them amphibious, before the mask turns his body into pure energy that saves the Great Spirit. Meanwhile, the Maxilos body that Teridax inhabited is found badly damaged after a ferocious battle with the Barraki's armies, and is so presumed dead. Mata Nui has been saved, but remains asleep.|$|E

500|$|A key {{concept in}} {{interpreting}} radiocarbon dates is archaeological association: {{what is the}} true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site?

[...] Metal grave goods, for example, cannot be radiocarbon dated, but they may be found in a grave with a coffin, charcoal, or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at the same time. [...] In these cases a date for the coffin or charcoal is indicative of the date of deposition of the grave goods, because of the direct functional relationship between the two. [...] There are also cases where there is no functional relationship, but the association is reasonably strong: for example, a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to the rubbish pit.|$|E
