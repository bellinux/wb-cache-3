50|$|Gas lift or Bubble pumps use the {{artificial}} lift technique of raising a fluid {{such as water}} or oil by introducing bubbles of compressed air, water vapor or other vaporous bubbles into the <b>outlet</b> <b>tube.</b> This {{has the effect of}} reducing the hydrostatic pressure in the <b>outlet</b> <b>tube</b> vs. the hydrostatic pressure at the inlet side of the tube.|$|E
50|$|Biosand {{filters are}} {{typically}} constructed from concrete or plastic. At {{the top of}} the filter, a tightly fitted lid prevents contamination and unwanted pests from entering the filter. Below this, the diffuser plate prevents disturbance of the biofilm when water is poured into the filter. Water then travels through the sand column, which removes pathogens and suspended solids. Below the sand column, a layer of gravel prevents sand from entering the drainage layer and clogging the <b>outlet</b> <b>tube.</b> Below the separating layer is the drainage layer consisting of coarser gravel that prevents clogging near the base of the <b>outlet</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E

They represent the two inlet <b>tubes</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> of the BHE and are connected to temperature-controlled water reservoirs. The latter provides stable temperatures, with an accuracy of 0.01  °C, and the attached pump enables volume flow rates of 0.5  l s− 1. At the beginning of the experiment, the sand and the water in the side tanks were at the laboratory temperature, which varied between 20 and 22  °C during the experiment.

50|$|Idle time {{typically}} comprises {{greater than}} 80% {{of the daily}} cycle; during this time, microbial attenuation processes {{are likely to be}} significant. Most removal occurs where water is in contact with the biofilm. The processes that occur in the biofilm have not been identified. When the standing water layer reaches the level of <b>outlet</b> <b>tube,</b> the flow stops. Ideally, this should be high enough to keep the biofilm in the sand layer wet and allow oxygen to diffuse through the standing water to the biolayer. The pause period allows microorganisms in the biolayer to consume the pathogens and nutrients in the water. The rate of flow through the filter is restored as they are consumed. If the pause period is too long, the biolayer will consume all of the pathogens and nutrients, and will die, reducing the efficiency of the filter when it is used again. The pause period should be between 1 and 48 hours. Pathogens in the non-biological zone die from a lack of nutrients and oxygen.|$|E

5000|$|Over time, {{particles}} accumulate {{between the}} filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms {{along the top}} of the diffuser plate. Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and bioclogging). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time APS1, it may become too slow for the users’ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litre/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance. The [...] "swirl and dump", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate. About 1 gal is poured into the filter before cleaning (assuming the filter is empty). The upper layer of sand is then swirled in a circular motion. Dirty water from the swirling is dumped out and the sand is smoothed out at the top. This process is repeated until flow rate is restored. Cleaning the diffuser plate, <b>outlet</b> <b>tube,</b> lid, and outside surfaces of the filters regularly is also recommended. Long-term sustainability and efficacy of biosand filters depends on education and support from knowledgeable support personnel.|$|E
5000|$|Sharks {{can detect}} weak {{electric}} fields {{in their environment}} using ampullary receptors in to find their prey. A study by Kalmijn et al. 1971 observed this action. [...] Kalmijn used a type of flatfish, called a plaice as a living source of food along with the electrodes and the whiting pieces. He saw that sharks could detect plaice buried under the sand, and would smoothly change direction to where the plaice lay hidden and attack it. To determine if sharks were using electric fields or smell to detect their prey, he devised an experiment. He used the shark species Scyliorhinus canicula and the ray species Raja clavata. He created an agar chamber, which would hold a plaice (small fish), and an opening tube downstream to separate any smells. The agar chamber would enclose the plaice on all sides. The agar does not allow odors to pass, but it does allow electric field to pass through it. Kalmijn would place the plaice in the agar and bury it underneath the sand to eliminate any visual cues. When sharks were in feeding mode, they would locate the agar with the plaice underneath it and attack it near the head region (where bioelectric fields are thought to originate). If chopped up bits of whiting were put in the agar chamber, the shark would try to locate the prey via smell {{coming out of the}} <b>outlet</b> <b>tube.</b> Also, if the plaice was put in an agar chamber and covered with polyethylene film, the sharks could no longer detect the plaice. The polyethylene layer inhibits the bioelectric fields and prevents the shark from using passive electrolocation to hunt its prey. One additional behavior observed in sharks is their orientation to the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth’s magnetic field acts as a uniform field, B. When the shark swim through the Earth's magnetic field with its own velocity v, the shark induces its own electric current. Sharks swimming though the Earth's magnetic field create a voltage gradient that could act as a physical basis for compass orientation.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  7 that the net {{administration}} dose can be estimated as the difference in the radioactivity between the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> for the C 15 O 2 inhalation scan. Transient changes in inhaling the gaseous radiopharmaceuticals suggested that population-based AIFs were limited in terms of providing individual AIFs.

This could be modeled, but it is beyond of the scope of the present study. Further studies need to be carried out.|$|R

Increasing the number of inlet tube in the borehole increases the contact surface area and then leads to increase of heat exchange with the ground.

30|$|In our model, {{we assumed}} {{a depth of}} 85  m in a 100  m BHE, with a soil {{temperature}} of 10  °C at this depth. The temperatures at the inlet <b>tubes</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> are set to 7.0 and 7.3  °C, respectively. Thus, the temperature difference of the tubes is 0.3  K, as obtained from the numerical simulations in the previous chapter. With this model, we study the influence of groundwater flow on the temperature distribution, especially on the temperature at the sensor positions shown in Fig.  1. We consider three different groundwater flow velocities of 10 − 6 m s− 1, 10 − 7 m s− 1, and 10 − 8 m s− 1 and vary the flow direction from 0 ° (W direction) to 180 ° (E direction) in steps of 22.5 °.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The air {{and water}} flow {{distribution}} are experimentally studied for a round header – flat tube geometry simulating a parallel flow heat exchanger. The number of branch flat tube is 25. The effects of <b>tube</b> <b>outlet</b> direction, <b>tube</b> protrusion depth and quality are investigated. The flow at the header inlet is identified as annular. For the upward flow configuration, the water flow distribution is significantly affected by the tube protrusion depth. For flush-mounted configuration, most of the water flows through frontal part of the header. As the protrusion depth increases, minimum water is forced to the rear part of the header. Possible explanations are provided based on the flow visualization results...|$|R
30|$|Under {{stationary}} conditions, {{the model}} with groundwater flow as advective heat transport is dominant (soil temperature is 10  °C) {{and is on}} average warmer than the one without flow. From the results in Fig.  4, groundwater flow appears to only minutely change the temperature at the inner ring sensors labeled 1 – 8 (see Figs.  1 and 3). However, the inner ring is essential for determining the sensor’s position relative to the BHE tubes. As the double U-tube heat exchanger is asymmetrical, the temperature shift resulting from the BHE layout {{has to be taken}} into account. Depending on the groundwater’s angle of incidence, the distorted temperature distribution differs with the relative position of the inlet <b>tubes</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes,</b> provided that they have a temperature difference. The influence of groundwater flow on the inner and outer ring temperatures will be discussed in the following section.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} combining {{solid and}} fluid models and fluid-structure interaction effects were performed for a diaphragm-type ventricular assist device (VAD). These simulations include an open loop configuration, {{in which the}} VAD inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are open to the}} surroundings, and a closed loop configuration, in which the VAD is connected to an idealized model of the circulatory system. Comparisons have been made between the open loop case and previous experimental and numerical results for a similar VAD designed by a group at Brunel University. Differences between the two models can be partially accounted for by differences in flow forcing. Even with these differences, this comparison validates this method as a tool for the design and optimization of VADs. For the closed loop case, results were limited by the required use of a slightly compressible fluid model. Further relaxation of this requirement is needed to fully explore closed loop simulations...|$|R

The size of the rotating cylinder is of 0. 5 D, where D is the diameter of the cyclone body, and is {{the same size as the}} <b>outlet</b> <b>tube.</b> The dust collection efficiency as well as the pressure loss has been measured when the inlet flow speed is 9 ~ 21 m/s and the rotating speed of the cylinder is 37 ~ 63 m/s. The velocity and pressure distributions were also measured. It is found that the collection efficiency decreases and the pressure loss increases as the rotating speed increases. It is also shown that both the inward radial velocity and the upward vertical velocity become large as the rotating cylinder increases its speed. As a whole, the rotation of the internal cylinder makes worse performance of the cyclone dust collector...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{analysis}} of heat exchange rate of {{several types of}} vertical ground heat exchangers (GHEs) with different condition of inlet water temperatures, borehole depths, and tube configurations have been carried out. The GHE models were built and simulated by using a commercial CFD code, FLUENT. Heat exchange rates per unit borehole depth of the GHEs increase in the cooling mode and decrease in the heating mode of 3. 4 W/m for U-tube, 5. 7 W/m for double tube, and 3. 3 W/m for multi-tube with increasing of 1 ???C of the temperature difference between inlet water and ground. Also, increasing the borehole depth lowers temperature difference between circulated water and surrounding ground and then lowers the heat exchange with the ground. Furthermore, thermal interference between inlet and outlet tubes due to the tube configuration affects significantly to the heat exchange rate of the GHEs. Insulating the <b>outlet</b> <b>tube</b> and increasing the inlet tube diameter in the multi-tube GHE contributes to the increasing the GHE performance...|$|E
