25|$|Genetic {{background}} {{may contribute}} to prostate cancer risk, as suggested by associations with race, family, and specific gene variants. Men who have a first-degree relative (father or brother) with prostate cancer have twice {{the risk of developing}} prostate cancer, and those with two first-degree relatives affected have a fivefold greater risk compared with men with no family history. In the United States, prostate cancer more commonly affects black men than white <b>or</b> <b>Hispanic</b> men, and is also more deadly in black men. In contrast, the incidence and mortality rates for Hispanic men are one third lower than for non-Hispanic whites. Studies of twins in Scandinavia suggest that 40% of prostate cancer risk can be explained by inherited factors.|$|E

25|$|Apparently part of {{the royal}} agenda for the Council of Husillos of 1088 was the {{enhancing}} of royal control over Coimbra and its environs.

Pierre David identified him as prior of the cathedral chapter of Coimbra and as the protégé of Sisnando Davides, who opposed the substitution of the Mozarabic rite (also known as Visigothic <b>or</b> <b>Hispanic</b> rite) for the Roman rite. But if Sisnando had proposed him and Alfonso had accepted him {{it is difficult to see}} why he was never consecrated.
