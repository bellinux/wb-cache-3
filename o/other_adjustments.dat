5|$|In 1739, the War of Jenkins' Ear {{broke out}} between Britain and Spain, and the {{decision}} was taken to improve the defences at Cromwell Castle. Abraham Tovey, the Master Gunner at the nearby fortification known as the Garrison, constructed a large gun-platform for a battery of six guns on the south-west side of the tower, possibly on top of any pre-existing 16th-century platform. A parapet protected the guns, a new entrance was cut into the main tower and <b>other</b> <b>adjustments</b> made.|$|E

25|$|Historical ecologists {{postulate}} that landscape transformations {{have occurred}} throughout history, {{even before the}} dawn of western civilization. Human-mediated disturbances are predated by soil erosion and animals damming waterways which contributed to waterway transformations. Landscapes, in turn, were altered by waterway transformation. Historical ecology views the effects of human-mediated disturbances on waterway transformation as both subtle and drastic occurrences. Waterways have been modified by humans through the building of irrigation canals, expanding or narrowing waterways, and multiple <b>other</b> <b>adjustments</b> done for agricultural or transportation usage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} some {{properties}} of a decentralized adjustment process which were investigated originally by T. A. Marschak in [Marschak, J. 1968.

XII. of McGuire, C. B., R. Radner (1972), eds. Borch and Mossin, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1972. ]. We correct some mathematical errors. Marschak compares the gross expected payoffs of centralized and decentralized mechanisms. We prove that his Proposition 5 : "the greater regular rate is the better" [Marschak, J. 1968.

Finally Marschak's problem on the finiteness of a modified adjustment process is solved. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{result is}} a {{frequency}} compensated probe for modest frequencies that presents a load of about 10megohms shunted by 12pF. Although such a probe is an improvement, {{it does not work}} when the time scale shrinks to several cable transit times (transit time is typically 5ns). In that time frame, the cable looks like its characteristic impedance, and there will be reflections from the transmission line mismatch at the scope input and the probe that causes ringing. The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe perform well at several hundred megahertz. Consequently, there are <b>other</b> <b>adjustments</b> for completing the compensation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Other</b> <b>adjustments</b> that CBS made {{in hopes}} of {{improving}} its coverage included hiring reporter Sonny Hill to cover the league on a full-time basis. CBS also put microphones and cameras on team huddles to allow viewers {{to see and hear}} coaches at work. Finally, CBS introduced a halftime segment called Red Auerbach on Roundball, featuring the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics coach. The segment intended to not only educate CBS' viewers about the complexities of the pro game, but also to teach young players how to improve their skills. They also subtly introduced audiences to an all-star team based on Auerbach's criteria such as screening and passing. In a Red on Roundball halftime segment which appeared on CBS' NBA telecasts in the 1973–74 season, Auerbach and referee Mendy Rudolph discussed and demonstrated the practice of flopping with obvious disapproval.|$|E
