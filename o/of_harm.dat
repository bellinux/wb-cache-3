5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information.

40|$|An {{evidence}} {{synthesis of}} a medical intervention should assess the balance <b>of</b> benefits and <b>harms.</b> Investigators performing system-atic reviews <b>of</b> <b>harms</b> face challenges in finding data, rating the quality <b>of</b> <b>harms</b> reporting, and synthesizing and displaying data from different sources. Systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>harms</b> often rely primarily on published clinical trials. Identifying important <b>harms</b> <b>of</b> treatment and quantifying the risk associated with them, how-ever, often require {{a broader range of}} data sources, including unpublished trials, observational studies, and unpublished infor-mation on published trials submitted to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Each source of data has some potential for yield-ing important information. Criteria for judging the quality <b>of</b> <b>harms</b> assessment and reporting are still in their early stages of development. Investigators conducting systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>harms</b> should consider empirically validating the criteria they use to judge the validity <b>of</b> studies reporting <b>harms.</b> Synthesizing harms data from different sources requires careful consideration of internal validity, applicability, and sources of heterogeneity. This article highlights examples of approaches to methodologic issues associated with performing systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>harms</b> from 96 Evidence-based Practice Center evidence reports...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees <b>of</b> <b>harm,</b> to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E

5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes <b>of</b> <b>harm</b> and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings.

A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.|$|E

5|$|Péron's {{interview}} describes {{some aspects}} of the behaviour of the King Island emu. He writes that the bird was generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time, then wandered off in pairs. They ate berries, grass and seaweed, and foraged mainly during morning and evening. They were swift runners, but were apparently slower than the mainland birds, due to being fat. They swam well, but only did so when necessary. They reportedly liked the shade of lagoons and the shoreline, rather than open areas. They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves. If unable to flee from the hunting dogs of the sealers, they would defend themselves by kicking, which could inflict a great deal <b>of</b> <b>harm.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} in Cambridge Water Co made an immediate {{change to the}} law, {{for the first time}} requiring foreseeability <b>of</b> <b>harm</b> to be considered in cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher and the general tort of nuisance. It was also significant in implying that Rylands was not an independent tort, something later concluded in the Transco case. Goff's judgment has been criticised on several points by academics, who highlight flaws in wording which leave parts of the judgment ambiguous and a selective assessment of Rylands that ignores outside influences.|$|E

It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot <b>of</b> <b>harm.</b>|$|E

5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence <b>of</b> <b>Harm,</b> dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a health <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work scale from the {{sustainable}} HRM perspective. Design/methodology/approach A three-dimensional model was proposed for the health <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work scale and validated (Total n= 527) using a five-part study (item generation, item reduction, convergent, construct and discriminant validity). Findings Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported that the three dimensions (restrictions for positive health, the risk factors for psychological health and the side effect <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work) simultaneously tap into different aspects <b>of</b> the health <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work construct. The results from the construct validity revealed that health <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work as a phenomenon has manifested itself in different facets <b>of</b> health <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work intensification. Finally, the discriminant validity study revealed that the overlap between the dimensions <b>of</b> the health <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work scale and the dimensions of recovery experience from the work questionnaire is low and it provides support for the discriminant validity of dimensions between these two scales. Practical implications The proposed measure can be used as potential leading indicators for negative occupational health to prevent or delay the onset of work-related illness manifestation or health consequences (sick leave, absenteeism, presenteeism, etc.). Originality/value This is the first study to validate a measure <b>of</b> health <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work and to provide tangible evidence <b>of</b> health <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> work which will subsequently trigger organizations to introduce a planned intervention to improve occupational well-being to promote sustainable HRM...|$|R
