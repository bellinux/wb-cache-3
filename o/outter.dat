50|$|NOD-1 {{recognition}} {{and the presence}} of Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) are two factors that modulate the effect of TCT. NOD-1 is a pattern recognition receptor that detects peptidoglycan. This receptor reacts weakly to TCT in humans, but robustly in mice. TCT is thought to work synergystically with LOS to mediate an inflammatory resposne, thus causing damage to ciliated epithelial cells. Notably, the human pathogens (B. pertussis and N. gonorrhea) that produce excess TCT, causing damage to cilia also both produce LOS in their <b>outter</b> membrane.|$|E

40|$|Weleri is a {{trade and}} {{industry}} town in Kendal Regency. Weleri also has a function as a trade and public service centre for its hinterland, which is crossed by <b>outter</b> ringroad as a primary artery. The function of road must be related to The Main Road Act, number 38 in 2004. Nowadays, there are some problems at <b>outter</b> ringroad of Weleri. One {{of the problem is}} the rapidly development of some activities and building, such as gas station, restaurant, and industry activities which access directly to the <b>outter</b> ringroad. Based on the problem, {{it is important to know}} how the attempts which are done to control the landuse activities in the <b>outter</b> ringroad of Weleri. The aim of this research is to identify the location of service centre as an attempt to control land use activites in the <b>outter</b> ringroad of Weleri. Therefore, there are some analysis that are done, such as landuse, service centre, transportation and feasibility analysis. Based on the result of this research, it is found that the recommended landuse in Weleri and Rowosari District is settlement and farm area. It is based on the score of topography, type of soil and fall of rain intencity. Based on the identification of region which has the potency as a service centre, there are 14 villages in Weleri and Rowosari District which have non-local services. Therefore, it becomes very strategic if the <b>outter</b> ringroad area of Weleri-which is administratively included in Weleri and Rowosari district- is guided as service centre, in order to grow as activities development areas. Identifying of the location of service centre is done by using Guttman schallogram analysis method, which is based on region’s facilities. Based on the result of the analysis, it is found that the location of service centre is in Tratemulyo and Pucuksari Village. Based on the survey of speed, with the assumption that the cross road is in Tratemulyo Village, it is found that speed in the <b>outter</b> ringroad of Weleri is 64 km/hour, while the plan of speed is 60 km/hour. From the findings, it can be concluded that service centre is guided in Tratemulyo and Pucuksari Village as an attempt to control land use activities at <b>outter</b> ringroad of Weleri. It can happen because based on the feasibility analysis, it is found that settlements, restaurants and warehouses can be developed in 135, 00 acre. Based on the result of this research, Kendal Regency Government can suggest the private sector and community who will develop activities in the <b>outter</b> ringroad of Weleri, to develop them especially in Tratemulyo and Pucuksari as activities development area. So that, landuse activities in the <b>outter</b> ringroad of Weleri can be undercontrolled. Keywords: guidance, controlling, service centre...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this disertation is to {{introduce}} and demonstrate {{a new approach to}} robust control of AC electrical drives. The proposed robust control method takes advantage of a nonlinear nature of AC motor d-q equations to construct self-scheduled LPV stator current controller. The benefit of this approach is in maitaining the robustness without any increase in conservatism of the H infinity controller. The resulting controller achieves fast and consistent response in the entire range of operating speeds. Rejection of the load torque disturbance is achieved with nonparametric H infinity speed controller in the <b>outter</b> loop of the cascade structure. The combination of LPV current controller and H infinity speed controller was verified on real-time simulation platform dSPACE ds 1103. Simulation results for both types of AC motors (PMSM and IM) shows that the proposed solution is not only robust with respect to operating speeds but also impervious to wide range of load disturbance values...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} a {{theoretical}} coupled {{study of the}} structural and phonons properties of bundled single- and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), under hydrostatic compression. Our results confirm drastic changes in volume of SWNTs in high-pressure regime as assigned by a phase transition from circular to collapsed phase which are strictly dependent on the tube diameter. For the DWNTs, those results show first a transformation to a polygonized shape of the outer tube and subsequently the simultaneous collapse of the <b>outter</b> and inner tube, {{at the onset of}} the inner tube ovalization. Before the DWNT collapse, phonon calculations reproduce the experimentally observed screening effect on the inner tube pressure induced blue shift both for RBM and tangential G$_z$ modes. Furthermore, the collapse of CNTs bundles induces a sudden redshift of tangential component in agreement with experimental studies. The G$_z$ band analysis of the SWNT collapsed tubes shows that the flattened regions of the tubes are at the origin of their G-band signal. This explains the observed graphite type pressure evolution of the G band in the collapsed phase and provides in addition a mean for the identification of collapsed tubesComment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Proto-planetary and {{transitional}} disks {{which are}} detected in scattered light provide a critical {{test of the}} interpretation of circumstellar disks based on the IR spectral energy distribution (SED) alone. The disk inclination to the line-of-sight, <b>outter</b> radius, and surface brightness (SB) maps or radial SB distributions provided by spatially resolved imaging remove most of the degeneracies inherent in fitting IR SEDs without such observational constraints. We have imaged the disk of SAO 206462 (HD 135344 B) in 1. 1 and 1. 6 µm scattered light with HST/NICMOS and can trace the essentially face-on disk out to 1. 05 ". The cavity detected in sub-mm observations lies entirely under the NICMOS coronagraphic spot, a result consistent with the SED fitting if the star is at d= 140 pc. The SED had previously been classified as a Meeus Group I SED and interpreted as arising in a flared disk. Neither the 1. 1 nor the 1. 6 µm radial surface brightness profiles are consistent with a flared disk. A FUSE FUV spectrum demonstrates the presence of excess light in this system, confirming the accretion rate estimated from Brγ. Collectively, these data strengthen the interpretation of this system as a transitional disk...|$|E
