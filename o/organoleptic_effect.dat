Besides antibacterial properties, essential oils or their components have been shown to exhibit antiviral,antimycotic, antitoxigenic, antiparasitic, and insecticidal properties. In this experiment the effects of supplementation of the diet for laying hens with thyme essential oils on physical and microbiological egg parameters were studied. Hens of laying hybrid Hy-Line Brown (n= 30) were randomly divided into 3 groups (n= 10) and fed for 23 weeks on diets with thyme essential oil supplemented. In the first experimental group the feed mixture was supplemented with thyme essential oil addition in a dose 0. 5 g/kg, in the second one some essential oil in a dose 1 g/kg. The results suggest that all of qualitative parameters of egg internal content (yolk weight (g), yolk index, percentage portion egg yolk (%), yolk index, yolk colour (°HLR), albumen weight (g), percentage portion of albumen (%), Haugh Units (HU), albumen index) were with thyme essential oil addition insignificantly influenced (P> 0. 05). The number of coliforms, enterococci, fungi and yeasts decreased with increasing dose of oil. The number of lactobacilli was zero in all groups...|$|E
40|$|Food {{fortification}} {{programs to}} reduce {{iron deficiency anemia}} require bioavailable forms of iron that do not cause adverse <b>organoleptic</b> <b>effects.</b> Rodent studies show that nano-sized ferric phosphate (NP-FePO 4) is as bioavailable as ferrous sulfate, but there is controversy over the mechanism of absorption. We undertook in vitro studies to examine this using a Caco- 2 cell model and simulated gastrointestinal (GI) digestion. Supernatant iron concentrations increased inversely with pH, and iron uptake into Caco- 2 cells was 2 – 3 fold higher when NP-FePO 4 was digested at pH 1 compared to pH 2. The size and distribution of NP-FePO 4 particles during GI digestion was examined using transmission electron microscopy. The d 50 of the particle distribution was 413 nm. Using disc centrifugal sedimentation, {{a high degree of}} agglomeration in NP-FePO 4 following simulated GI digestion was observed, with only 20 % of the particles ≤ 1000 nm. In Caco- 2 cells, divalent metal transporter- 1 (DMT 1) and endocytosis inhibitors demonstrated that NP-FePO 4 was mainly absorbed via DMT 1. Small particles may be absorbed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis. These findings should be considered when assessing the potential of iron nanoparticles for food fortificatio...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{evaluation}} of phytochemical components, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial effects of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) essential oil (BEO) in vitro. The lipid oxidation of the meat and antibacterial effects of BEO were also evaluated in beef burger product. In this empirical study, essential oil of the basil was isolated by hydrodistillation. Then, BEO was analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The effect of different concentrations of BEO (0. 00, 0. 062, 0. 125, and 0. 25 %) at 4 ± 1 ºC temperature and storage time of up to 12 days was evaluated on lipid oxidation, anti Staphylococcus aureus activity, and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>effects</b> in beef burger. The main compounds in BEO were methyl chavicol (85. 19 %), 1, 8 cineol (3. 96 %), trans-alpha bergamotene (1. 18 %) and linalool (1. 03 %). In the storage temperature (4 ± 1 ºC), the BEO decreased the growth rate of S. aureus in beef burger (P 0. 05). Therefore, this essential oil might be used as antibacterial agent and flavor enhancer in meat products such as beef burger...|$|R
40|$|Several of the {{priority}} pollutants discussed in EPA's Ambient Water Quality Criteria documents {{have been reported}} to have promotion or cocarcinogenic activity. For example, phenol appears to have tumor-promoting activity in mice when repeatedly applied after initiation with either 7, 12 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) or benzo(a) pyrene (BaP). Similarly, {{it has been reported that}} 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a potent promoter of liver tumors as well as a cocarcinogen. However, in developing guidelines to derive ambient water quality criteria, it became apparent that satisfactory approaches had not been developed for using promotion/cocarcinogen data in human health risk estimation, nor were available promotion and/or cocarcinogen data on individual chemicals strong enough to permit a defensible quantitative risk estimation, if such approaches had existed. For this reason, the criteria derived for pollutants with reported promotion/cocarcinogenic activities were based on approaches for carcinogenic (e. g., TCDD), toxic (e. g., fluoranthene) or <b>organoleptic</b> <b>effects</b> (e. g., 2, 4 -dichlorophenol). Nonetheless, with advances in studies on both the biological mechanisms and dose/response patterns of promoters and cocarcinogens, it may be possible to develop a scientifically valid quantitative approach to use this type of data for derivation of ambient water quality criteria or other risk assessments. Some progress toward this goal and the problems associated with this effort are discussed...|$|R

The aim of this study was evaluation of antioxidant activity and antibacterial effects Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) essential oil (TEO) in beef burger product. In this experimental study, essential oil of the Tarragon was isolated by hydrodistillation. Then, TEO was analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The effect of different concentrations of Tarragon essential oil (0. 00, 0. 062, 0. 125, and 0. 25) in 4 ° ± 1 °C temperature and storage time up to 12 days was evaluated on lipid oxidation, anti Staphylococcus aureus activity and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>effects</b> in beef burger. The monoterpenes hydrocarbons constitute the major fraction of the TEO (95. 91) and the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the minor fraction (0. 46). No significant differences were observed after adding of different concentrations of essential oil on lipid oxidation value in raw beef burger (P> 0. 05). The Tarragon essential oil 0. 25 in storage temperature (4 ± 1 °C) decreased growth rate of S. aureus in beef burger (p< 0. 05). Also overall acceptance rate in beef burger containing Tarragon essential oil 0. 125 created a better sense in product (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Essential oils are {{aromatic}} {{and volatile}} liquids extracted from plants. The chemicals in essential oils are secondary metabolites, which {{play an important}} role in plant defence as they often possess antimicrobial properties. The interest in essential oils and their application in food preservation has been amplified in recent years by an increasingly negative consumer perception of synthetic preservatives. Furthermore, food-borne diseases are a growing public health problem worldwide, calling for more effective preservation strategies. The antibacterial properties of essential oils and their constituents have been documented extensively. Pioneering work has also elucidated the mode of action of a few essential oil constituents, but detailed knowledge about most of the compounds' mode of action is still lacking. This knowledge is particularly important to predict their effect on different microorganisms, how they interact with food matrix components, and how they work in combination with other antimicrobial compounds. The main obstacle for using essential oil constituents as food preservatives is that they are most often not potent enough as single components, and they cause negative <b>organoleptic</b> <b>effects</b> when added in sufficient amounts to provide an antimicrobial effect. Exploiting synergies between several compounds has been suggested as a solution to this problem. However, little is known about which interactions lead to synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects. Such knowledge could contribute to design of new and more potent antimicrobial blends, and to understand the interplay between the constituents of crude essential oils. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current knowledge about the antibacterial properties and antibacterial mode of action of essential oils and their constituents, and to identify research avenues that can facilitate implementation of essential oils as natural preservatives in foods...|$|R

40|$|Garlic {{has been}} used {{worldwide}} for centuries for its taste, but also for its health benefits. The therapeutic compounds are mostly organosulfurs, and can be formed when an enzyme, alliinase, gets in contact with its substrate, alliin. Both are separated in an entire cell, and react when the plant is damaged. The product of the enzymatic reaction, allicin, turns quickly into different molecules with potential beneficial effects. The way garlic is processed has {{a major influence on}} the released products. Indeed, an aqueous or oily medium, as far as the temperature, can emphasize the formation of specific compounds. Vinyldithiins are one of the active molecules, and are part of the garlic’s <b>organoleptic</b> properties. Their <b>effects</b> against obesity have been recently proven. This study aims to describe the conditions of vinyldithiins formation, as well as its extraction, purification and analyse. Vinyldithiins are mostly produced when garlic is crushed in edible oil, at low temperature. Extraction conditions (garlic/oil ratio, oil and garlic source, temperature and extraction time) were optimized. Analysis of the results were performed by HPLC. Finally, a purification process was set up. These results allow better knowledges on vinyldithiins formation that can be applied in garlic-based nutraceuticals. They might also lead to new uses of garlic in the production of highly valuable compounds. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown an {{association}} between a high consumption of vegetables and fruits and low incidences of certain chronic diseases. With the increasing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as market globalization, an increase in foodborne illness due to produce is a real possibility {{as a result of}} contamination of foods with pathogenic microorganisms. Minimally processed foods such as fresh, precut vegetables and fruits, both conventional and organic, have limited shelf life and mainly rely on good manufacturing practices (GMP) for preservation and safety. Contaminated raw vegetables, fruits, and fruit juices have all been vehicles for transmission of pathogens. These foods are often consumed raw without the benefit of any pathogen-killing step. In the past few decades, a number of major foodborne disease outbreaks involving up to thousands of cases and many deaths attributable to consumption of fresh, precut, and minimally processed produce have been reported in several countries. The microorganisms present in this produce are the natural microflora (lactic acid bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., yeast and molds) or the bacteria incorporated in these products during their cultivation (irrigation and fertilization), and processing (harvest, postharvest handling, processing, and distribution). Ionizing radiation is a nonthermal technology that has been reported to eliminate foodborne pathogens and extend the shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables. This chapter presents the microbiological, <b>organoleptic,</b> and physicochemical <b>effects</b> of ionizing irradiation, alone or in combination with various other hurdles, on fruits and vegetables. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
