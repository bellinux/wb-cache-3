While he proposed a number of improvements, money was not available in the state budget to implement his plans. In his first full year in office, he cut $11.5 million from the state budget, but it remained <b>out-of-balance.</b> The state issued additional interest-bearing warrants to cover its debts. In 1931, these warrants accounted for 24.2 percent of the state's receipts; by 1932, that number had climbed to 40.2 percent. In order to raise more funds, Laffoon proposed a 2 percent state sales tax in 1932. The proposal was extremely unpopular with merchants and private citizens, and it showed little promise of passing in the General Assembly. On March 2, 1932, a mob of 100 anti-tax protesters stormed the governor's mansion, damaging some items inside. In {{an attempt to get}} the tax passed, Laffoon agreed to seek only a 1 percent tax. The proposal passed the House, but a Senate committee refused to report it to the full chamber for a vote.|$|E

The model is applied to simulate circulation tests using a domestic finite element code. The parameters are calibrated from the thermal outputs of the Fenton Hill and Rosemanowes reservoirs. At variance with a double porosity model with Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE), the Local thermal Non Equilibrium model (LTNE) displays the characteristic two step time profile that is reported for these two reservoirs. In agreement with field data, fluid loss is observed to be high initially and decreases with time. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influences of the internal length scales, namely fracture spacing and crack aperture, in the complete framework of the dual porosity (2 pressures 2 P) and local thermal non equilibrium (3 temperatures 3 T). The fine description of the effective stress, pore and fracture pressures, and solid, pore and fracture temperatures of the most general format (2 P- 3 T) is essentially unchanged when the model is specialized to (2 P- 2 T) with equal pore and solid temperatures. At variance, {{the quality of the}} description is degraded for the (1 P- 2 T) model that omits the permeability contribution of the pores, and for the (1 P- 1 T) standard single porosity LTE model. The progressive transition is quantified during circulation tests at the Fenton Hill HDR...|$|R

The depressed prices caused by this <b>out-of-balance</b> supply and demand dynamic prompted the South African government to fund the formation of the Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika Bpkt (KWV) in 1918. Initially started as a co-operative, the KWV soon grew in power and prominence, setting policies and prices for the entire South African wine industry.

50|$|The {{effect of}} {{vertical}} <b>out-of-balance,</b> or varying wheel {{load on the}} rail, was quantified by Professor Robinson in the U.S. in 1895. He measured bridge deflections, or strains, and attributed a 28% increase over the static value to unbalanced drivers.|$|E
50|$|The crankpin-and-rods {{weight on}} the wheels is in a plane outside the wheel plane {{location}} for the static balance weight. 2-plane, or dynamic, balancing is necessary if the <b>out-of-balance</b> couple at speed needs to be balanced. The second plane used is in the opposite wheel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Out-of-balance</b> inertia {{forces in}} the wheel can cause {{different}} vertical oscillations depending on the track stiffness.

5000|$|It is {{transferred}} to the track by the driving wheels of many steam locomotives. It is an <b>out-of-balance</b> force on the wheel (known as overbalance). It {{is the result of}} a compromise when a locomotive's wheels are unbalanced to off-set horizontal reciprocating masses, such as connecting rods and pistons, to improve the ride. The hammer blow may cause damage to the locomotive and track if the wheel/rail force is high enough. 'Dynamic augment' is the US term for the same force.|$|E
50|$|Qualitative {{assessments}} may {{be done on}} a {{road trip}} {{in terms of the}} riding qualities in the cab. They may not be a reliable indicator of a requirement for better balance as unrelated factors may cause rough riding, such as stuck wedges, fouled equalizers and slack between the engine and tender. Also the position of an <b>out-of-balance</b> axle relative to the locomotive center of gravity may determine the extent of motion at the cab. A. H. Fetters related that on a 4-8-2 the effects of 26,000 lb dynamic augment under the cg did not show up in the cab but the same augment in any other axle would have.|$|E
5000|$|In English full-circle ringing {{there is}} no counter-balancing, so the bell accelerates rapidly to its maximum {{velocity}} when mouth downwards, and slows down as it rises to mouth upwards. In Veronese full-circle ringing {{there is a large}} amount of counter-balancing, so there is little net gravitation pull and the bell accelerates slowly and rotates gracefully. The small <b>out-of-balance</b> weight makes it much easier than English bells to stop the bells mouth upwards. However, English full-circle ringing is capable of much better control of bell speed, as it is independent of the counter-balance effect. The Bolognese style of bell hanging does not have any counter-balancing.|$|E
50|$|The {{center of}} gravity is even more {{critical}} for helicopters {{than it is for}} fixed-wing aircraft (weight issues remain the same). As with fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter may be properly loaded for takeoff, but near {{the end of a long}} flight when the fuel tanks are almost empty, the CG may have shifted enough for the helicopter to be out of balance laterally or longitudinally. For helicopters with a single main rotor, the CG is usually close to the main rotor mast. Improper balance of a helicopter’s load can result in serious control problems. In addition to making a helicopter difficult to control, an <b>out-of-balance</b> loading condition also decreases maneuverability since cyclic control is less effective in the direction opposite to the CG location.|$|E

5000|$|True {{the wheel}} by {{knocking}} abrasive particles from the wheel's surface {{and making the}} wheel concentric. This minimizes vibration and improves surface finish, eliminating the vibration of the <b>out-of-balance</b> wheel across the workpiece's surface. It {{is not unusual for}} grinding wheels to become out of round with use. This is partially from loaded (clogged) areas of the wheel wearing at different rates from less loaded areas. It can also be exacerbated by grinding when the wheel is not under power, such as using the work to apply braking action to the wheel to stop it from coasting. Dressing restores the roundness. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing resolves this problem.|$|E
50|$|An {{isolated}} flutter {{incident was}} reported in 1986 involving violent oscillations of the rudder and tail boom on the T-400 during a delivery flight. Investigations were carried out by ARL and a split mass balance arm was fitted to each rudder. Prior to this the aircraft had relied on frictional damping provided by the lengthy control cables. The modified aircraft was tested both on the ground, and in flight trials in March 1988 over Port Philip near Melbourne, Australia. All attempts to induce the oscillations showed {{that there was no}} indication of a mode of vibration becoming unstable. The maximum speed achieved was 160 knots in a steep dive. Oscillations were induced with an air operated tool fitted with an <b>out-of-balance</b> rotating mass. This device had a rotational speed from 18 Hz down to zero for each charge of the compressed air cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|An {{industrial}} washer can {{be mounted}} on heavy-duty shock absorbers {{and attached to}} a concrete floor, {{so that it can}} extract water from even the most severely <b>out-of-balance</b> and heavy wash loads.

[...] One special type of continuous-processing washer is known as the tunnel washer. This specialized high-capacity machine does not have a drum where everything being washed undergoes distinct wash and rinse cycles, but moves the laundry slowly and continuously through a long, large-diameter horizontal-axis rotating tube in the manner of an assembly line, with different processes at different positions.|$|E
50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an <b>out-of-balance</b> {{which is caused}} by their off-center crank pins and {{attached}} components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the valve gear eccentric crank and the back end of the eccentric rod. In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the side rod weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the center of percussion. This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and side rod weight. The side rod weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|E

50|$|Boeing was in {{the midst}} of {{designing}} the Boeing B-47 Stratojet, and the initial Model 424 was a straight-wing design similar to the B-45, B-46 and B-48 it competed with. A recent design overhaul completed in June produced the Model 432, another four-engine design with the engines buried in the fuselage to reduce drag, and long-span wings that gave it an almost glider-like appearance. By September the Braunschweig data had been worked into the design, which re-emerged as the Model 448, a larger six-engine design with more robust wings swept at about 35 degrees. Another re-work in November moved the engines into strut-mounted pods under the wings since Boeing was concerned that the uncontained failure of an internal engine could potentially destroy the aircraft. With the engines mounted away from the wings on struts equipped with fuse pins, an <b>out-of-balance</b> engine would simply shatter the pins and fall harmlessly away, sparing the aircraft from destructive vibrations. The resulting B-47 design had performance rivaling the fastest fighters and trounced the straight-winged competition. Boeing's winning jet-transport formula of swept wings and engines mounted on pylons under the wings has since been universally adopted.|$|E

The saving of the seriously <b>out-of-balance</b> Avro Pike prototype in 1916, which involved Roy Dobson crawling {{along the top of the}} fuselage to the rear gunner's position, speaks both to Robson's courage and Raynham's flying skills. His good luck and his airmanship were also severely tested whilst flying the little Handley Page Ship's Fighter in 1924. He lost elevator control at 2,000 ft (610 m): feeling around the bottom of the control column, he found that the linkage had become disconnected but that he could, leaning down, just grasp the end of the control rod. With his head down in the cockpit, his other hand on the magneto switch for engine control and the occasional glance outside, he managed to land the aircraft without much damage.|$|E

The propeller of number 1 engine slashed the roof of the cabin before the detached part of the left wing separated from {{the remainder of the}} aircraft. With the roof slashed open, the airstream entered the fuselage and peeled away large segments of the cabin roof. The fuselage disintegrated aft of the propeller slash. Passengers and passenger seats {{from the rear of the}} cabin were ejected into the airstream, some passing through the ball of fire created by fuel from the severed left wing. The tail and rear fuselage aft of the rear cabin door remained intact but broke away from the rest of the fuselage. The investigation was the longest and most detailed of any aircraft accident investigation conducted in Australia. It concluded that the probable cause of the accident was:The means of securing the oil metering unit to the no. 2 cabin blower became ineffective and this led to the initiation of a fire within the blower, which propagated to the wing fuel tank and substantially reduced the strength of the main spar upper boom.

40|$|Abstract There are {{a number}} of {{approaches}} reported in the literature for modelling cracks in shafts. Although two and three dimensional finite element models may be used, the most popular approaches are based on beam models. Of particular concern is the modelling of breathing cracks, which open and close as the rotor spins due to its self-weight. One simple model of a breathing crack assumes the shaft stiffness varies as a cosine function as the crack opens and closes. In large rotating machines the deflection caused by <b>out-of-balance</b> forces is small compared with that due to gravity and also the cracks are, at least initially, small. This paper will consider the influence of these two assumptions on the response of a cracked Jeffcott rotor. The effect of an asymmetric shaft is also considered. 1...|$|E

In this paper, we analyse its behaviour when it is applied to the continuation of a branch with bifurcation points. We show that when the starting point of the continuation is near a bifurcation, the radius of convergence of the power series is exactly the distance from the starting point to the bifurcation. This leads to an accumulation of small steps around the bifurcation point. This phenomenon is related to the presence of inevitable imperfections in the FE models. We also explain that, depending on the maximal tolerated residual error (<b>out-of-balance</b> error), the ANM continuation may continue to follow the fundamental path or it may turn onto the bifurcated path without applying any branch switching technique...|$|E
