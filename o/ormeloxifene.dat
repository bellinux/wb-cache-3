5000|$|<b>Ormeloxifene</b> is a {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). In {{some parts of}} the body, its action is estrogenic (e.g., bones), {{in other parts of the}} body, its action is anti-estrogenic (e.g., uterus, breasts.) It causes an asynchrony in the menstrual cycle between ovulation and the development of the uterine lining, although its exact mode of action is not well defined. In clinical trials, it caused ovulation to occur later than it normally would in some women, but did not affect ovulation in the majority of women, while causing the lining of the uterus to build more slowly. It speeds the transport of any fertilized egg through the fallopian tubes more quickly than is normal. [...] Presumably, this combination of effects creates an environment such that if fertilization occurs, implantation will not be possible.|$|E
50|$|Raloxifene {{originally}} failed as {{a breast}} cancer drug due to its poor performance in comparison to tamoxifen in the laboratory but the estrogenic effects of raloxifene on bone led to its rediscovery and approval in 1997. It was approved for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis {{and was the first}} clinically available SERM to prevent both osteoporosis and breast cancer. Ospemifene was approved on February 26, 2013, for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, which is a symptom, due to menopause, of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Combined therapy with conjugated estrogens and the SERM bazedoxifene, was approved on October 3, 2013, for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms linked with menopause. Bazedoxifene is also used in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The search for a potent SERM with bone efficacy and better bioavailability than raloxifene led to the discovery of lasofoxifene. Although lasofoxifene was approved in 2009, it was not marketed for three years following the approval, so the marketing authorization for it has expired. In Europe, bazedoxifene is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture while in India <b>ormeloxifene</b> has been used for dysfunctional uterine bleeding and birth control.|$|E
40|$|Background: Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB) is {{the most}} common cause of {{abnormal}} uterine bleeding and is a major indication for referral to gynecological clinics. There are very few studies comparing the effect of <b>ormeloxifene</b> and progesterone in DUB. The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of <b>Ormeloxifene</b> in DUB and compare it with Norethisterone. Methods: Hundred women presenting with DUB were randomly allocated to 2 equal groups, Group-A, which received 60 mg <b>ormeloxifene</b> twice a week for 12 weeks followed by 60 mg once a week for next 12 weeks and Group-B, which received 5 mg norethisterone twice daily for 21 days for 6 cycles. The primary outcomes were reduction in menstrual blood loss [measured by fall in PBAC (Pictorial Blood loss Assessment Chart) score and subjective assessment], rise in hemoglobin level and decrease in endometrial thickness. Results: The reduction in mean PBAC score with <b>ormeloxifene</b> (216 to 88) was significantly more than with norethisterone (262 to 162) at 3 months (p< 0. 01). The rise in hemoglobin concentration and fall in endometrial thickness were also significantly more with <b>ormeloxifene</b> than norethisterone (7. 52 g% to 9. 2 g% vs. 7. 48 g% to 8. 4 g%, p< 0. 05, and 12. 12 mm to 9. 46 mm vs. 12. 05 mm to 10. 7 mm, p< 0. 05, respectively). Further improvement at 6 months was much more with <b>ormeloxifene.</b> No major side effects were reported in any group. Conclusions: Both drugs are effective in treating DUB, but <b>ormeloxifene</b> is superior to norethisterone in reducing menstrual blood loss.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the short-term effects of <b>ormeloxifene</b> on systemic hemodynamics, coagulation profile, and serum antioxidant activity in vivo {{in comparison with}} raloxifene. Materials and Methods: Colony-bred adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 19 groups of 10 each and received either <b>ormeloxifene</b> or raloxifene (0. 25, 1. 25, or 3 mg/kg/day) for 7, 15, or 30 days by the oral route. Animals of control group received vehicle (gum-acacia in distilled water) alone in a similar manner. Systemic hemodynamics and serum total antioxidant activity were assessed 24 h after the last treatment. Results: There was no significant effect of <b>ormeloxifene</b> administered at these doses and schedules on hemodynamic parameters or antioxidant activity, except for increase in amplitude of R wave in rats treated with 3 mg/kg/day dose for 30 days. This effect with raloxifene was evident only 7 days after treatment at this dose. Overall response was, however, almost similar with both the agents. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate comparable pharmacological profile of <b>ormeloxifene</b> and raloxifene on short-term administration to rats. Based on changes observed in the ECG (R wave), long-term studies may lead to justifiable comparison of beneficial and harmful effects of <b>ormeloxifene</b> and raloxifene in relation to cardiovascular effects...|$|E
