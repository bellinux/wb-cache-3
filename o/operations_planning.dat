25|$|At {{the moment}} of the Restoration of Portuguese independence, the country's ground forces were reduced to around 2000 ill-equipped men. The OrdenanÃ§as had been {{neglected}} and virtually disappeared. A new military organization had then to be built. By this time, ground forces started to be referred to as the ExÃ©rcito (Army). The high command structure of the new military organization had a Council of War (Conselho de Guerra) as the supreme military body of the country. The Monarch delegated most of his military roles in this council, including the responsibility for military organization, commission of officers, military <b>operations</b> <b>planning,</b> building of fortifications and military justice. The role of Captain-General of the Arms of the Kingdom was created to serve as the commander-in-chief of the Army, at the same time presiding over the Council of War. Under the Captain-General, there was a military territorial organization that included a general officer governor of arms for each of the six provinces (Entre-Douro e Minho, TrÃ¡s-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura, Alentejo and Algarve) and under them, a military governor for each of the 25 comarcas.|$|E

2500|$|In Okinawa, ÅŒta {{commanded}} a force with a nominal strength of 10,000 men. However, half were civilian laborers conscripted into service with minimal training, {{and the remainder}} were gunners from various naval vessels with little experience in fighting on land. Allied sources are contradictory on his role as commander of the naval elements in Okinawa. Some cite ÅŒta as able to organize and lead them into an effective force, which fought aggressively against the Allied forces, [...] "withdrawing slowly back to the fortified Oroku Peninsula." [...] But Naval elements, except for outlying islands were headquartered on the Oroku peninsula {{from the beginning of}} the battle. <b>Operations</b> <b>Planning</b> Colonel Hiromichi Yahara of the Japanese 32nd Army describes a miscommunication occurring in the order for Ota's Naval elements to withdraw from the Oroku Peninsula to support the army further south. What actually happen is clear: ÅŒta began preparations on or around 24 May, for the withdrawal of all Naval elements to the south in support of the Army. He destroyed most heavy equipment, stocks of ammunition and even personal weapons. While in mid-march to the south, 32nd Army HQ ordered ÅŒta back into the Oroku peninsula citing that a mistake had been made in timing (explanations vary). Naval elements returned to their former positions with no heavy weapons and about half the troops had no rifles. The Americans, who had not noticed the initial withdrawal attacked and cut off the peninsula by attacks from the north on land, and one last seaborne landing behind the Navy's positions. [...] Naval elements then committed suicide with whatever weapons possible, with some leading a last charge out of the cave entrances. According to the museum for the underground Naval Headquarters in Okinawa, [...] "many soldiers committed suicide" [...] inside the command bunker, including ÅŒta.|$|E
