40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the direct and}} indirect effects of financial intermediary development on <b>output</b> <b>fluctuations</b> based on the theoretical works by Bacchetta and Caminal (2000) and Beck, Lundberg and Majnoni (2006). According to credit market imperfections, well-developed financial intermediaries dampen the effect of real sector shocks and magnify the effect of monetary shocks on <b>output</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> This paper examines whether financial intermediaries serve as shock absorbers or shock magnifiers that mitigate or amplify the effect of real and monetary shocks on <b>output</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Using data from 8 countries of ASEAN- 5 Plus 3, the empirical results indicate that (1) there is strong and robust evidence for the dampening effect of financial intermediary development on <b>output</b> <b>fluctuations</b> via the propagation of real shocks, (2) there is somewhat weak evidence for the magnifying effect of financial intermediary development via the propagation of monetary shocks and (3) financial intermediary development has strong direct impact on <b>output</b> <b>fluctuations</b> if countries are bankdependent in the cointegration regression.

In this paper, {{we set out to}} bridge the gap between the two approaches by estimating a small scale DSGE model using a loss function based structural Bayesian inference approach.

Analysis of the data reveals a positive correlation between long-term growth rates and the persistence of <b>output</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in ‘high-tech’ sectors. This empirical analysis is further supported by reformulating the model of Matsuyama (1999 b) in a stochastic environment.

The stochastic nature of the long run output trend is endogenous and based on technological shocks.
