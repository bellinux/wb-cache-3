The United States, because of its identification with {{the failure of the}} Alliance for Progress to live up to expectations, is blamed. People in the countries concerned also used <b>our</b> <b>visit</b> as an opportunity to demonstrate their frustrations with the failure of their own governments to meet their needs...demonstrations that began over grievances were taken over and exacerbated by anti-US and subversive elements which sought to weaken the United States, and their own governments in the process.|$|E

At the door were smartly uniformed firemen and policemen. The room itself was still adorned with large fine paintings... The two-star flag of a major general with black streamers hung over the flag-draped coffin which was attended by a military honor guard. Chep loved things military and would have approved of the arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that [...] "they’d cleaned the place up and hired an RN [...] for <b>our</b> <b>visit.</b> We only saw first-trimester procedures." [...] She adding that [...] "Unfortunately, some women don't know where to turn. You sometimes have substandard providers preying on low-income women who don't know {{that they do have}} other (safe) options." [...] A {{spokesperson for}} Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pennsylvania, condemned Gosnell, saying, [...] "We would condemn any physician who does not follow the law or endangers anyone’s health... All women should have access to high-quality care when they are vulnerable and facing difficult decisions." [...] Dayle Steinberg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, says she knew that Gosnell had provided abortions in Philadelphia for many years, but says she hadn't heard of any problems at his clinic until the allegations surfaced. She has been quoted as stating that [...] "when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there. We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health." [...] She clarified that [...] "when Gosnell was arrested, I asked our staff if anyone had ever heard of him, and clinic staff members reported that a few women over the years said they were concerned about the uncleanliness of his facility and came to Planned Parenthood instead... if we had heard anything remotely like the conditions that have since come to light about Gosnell's facility, of course we would have alerted the state and other authorities".|$|E
