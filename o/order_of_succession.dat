50|$|The kings since Ibn Saud's death {{have all}} been his sons, and all likely {{immediate}} successors to the reigning King Salman will be from his progeny. Sons of Ibn Saud are considered to have primary claim on the throne of Saudi Arabia. This makes the Saudi monarchy quite distinct from Western monarchies, which usually feature large, clearly defined royal families and <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> The current Crown Prince is the first grandson of Ibn Saud {{to be in the}} line <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the {{separation}} <b>of</b> the <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> the Dutch and Luxembourgish thrones split in 1890. The Nassau-Weilburg monarchs celebrated their official birthdays on their actual birthdays. In 1947, {{the day was}} declared the 'national holiday'. As both the then-reigning Charlotte and the heir apparent (and regent) Jean were born in January, it was feared that their actual birthdays, therefore the nation's holiday, would be marred by poor weather. Thus, on 23 December 1961, the date was fixed on 23 June by Grand Ducal decree.|$|R
5|$|In {{the event}} of a vacancy in the governor's office, the state {{constitution}} specified that the President of the New Jersey State Senate, the upper chamber of the state legislature, would assume the role of acting governor without relinquishing his or her powerful role in the state senate. Further, if the acting governorship filled by the state senate president were vacated or that person could not assume the office, he or she would be succeeded by the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, the state legislature's lower chamber. This <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> was included in the first state constitution in 1776, reinstated in the subsequent 1844 constitution, and kept in the 1947 Constitution until the 2006 amendment.|$|E
5|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} an {{independent}} grand duchy since 9 June 1815. Originally, Luxembourg was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890. While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands, this was not possible in Luxembourg due to the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> being based on Salic law at that time; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe. In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent {{voted in favor of}} keeping the monarchy. The current monarch is Henri.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, followed in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E
50|$|National Security Presidential Directive 51, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 (NSPD-51/HSPD-20), and the National Continuity Policy, dated May 4, 2007, {{outline the}} {{continuity}} requirements for all Federal departments and agencies, with guidance for non-Federal organizations. These requirements include {{such things as}} essential functions, <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> delegations <b>of</b> authority, continuity of operations, continuity of communications, vital records, and human capital. All of these rules and regulations for a national defense against any possible threat of national attack. HSPD-8 Annex 1 resulted in the Integrated Planning System (IPS) by using the Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 (CPG).|$|R
50|$|Power {{can come}} from force, but formal {{legitimacy}} is often established, even if only by fictitious claims of continuity (e.g., a forged claim of descent from a previous dynasty). There have been cases of sovereignty granted by deliberate act, even when accompanied by <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> (as {{may be the case}} in a dynastic split). Such grants of sovereignty are usually forced, as is common with self-determination granted after nationalist revolts. This occurred with the last Attalid king of Hellenistic Pergamon, who by testament left his realm to Rome to avoid a disastrous conquest.|$|R
50|$|The Deputy President's {{functions}} {{are to be}} the main assistant to the President and shall deputise for the President in the execution of the President's functions.

5|$|The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is {{an elected}} {{constitutional}} {{officer in the}} executive branch of the state government of New Jersey in the United States. The lieutenant governor is the second highest-ranking official in the state government and is elected concurrently on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Because the position itself does not carry any powers or duties other than to be next in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> the state constitution requires that the lieutenant governor be appointed to serve as the head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{overlaid}} the Avatars of {{the fictional}} universe with an elaborate <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> by blood, similar to the ascent of royal families. The descriptors Royals, King and Prince are replaced in the series with Vectori, Prophet and Prince. Female royals like Queens and Princesses {{do not have a}} fictional counterpart and are instead replaced with the concepts of the Alpha, the Omega and the Usher. These Wild Card Avatars have special rules in addition to, or replacing, the normal ones. Reviewers rarely focused on the significance of the mentioned Avataric terms and their implied characteristics in the story, despite detailed explanations by Knauf and the later public availability of Carnivàles Pitch Document, setting out the complex mythological structure.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mayor}} dies in office, resigns, or {{is unable to}} carry out his/her duties and he/she did not {{designate}} an acting mayor, {{the president of the}} Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board select a person to fill the vacancy and finish the previous mayoral term. (In the case that both the president of the Board of Supervisors and the mayor are incapacitated, the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> is followed.) This has happened six times: James Otis died in office and was succeeded by George Hewston, Eugene Schmitz was removed and succeeded by Charles Boxton, Charles Boxton resigned and was succeeded by Edward Robeson Taylor, James Rolph resigned and was succeeded by Angelo Rossi, George Moscone was assassinated and was succeeded by Dianne Feinstein, and Gavin Newsom resigned and was succeeded by Ed Lee.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{temporary}} incapacity or absence from the country, the title of Acting President (Presidente en ejercicio) is transferred to lower officials according to the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> presidential <b>succession.</b> In September 2012, Senate President Gabriela Montaño {{became the first woman}} to assume this office since the presidency of Lidia Gueiler Tejada.|$|R

5|$|The {{events of}} the Darien Scheme, and the passing by the English Parliament of the Act of Settlement 1701 asserting {{the right to choose}} the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> for English, Scottish and Irish thrones, {{escalated}} political hostilities between England and Scotland, and neutralised calls for a united British people. The Parliament of Scotland responded by passing the Act of Security 1704, allowing it to appoint a different monarch to succeed to the Scottish crown from that of England, if it so wished. The English political perspective was that the appointment of a Jacobite monarchy in Scotland opened up the possibility of a Franco-Scottish military conquest of England during the Second Hundred Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession. The Parliament of England passed the Alien Act 1705, which provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property, whilst also restricting the import of Scottish products into England and its colonies (about half of Scotland's trade). However, the Act contained a provision that it would be suspended if the Parliament of Scotland entered into negotiations regarding the creation of a unified Parliament of Great Britain, which in turn would refund Scottish financial losses on the Darien Scheme.|$|E
5|$|While {{the church}} in Norway {{initially}} had refused to recognise Haakon as King of Norway, it had largely turned to support his claim to the throne by the 1223 meeting, although later disagreements occurred. Despite additionally having become the undisputed ruler of Norway after 1240, Haakon had still not been approved as king by the Pope due to his illegitimate birth. He nonetheless had a strong personal desire to be approved fully as a European king. Several papal commissions were appointed to investigate the matter, and Haakon declared his legitimate son Haakon the Young his successor instead of an older living illegitimate son. Although Haakon had children with his mistress Kanga the Young prior to his marriage with Margrete, it was his children with Margrete that was designated as his successors in accordance with a papal recognition. The Catholic principle of legitimacy was thus established in the Norwegian <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> although Haakon's new law still maintained that illegitimate children could be designated as successor {{in the absence of}} any legitimate children or grandchildren—contrary to Catholic principles. While his strong position allowed him to set boundaries to the church's political influence, he was on the other hand prepared to give the church much autonomy in internal affairs and relations with the rural society.|$|E
5|$|In 1710, Andriamasinavalona {{divided the}} Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants, which {{were given to}} his four {{favorite}} sons to rule. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana received the eastern quadrant, Avaradrano, and transformed his rova at Ambohimanga into its capital. As the first king of Avaradrano (1710–1730), Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana also built the site's defensive walls and its first set of seven gates. Rather than rule their respective territories peacefully as Andriamasinavalona had intended, his four sons {{began a series of}} wars to seize control of neighboring territory, causing famine and suffering among the peasant population of Imerina. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana spent much of his reign strengthening the authority of his governance at Ambohimanga and attracting residents to settle in the surrounding villages while battling his brothers to increase the land under his control. He was succeeded by his adopted son, Andriambelomasina (1730–1770), who continued to rule Avaradrano from Ambohimanga in the Mahandrihono compound he built beside the original compound of Besakana. Andriambelomasina significantly expanded Ambohimanga and strengthened its defenses, enabling him to successfully repel an attack against the rova by a band of Sakalava warriors employed by his chief rival, the ruler of Antananarivo. He named as his successor his eldest son, Andrianjafy (1770–1787), and designated his grandson Andrianampoinimerina to follow Andrianjafy in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> Andrianjafy, a weak and unjust ruler, maintained his capital at Ambohimanga where he built a new private compound called Nanjakana, but often resided in the nearby village of Ilafy.|$|E

60|$|Of all truths {{relating}} to phenomena, {{the most valuable}} to us are those which relate to the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> their <b>succession.</b> On a knowledge of these is founded every reasonable anticipation of future facts, and whatever power we possess of influencing those facts to our advantage. Even the laws of geometry are chiefly of practical importance to us as being {{a portion of the}} premises from which the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the <b>succession</b> <b>of</b> phenomena may be inferred. Inasmuch as the motion of bodies, the action of forces, and the propagation of influences of all sorts, take place in certain lines and over definite spaces, the properties of those lines and spaces {{are an important part of}} the laws to which those phenomena are themselves subject. Again, motions, forces, or other influences, and times, are numerable quantities; and the properties of number are applicable to them as to all other things. But though the laws of number and space are important elements in the ascertainment <b>of</b> uniformities <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> they can do nothing toward it when taken by themselves. They can only be made instrumental to that purpose when we combine with them additional premises, expressive <b>of</b> uniformities <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> already known. By taking, for instance, as premises these propositions, that bodies acted upon by an instantaneous force move with uniform velocity in straight lines; that bodies acted upon by a continuous force move with accelerated velocity in straight lines; and that bodies acted upon by two forces in different directions move in the diagonal of a parallelogram, whose sides represent the direction and quantity of those forces; we may by combining these truths with propositions {{relating to}} the properties of straight lines and of parallelograms (as that a triangle is half a parallelogram of the same base and altitude), deduce another important uniformity <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> viz., that a body moving round a centre of force describes areas proportional to the times. But unless there had been laws <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> in our premises, there could have been no truths <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> in our conclusions. A similar remark might be extended to every other class of phenomena really peculiar; and, had it been attended to, would have prevented many chimerical attempts at demonstrations of the indemonstrable, and explanations which do not explain.|$|R
60|$|It is certain, then, that {{a part of}} our {{notion of}} a body {{consists}} of the notion of a number of sensations of our own, or of other sentient beings, habitually occurring simultaneously.

All or most of these various sensations frequently are, and, as we learn by experience, always might be, experienced simultaneously, or in many different <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> at our own choice: and hence the thought of any one of them makes us think of the others, and the whole becomes mentally amalgamated into one mixed state of consciousness, which, {{in the language of the}} school of Locke and Hartley, is termed a Complex Idea.|$|R
