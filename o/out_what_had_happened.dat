5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> The {{official}} proceeding {{lasted for}} 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned {{as well as}} inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so {{did not know what}} they were talking about.|$|E
5|$|As Chief of the Intelligence Division, Matsui was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Chiang Kai-shek, who was attempting to end the civil war in China and unify the country under his leadership. Matsui hoped that Chiang would succeed and form a strong partnership with Japan to resist both Western influence in Asia and communism. However, Matsui's tenure in office was punctuated by a series of crises. Against Matsui's advice the Japanese government sent troops to the Chinese city of Jinan in 1928 to protect Japanese property and civilians, but they ended up clashing with the Chinese Army. Matsui headed to Jinan to help settle the affair, but while he was still there Japanese army officers assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the warlord leader of Manchuria. Matsui, who had been a supporter of Zhang, immediately left for Manchuria to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> He demanded that the officers responsible for the assassination be punished.|$|E

5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed {{his hand over his}} heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to the}} bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E
25|$|Acts of savagery on Kidd's part were {{reported}} by escaped prisoners, who told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and drubbed with a drawn cutlass. On one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship Mary and tortured several of its crew members while Kidd and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in Kidd's cabin. When Kidd found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} altercation, one officer, Phillip Cardillo, {{was shot at}} close range with his own gun. Another officer's gun was missing, never to be recovered. Police {{reinforcements}} arrived, as did the news media, and word spread throughout the neighborhood {{that the police had}} committed some outrage in the mosque that they were trying to cover up. An angry and restless crowd had gathered as the police secured the inside of the mosque and tried to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Two men were arrested and the other worshippers were in custody.

25|$|After the blasts, {{bystanders}} {{rushed to}} help the wounded, and emergency response personnel were on the scene within minutes. Hospitals across Dublin were put on standby to receive casualties. However, rescue operations in Dublin were hampered by heavy traffic due to the bus strike. Rescuers, feeling that help was not coming fast enough, lifted the dead and wounded, wrapped them in coats and bundled them into cars {{to get them to}} the nearest hospital. Garda Síochána squad cars escorted surgeons through the crowded streets to attend the wounded. Many people, on finding <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> went straight away to offer blood.|$|E
25|$|Mulder's {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} uncover what he {{believed to be a}} government conspiracy to hide the truth about alien life, and to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to his sister. His quest and belief in the existence of aliens was, for most of the series, the driving force of the plot, or mytharc. However, during a period of time after Scully's cancer went into remission (season 5), Mulder was convinced by Michael Kritschgau that aliens did not in fact exist, and that the government conspirators had merely concocted that threat as a smokescreen, to justify military activities and toy with him.|$|E

Cobra Commander abandoned his wife, taking Billy with him. Living on the road and earning a living by increasingly illicit scams and con jobs, the soon-to-be Commander blamed all his problems on the American social system, and traveled in search of people who shared his desire to topple big business and the government, using money earned from pyramid schemes to attract followers.

25|$|In 1885, Lawrence became pregnant. She {{went to live}} {{in rooms}} in Dublin which Chapman got for her, and in December 1885 a son was born and christened Montagu Robert. Chapman stayed with his wife, while seeing Lawrence and his son, until Edith Chapman found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> (the Chapmans' butler, while in a Dublin grocer's shop, heard a young woman give her name as Mrs Thomas Chapman – he {{recognised}} the woman as Sarah Lawrence).

He took her to live at Tremadog, Caernarfonshire, now Gwynedd, North Wales, and their second illegitimate son, christened Thomas Edward and later known as Lawrence of Arabia, was born there in August 1888.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon's defeat {{was also}} {{somewhat}} mirrored by Hitler's failed invasion of Russia during World War II in 1941. Although, ironically, Hitler had studied Napoleon's battle tactics, he decided, against {{the advice of}} many of his top advisers, to invade Russia and break his pact with Stalin. He knew the invasion would have only one chance and if he failed, he would be fighting a war on two fronts (the Western Front consisting of the Western Allies and the Eastern Front which would consist of the Soviet Union) which also proved fatal in Napoleon's situation. In 1812, Napoleon had been campaigning in Spain as well as Russia and had failed in both. In 1941, Hitler had to split his army in order to conquer Russia and in doing so, perhaps lost the war solely on that point. After Stalin found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> he orchestrated the Battle of Moscow which, along with the notoriously cold Russian winter, stopped the German troops and finally pushed them back. Hitler would now be fighting on two fronts.|$|E

The gendarmes on duty claimed that this was but a military exercise. However, during the [...] "exercise" [...] the lieutenants dragged President M'ba from his bed at gunpoint. Bongo heard this noise and telephoned President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Bigmann arrived at the presidential palace and asked the rebels what Bongo had asked him. At this point they opened the gates and arrested him too. The plotters subsequently arrested {{every member of the}} Gabonese cabinet except the respected technician André Gustave Anguilé. Apparently, the plotters let him roam free in the hopes of him joining them, although before noon he asked to be arrested. Joseph N'Goua, the Gabonese minister of foreign affairs, was able to tell the French Embassy of this before he was arrested.|$|E
500|$|The republican Government {{feared that}} demonstrations {{in favor of}} the Emperor might erupt on Monday 17 November. The Lieutenant Colonel João Nepomuceno de Medeiros Mallet was sent at dawn to inform the Imperial Family that it must leave immediately. A commotion arose among those present until Pedro II himself {{appeared}} in the room. Mallet respectfully told him that the Government had asked them to depart at once. The Emperor refused to leave immediately, claiming that he was not a slave trying to escape {{in the middle of the}} night. Mallet tried to persuade him, alleging that republican students would launch violent demonstrations against him. The Emperor seemed skeptical: [...] "Who gives credence to students?" [...] At that moment, shots were heard outside. Mallet left the palace to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Fifteen Imperial sailors had attempted to land in support of the Emperor but were overpowered and imprisoned by republican troops. Mallet returned to the building and deceived Pedro II by saying that militant republicans had tried to attack him and his family. Astonished, the Emperor agreed to leave.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of this infiltration, a white officer and 35–40 African-American {{soldiers}} left their position south of Haman at a roadblock and fled to the rear until they reached Check's 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, command post [...] away. There, at 05:00 this officer said 2,000 North Koreans had overrun his position and others near Haman, including the 24th Regiment command post. Check reported this story to Kean, and then sent a platoon of tanks with a platoon of infantry toward Haman to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Some of his officers, meanwhile, had stopped about 220 soldiers streaming to the rear. Check ordered these men to follow his tank and infantry patrol back into Haman. Some of them did so only when threatened with being shot. The tank-led column entered Haman unopposed, where they found the 24th Regiment command post intact and everything quiet. The next day, September 6, a sniper severely wounded Champney while he was inspecting his front-line positions west of Haman. Champney was evacuated immediately. The commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, Corley, succeeded to the command of the regiment.|$|E

He had diligently prepared himself for the introduction to Manning by reading her works, and felt that her book The Wind Changes showed [...] "signs of genius". He described Manning as a jolie laide, possessing lovely hair, hands, eyes and skin though an overlong nose, {{and fell in love}} at first sight. When he borrowed a half-crown from her on their first meeting, and repaid it the next day, he knew they would marry. Manning was less certain of the relationship, but Reggie quickly moved into her flat, proposing in bed a few weeks later. They were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 18August 1939, with Stevie Smith and Louis MacNeice as witnesses. The bridegroom, unconventionally and true to form, did not produce a ring for the ceremony. A few days after the wedding, the couple received word that Reggie had been recalled to Bucharest.
