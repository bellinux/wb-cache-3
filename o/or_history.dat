5|$|Fewer than 3% {{of people}} live more than {{fourteen}} years. Disease features {{significantly associated with}} reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as heart problems, diabetes <b>or</b> <b>history</b> of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival. While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced {{when compared to the}} healthy population among those who are younger. Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail <b>or</b> <b>history</b> of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E

5|$|Official state {{horses are}} one of many state symbols officially {{designated}} by states. Each state has its own flag and state seal, and many states also designate other symbols, including animals, plants, and foods.

5|$|Ælfric {{was the son}} of an earl of Kent {{and became}} a monk of Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He was very likely Abbot of Abingdon before {{becoming}} Abbot of St Albans Abbey around 975, although some historians do not believe that he held the office of Abbot at Abingdon. Although the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, <b>or</b> <b>History</b> of the Church of Abingdon, names Ælfric as abbot, the abbatial lists do not record him as such. Indirect corroboration of his being abbot at Abingdon is a grant of land to Ælfric personally (instead of to the office he held) while he was archbishop that had previously been unjustly taken from Abingdon. This land was to revert to Abingdon after Ælfric's death.|$|E
