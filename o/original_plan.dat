5|$|Although {{similar in}} size the bridge towers are not {{identical}} in design, the Clifton tower having side cut-outs whilst the Leigh tower has more pointed arches and chamfered edges. Brunel's <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> proposed they be topped with then-fashionable sphinxes, but the ornaments were never constructed.|$|E
5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} a new plan for the freight and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority {{refused to accept the}} plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the <b>original</b> <b>plan.</b> The <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> would have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E
5|$|In a {{surprise}} announcement in London on 8 September the South African Minister of Sport and Recreation Fikile Mbalula said that Paralympic medal winners and their coaches would {{receive the same}} performance bonuses that their Olympic counterparts were promised. The amounts initially promised were significantly lower. The minister said the <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> was discriminatory.|$|E

Scott Steiner received an unspecified injury at Sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the female}} {{claim to the}} {{principal}} rooms of the corps de logis, the library and dining room were relocated to a secondary wing not built until much later. This secondary wing {{is linked to the}} west of corps de logis by a large arcaded loggia; originally open, it is now glazed and known as the Winter Garden. A later secondary wing, known as the Shuvalov wing (named after Vorontsov's son-in-law, Count Shuvalov) was not part of Blore's <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> and designed by his assistant, William Hunt.|$|E

5|$|In the 1994 Peace Agreement between Israel and Jordan it {{was decided}} that {{operations}} were supposed to be transferred from Eilat Airport to Aqaba Airport. The <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> was to rename Aqaba Airport as Aqaba-Eilat Peace International Airport. The agreement was never followed, however, and an agreement between the two countries in March 1997, stipulated that domestic flights would continue to use Eilat Airport, whilst no further action to move international flights took place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2006, Shelbourne Development issued two {{separate}} press releases regarding the construction and design of the spire. A November 2006 press release stated that construction of the Chicago Spire would begin in June 2007. In early December 2006, Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that {{the design of the}} building had been revised. This included the removal of the hotel and the antenna mast, making the building consist solely of condominium units. The design change altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building, which was also wider than the <b>original</b> <b>plan.</b> Additionally, the spire no longer tapered at the top, resulting in an increase in floor space and overall floor count. The revision also removed the separate parking structure from the <b>original</b> <b>plan,</b> instead incorporating underground parking into the spire itself. This first major redesign of the Chicago Spire was criticized by architectural critics and city officials.|$|E

5|$|McFetridge Drive is the {{boundary}} between Grant Park and Burnham Park. Beginning with Northerly Island and the 14th Street Beach, and enclosing Burnham Harbor and its public marina, the park runs in a narrow strip past Soldier Field and McCormick Place, both of which disrupt Burnham's <b>original</b> <b>plan,</b> south to 56th street. The park, from North to South, runs through the communities of Near South, Douglas, Oakland, Kenwood and Hyde Park.|$|E
5|$|Meeker's first {{employment}} in the Pacific Northwest was unloading a ship that had docked at Portland. He moved to {{the nearby town of}} St. Helens, where construction of a wharf in competition with Portland's was under way—Oliver rented a house to lodge workers in, and Ezra went to help his brother. By this time, Ezra Meeker and his wife were determined to fulfill their <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> to farm, and when work was abandoned on the wharf, he went to find land which could be cultivated.|$|E
5|$|NASA's <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> for safely de-orbiting Hubble was to {{retrieve}} it using a space shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. This {{is no longer possible}} since the space shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{had already}} experimented with filming outside {{the context of}} a {{standard}} rock concert, including an hour-long performance in KQED TV studios in April 1970. Adrian Maben had become interested in combining art with Pink Floyd's music, and during 1971, he attempted to contact the band's manager, Steve O'Rourke, to discuss the possibilities of making a film to achieve this aim. After his <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> of mixing the band with assorted paintings had been rejected, Maben went on holiday to Naples in the early summer.|$|E
5|$|The Institute of Directors {{was founded}} in 1903 and {{received}} a royal charter in 1906. The former branch of the Midland Bank at Nos.69–70 Pall Mall was designed by Edwin Lutyens and constructed between 1922 and 1927. The <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> to redevelop No.70 proved impractical so the two premises were demolished to provide a site for the current premises. The cigarette manufacturer Rothmans have their head office at No65 Pall Mall, in a building designed by Norman Shaw, while P Ferries' main administrative office is at No79.|$|E
5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{began as}} a highway {{proposed}} in the Metropolitan Region Scheme in the mid-1950s. The <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> took the route, then known as Yanchep Highway, inland from what {{is now known as}} Karrinyup Road to the intersection of Wanneroo Road and Balcatta Road. However, the first gazetted edition of the Metropolitan Region Scheme, from 1963, shows a controlled-access highway along the current freeway alignment. The later plan only detailed the route up until a point east of Sorrento, at a proposed east-west controlled-access highway on the modern day Hepburn Avenue alignment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of a simple optimisation method for improving target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for cervical oesophageal cancer. Methods For 20 selected patients, clinically acceptable <b>original</b> IMRT <b>plans</b> (<b>Original</b> <b>plans)</b> were cre-ated, and two optimisation methods were adopted to improve the plans: 1) a base dose function (BDF) -based method, in which the treatment plans were re-optimised based on the <b>original</b> <b>plans,</b> and 2) a dose-controlling structure (DCS) -based method, in which the <b>original</b> <b>plans</b> were re-optimised by assigning additional constraints for hot and cold spots. The Orig-inal, BDF-based and DCS-based plans were compared with regard to target dose homoge-neity, conformity, OAR sparing, planning time and monitor units (MUs). Dosimetric verifications were performed and delivery times were recorded for the BDF-based and DCS-based plans...|$|R
5|$|The New England Quarter is a mixed-use {{development}} {{in the city of}} Brighton and Hove, England. It was built between 2004 and 2008 on the largest brownfield site in the city, adjacent to Brighton railway station. Most parts of the scheme have been finished, but other sections are still being built and one major aspect of the <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> was refused planning permission.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
