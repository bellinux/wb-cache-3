5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognizable}} symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms {{may be present}} at the time <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|At least 50% {{of people}} with {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma have diabetes at the time <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E
5|$|Prognostic {{factors in}} NSCLC include {{presence}} of pulmonary symptoms, large tumor size (>3cm), nonsquamous cell type (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. For people with inoperable disease, outcomes are worse {{in those with}} poor performance status and weight loss of more than 10%. Prognostic factors in small cell lung cancer include performance status, gender, stage of disease, and involvement of {{the central nervous system}} or liver at the time <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E

5|$|The annual {{incidence}} is about 1.1 per 100,000 annually in population studies from the United States and France. From 1994 to 2003, the incidence increased threefold; {{this has been}} attributed to the more widespread use of modern imaging modalities rather than a true increase. Similarly, those living in urban areas are more likely to receive appropriate investigations, accounting for increased rates <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> in those dwelling in cities. It is suspected that a proportion of cases in people with mild symptoms remains undiagnosed.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{study to}} date {{followed}} {{over a thousand}} people for eight years; it showed an 87% increased risk of death compared to the normal population. Predictors of higher risk were: female sex, absence of treatment for sex hormone deficiency, younger age at the time <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> and a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Apart from cardiovascular disease, this study also showed {{an increased risk of}} death from lung disease.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{laboratory}} test for serotonin syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is by symptom observation and {{investigation of the}} patient's history. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The first rigorously evaluated criteria were introduced in 1991 by Harvey Sternbach, a {{professor of psychiatry at}} UCLA. Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better sensitivity and specificity, 84% and 97%, respectively, when compared with the gold standard <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> by a medical toxicologist. As of 2007, Sternbach's criteria were still the most commonly used.|$|E

40|$|Delayed <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> {{anorectal}} malformation (ARM) is an avoidable event {{associated with}} significant complications and morbidity. Previous {{studies have suggested}} higher than expected rates <b>of</b> delayed <b>diagnosis,</b> especially when a threshold of 24 hours of life is used to define delayed <b>diagnosis.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} highlight the prevalence <b>of</b> delayed <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> ARM in Ireland and to determine if any improvement in rates <b>of</b> delayed <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> ARM has occurred since we previously examined this problem over a 10 year period in 2010. We compared trends in the incidence <b>of</b> delayed <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> ARM between two cohorts, A (1999 - 2009) and B (2010 - 2012). Delayed diagnosis was defined as one occurring after 48 hours <b>of</b> life. Delayed <b>diagnosis</b> occurred in 29 cases (21. 3 %) in total, with no difference in the incidence <b>of</b> delayed <b>diagnosis</b> between cohort A (21 patients [21. 2 %]) and cohort B (8 patients [21. 6 %]) being recorded. The rate of bowel perforation in patients with delayed diagnosis was 10. 3 % (3 cases). Our findings highlight the importance of a careful, comprehensive clinical examination in diagnosing ARM and suggest this is still sub-optimal. We strongly support the use of a nationally devised algorithm to aid <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> ARM in order to avoid life-threatening complications...|$|R
30|$|Because of this {{difficulty}} in ultrasonographic diagnosis, when no products of conception are found intra-operatively at termination <b>of</b> pregnancy the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> OEP {{should always be}} on the list <b>of</b> possible <b>diagnosis,</b> and every effort {{should be taken to}} exclude the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> ovarian and other ectopic pregnancies, as in our reported cases.|$|R
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including the amount <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> patients require. This {{can be set}} to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all people}} with lung {{cancer in the}} US, 16.8% survive {{for at least five}} years after diagnosis. In England and Wales, between 2010 and 2011, overall five-year {{survival}} for lung cancer was estimated at 9.5%. Outcomes are generally worse in the developing world. Stage is often advanced at the time <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> At presentation, 30–40% of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are stage IV. Survival for lung cancer falls as the stage at diagnosis becomes more advanced: the English data suggest that around 70% of patients survive at least a year when diagnosed at the earliest stage, but this falls to just 14% for those diagnosed with the most advanced disease.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E
