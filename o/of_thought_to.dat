40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on desire to smoke. However, previous research has examined suppression <b>of</b> general smoking <b>thoughts</b> rather than <b>thoughts</b> specifically related <b>to</b> desire to smoke. The present study investigated whether suppression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire <b>to</b> smoke results in subsequently elevated ratings of desire to smoke. An experimental study examined the effects <b>of</b> suppressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire <b>to</b> smoke, versus expressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire <b>to</b> smoke, versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of desire to smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects <b>of</b> suppressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire <b>to</b> smoke on subsequent reports <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire <b>to</b> smoke were examined. Suppressing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire <b>to</b> smoke caused <b>thought</b> rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire <b>to</b> smoke). However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of desire to smoke. Suppressing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire <b>to</b> smoke does not elevate subsequent ratings of this desire. Increased cigarette consumption following suppression <b>of</b> smoking <b>thoughts</b> may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased desire to smoke...|$|R
25|$|In his {{philosophical}} work, Grayling connected {{solutions to}} the problem of scepticism in epistemology with the questions about assertibility and the problem of meaning in the philosophy of language and logic. A principal theme in his work is that considerations of metaphysics, which relate to what exists, has to be kept separate from the two connected questions of the relation <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> its objects in the variety of domains over which thought ranges, and the mastery of discourses about those domains, where a justificationist approach is required.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Taymiyyah censured the {{scholars}} for blindly conforming to the precedence of early jurists without any {{resort to the}} Qur'an and Sunnah. He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset {{in light of the}} Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in Islamic Law. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of Taqlid (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school <b>of</b> <b>thought)</b> <b>to</b> the practice of Jews and Christians who took their rabbis and ecclesiastics as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources. The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.|$|E
25|$|He says {{religion}} has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion {{is opposed to}} any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge. Hedgel is indifferent to what the Bible says. He writes in his Philosophy of Religion If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies itself with religion, this cannot really surprise us {{when we consider the}} general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take to do with the knowledge of God, and by the aid <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> comprehend His nature, must be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E

25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>to</b> the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism {{originated}} on the Indian subcontinent. It {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} the world's oldest extant religion. Hinduism contains a vast body of scripture, divided as revealed and remembered, expounding on dharma, or religious living. Hindus consider the Vedas and the Upanishads as being among the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. The , a treatise excerpted from the , is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the Vedas. It is difficult to identify any universal belief or practice in Hinduism, although prominent themes include: Dharma, Samsara, Karma, and Moksha. Hinduism is sometimes called a polytheistic religion, but this is an oversimplification. Hinduism includes a diverse collection of schools whose beliefs span monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, monism and even atheism. For instance, the Advaita Vedanta school holds {{that there is only one}} causal entity (Brahman), which manifests itself into all the various living and non-living forms that we observe, whereas traditions such as Vaishnavism and Shaivism worship Vishnu and Shiva in a relatively more monotheistic sense (caused by a differentiation between the parabrahman and atman). A number of scholars even consider the Samkhya school <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have atheistic leanings.Weightman (1997). Pg 263.|$|E
500|$|This {{was seen}} as an {{excellent}} result by Murray, who had no interest in politics except as a stepping stone to {{become a member of the}} judiciary. Murray was not suited to politics, as he was far too calculating and independent <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> accept any one party's doctrine. His Scottish and Jacobite roots also allowed for endless insinuation and controversyin 1753 he was accused by the Bishop of Gloucester of [...] "having drunk the health of the Old Pretender on his knees". Although the story was proven to be false, it embarrassed Murray, and was used to taunt him as late as 1770. His rivalry with William Pitt highlighted his unsuitability for politics - unlike other politicians such as Philip Yorke and Edward Thurlow, he did not have the temperament to resist [...] "the vehemence of Pitt's invective". It was widely felt that he could have become Prime Minister after the death of Henry Pelham, but it would have [...] "set [...] in a false environment", and he declined all opportunities to return to politics except as Lord Chief Justice.|$|E

500|$|Poulenc's {{major works}} for choir and {{orchestra}} are the Stabat Mater (1950), the Gloria (1959–60), and Sept répons des ténèbres (Seven responsories for Tenebrae, 1961–62). All {{these works are}} based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the Gloria, Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, [...] "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have three good religious works. May they spare me {{a few days in}} Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell." [...] Sept répons des ténèbres, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>To</b> the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own requiem and is [...] "the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his magnum opus sacrum, the opera, Dialogues des Carmélites." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Deconstruction and {{breakthrough}} in Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna" [...] is an essay by Glen T. Martin. Martin compares {{the philosophy of}} Nietzsche to the philosophy of Nāgārjuna, aiming to illuminate the relationship between their respective attempts to develop [...] "spiritual break-throughs", by considering each thinker in turn. First he looks at Nietzsche's distinct rejection of traditional values, and, subsequently, considers Nietzsche's answer to the problem. Second, Martin looks to Nāgārjuna, tracing his line <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> the [...] "emptiness" [...] and [...] "ultimate truth", and then to his conception of [...] "liberation".

At about the same time that Bowlby was applying Craik's ideas to the study of attachment, other psychologists were using these concepts in discussion of adult perception and cognition.|$|E
