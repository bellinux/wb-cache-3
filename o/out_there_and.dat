5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm going to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made {{that is going to be}} my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut against the Boston Red Sox on Opening Day on April 3, 2006, {{and got his}} first major league hit in his first major league at bat, off Curt Schilling. Kinsler said: The crowd was full; I had the {{butterflies}} going, so to get that hit was huge. The family was in town.... To go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> face {{one of the best}} pitchers of all time, you've got to be locked in. It's your first game, your first big league experience—it was unbelievable to face that guy.|$|E
5|$|Information {{gathered}} in Rennes, Paris, and Eindhoven pointed to Strasbourg {{as a place}} of particular interest. Physicists Rudolf Fleischmann and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were known to be working at the University of Strasbourg, as was Eugen von Haagen, an expert on viruses whose work was of great concern to the Alsos Mission's Biological Warfare section. The Naval section was interested in the torpedo research being carried <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> jet engine development was being undertaken at Strasbourg's Junkers plant.|$|E

5|$|Authorized to be {{built by}} Ansaldo of Genoa, the new battleship's keel was laid down on 14 May 1938 and {{launched}} on 15 November 1939. At her launching, she was christened Impero, after Italy's empire in Africa. With Genoa being in bombing range of France, and war now a definite possibility, Impero was moved to Brindisi on 8 June 1940 due to fears of French attack. Trieste was considered a better location, but Roma was fitting <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> the shipyard could not handle two battleships at one time. While at Brindisi, some of her machinery was installed, along with parts of her smaller caliber weaponry. Despite the intent to move Impero to a safer location, Brindisi was still hit by Allied bombers, though Impero was not damaged. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to shift production priorities to desperately needed escorts for merchant convoys. As a result, construction of Impero was delayed to expedite those ships. The only work done was the fitting of the engines and some gun mountings.|$|E
5|$|In February 1941, Roosevelt sent Conant to Britain {{as head of}} {{a mission}} that also {{included}} Frederick L. Hovde from Purdue University and Carroll L. Wilson from MIT, to evaluate the research being carried <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> the prospects for cooperation. The 1940 Tizard Mission had revealed that American technology was some years behind that of Britain in many fields, most notably radar, and cooperation was eagerly sought. Conant had lunch with Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Frederick Lindemann, his leading scientific adviser, and an audience with King George VI at Buckingham Palace. At a subsequent meeting, Lindemann told Conant about British progress towards developing an atomic bomb. What most impressed Conant was the British conviction that it was feasible. That the British program was ahead of the American one raised the possibility in Conant's mind that the German nuclear energy project might be even further ahead, as Germany was generally acknowledged to be a world leader in nuclear physics. Later that year, Churchill, as Chancellor of the University of Bristol, conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Conant in absentia.|$|E

Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E

Calzaghe said in reply that he could only beat whoever was <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> prepared to fight him.

After much searching, it turns out Narmeleth, Laerdan's daughter, who originally caused Amarthiel's fall in Fornost, has become possessed by her. But all searching seems in vain, when it is revealed Amarthiel has already found Narchuil. However, Elrond does not fall for her trickery again; he realizes Narchuil is still <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> Laerdan knows where.|$|E
25|$|The vicereine again won plaudits, {{though not}} universal, {{from the media}} and public for her actions {{following}} the earthquake that devastated her native Haiti on January 12, 2010, in which she lost her friend Magalie Marcelin, godmother to Jean's daughter. The Governor General, with her prime minister, Stephen Harper, attended an emergency meeting at the Department of Foreign Affairs and then made a tearful speech, with parts in Haitian Creole, thanking the Cabinet for its swift action and the Canadian media for its coverage, as well as urging strength and courage to Haitians. She later attended a vigil in Montreal and, on January 25, 2010, met at Rideau Hall with Haitian prime minister Jean-Max Bellerive. After officially opening the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, on February 12, and the Winter Paralympics a month later, the Governor General made a visit to Haiti, from March 8–10, 2010, to observe the devastation and Canadian assistance being meted <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> to meet with President Préval.|$|E

25|$|More {{than just}} the band's image was changing, however. In 1988, Pantera {{released}} its first album with Anselmo, titled Power Metal. Power Metal, like Pantera’s previous three albums, was released on Metal Magic Records, but showcased a change in their sound. By far the band’s heaviest album at this point, Power Metal was a mix of 1980s hard rock and thrash metal, sometimes blending both styles in a single song. Complementing the band’s new sonic approach were Anselmo’s harder-edged vocals compared to those of Terrence Lee. After the release of Power Metal, the band members decided to seriously reconsider their glam metal image and sound. Referring to the band's spandex appearance, Vinnie Paul remarked at a band meeting that “These magic clothes don't play music; we do. Let’s just go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be comfortable — jeans, t-shirt, whatever—and see where it goes.” The band members would later ignore their independent releases, including Power Metal, as they sculpted a new, heavier image to accompany their later groove metal sound. Their four independent albums are not listed on the band’s official website and have become hard-to-find collector’s items.|$|E

However, other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser's hesitance to break the record, he would have reassured him, saying [...] "I'd have kicked him right in the rear if I had known that...
