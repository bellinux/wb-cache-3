40|$|Abstract We review recent {{theoretical}} and experimental ef-forts toward developing an all-optical switch based on trans-verse <b>optical</b> <b>patterns.</b> Transverse <b>optical</b> <b>patterns</b> are formed when counterpropagating laser beams interact with a nonlinear medium. A perturbation, {{in the form}} of a weak switch beam injected into the nonlinear medium, controls the orientation of the generated patterns. Each state of the pattern orientation is associated with a state of the switch. That is, information is stored in the orientation state. A realization of this switch using a warm rubidium vapor shows that it can be actuated by as few as 60040 photons with a response time of 5 µs. Models of non-linear optical interactions in semiconductor quantum wells and microresonators suggest these systems are also suitable for use as fast all-optical switches using this same conceptual design, albeit at higher switching powers. A pair of counterpropagating beams induce an instability that generates transverse <b>optical</b> <b>patterns.</b> (A) Two spots form the unperturbed far-field pattern. (B) A weak beam incident at an angle to the pump beam axis causes the generated pattern to rotate. From [1]. © 2010 by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Several theorems describe the universal properties of output patterns and what patterns having those properties are realizable.

50|$|The NBRF’s {{earliest}} area {{of emphasis}} was developing <b>optical</b> <b>pattern</b> recognition technology. Working with Wilson in 1960 and 1961, Ledley built the Automatic Device for Antibiotic Determination (ADAD), a computerized light-measuring device that tested for efficacy of antibiotic drugs by measuring transparency in petri dish cultures. Areas that were transparent were likely {{areas where the}} antibiotics had killed the bacterial populations; areas that were opaque likely areas where the bacteria were still alive. The NBRF sold several ADAD units to the Food and Drug Administration, and to large pharmaceutical companies.|$|E

With the book and position known, the Tag device looks up the appropriate audio to play for that location {{in the book and}} plays it. This technique for position recognition is patented by Anoto.|$|E

5000|$|High {{resolution}} template patterning can currently {{be performed}} by electron beam lithography or focused ion beam patterning; however at the smallest resolution, the throughput is very slow. As a result, <b>optical</b> <b>patterning</b> tools will be more helpful if they have sufficient resolution. Such an approach has been successfully demonstrated by Greener et al. whereby robust templates were rapidly fabricated by <b>optical</b> <b>patterning</b> of a photoresist-coated metal substrate through a photomask. If homogeneous patterns on large areas are required, interference lithography is a very attractive patterning technique. Other patterning techniques (including even double patterning) may also be used. Kumar and Schroers at Yale developed the nanopatterning of amorphous metals {{which can be used}} as inexpensive templates for nanoimprinting. Currently, state-of-the-art nanoimprint lithography can be used for patterns down to 20 nm and below.|$|R
