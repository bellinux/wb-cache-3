5|$|In 2012, {{after the}} {{cancellation}} of their Psychoville, writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith were commissioned to produce two series for the BBC by controllers Janice Hadlow and Cheryl Taylor, partially in response to Sky beginning to produce comedy. At the time, {{it was unclear whether}} this would be two series <b>of</b> <b>Inside</b> No. 9, then known by the working title Happy Endings, or a series <b>of</b> <b>Inside</b> No. 9 and a series of some other programme. Inside No. 9 was to be produced by a BBC team, which was later revealed to be David Kerr (director), Jon Plowman (executive producer) and Adam Tandy (producer).|$|E

In addition, Bruce Mackinnon provided the voice of an actor playing Malcolm in Macbeth, and Jo Stone-Fewings provided the voice of an actor playing Macduff.|$|E

25|$|Several {{people have}} pointed out more or less {{significant}} areas where Lewis' Outline is {{not consistent with the}} text of The Chronicles. Paul Ford, author of Companion to Narnia, points out that the text of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe states that Lucy and Edmund are one year apart in age, the years given in the timeline for their births, 1930 and 1932 respectively, would put their ages at something more than a year. Devin Brown, author <b>of</b> <b>Inside</b> Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, uses the timeline as a way to reconcile some of the statements concerning the timing of Aslan's appearances in Narnia with other characters' recollection of those appearances.|$|E
