3000|$|The [...] "Ubiquitous Consumer Wireless World" [...] (UCWW) {{paradigm}} introduces {{new perspectives}} and dimensions to performance in wireless communications. UCWW {{is a radical}} proposal to create a consumer-centric wireless communications techno-business environment to at least complement if not replace the existing legacy subscriber-based network-centric one. It holds {{the potential to be}} the next [...] "big thing" [...] on the macro-scale of wireless communications environments, with a promise of significant benefits for future generations of wireless networking. In particular with its concept of user-driven ABC&S, the consumer is handed new powers to manage their connection and its performance. One of the key novel underpinning infrastructural pillars to enable this shift of control is the wireless billboard channels (WBCs). These narrowband broadcast channels serve primarily for network providers advertising their wireless access services to consumers and for consumers to discover the existence of such services and be enabled to make association decisions with the networks for use of the advertised services. WBCs can be created within existing broadcast platforms established for pervasive services such as TV. However, QoS requirements for the WBCs will be different. As access network providers will rely <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>broadcast</b> advertised data to attract mobile consumers to use their network services, transmission performance on the WBCs should be predictable, controllable, and good. In their paper [...] "Performance analysis of [...] "WBC over DVB-H" [...] link layer," [...] authors Zhanlin Ji et al. of the Telecommunications Research Centre in the University of Limerick, Ireland address this performance issue in WBCs. Considering WBCs established over digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H) platforms, they present novel [...] "smart" [...] cross-layer error-control coding schemes for improving error protection performance. The algorithms for these schemes are jointly executed by the link layer and service layer cross-layer algorithms. In their paper, they show that the schemes improve error protection reliability relative to existing DVB-H IP datacasting schemes and can operate without detriment to flexibility or throughput efficiency.|$|E

The game was played on January 1, 2007 at its new venue, the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The matchup pitted the Big 12 champion No. 8 Oklahoma Sooners against the WAC champion No. 9 Boise State Broncos. The contest was televised <b>on</b> Fox.

50|$|The block airs each Monday through Friday from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 7:00 to 10:00 a.m. {{local time}} (these {{designated}} time periods {{also apply to}} the national block aired <b>on</b> <b>This</b> TV, which <b>broadcasts</b> <b>on</b> an Eastern Time schedule). Scheduling variances may exist for the syndicated block in certain markets due to network programming obligations (such as One Magnificent Morning, which may delay or preempt the KidsClick Saturday lineup on CW-affiliated stations that carry both blocks) {{as well as a}} preference to air news and sports programming in those slots.|$|R
50|$|Maxx Zoom {{consists}} of four compact unmanned camera units. Units are placed in pairs along the goal line, where each pair is covering the endzone from opposing angles. The units consist of clusters of four miniature cameras. The images from these cameras are combined using image stitching into a large, high-resolution video feed. Each cluster's pixel count adds up to total resolution of up to 8 times 1080p resolution or 16 times 720p resolution (16 Megapixel). This allows for digital zooming into players near the endzone without loss of quality or detail. Its main purpose is to analyze contested plays. For instance, during the New Orleans Saints at San Francisco 49ers game, an NFL official reversed his call on a 2-point conversion based on the Maxx Zoom replay. According to ESPN director Chip Dean, Maxx Zoom is the top development <b>on</b> <b>this</b> year’s <b>broadcasts.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that the decision to proscribe any broadcast on Radio 4 was taken before production was complete since the majority of episodes overran their allotted 30 minute time slot <b>on</b> first <b>broadcast.</b> <b>This</b> would not have been permissible on Radio 4 and they would have required additional editing to shorten them before they could be aired. Radio 3 had more flexibility and thus listeners were able to enjoy recorded material that would otherwise have ended up on the cutting room floor.|$|R

The <b>broadcast,</b> airing from 5 until 7, was simulcasted on sister stations WIVT in Binghamton and WUTR in Utica. The newscast was produced by WIXT from a secondary set at its studios and included brief localized updates (focusing on Watertown) twice an hour. Most coverage, however, presented was regional in nature with area-wide weather forecasts.|$|R
50|$|Prince Muhammed's granddaughter, Misha'al bint Fahd, {{was convicted}} of {{adultery}} in Saudi Arabia; she and her lover were sentenced to death on the explicit instructions of her grandfather, {{a senior member of}} the royal family, for the alleged dishonour she brought on her clan and defying a royal order calling for her to marry a man selected by the family, and were subject to public execution. Western media criticized the event as a violation of women's rights. A British TV channel presented a dramatized documentary, Death of a Princess, which was based <b>on</b> <b>this</b> incident.

50|$|In 2002, Sissons {{announced}} {{the death of}} the Queen Mother <b>on</b> the BBC. <b>This</b> <b>broadcast</b> created a major controversy, as he wore a burgundy tie as opposed to a black one, deemed more appropriate by tradition for such news. Sissons has since publicly defended his actions. Also during the broadcast he carried out a live on air interview with the Hon. Margaret Rhodes, the Queen Mother's niece, in which he pressed her for intimate details of the final moments of the death to the point of her breaking off the interview. This interview caused a media furore at the time, consternation in the Royal Family's circle and led the Prince of Wales to choose ITN to record his personal televisual appreciation of his grandmother rather than the BBC which would have been the expected and traditional option.|$|R
