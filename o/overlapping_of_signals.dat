40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{critical}} factors for lifetime and operability of ad-hoc and sensor networks is the limited amount of available energy. To this respect, minimizing the interference in the network (i. e., the <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> at network nodes) has certainly a positive effect, because it induces a reduction of the number of conflicting transmissions, and then results in an overall saving of energy consumption. Along this direction, in this paper we study the computational hardness of several interference minimization problems which arise while supporting some classic network communication patterns such as broadcasting (one-to-all), gossiping (all-to-all), and symmetric gossiping (symmetric all-to-all). In particular, concerning the non-approximability results, we prove that for any of the above communication patterns, the prominent problem of minimizing the maximum interference experienced by any node in the network is hard to approximate within better than a logarithmic factor, unless NP admits slightly superpolynomial time algorithms. On a positive side, we show that any approximation algorithm for the problem of minimizing the total transmission power assigned to the nodes in order to guarantee any of the above communication patterns, can be transformed, by maintaining the same performance ratio, into an approximation algorithm for the problem of minimizing the total interference experienced by all the nodes in the network...|$|E
40|$|The cluster {{formation}} in Three Dimensional Wireless Sensor Networks (3 D-WSN) {{give rise to}} <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> due to spherical sensing range which leads to information redundancy in the network. To address this problem, we develop a sensing algorithm for 3 D-WSN based on dodecahedron topology which we call Three Dimensional Distributed Clustering (3 D-DC) algorithm. Using 3 D-DC algorithm in 3 D-WSN, accurate information extraction {{appears to be a}} major challenge due to the environmental noise where a Cluster Head (CH) node gathers and estimates in{{formation in}} each dodecahedron cluster. Hence, to extract precise information in each dodecahedron cluster, we propose Three Dimensional Information Estimation (3 D-IE) algorithm. Moreover, Node deployment strategy also plays an important factor to maximize information accuracy in 3 D-WSN. In most cases, sensor nodes are deployed deterministically or randomly. But both the deployment scenario are not aware of where to exactly place the sensor nodes to extract more information in terms of accuracy. Therefore, placing nodes in its appropriate positions in 3 D-WSN is a challenging task. We propose a Three Dimensional Node Placement (3 D-NP) algorithm which can find the possible nodes and their deployment strategy to maximize information accuracy in the network. We perform simulations using MATLAB to validate the 3 D-DC, 3 D-IE and 3 D-NP, algorithms respectively. Comment: 11 page...|$|E

Stinkbugs gain higher signal-to-noise ratio and increase communication distance by emitting narrowband low frequency vibratory signals that are tuned with transmission properties of plants. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate hitherto overlooked consequences of duetting with mutually overlapped narrowband vibratory signals. The overlapped vibrations of the model stinkbug species Eushistus heros, produced naturally or induced artificially on different plants, have been analysed. They represent female and male strategies to preserve information within a complex masked signal. The brown stinkbugs E. heros communicate with species and gender specific vibratory signals that constitute characteristic duets in the calling, courtship and rivalry phases of mating behaviour. The calling female pulse overlaps the male vibratory response when the latency of the latter is shorter than the duration of the female triggering signal or when the male response does not inhibit the following female pulse. <b>Overlapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> induces interference that changes their amplitude pattern to a sequence of regularly repeated pulses in which their duration and the difference between frequencies of overlapped vibrations are related inversely.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the dynamic {{response}} of landslide prone slopes to seismic shaking can play an important role in failure triggering during earthquakes. It was also demonstrated that slope seismic response is often characterised by directional resonance phenomena. Directivity can be revealed by the analysis of ambient noise recordings according to a technique known as HVNR method based on the analysis of azimuthal variation of spectral ratios between the spectral amplitude of horizontal H and vertical V component of noise recording. Directional resonance is then revealed by the presence of a preferential polarisation of H/V ratio peaks, whose frequencies correspond to resonance frequencies and whose amplitudes depend on the impedance contrast between surface material and bedrock. H/V ratio amplitudes can potentially provide information also on amplification factors. However, the relation is not straightforward depending on the nature of the waves contributing to the ambient noise. Thus, it is desirable to distinguish different kinds of noise wave packets, possibly isolating the contribution of Rayleigh waves, which appear to better reflect site response properties. To identify Rayleigh wave packets in noise recording a new approach was tested, based on a technique of analysis of instantaneous polarisation. The results are promising for the investigation of site response directional properties, particularly in the case of complex site conditions, where resonance can be characterised by multiple anisotropic peaks. In our preliminary tests of noise recordings carried out at a site located on a slope affected by landslides, only a small fraction of data samples (in the order of 1 %) were identified as Rayleigh type waves: this was likely due the fact that the noise recording was dominated by an <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> with different kinds of polarisation. Thus, it was possible to recognise Rayleigh polarisation only when the energy of this kind of wave was prevalent. However, from a relatively short noise recording (in the order of 30 - 45 minutes) one can obtain a high number (in the order of thousands) of estimates of H/V amplitude and azimuth, providing a robust statistics to recognise ground vibration properties reflecting site response. The tests on sites where directional resonance properties had been verified through the analysis of seismic event recordings, showed that more coherent observations can be obtained for H/V ratios and directivity estimates by selecting Rayleigh type data samples, rather than analysing the entire data set or SH-type wave packets. This offers the possibility of reducing the uncertainties in data interpretation related to the influence of the nature of the noise wavefield...|$|E

Several single-chain (scFv) antibodies, derived from an affinitymatured series of anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) mouse IgG 1, were constructed with either complete or individual replacement of tryptophan residues with 5 -fluorotryptophan (5 F W). An array of biophysical techniques was used to gain insight into the impact of fluorine substitution on the overall protein structure and antigen binding. SPR measurements indicated that 5 F W incorporation lowered binding affinity for the HEL antigen. The degree of analogue impact was residue-dependent, and the greatest decrease in affinity was observed when 5 F W was substituted for residues near the binding interface. In contrast, corresponding crystal structures in complex with HEL were essentially indistinguishable from the unsubstituted antibody. 19 F NMR analysis showed severe <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> in the free fluorinated protein that was resolved upon binding to antigen, suggesting very distinct chemical environments for each 5 F Wi...|$|R

The ultrasound wave travels in a direct and a reflected path to the receiver, resulting in an overlap in the recorded output signal. The matched-filtering and deconvolution techniques were applied to determine the transit times associated with the two signal paths. Both techniques were able to detect the two different transit times; while matched-filtering has a better accuracy (0. 13 μs vs. 0. 18 μs standard deviation), deconvolution has a 3. 5 times improved side-lobe to main-lobe ratio.

40|$|The paper aims at {{detecting}} on-line cognitive {{failures in}} driving by decoding the EEG signals acquired during visual alertness, motor-planning and motor-execution {{phases of the}} driver. Visual alertness of the driver is detected by classifying the pre-processed EEG signals obtained from his pre-frontal and frontal lobes into two classes: alert and non-alert. Motor-planning performed by the driver using the pre-processed parietal signals is classified into four classes: braking, acceleration, steering control and no operation. Cognitive failures in motor-planning are determined by comparing the classified motor-planning class of the driver with the ground truth class obtained from the co-pilot through a hand-held rotary switch. Lastly, failure in motor execution is detected, when the time-delay between the onset of motor imagination and the EMG response exceeds a predefined duration. The {{most important aspect of}} the present research lies in cognitive failure classification during the planning phase.

In this work, we propose an approach for detecting, identifying and positioning a set of simultaneous acoustic events in a room environment, using multiple arbitrarily-located microphone arrays, and working in real time. Assuming a set of estimated acoustic source positions, {{the use of a}} frequency invariant nullsteering beamformer for each position and each array yields a set <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> which show different balances among the various acoustic sources. For each signal, a model-based likelihood computation is carried out to obtain a matrix of likelihood scores. Then a MAP criterion is used to jointly detect the event classes and assign each of them to a given source position. Experimental results with two sources, one of which is speech, and two threemicrophone linear arrays are reported, and a comparison with alternatives approaches is carried out.

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of this approach}} was that for any given amount of gun power, the shadow mask filtered out the majority <b>of</b> the <b>signal.</b> To ensure there was no <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> the <b>signal</b> on the screen, the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25% of its surface. This led to very dim images, requiring much greater power {{in order to provide}} a useful picture. Moreover, the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns, which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors. In spite of this, the technical superiority of the RCA system was overwhelming compared to the CBS system, and was selected as the new NTSC standard in 1953. The first broadcast using the new standard occurred on New Year's Day in 1954, when NBC broadcast the Tournament of Roses Parade.|$|R
