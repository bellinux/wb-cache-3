5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its themes <b>of</b> <b>chance</b> and fate, {{which he}} characterises as simple luck, to him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, {{a man who}} mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E
5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics <b>of</b> <b>chance.</b> As a result, drift acts upon the genotypic frequencies within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of alleles that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.|$|E
50|$|A player's {{expected}} {{score is}} his probability of winning plus half his probability of drawing.

On {{the other extreme}} it could represent a 50% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning, 0% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> losing, and 50% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> drawing. The probability of drawing, as opposed to having a decisive result, is not specified in the Elo system. Instead a draw is considered half a win and half a loss.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDo {{individuals}} {{unfamiliar with}} probability and statistics need {{a specific type}} of data in order to draw correct inferences about uncertain events? Girotto and Gonzalez (Cognition 78 (2001) 247) showed that naive individuals solve frequency as well as probability problems, when they reason extensionally, in particular when probabilities are represented by numbers <b>of</b> <b>chances.</b> Hoffrage, Gigerenzer, Krauss, and Martignon (Cognition 84 (2002) 343) argued that numbers <b>of</b> <b>chances</b> are natural frequencies disguised as probabilities, though lacking the properties of true probabilities. They concluded that we failed to demonstrate that naive individuals can deal with true probabilities as opposed to natural frequencies. In this paper, we demonstrate that numbers <b>of</b> <b>chances</b> do represent probabilities, and that naive individuals do not confuse numbers <b>of</b> <b>chances</b> with frequencies. We conclude that there is no evidence for the claim that natural frequencies have a special cognitive status, and the evolutionary argument that the human mind is unable to deal with probabilities.

5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements <b>of</b> <b>chance</b> are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E

Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E

5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because it is a matter <b>of</b> <b>chance,</b> or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport <b>of</b> <b>chance</b> yet some players claim skill is involved.

In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E

Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game <b>of</b> <b>chance</b> (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).|$|E

The road runs through another series of sharp curves through marshland before straightening out and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, two examples of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge carries it over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On the north side of the bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through the community <b>of</b> <b>Chance,</b> the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, which leads to a large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more marshland before entering Dames Quarter.
