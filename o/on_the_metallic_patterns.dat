40|$|We have {{proposed}} a metamaterial lens that enables sub-wavelength focusing, which is shorter than an operating wavelength. Our lens is a two dimensional array of a unit cell consisting of a metallic dual-plate printed on a dielectric substrate. The unique dual-plate structure provides negativeness both in permittivity and permeability, with no help from conventional additional structures, which are normally printed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite of <b>metallic</b> <b>patterns.</b> Therefore, we can focus a source (or an image) in a tiny distance shorter than the free space wavelength (λ) at the frequencies of interest. Furthermore, since the proposed geometry does not need separate supplementary structures to acquire negative permittivity or permeability, our lens is much simpler than conventional metamaterial lenses, which is a strong point in practical applications. We have validated sub-wavelength focusing ability in a 6 GHz frequency band through an experiment of near field scanning, which provided the width of about 0. 19 λ at a half maximum of a peak value of an measured image. The width of the focused image through the lens is more than 4 times shorter than that without the lens, which confirms the validity of our design approach...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{the organic}} solar cells based on nanohole-type and nanopillar-type <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> {{electrodes}} {{have been investigated}} systematically by comparing their similarities and differences. It has been demonstrated that both of <b>the</b> <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> electrode-based organic solar cells can outperform the planar control with an enhanced light trapping effect in the active layer if optimal designs are utilized. The integrated absorption efficiencies over the investigated wavelength range for <b>the</b> two optimal <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> electrode-based organic solar cells are approximately the same (82.4 %), leading to a 9.9 % enhancement factor {{compared to that of}} the control. Given that the thickness of the active layer in the organic solar cell with either type of <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> electrode is <b>the</b> same as that of the control (which produces the first absorption peak due to cavity resonance), the organic solar cells with <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> electrodes can maintain the carrier transport properties of the planar control device but with enhanced absorption and less active materials. The improved light trapping effects for the two different organic solar cells have also been clarified by analyzing the field distributions at the enhancement peaks. <b>The</b> nanohole-type <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> electrode can excite the dipole-like localized plasmon resonances and propagating surface plasmon polaritons which are localized at <b>the</b> top of <b>metallic</b> ridges. <b>The</b> nanopillar-type <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> electrode can also excite the dipole-like localized plasmon resonances and propagating surface plasmon polaritons which are localized at <b>the</b> top of <b>metallic</b> nanopillars. In addition, grating-coupled surface plasmon polariton modes at <b>the</b> bottom of <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> electrodes are also excited, yielding multiple peaks superimposed over the broad enhancement bump at the wavelength range shorter than 600  nm. The integrated absorption efficiency is optimized with the periodicity of 350  nm when the localized resonant modes are hybridized with the bent surface modes only over the short wavelength range. In a comprehensive view, <b>the</b> nanopillar-type <b>patterned</b> <b>metallic</b> electrode is suggested to be applied in the present organic solar cell system, since its optimal design has a moderate filling ratio, which is much easier to process than its counterpart.
