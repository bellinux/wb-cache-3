50|$|The Order {{has existed}} {{in a variety}} of forms and under {{multiple}} names. It was first founded in 1876 as the <b>Order</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Humility (OOH). In 1901, the Supreme Orient governing body was formed, now known as Supreme Sanctorum {{and the name of the}} organization changed to the Oriental <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Humility and <b>Perfection</b> (OOH&P) due to the addition of a second degree. Over the next decade, the OOH&P gradually merged with several other similar Odd Fellows appendant bodies formed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: the Imperial <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Muscovites, the Pilgrim Knights of Oriental Splendor, the Veiled Prophets of Bagdad, and the Ancient Mystic <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Cabirians. The name of the combined body was first chosen to be the United <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Splendor and <b>Perfection</b> and later changed to the present name <b>of</b> Ancient Mystic <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Samaritans as efforts to bring more units from Odd Fellows appendant bodies into one entity continued. During the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> and its constituent bodies, names, titles and regalia have also changed numerous times. Although the name of the organization implies a limitation to the United States and Canada, at one time there were also subordinate sanctorums in Cuba and the Panama Canal Zone.|$|R

50|$|OOH is {{reported}} to have been reorganized as the Oriental <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Humility and <b>Perfection</b> (OOH&P) in 1901 in Guelph, ON, but it is not entirely clear whether this reorganization is the same organization or a new one inspired by the original. This also coincides with the instituting of Supreme Orient on August 13, 1901, the predecessor to Supreme Sanctorum, as well as the creation <b>of</b> the <b>Perfection</b> Degree. Both the Perfection Degree and the rituals of the Supreme Orient were written by Abner Fraser of Hamilton, ON, the first Supreme Clericus of The Supreme Orient, a job which later came to be titled Supreme Secretary in AMOS. The Supreme Orient was incorporated in New York on February 5, 1919. The OOH&P had even more in common with today's incarnation than did the OOH, including the familiar owl and scimitar logo and very similar set of officers, with the principal difference being today's Grand Monarch was formerly referred to as a Grand High Hystytee and the Vice Grand Monarch as Vice Grand Hystytee. The local bodies of OOH&P were referred to as Sanctorums. The two ranks of members were Tribesmen who had taken the Degree of Humility and Sheiks who had further taken the Degree <b>of</b> <b>Perfection.</b>|$|R

Furthermore, it will explore how the enactment <b>of</b> <b>perfection</b> may define a woman’s overall identity. Through the use portraiture, this project will explore how women of different ages experience perfection in their daily lives at different moments in their lifespan. These enactments may be in the form of (but will not be limited to) achieving the ideal body, being professional at work, or having successful interpersonal relationships. This project examines perfection by contrasting Foucault’s theory of self-discipline (1979, 1980) and Gidden’s concept of structuration theory (1979, 1984, 1998). Perfection will be examined as both a burden and an opportunity in women’s lives.

[...]The Great Perfection, in its {{unbiased}} inclusivity, actualizes {{the meaning}} of self-sprung awareness.As the lion overawes all other beasts with his roar, so the language <b>of</b> Great <b>Perfection</b> commands the gradual approaches; speaking a tongue of its own, it engenders its own ultimate meaning. The land <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is free <b>of</b> buddhas and sentient beings; the ground <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is free <b>of</b> good and bad; the path <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> has no length; the fruition <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> can neither be avoided nor attained; the body <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither existent nor nonexistent; the speech <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither sacred nor profane; and the mind <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> has no substance nor attribute.The space <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> cannot be consumed nor voided; the status <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither high nor low; the praxis <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither developed nor neglected; the potency <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither fulfilled nor frustrated; the display <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither manifest nor latent; the actuality <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither cultivated nor ignored; and the gnosis <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither visible nor invisible.The hidden awareness <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is everywhere, its parameters beyond indication, its actuality incommunicable; the sovereign view <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is the here-and-now, naturally present without speech or books, irrespective of conceptual clarity or dullness, but as spontaneous joyful creativity its reality is nothing at all. In the verse of homage, the first, second and third lines reveal the self-sprung natural essence while the fourth line shows familiarity with that unchanging space of reality. The fruition <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is distinguished from our ordinary disposition by {{nothing more than an}} indication about the existential ground (the starting point that is 'basic total presence' adduced in the first line of the vajra-homage). All experience, therefore, is revealed as perfect and complete in the gnosis of pure mind.There is no imperfection anywhere: Perfect in one, perfect in two, perfect in all, life is blissfully easy.Unity is perfect as unitary pure mind, duality is perfect as the mind's creation, and multiplicity is abundant completion. In the transmission <b>of</b> the <b>perfection</b> <b>of</b> unity lies the pure buddha-dynamic; the teaching on the <b>perfection</b> <b>of</b> duality reveals everything as perfect projection; and by virtue <b>of</b> the <b>perfection</b> <b>of</b> multiplicity everything turns whole and splendid. Abiding here, doing nothing, embodied as man or god, our dynamic is buddha-reality; here sentient beings are cared for, And without any exertion we live in ease.|$|R

Therefore, God has the property of existence, that is, God exists. Descartes’ argument relies on his vivid and clear perceptions.

I argue that Descartes’ ontological {{argument for the}} existence of God does not prove the existence of God because Descartes could not have vividly and clearly perceived God to have the property <b>of</b> <b>perfection.</b> Given that a vivid and clear perception is unquestionable, if I prove that God’s property <b>of</b> <b>perfection</b> is questionable, Descartes’ ontological argument falls apart.
