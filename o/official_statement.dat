Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders {{not to make}} a speech, arguing that the international public does not know who is in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could be mistaken as an <b>official</b> <b>statement</b> of the Dutch government. Also Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E

For the final tournament, Totti was not named in the 23-man squad, and Italy was subsequently eliminated, failing to win a match and finishing last in their group, their worst-ever World Cup performance. Diego Maradona and former national teammates Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon said {{one of the reasons for}} Italy's early exit was due to the lack of creative players like Totti in the team.|$|E
5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an <b>official</b> <b>statement</b> on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E

5|$|A toyline for {{the film}} was {{confirmed}} by Hasbro in February 2012. Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to retailers, and appeared on store shelves in May 2012. A Variety article was published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from the shelves and recalled by Hasbro, although the company's <b>official</b> <b>statement</b> indicated that existing product would be sold through. New product shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys R Us as late as December 2012. The toyline was re-released in the United States in February 2013. A four-part limited series comic book titled G.I.

However, only weeks after its release, Paramount issued a recall due to audio synchronization problems. The studio issued an <b>official</b> <b>statement</b> acknowledging the problem, which they attributed to an authoring error by Technicolor that escaped the quality control process, {{and that they had}} already begun the process of replacing the defective discs.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, Nader {{was let go}} from All My Children due to {{budgetary}} considerations, however, {{he later}} returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character {{to the center of}} a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an <b>official</b> <b>statement</b> saying they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who was negatively received by viewers, and let go shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back {{due to a lack of}} storyline. In 2004, Nader's suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{characteristics}} of apology (responsibility admittance, sympathetic expression, compensation, reassurance) and other features of crisis response such as use of excuses, function of apology, and organizational representation appearing in <b>official</b> <b>statements</b> when cyber-security breaches threaten an organizational reputation. Ultimately, 108 <b>official</b> <b>statements</b> issued by organizations in the United States and South Korea were analyzed through a quantitative content analysis. The results showed that (1) the most common type of data breach is identity theft, and almost all types of industry are exposed to the risk of data breach incidents; (2) internal security vulnerabilities including “malicious insider” and “accidental loss” are the second most frequent cause of cyber-security breaches; and (3) culture plays a significant role in the characteristics of apology (responsibility, sympathy, compensation, reassurance), use of excuse, function of apology, and organizational representation in <b>official</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R
