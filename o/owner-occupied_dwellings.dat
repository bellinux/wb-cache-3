In Tropic of Ruislip, Leslie Thomas’s humorous account of suburban sexual and social mores in the mid-1970s (adapted for television as Tropic, ATV 1979), the steady flow of families from council housing on one side of the railway to an executive estate on the other side served to illustrate what was becoming known as “upward mobility”. Another sign was that, by the end of the book, [...] "half the neighbourhood" [...] of Plummers Park (probably based on Carpenders Park, on the outskirts of Watford) had moved south of the River Thames to Wimbledon or nearby Southfields. This was put down to the [...] "attractions of Victoriana", which, like suburbia itself, championed at the time by Betjeman’s Metro-land, was coming back into fashion; however, it appeared to have just as much to do with couples following each other round in order to maintain extramarital affairs.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the value}} of an <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwelling</b> and for {{mortgage}} debt related to that, this box and not box 3 applies. Based on {{the value of}} the dwelling, a [...] "fixed rentable value" [...] is counted, while interest for the mortgage is deductible. This is an important factor, since interest on a mortgage can easily be over a thousands euros per month, which is subtracted from income before any income tax is applied. If {{the value of an}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwelling</b> would be positive (fixed rentable value is greater than interest) it is changed to zero.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{expenditure}} on enlarging or reconstructing an <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwelling</b> {{would be}} covered, {{in addition to}} regular maintenance and repair. Two arguments of an almost theological character are advanced {{in connection with this}} transactions approach.|$|R
50|$|Rising {{prosperity}} and pro home-ownership Government policies brought owner-occupation to {{its peak in}} the 1980s, whilst reducing the private rented sector. During this period <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> rose by 24% whilst the private rented sector contracted by 10%.|$|E
50|$|The way {{in which}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> should {{be dealt with in}} a Consumer Price Index has been, and remains, a subject of heated {{controversy}} in many countries. Various s have been considered, each with their advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{application}} of this principle in the <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> component of a Consumer Price Index {{is known as the}} [...] "debt profile" [...] method. It means that the current movement of the index will reflect past changes in dwelling prices and interest rates. Some people regard this as odd. Quite a few countries use the debt profile method, but in doing so most of them behave inconsistently. Consistency would require that the index should also cover the interest on consumer credit instead of the whole price paid for the products bought on credit if it covers mortgage interest payments. Products bought on credit would then be treated {{in the same way as}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{estimates}} {{of the effects of}} local domestic property taxes (rates) on local house prices are presented, and the effect of local taxes on <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwelling</b> prices is calculated for a number of English cities for the period up to 1990. The methods used enable estimation to be made of the effect of the introduction, during 1990, of the Community Charge or poll tax in England, when the local tax base was moved from housing consumption onto individual residency. It is estimated that the reform could have increased house prices by around 15 per cent and contributed substantially to house price inflation. ...|$|R
5000|$|Opportunity cost can {{be looked}} at in two ways, since there are two {{alternatives}} to continuing {{to live in an}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwelling.</b> One — supposing that it is one year's cost that is to be considered — is to sell it, earn interest on the owner's capital thus released, and buy it back a year later, making an allowance for its physical depreciation. This can be called the [...] "alternative cost" [...] approach. The other, the [...] "rental equivalent" [...] approach, is to let it to someone else for the year, in which case the cost is the rent that could be obtained for it.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} is to concentrate on spending.3 Everyone agrees that repairs and maintenance expenditure of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> should be covered in a Consumer Price Index, but the spending approach would include mortgage interest too. This {{turns out to be}} quite complicated, conceptually as well as in practice.|$|E
50|$|In 2016 {{there were}} about 9.0 million private {{dwellings}} in Australia, each with, on average, 2.6 occupants. In 1966 about 70% of dwellings were owner-occupied - {{one of the largest}} proportions of any country. The remainder were rented dwellings. About half of the <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> were under mortgage.|$|E
50|$|Then, {{there is}} the point that a rise in {{interest}} rates designed to halt inflation could paradoxically make inflation appear higher if current interest rates {{showed up in the}} index. Economists' principles are not acceptable to all; nor is insistence upon consistency between the treatment of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> and other durables.|$|E

40|$|Game-theoretic {{analysis}} of an owner's decision about renovating or improving his property indicates that some socially desirable choices are dominated, given the owner's preferences. In {{the case of}} <b>owner-occupied</b> multiple <b>dwellings,</b> public policy should revise the institutions that force the owner to injure society in order to benefit himself and his tenants. Separating assessment from building permit issuance (in the area of tax administration), and revising building codes to permit owners {{to do their own}} work under appropriate supervision where licensed contractors are now required (in the area of regulation), would be socially beneficial.

40|$|A simple OLG-model is developed, where {{housing is}} the only {{consumption}} good and saving is either in terms of financial assets or in terms of <b>owner-occupied</b> or rented <b>dwellings.</b> It is shown that, while without taxes optimal consumption plans and maximum utility are the same for both the tenant and the owner-occupier, conventional income taxes cause a bias in favour of the latter. It is argued that the consumption good approach is always advantageous for the owner-occupier {{in comparison with the}} investment approach, even with high interest rates and a high share of borrowing. However, even the investment approach does not entirely remove the taxation bias on the expense of the tenant, unless the latter is allowed to deduct total interest payments from his income. An alternative could be cash-flow taxation. It is also shown that the conventional investment approach is equivalent to - and therefore could be replaced by - a much simpler version, where instead of imputed rent imputed interest on net capital is taxed.

50|$|Dwelling {{prices are}} {{volatile}} and so, therefore, {{would be an}} index incorporating the current value of a dwelling price sub-index which, in some countries, would have a large weight under the third approach. Furthermore, the weight for <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> could be altered considerably when reweighting was undertaken. (It could even become negative under the alternative cost approach if weights were estimated for a year during which house prices had been rising steeply).|$|E

5000|$|Variants of {{the debt}} profile method are {{employed}} or have been proposed. One example is to include down payments as well as interest. Another is to correct nominal mortgage rates for changes in dwelling prices or {{for changes in the}} rest of the Consumer Price Index to obtain a [...] "real" [...] rate of interest. Also, other methods may be used alongside the debt profile method. Thus several countries include a purely notional cost of depreciation as an additional index component, applying an arbitrarily estimated, or rather guessed, depreciation rate to the value of the stock of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings.</b> Finally, one country includes both mortgage interest and purchase prices in its index.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, urban {{restructuring}} programs have been implemented in many Western European cities with the main goal of combating a variety of socioeconomic problems in deprived neighborhoods. The main instrument of restructuring has been housing diversification and tenure mixing. The demolition of low-quality (social) housing {{and the construction of}} <b>owner-occupied</b> or private-rented <b>dwellings</b> was expected to change the population composition of deprived neighbourhoods through the in-migration of middle and high income households. Many studies have been critical with regard to the success of such policies in actually upgrading neighborhoods. Using data from the 31 largest Dutch cities for the 1999 to 2013 period, this study contributes to the literature by investigating the effects of large-scale demolition and new construction on neighborhood income developments on a low spatial scale. We use propensity score matching to isolate the direct effects of policy by comparing restructured neighborhoods to a set of control neighborhoods with low demolition rates, but with similar socioeconomic characteristics. The results indicate that large-scale demolition leads to socioeconomic upgrading of deprived neighborhoods through the in-migration of middle and high income households. We find no evidence of spillover effects to nearby neighborhoods, suggesting that physical restructuring only has very local effects. Urban Renewal and Housin...|$|R
50|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the Management and Coordination Agency in 1983 found that there were 34.75 million occupied dwellings in Japan, of which 46.1% were built of timber, 31.3% of fireproof timber, and 22.6% of ferroconcrete or other nontimber materials. The same survey found that detached housing accounted for 64.3% off all housing in Japan, with the ratio falling in urban areas. In the 23 wards of Tokyo, for instance, multi-unit structures such as apartment houses accounted for 62.5% of all housing in those wards. In terms of tenure, 62.4% of housing in Japan consisted of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> 24.3% of units leased by the private sector, 7.6% of units leased by the public sector, and 5.2% of housing for government workers and company employees.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{argument}} has been expressed {{in connection with}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> the logic applies equally to all durable consumer goods and services. Furniture, carpets and domestic appliances are not used up soon after purchase {{in the way that}} food is. Like dwellings, they yield a consumption service that can continue for years. Furthermore, since strict logic is to be adhered to, there are durable services as well that ought to be treated in the same way; the service consumers derive from appendectomies or crowned teeth continue for a long time. Since estimating values for these components of consumption has not been tackled, the economic theorists are torn between their desire for intellectual consistency and their recognition that inclusion of the opportunity cost of the use of durables is impracticable.|$|E
50|$|One {{argument}} is that purchases of new dwellings are treated as Investment in the System of National Accounts, so should not enter a consumption price index. It is {{said that this is}} more than just a matter of terminological uniformity. For example, it may be thought to help understanding and facilitate economic analysis if what is included under the heading of Consumption is the same in the Consumer Price Index and in the national income and expenditure accounts. Since these accounts include the equivalent rental value of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> the equivalent rental approach would have to be applied in the Consumer Price Index too. But the national accounts do not apply it to other durables, so the argument demands consistency in one respect but accepts its rejection in another.|$|E
50|$|There are, of course, {{practical}} problems in implementing {{either of these}} economists' approaches. Thus, with the alternative cost approach, if house prices are rising fast the cost can be negative and then become sharply positive once house prices start to fall, so such an index would be very volatile. On the other hand, with the rental equivalent approach, there may be difficulty in estimating the movement of rental values of types of property which are not actually rented. If one or other of these measures of the consumption of the services of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> is included in consumption, then it must be included in income too, for income equals consumption plus saving. This means that if the movement of incomes is to {{be compared with the}} movement of the Consumer Price Index, incomes must be expressed as money income plus this imaginary consumption value. That is logical, {{but it may not be}} what users of the index want.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of extensive housing subsidies characterizes the current Italian tax system as inefficient. In this article, we study whether inefficiency {{is the price}} to be paid to improve equity, by assessing the distributive impact of housing taxation on households' well-being. We concentrate on the Personal Income Tax (PIT) on the main residence, and compare current provisions of the Tax Code with alternative approaches which consider the imputed rent (IR) from <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and would make the tax system neutral with respect to the allocation of wealth among different assets. Holding revenues constant at the current level, we assess the distributional consequences of the IR approach in terms of several alternative scenarios. Our results suggest that the current tax system is as inefficient as it is inequitable. In particular, by including IR from <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> as a component of the PIT gross income, we find that overall, inequality is reduced, while contemporaneously increasing efficiency in the allocation of wealth. Moreover, considering changes in tax liabilities for individual taxpayers, we show that taxing IRs will favour the young and penalize the elderly. © The Author 2012.

The private economy comprises the business sector itself and owner-occupied housing for which output at the industry level is hampered by several measurement problems. Using the aggregate production possibility frontier, owner occupied housing is accounted for on both the output and input, thereby mitigating the impact of measurement problems on the private economy. Under this framework, the purchase of new owner-occupied housing is included in investment, the flow of services from the corresponding installed stock of this asset is accounted in consumption on the output side. <b>Owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> capital services are also treated consistently in the capital input measure.

40|$|Abstract The {{taxation}} of the {{owner-occupied house}} – the “principal dwelling”– was a recurrent central {{issue in the}} political and economic debate in Italy especially in the last 15 years.
