5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> (also known as Flowers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest),</b> which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man looking away from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{contains}} {{four areas}} of pristine wilderness that have remained largely untouched by human {{activities such as}} mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses. Additionally, {{a small portion of}} the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> is designated wilderness. The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.|$|E
5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and those parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With {{the collapse of the}} sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|E

5|$|The 1215 charter {{had several}} clauses {{relating}} to the royal forests; clauses 47 and 48 promised to deforest the lands added to the forests under John and investigate the use of royal rights in this area, but notably {{did not address the}} forestation of the previous kings, while clause 53 promised some form of redress for those affected by the recent changes, and clause 44 promised some relief from the operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> courts.

5|$|The Absaroka and Beartooth Mountains {{are partly}} in the {{northern}} section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> The Wind River Range is in the southern portion and contains Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming. Yellowstone National Park forms part of the boundary to the west; south of Yellowstone, the Continental Divide separates the forest from its neighbor Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The eastern boundary includes privately owned property, lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Wind River Indian Reservation, which belongs to the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians. Custer National Forest along the Montana border is on the northern frontier.

5|$|The medieval {{phase of}} the history of the shrine began with the arrival of Kalyanagiri Swamy from North India {{sometimes}} during the 16th or 17th century. He identified the very spot of the shrines and their mythic associations with characters and events as expounded in Kanda Puranam. Following his re-establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> shrine, it again became a place of pilgrimage for Indian and Sri Lankan Hindus. The shrine also attracted local Sinhala Buddhist devotees. The caretakers of the shrines were people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> who were of indigenous Vedda or mixed Vedda and Sinhalese lineages. The shrines popularity increased with the veneration of the place by the kings of the Kingdom of Kandy, the last indigenous kingdom before colonial occupation of the island. When Indian indentured workers were brought in after the British occupation in 1815, they too began to participate in the pilgrimage in droves, thus the popularity of the shrine increased amongst all sections of the people.|$|E
