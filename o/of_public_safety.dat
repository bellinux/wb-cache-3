Bomar then began a long career in law enforcement, beginning in the United States Marshals Service office from 1934 to 1939. In 1939 he became a division chief with the Knoxville Highway Patrol {{and a year later}} became director <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>safety,</b> overseeing the city's police and fire departments.

5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Safety,</b> led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E

On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for his refusal to serve in the Vendée campaign. He faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects.|$|E

5|$|Prior to its Broadway debut, preview {{performances}} of the play were staged in several cities. The first was in Pittsburgh, where it began a scheduled one-week run on September 26, 1921.

Hopwood was upset by the censorship, but Woods was happy to have free publicity from press coverage of the closure. The tryouts then moved to Stamford, Connecticut and Atlantic City, New Jersey, where they proceeded without incident. The play's Broadway opening was at the Times Square Theatre on October 18, 1921. It ran there for a few weeks until Woods transferred it to his own Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre on November 7.|$|E
