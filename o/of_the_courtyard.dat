5|$|To {{the east}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> lies the Keep. It was re-built in the 1830s, having {{previously}} lain in ruins. This area {{has the largest}} concentration of students living in the castle. To the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> is the Gatehouse, built originally by Hugh de Puiset in the 12th century and re-developed in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. Around this are the college's more modern offices.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} is flanked on {{four sides}} by 32 khanas, or small study cloisters for religious scholars. The mosque's four 107 foot tall minarets {{are located in}} each corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The castle {{comprises}} {{a rectangular}} courtyard {{surrounded by a}} curtain wall, with a tower house, or keep, at one corner, and the round Glassin Tower projecting from the opposite corner. The foundations of demolished ranges of buildings remain around two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> Of the outer court, only an earth bank shows {{the position of the}} walls, with fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.|$|E

50|$|His {{colorful}} and rather theatrical period images of Venetian society, e.g. On the Balcony (1877; Private Collection), were quite different compared to delicate pastels and etchings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards,</b> balcony and canals of modern Venice.|$|R
2500|$|Currently, {{the park}} is on <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Main <b>Courtyard</b> (Hon-maru), and <b>the</b> Senior Citizens’ Welfare Center is on <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Secondary <b>Courtyard</b> (Ni-no-maru). [...] Remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earthen ramparts can be seen around <b>the</b> Main <b>Courtyard,</b> and a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} dry moat remains at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope below <b>the</b> Main <b>Courtyard.</b>|$|R
5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> the design is nearly identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated {{is linked}} to the six Khmer bronze statues (three lions–with heads {{substituted}} later in Burmese style, a three-headed elephant known as Airavata, and two warriors in the form of Shiva), which are installed in the temple in the northern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E
25|$|Today, <b>the</b> {{district}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Ghetto is <b>the</b> home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Synagogue <b>of</b> Rome.

50|$|A square stone kiosk-mosque (köşk mescidi), {{the oldest}} example in Turkey, {{is located in}} <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open <b>courtyard.</b> A {{construction}} of four carved barrel-vaulted arches supports the mosque on the second floor. Stables with accommodation above were located in the arcades on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>courtyard.</b>|$|R
5|$|By 1630, the inn {{was owned}} by William Riplingham, officer of the Great Wardrobe. Riplingham built an {{extension}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> ranges {{on the site of}} the Angel Inn around 1638, for which he was fined due to breaking building regulations. These ranges survived up to the early 19th century. By 1677, the Angel {{was owned by}} James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton and occupied by Edward Fawcett, who ran the inn until his death in 1696. The premises accommodated livestock traders destined for Smithfield Market as well as long distance travellers.|$|E
5|$|Decorative tiles {{designed}} by Henry Chapman Mercer—one {{of the leading}} figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings. The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E
5|$|On June 18, 1998, {{a severe}} storm damaged the estate. Heavy rains caused the {{drainage}} system to fail and {{a cascade of}} water surged over the retaining wall. This caused a mudslide, damaging the estate's foundation. Furthermore, the large oak tree at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> fell {{down on top of}} the house. The next year, another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing. A 1999 grant from Save America's Treasures helped defray costs to re-roof Taliesin III, to stabilize its foundation, and to connect it to a local sewage treatment plant.|$|E
50|$|Circulation {{throughout}} {{the building is}} via the extensive verandahs and colonnades, {{all of which are}} now enclosed. <b>The</b> southern ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards,</b> once open, are now blocked off by two brick bathroom wings with storage areas underneath. The house has six brick chimney stacks, some of which are highly ornate.|$|R

An additional fighter on the east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> fired, fatally wounding Gathercole. Higgins and Robinson returned fire, killing that fighter. They were joined by Sergeant First Class Jerod Staidle, the platoon sergeant, and Specialist Gary Depriest, a medic. Directing the medic to treat Gathercole, Petry was assisted by Staide and Higgins to the casualty collection point.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{as a basic}} L-shaped tower {{built from}} tooled ashlar dressed rubble, the castle was {{extended}} in a southerly direction {{by the addition of}} a circular tower during the first alterations in the late 16th century. A staircase was inside the new tower and further structures were added to the south and north sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> {{at this stage of the}} development. Replacement entrances were installed and the original first-floor doorway was closed off. Access on the west side was gained through a narrow round-headed entrance and a wider main doorway was incorporated in the south elevation.|$|E
5|$|Still {{awaiting}} imperial {{permission to}} build in the courtyard, the Perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to the Jews in 1623, which stated {{that there could be}} no objection to them building in their own quarters. Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the courtyard. In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government's disregard of the documents proving their ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atrium are {{decorated}} by {{a multitude of}} vaults with piers in between. In total, there are fourteen vaults: four on each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard's</b> three walls and one each where the west wall meets the sides. The atrium includes {{an equal number of}} round limestone columns each standing opposite one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piers, [...] apart.|$|R
25|$|The medieval European {{farmhouse}} embodies what {{we think}} of today as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most archetypal examples of a courtyard housefour buildings arranged around a square courtyard with a steep roof covered by thatch. <b>The</b> central <b>courtyard</b> was used for working, gathering, and sometimes keeping small livestock. An elevated walkway frequently ran around two or three sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> in <b>the</b> houses. Such structures afforded protection, and could even be made defensible.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{courtyard}} view of California Art Club. (former residence of Miss Aline Barnsdall), ca. 1932. Taken {{from within the}} California Art Club's central courtyard (also known as the "Aline Barnsdall Hollyhock House", designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright), this photograph shows <b>the</b> architectural detail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>courtyard,</b> especially <b>the</b> ornate "Hollyhock" motifs that decorate many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house's external surfaces.

5|$|The present main {{entrance}} to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard {{at the opposite end}} of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya; the southwestern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across the courtyard from the {{entrance to the}} Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall.|$|E
5|$|Two {{doors at}} the {{south-east}} and south-west corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> led to a small hypostyle hall with four pairs of red granite pillars. Beyond were storage chambers and the inner sanctum with three (Ricke) or five (Lauer) statue niches where statues of the king would have been placed, facing the pyramid to the north. Contrary to other mortuary temples, the inner sanctum was thus separated from the pyramid by the courtyard. The only remains of the mortuary temple that are visible today are its basalt paving and the large granite blocks framing the outer door.|$|E
5|$|Devotees can first {{complete}} a ritual circumambulation on the jagati {{starting from the}} main entrance by walking in a clockwise direction (towards the left) before entering the mantapa, following the sculptural clockwise-sequenced reliefs on the outer temple walls depicting a sequence of epic scenes from the Hindu epics. Temples that are not built on a jagati can have steps flanked by elephant balustrades (parapets) {{that lead to the}} mantapa from ground level. An example of a temple that does not exhibit the raised platform is the Bucesvara temple in Korvangla, Hassan District. In temples with two shrines (dvikuta), the vimanas (the shrines or cellae) may be placed either next to each other or on opposite sides. The Lakshmidevi temple at Doddagaddavalli is unique to Hoysala architecture as it has four shrines around a common centre and a fifth shrine within the same complex for the deity Bhairava (a form of Shiva). In addition, four minor shrines exist at each corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> (prakaram).|$|E

25|$|In all, 26 {{people were}} {{shot by the}} paratroopers; 13 died on the day and another died four months later. Most of them were killed in four main areas: the rubble {{barricade}} across Rossville Street, <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> car park <b>of</b> Rossville Flats (on <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flats), <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> car park <b>of</b> Glenfada Park, and <b>the</b> forecourt <b>of</b> Rossville Flats (on <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flats).|$|R

5|$|The Guests' Hall and its {{adjoining}} Porch Room {{occupy the}} space above {{the entrance to}} the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase at the south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible {{from the front of the}} house. A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch in the ceiling of the Brew-house below.|$|E
5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the exotic and {{beautiful}} wares in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, crystal, and many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months. From 975 to 1075, Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics, {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in the world. One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US$150,000 per day, to the administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam. Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans; a basic unit consisted of rooms built around a central courtyard, with an arcade of arches on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> being the principal means of access.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} was rebuilt, {{the architect}} Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble balustrading {{on the upper}} level. Today the upper arcades are known as the Galerie d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honoré II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its external walls with frescoes. It is thought that the galleries (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} is a simple rectangle measuring 97 feet wide x 83 feet deep. The plan is typical of Spanish construction, with interconnected rooms, around the outside perimeter that also open to a central courtyard. There is a wide arched vehicular passage leading from the front through <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> to <b>the</b> rear exit from the building. <b>The</b> original <b>courtyard</b> has been partially closed in {{on the first floor}} only on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passageway to create two additional rooms. Between the front rooms and <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> a fine masonry staircase rises on the left side off the central passage.
