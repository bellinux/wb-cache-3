40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parameter-dependent controller design approach for vehicle active suspensions {{to deal with}} changes in vehicle inertial properties and existence of actuator time delays. By defining a parameter-dependent Lyapunov functional, matrix inequality conditions with reduced conservatism are obtained {{for the design of}} controllers. Feasible solutions can be obtained by solving a finite number of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) embedded within a genetic algorithm (GA). Both state feedback and static output feedback controllers can be designed under a unified framework. Based on the measurement or estimation of the vehicle inertial parameters, a parameter-dependent controller could be implemented in practice. The presented approach is applied to a two-degree-of-freedom quarter-car suspension model. Numerical simulations on both bump and random road responses show that the designed parameter-dependent controllers can achieve good active suspension performance regardless of the variation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sprung</b> mass and the presence of actuator time delay. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{geometric}} control {{properties of}} vehicles with active suspensions are analyzed. A special attention {{is devoted to}} the problem of disturbance decoupling. Active suspensions of advanced vehicles allow the active rejection of external disturbances exerted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sprung</b> mass of the vehicle and caused by road surface irregularity. We focus on the road irregularity disturbances with the purpose of isolating the chassis from vibrations transmitted through suspensions. The paper is aimed at the synthesis of a decoupling control law of the regulated outputs, i. e., roll, pitch and chassis height, from the external disturbances. The paper emphasizes that disturbance decoupling can be thought as a structural property of road vehicles with active suspensions. The framework throughout is the geometric approach to the control of dynamic systems. It is shown that a controlled and conditioned invariant subspace exists such that it allows the geometric disturbance localization. The decoupling problem with stability and the algebraic feedback of suspension heights, i. e. the system measurements, are considered. Simulations with real data are included to validate theoretical results. Saturating actuators are also considered in order to model a more realistic case. 1...|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{is a basic}} {{phenomenon}} that has attached control engineering’s attention for many decades. Vibration rejection in control systems is implemented with passive, semi active and active vibration suppression systems. These methods commonly use multiple redundant sensors. Multiple sensor usage and complex control has implemented the cost of operation and complexity. Minimal sensor usage to provide vibration suppression within the commonly used acceleration or deflection observation {{could be used to}} reduce the complexity and the cost of the system. This dissertation proposes a novel methods which uses either the acceleration or motor deflection measurement based disturbance force observe for vibration observations and to suppress the vibrations with active vibration suppression. The proposed system is capable of estimating the disturbances and compensate disturbance using the only a acceleration or suppression deflection sensory data. Proposed system still could work as a traditional vibration suppression system in case of a failure to active system. Active for to be injected is calculated based on the disturbance forces acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sprung</b> mass. A novel method is proposed for spring and damper parameter measurements with electromagnetic actuators which enhance the overall system performance. A Quarter car model is used to illustrate the adaptability, robustness, and the vibration suppression capabilities of the system. Performance of the active vibration suppressor and disturbance observer is measured using system simulations and practical results. Simulation and practical system responses provide evidence of robust vibration suppression capabilities of the proposed method under different conditions...|$|E

40|$|Articulated {{vehicles}} {{are known to}} exhibit appreciable yaw oscillations during high-speed directional maneuvers. Excessive vehicle off-tracking of multiple axle semitrailers causes rapid tire wear and poor maneuverability at low speeds. The concepts in articulation damping and forced-steering of the semitrailer axles are investigated to achieve improved low speed maneuverability as well as high speed directional control performance of the vehicle. The concept of a damped articulation mechanism is introduced and its potential benefits in limiting the yaw and lateral oscillations of semi-trailer are investigated. Different force-steering algorithms are formulated to achieve both improved low- and medium-speed maneuvrability and high-speed directional control performance. A nonlinear yaw plane model of an articulated vehicle with a multiple axles semitrailer comprising two articulation dampers and forced-steering of a semitrailer axle is formulated. The cornering forces and aligning moments of a radial truck tire are characterized by a nonlinear function in normal load, side-slip angle and pneumatic trail. The damping forces and moments acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sprung</b> masses due to the articulation dampers are derived from the kinematic and dynamic analysis of the articulation mechanism. The equations of motion of the vehicle are solved for typical low-speed cornering and high-speed lane-change and evasive maneuvers. A parametric study is performed to establish the influence of articulation damping coefficients on the magnitude of lateral and yaw oscillations of the semitrailer. The {{results of the study}} show that the yaw and lateral oscillations encountered during high speed directional maneuvers can be significantly reduced by the articulation dampers. The low- and medium-speed maneuvrability and high-speed directional dynamics of the vehicle are further investigated using forced-steering of a semitrailer axle, assuming proportional control and negligible generator dynamics. The results are discussed to highlight the influence of the location of the forced-steering axle, feedback variables and control gains. The study showed that a forced-steering algorithm based on articulation angle and speed sensitive articulation angle offers considerable potentials in realizing both the improved low speed maneuvrability and high-speed directional control performance...|$|E
