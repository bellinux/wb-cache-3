5|$|When meeting another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways {{from side to}} side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone are enough to start displays and distinguish members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E
5|$|Among P. labiata {{and some}} other Portias, when adults <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> but {{opposite}} sexes recognise each other, they display at 10 to 30centimetres. Males usually wait for 2 to 15minutes before starting a display, but sometimes a female starts a display first.|$|E

60|$|As Gartner {{found that}} there was {{sometimes}} an innate difference in different INDIVIDUALS <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> two <b>species</b> in crossing; so Sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> two <b>species</b> in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, <b>the</b> facility <b>of</b> effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting. The common gooseberry, for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.|$|R

5|$|E. annectens {{differed}} from E. regalis {{by having a}} longer, lower, less robust skull. Although Brett-Surman regarded E. regalis and E. annectens as potentially representing males and females <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> all E. regalis specimens come from older formations than E. annectens specimens.|$|E
5|$|Population ecology {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment. A population consists of individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, mature {{females of}} P. fimbriata, P. africana, P. fimbriata, P. labiata, and P. schultzi emit {{olfactory}} signals that {{reduce the risk}} that any other females, males or juveniles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> may contend for the same prey. The effect inhibits aggressive mimicry against a prey spider even if the prey spider is visible, and also if the prey is inhabiting any part of a web. If a female {{of one of these}} Portias smells a male <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> the female stimulates the males to court. These Portia species do not show this behaviour when they receive olfactory signals from members of other Portia species.|$|E

5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against others <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{coloration}} can {{signal the}} services an animal offers to other animals. These may be <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> as in sexual selection, or of different species, as in cleaning symbiosis. Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may {{be understood by}} many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited by different species of fish, and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E

30|$|The forearm length, body weight, and <b>the</b> {{predominant}} CF <b>of</b> H. pratti {{measured in}} the present study (Fig.  1, Tables  1 and 2, bats caught in Hubei province) were similar to <b>the</b> measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bat <b>species</b> reported in a previous study (bats caught in Fujian, Guangxi, and Henan provinces, Zhang et al. 2009) but different from that reported in another study (bats caught in Guizhou province, Chen et al. 2002). The difference in these measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bat <b>species</b> may be due to geographic difference. Regardless of these different reports, our present study did not find any sexual dimorphism in the forearm length and body weight of H. pratti (Table  1).|$|R
5|$|Distinguishing S.grandis {{from the}} other four New World species of Sphecius (S.convallis, S.hogardii, S. speciosus, S.spectabilis) is difficult. The female S.convallis was {{originally}} distinguished from the female S. grandis by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral tergites on S.convallis and yellow marks on all tergites for S.grandis. However, this {{was found to be}} insufficient for correct identification because the positions of the markings can vary among different wasps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{including}} libellulids and aeshnids {{are found}} in desert pools, for example in the Mojave Desert, where they are active in shade temperatures between 18 and 45°C (64.4 to 113°F); these insects were able to survive body temperatures above the thermal death point of insects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> found in cooler places.|$|E
5|$|Host-parasite mimicry is a {{situation}} where a parasite mimics its own host. As with mimicry of the female sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic being <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species.</b> Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such situation where host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E

5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species {{and this may}} have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Many birds {{actively}} {{defend a}} territory from others <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that {{are unable to}} defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.|$|E
5|$|Predominantly insectivorous, the {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species {{for the study of}} warbler behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.|$|E

5|$|Russulaceae {{are also}} an {{important}} group of orchid mycorrhizal fungi. This symbiosis is mutualistic {{in the case of}} green orchids, but a partly or fully epiparasitic relationship in the case of myco-heterotrophic and mixotrophic orchids, respectively. In some cases, the association with Russulaceae is, as in monotropoid mycorrhiza, very specific: the Mediterranean orchid Limodorum abortivum predominantly associates with Russula delica and closely related species; in Corallorhiza maculata, different genotypes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> have distinct Russula partners.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{use their}} venom {{to kill or}} subdue prey, {{as well as for}} other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current {{scientific}} theory suggests that snake venom is not used for defense or for competition between members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E
5|$|Solitary animals {{defend a}} {{territory}} and avoid social {{interactions with the}} members of its species, except during breeding season.
