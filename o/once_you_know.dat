2500|$|Computer and Video Games' Andy Robinson {{described}} Cave's personality as [...] "loud" [...] {{and that}} Simmons is [...] "on form here". GameZone's Ben PerLee described Cave as [...] "the typical tycoon mastermind/crazy man, so stubborn in his ways, government and {{basic human rights}} be damned" [...] and that [...] "his suggested history with GLaDOS provides an amazing focal point for the second entry". PC Gamers Dan Stapleton wrote that Cave's [...] "comically sociopathic approach to science {{is second only to}} GLaDOS’". He also praised Simmons for his portrayal of Cave because of his [...] "fittingly cantankerous voice". Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis called Simmons' portrayal [...] "terrific" [...] and described Simmons as a [...] "perennial tough-talker and boss-man-type". CNN's Larry Frum praised Cave's [...] "sarcastic, shoot-from-the-hip attitude" [...] for its contribution to the game's dialogue. ABC News' Lou Kesten wrote that Cave was a [...] "memorable" [...] character, and that Simmons helped in portraying what he thought was one of the three [...] "most distinctive characters in video games" [...] along with Wheatley and GLaDOS. The Wall Street Journals Ryan Kuo wrote that Cave's [...] "gruff proclamations are somewhat more grating than his synthetic counterparts" [...] and that [...] "for better or worse, it’s also impossible to un-see J.K. Simmons <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it’s him speaking".|$|E
2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{fingered the}} ringlets of his periwig, {{a little embarrassed}} how to deliver himself, {{considering}} how he should begin.

6000|$|... 'That's the way it's done,' the Queen {{said with}} great decision: 'nobody can {{do two things}} at <b>once,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> Let's {{consider}} your age to begin with--how old are you?' ...|$|E
