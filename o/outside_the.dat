5000|$|A typical [...] "house pattern" [...] {{ranges from}} 38 to 42 {{feet in length}} and the oil is tapered from <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> to <b>the</b> center such that <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> lane has {{the least amount of}} oil and the center has the most. The lack of oil on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> lane and an {{abundance}} of oil near the center creates a funnel effect that causes balls rolled on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> lane to hook to the pins and balls rolled in middle of the lane to slide to the pins.|$|R

40|$|This {{demonstration}} {{shows that}} the charge on a conductor resides on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> conductor using the classical Faraday ice pail experiment. A regular old mop bucket, isolated from ground, is charged to a high potential using a Wimshurst machine. Charge is then "scraped" off <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> pail using small conducting spheres and deposited on an electrometer, causing the electrometer to deflect and thus indicating the presence of charge on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> pail, as seen in Figure 1. When a similar procedure is used to scrape charge off {{the inside of the}} bucket, it is found that no charge is obtained, thus demonstrating that the charge resides on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> conductor...|$|R
