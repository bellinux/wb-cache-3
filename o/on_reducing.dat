5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers <b>on</b> <b>Reducing</b> Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations {{was reflected in the}} cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation.|$|E

After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core exhaust nozzle. The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.|$|E

Treatment focuses <b>on</b> <b>reducing</b> bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{is focused}} <b>on</b> <b>reducing</b> stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four {{treatment}} modalities {{have been reported}} in the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and antiplatelet drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, thrombolysis (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with angioplasty and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. Surgery is only used in exceptional cases.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the {{divisions}} in the state party proved ruinous for Randall's chances at the Speaker's chair. Instead, the Democrats decided on Michael C. Kerr of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In that post, he focused <b>on</b> <b>reducing</b> the government's spending, and cut the budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition from the Republican Senate. Kerr's health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused {{to take his place}} as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work. Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876, but Kerr died in August of that year, leaving the Speakership vacant once again.|$|E

5|$|Intent on {{propagating}} Islam, in 1973 Gaddafi {{founded the}} Islamic Call Society, which had opened 132 centres across Africa within a decade. In 1973 he converted Gabonese President Omar Bongo, an action which he repeated {{three years later}} with Jean-Bédel Bokassa, president of the Central African Republic. Between 1973 and 1979, Libya provided $500 million in aid to African countries, namely to Zaire and Uganda, and founded joint-venture companies throughout the country to aid trade and development. Gaddafi was also keen <b>on</b> <b>reducing</b> Israeli influence within Africa, using financial incentives to successfully convince eight African states to break off diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973. A strong relationship was also established between Gaddafi's Libya and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistani government, with the two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance; this relationship ended after Bhutto was deposed by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 1993, Clinton {{made his}} first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused <b>on</b> <b>reducing</b> the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E
5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his {{campaign}} to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first motion was about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be self-financing and the third motion was <b>on</b> <b>reducing</b> the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's quotation after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members to reduce the number of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard report as the ideal council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion to reduce the number.|$|E

5|$|The Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, {{although}} written under McIntosh's leadership, {{had been}} {{determined by a}} special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The manifesto focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned. One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as Fares Fair, which focused <b>on</b> <b>reducing</b> London Underground fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1975, it was widely {{considered to be a}} moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London rates.|$|E

30|$|A {{method for}} the {{chemical}} synthesis of reduced graphene oxide has been developed. It {{is based on}} the chemical oxidation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes by means of heptavalent manganese with subsequent reduction. Sodium hypophosphite and sulfite were used as reductants. It has been confirmed by different methods that reduced graphene oxide is obtained. Current-potential curves for electrodes based <b>on</b> <b>reduced</b> graphene oxide in an oxygen fuel cell mock-up with alkaline electrolyte have been studied. It has been found that the characteristics of the electrode of graphene oxide reduced with sodium hypophosphite in oxygen reduction reaction are three to four times higher than those of the electrode of starting multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The electrodes based <b>on</b> <b>reduced</b> graphene oxide are superior to multiwalled carbon nanotube-MnO 2 composite in characteristics. The characteristics of oxygen electrodes based <b>on</b> <b>reduced</b> graphene oxide were stable during 6 -month tests.
