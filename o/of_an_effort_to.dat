5|$|Hashimoto's {{submarine}} {{then returned}} to Japan, {{one of the few}} such ships to survive the war. Hashimoto was called to testify on behalf of the prosecution at the court-martial of Charles B. McVay III, the commanding officer of Indianapolis, a move which was controversial at the time. He was later part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> exonerate McVay, which was eventually successful. Hashimoto later became a Shinto priest. He died in 2000.|$|E
5|$|SM U-17 was {{constructed}} in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 21 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October.

5|$|U-17 {{primarily}} operated from Cattaro, patrolling off the Italian and Albanian coasts.

5|$|Attendance was {{in decline}} across the league as the Great Depression took hold. The Habs posted a losing record in 1932–33, leading to still smaller crowds. Averaging only 2,000 fans per game, the team sold Morenz to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> cut costs. The move {{was not a}} popular one, and fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a {{standing}} ovation when he scored against the Canadiens {{on the last day}} of the 1934–35 season.|$|E
5|$|Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, {{which were}} {{designated}} the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies {{of oil and}} other important raw materials. This formed part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route.|$|E

5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> {{establish a}} healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout {{the forests of}} Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
5|$|Offensive {{additions}} included halfback Ara Parseghian {{and quarterback}} George Terlep, {{but the most}} significant signing {{of the year was}} Dub Jones. Brown got Jones – who had a long and successful career in Cleveland – in a trade with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the rights to draft Bob Chappuis. Author Andy Piasick describes this trade {{as one of the most}} astute in Browns history. The Browns also signed quarterback Y. A. Tittle from Louisiana State University, but were forced to send him to the Baltimore Colts as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> balance talent among the AAFC's teams during the league's third year of play.|$|E

5|$|The {{entry of}} a new {{ownership}} group of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the offseason that included Branch Rickey affected the Browns' schedule in 1948. Rickey, an executive for baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Brown to schedule a late-season road trip during which Cleveland would play three teams in eight days: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dons and the San Francisco 49ers. The plan was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> bring {{more attention to the}} AAFC and help attendance by sending its most successful team on a cross-country road trip, a strategy that had worked in baseball.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond of Tripoli seized Antioch without {{resistance}} {{after his}} father died in April 1201, but many noblemen left the principality to seek refuge in Cilicia. Leo invaded the Principality of Antioch in almost every year between 1201 and 1208, {{but he had to}} return to his kingdom on each occasion because Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, or Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan of Rum stormed into Cilicia in his absence. Pope Innocent III initially supported Leo. However, the conflict between Leo and the Knights Templar over Bagras led to Leo's excommunication in 1208. During the following years, Leo captured new fortresses in Syria, abandoning them in 1213 as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> improve his relationship with the Holy See. Taking advantage of BohemondIV's isolation, Leo entered Antioch, helping Raymond-Roupen seize the principality in 1216. Before long, Leo abandoned Bagras and lost the Armenian fortresses {{to the north of the}} Taurus Mountains to the Seljuqs. Raymond-Roupen increased taxes, which made him unpopular in Antioch. His relationship with Leo also became tense, enabling BohemondIV to regain Antioch in 1219. The war contributed to the weakening of the Christian states in Northern Syria.|$|E

5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E

Crews was succeeded by Chris Harrison, host of The Bachelor and its spin-offs, when season 14 premiered on September 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Allies also {{conducted}} a major air offensive against the French railway network and bridges {{over the river}} Seine from April to June. Bomber Command made 53 raids against these targets, of which 25 involved the four Australian heavy bomber squadrons. A total of 17 Australian bombers were lost during these operations, including six that German fighters shot down during {{an attack on the}} marshalling yards at Lille on the night of 10/11 May. In addition, Australians took part in 29 of the 46 raids conducted by 2TAF's light bombers against French railway infrastructure. Australian fighter pilots, including all of No.453 Squadron on occasion, escorted some of these raids and conducted ground attack sorties targeting railway rolling stock. 2TAF's fighter-bombers also attacked bridges over the river Seine from April as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> seal off the Normandy region, and Australian pilots posted to British squadrons were involved in a small number of these operations. No.453 Squadron attacked bridges and viaducts near Normandy on 27 April and 2 May.|$|E
