5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements</b> in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of plant}} life will also {{result in the}} {{eventual}} loss of oxygen as well as ozone due to the respiration of animals, chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and volcanic eruptions, meaning less attenuation of DNA-damaging ultraviolet radiation, {{as well as the}} death of animals; the first animals to disappear would be large mammals, followed by small mammals, birds, amphibians and large fish, reptiles and small fish, and finally invertebrates. Before this happened it's expected that life would concentrate at refugia of lower temperature such as high elevations where less land surface area is available, thus restricting population sizes. Smaller animals would survive better than larger ones because of lesser <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements,</b> while birds would fare better than mammals thanks to their ability to travel large distances looking for colder temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Background—The {{supplemental}} {{oxygen flow rate}} is a common bedside measure of gas exchange impairment. We aimed {{to determine whether a}} titrated <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> predicted mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods—We examined 104 adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis enrolled in a prospective cohort study and a validation cohort of 151 adults with a variety of interstitial lung diseases. The titrated <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> was defined as the lowest oxygen flow rate required to maintain an oxyhemoglobin saturation of 96 % while standing. Cox proportional hazards models and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were used to examine survival time. Results—A higher titrated <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> was associated with a greater mortality rate independent of forced vital capacity and six-minute walk test results in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (adjusted hazard ratio per 1 L/min = 1. 10, 95 % confidence interval 1. 01 to 1. 20). The titrated <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> was at least as accurate as pulmonary function and six-minute walk testing at predicting 1 -year mortality. Findings were similar in other interstitial lung diseases. Conclusion—The titrated <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> is a simple, inexpensive bedside measuremen...|$|R

25|$|High BOD {{concentrations}} initially {{exceed the}} ability of the secondary treatment ecosystem to utilize available food. Ecosystem populations of aerobic organisms increase until oxygen transfer limitations of the secondary treatment bioreactor are reached. Secondary treatment ecosystem populations may shift toward species with lower <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements,</b> but failure of those species to use some food sources may produce higher effluent BOD concentrations. More extreme increases in BOD concentrations may drop oxygen concentrations before the secondary treatment ecosystem population can adjust, and cause an abrupt population decrease among important species. Normal BOD removal efficiency will not be restored until populations of aerobic species recover after oxygen concentrations rise to normal.|$|E
25|$|To {{decrease}} {{the risk of}} developing decompression sickness, pilots breathe 100% oxygen for an hour prior to take off to remove nitrogen from the blood. A portable oxygen supply is used during transport to the aircraft. Since 2001, more than a dozen pilots have reportedly suffered the effects of decompression sickness, including permanent brain damage in nine cases; initial symptoms include disorientation and becoming unable to read. Factors increasing the risk of illness since 2001 include longer mission durations and more cockpit activity. Conventional reconnaissance missions would limit pilot duties to maintaining flight path for camera photography. Operations over Afghanistan included more real time activities, such as communication with ground troops, increasing their bodies' <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements</b> and the risk of nitrogen bubble formation. U-2 pilots now exercise during oxygen pre-breathing. In 2012, modifications were initiated under the Cockpit Altitude Reduction Effort (CARE), increasing the cabin pressure from 3.88 psi to 7.65 psi, a 15,000 foot altitude equivalent. The urine collection device also was rebuilt to eliminate leakage.|$|E
25|$|Sea snakes (Hydrophiinae, {{sometimes}} {{considered to}} be a separate family) have adapted to a marine way of life in different ways and to various degrees. All have evolved paddle-like tails for swimming and the ability to excrete salt. Most also have laterally compressed bodies, their ventral scales are much reduced in size, their nostrils are located dorsally (no internasal scales), and they give birth to live young (oviparity). In general, they have the ability to respire through their skin; experiments with the yellow-bellied sea snake, Hydrophis platurus, have shown that this species can satisfy about 20% of its <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements</b> in this manner, allowing for prolonged dives. The sea kraits (Laticauda spp.) are the sea snakes least adapted to aquatic life. They spend much of their time on land, where they lay their eggs. They have wide ventral scales, their tails are not as well-developed for swimming, and their nostrils are separated by internasal scales.|$|E

2500|$|Management {{is similar}} to vaso-occlusive crisis, with the {{addition}} of antibiotics (usually a quinolone or macrolide, since cell wall-deficient [...] bacteria are thought to contribute to the syndrome), oxygen supplementation for hypoxia, and close observation. Should the pulmonary infiltrate worsen or the <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements</b> increase, simple blood transfusion or exchange transfusion is indicated. The latter involves the exchange of {{a significant portion of the}} person's red cell mass for normal red cells, which decreases the percent of haemoglobin S in the patient's blood.

2500|$|Fish have a {{range of}} {{physiological}} tolerances that are dependent upon which species they belong to. [...] They have different lethal temperatures, dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements,</b> and spawning needs that are based on their activity levels and behaviors. [...] Because fish are highly mobile, they are able to deal with unsuitable abiotic factors in one zone by simply moving to another. [...] A detrital feeder in the profundal zone, for example, that finds the oxygen concentration has dropped too low may feed closer to the benthic zone. [...] A fish might also alter its residence during different parts of its life history: hatching in a sediment nest, then moving to the weedy benthic zone to develop in a protected environment with food resources, and finally into the pelagic zone as an adult.|$|E
2500|$|Reducing {{the force}} of {{contraction}} of the myocardium {{is known as the}} negative inotropic effect of calcium channel blockers. Slowing down the conduction of electrical activity within the heart, by blocking the calcium channel during the plateau phase of the action potential of the heart (see: cardiac action potential), results in a negative chronotropic effect, or a lowering of heart rate. [...] This can increase the potential for heart block. [...] The negative chronotropic effects of CCBs make them a commonly used class of agents in individuals with atrial fibrillation or flutter in whom control of the heart rate is generally a goal. [...] Negative chronotropy can be beneficial when treating a variety of disease processes because [...] lower heart rates represent lower cardiac <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements.</b> Elevated heart rate can result in significantly higher [...] "cardiac work", which can result in symptoms of angina.|$|E
40|$|Activities of prokaryotes are pivotal {{in shaping}} the environment, and are also greatly {{influenced}} by the environment. With the substantial progress in genome and metagenome sequencing and the about-to-be-standardized ecological context information, environment-centric comparative genomics will complement species-centric comparative genomics, illuminating how environments have shaped and maintained prokaryotic diversities. In this paper we report our preliminary studies on the association analysis of a particular duo of genomic and ecological traits of prokaryotes – gene-gene functional association patterns vs. <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> conditions. We first establish a stochastic model to describe gene arrangements on chromosomes, based on which the functional association between genes are quantified. The gene-gene functional association measures are validated using biological process ontology and KEGG pathway annotations. Student’s t-tests are then performed on the aerobic and anaerobic organisms to identify those gene pairs that exhibit different functional association patterns in the two different <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> conditions. As {{it is difficult to}} design and conduct biological experiments to validate those genome-environment association relationships that have resulted from long-term accumulative genome-environment interactions, we finally conduct computational validations to determine whether the <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> condition of an organism is predictable based on gene-gene functional association patterns. The reported study demonstrates the existence and significance of the association relationships between certain gene-gene functional association patterns and <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> conditions of prokaryotes, as well as the effectiveness of the adopted methodology for such association analysis...|$|R
