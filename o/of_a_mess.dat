The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} noting that Diplo makes Madonna sound fun on the song, Gavin Haynes of NME {{commented that the}} song's {{composition}} [...] "showed the gulf between [...] life and her music is now impossible to ignore". Calling it [...] "awry", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian claimed that [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] is [...] "a fantastic title {{in search of a}} song. In lieu of one, producer Diplo comes up with a kind of hybrid of EDM and happy hardcore and throws Nicki Minaj at her most hyperactive into the mix; the result genuinely sets your teeth on edge." [...] Criticizing Rebel Heart for being [...] "overworked", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that [...] "the duality of its title [...] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna'". John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song [...] "never quite lives up to its fantastic title, and just sounds a bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess,</b> trying to cram in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters opined that the song—and another Rebel Heart track, [...] "Illuminati"—"absolutely reek of desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that they fail to resolve as satisfying songs first and foremost".|$|E

[...] Whilst The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon expected that the physical contact between Marsters and Barrowman would result in [...] "somebody's sci-fi fantasy" [...] being realised she saw it dashing her [...] "hopes series two might serve less sex, less rubbish aliens and more credible drama". However, Dan Martin of The Guardian described the character as the [...] "best thing about the opener" [...] and stated that [...] "he stole every scene he was in". He felt the production team [...] "shamelessly and brilliantly.... transplanted" [...] the character of Spike into the series. Richard Edwards of SFX magazine also gave particular praise to Marsters portrayal and like Martin, stated that he [...] "steals the show". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy felt Hart's arrival to be [...] "self-consciously iconic" [...] in providing [...] "swagger, innuendo and a wonderful Star Wars reference". He felt that overall the characterisation verged [...] "dangerously close to parody at times" [...] but this didn't detract from Marsters being [...] "a joy to watch, in a similar vein to his role in Buffy." [...] Charlie Jane Anders commented in regards to the episode that [...] ""Spike" [...] is pretty great in his Adam Ant jacket, with his paralyzing lip gloss and his zany sexual innuendo".

Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta [...] "almost always has {{something}} going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a [...] "woeful, depressing failure" [...] and stating that the [...] "cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid {{the wreckage of the}} Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue." [...] Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being [...] "fairly dim, adolescent stuff," [...] as well as expressing dislike for the [...] "barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult." [...] On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says [...] "it's not hard to see why," [...] as well as criticising Portman's performance: [...] "Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance." [...] Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film [...] "works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three". He added that the film will become [...] "a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age." [...] Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is [...] "a bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess...</b> it rarely thrills or engages as a story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Collider.com's Kayti Burt {{felt the}} episode of Arrow [...] "gets enough nostalgic hits {{in to make}} it work, while also giving us an {{exciting}} (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover... Though the shared hallucination gimmick might lack long-term narrative consequence and feel like {{a bit of a}} 'Look, It's The 100th Episode!' plot device, it works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people." [...] Conversely, Burt [...] "was a bit sad that Arrow was robbed the opportunity of having a 100th episode outside of the already considerable demands of the crossover event, which were sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess,</b> but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways." [...] She gave the episode 3 stars out of 5. Sara Netzley, for Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, awarding it an [...] "A", saying [...] "Lots of Arrow action here, and not as much for The Flash/Supergirl folks to do. Still, it all worked beautifully. We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the invasion story line – and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made Arrow such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons. It was a tall order, but the episode pulled it off." ...|$|E

2500|$|ReelViews' James Berardinelli said Enough is {{director}} [...] " [...] Apted at his most commercial, and, unfortunately, his least compelling." [...] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice called Campbell the film's [...] "primary power source", [...] "His steely gaze and overbearing quietude are forever tainted; [...] "Once and Again" [...] doesn't {{stand a chance}} in Lifetime reruns". Robert Koehler of Variety was negative, [...] "Enough, a thriller detailing how a good wife gets back at an evil, possessive husband, is never provocative enough to generate strong emotional response." [...] Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert called the film [...] "tacky material" [...] {{and was surprised to}} [...] "see a director like Michael Apted and an actress like Jennifer Lopez" [...] involved in it. Paula Nechack of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Enough [...] "implausible and ugly" [...] and felt that it had already been done by actresses including Julia Roberts and Ashley Judd, and its script was [...] "more than enough <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> to tarnish her box-office luster." [...] Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide reviewed the film negatively, but praised the ending sequence, [...] "If ever a movie was undermined by its packaging, it's this formulaic thriller about a resourceful battered wife and the brutal husband who won't let her go [...] the entire promotional campaign is driven by the last 20 minutes, in which Slim becomes a lean, mean fighting machine and kicks the bastard's ass". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club said [...] "the film's idiocy works for Lopez: Every diva needs at least one camp classic on her résumé", while Desson Thomson from the Washington Post emphasized his disappointment with the film, stating: [...] "In terms of actual social conscience, the movie gets a demagogic, rabble-rousing F.

2500|$|Megan Lehmann, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, {{said that the}} film [...] "defies {{all but the most}} cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is [...] "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to {{accompany}} the requisite Aussie clichés", {{and the bottom line is}} [...] "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess.</b> I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
