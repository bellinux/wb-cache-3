5|$|During {{the same}} period, Colbert worked again with Sedaris and Dinello {{to develop a}} new comedy series for Comedy Central, Strangers with Candy. Comedy Central picked up the series in 1998 after Colbert had already begun working <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Daily</b> Show. As a result, he {{accepted}} a reduced role, filming only around 20 Daily Show segments a year while he worked on the new series.|$|E

50|$|Anderson's {{assistant}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sunday strip was Don Trachte. His assistant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dailies</b> was John Liney. In 1942, arthritis kept Anderson {{away from}} the drawing board, so Anderson turned <b>the</b> <b>dailies</b> over to Liney, and Trachte drew the Sunday strips. Liney retired in 1979. Jack Tippit then took over <b>the</b> <b>dailies</b> until 1983. Dick Hodgins, Jr. worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dailies</b> from 1983 until 1990. Trachte continued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sundays through 1995. About 75 newspapers still run classic Henry strips. These are also available through King Features' Comics Kingdom.|$|R

5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>daily</b> living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E

5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>daily</b> affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E
