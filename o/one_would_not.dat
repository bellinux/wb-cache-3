25|$|Two-slit {{diffraction}} is {{a famous}} {{example of the}} strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits {{cancel each other out}} in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.|$|E

25|$|In May 2007, Fincham {{took the}} {{decision}} to drop Neighbours, an Australian soap opera, from BBC One after 21 years on the channel, when its producers significantly raised the price they wanted the BBC {{to pay for it}} in a bidding war.

25|$|Both sides had {{lessons to}} learn from the battle. The Germans had assumed that their cruisers, leaving port one by <b>one,</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> meet larger ships or major forces. They failed to keep their ships {{together}} so they might have better odds in any engagement. Beatty—when faced with the choice of leaving one of his ships to finish off disabled enemies—had elected to keep his squadron together and only later return in force to finish off those ships. Goodenough, on the other hand, had managed to lose track of two cruisers, which therefore played no further part in the battle.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{complexity}} and time requirements, de-novo assemblies are {{orders of magnitude}} slower and more memory intensive than mapping assemblies. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that the assembly algorithm needs to compare every read with every other read (an operation that has a naive time complexity of O(n2); using a hash this can be reduced significantly). Referring to the comparison drawn to shredded books in the introduction: while for mapping assemblies one would have a very similar book as template (perhaps with the names of the main characters and a few locations changed), the de-novo assemblies are more hardcore in a sense as <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> know beforehand whether this would become a science book, a novel, a catalogue, or even several books.

25|$|It is {{said that}} the city of Cholula has 365 churches, either one for {{each day of the}} year or one for each pre-Hispanic temple that used to be there. In reality, there are only thirty seven churches; 159, if all the small chapels {{including}} those on local haciendas and ranches are counted. One legend states that the first chapel to be built in Cholula was in the San Miguelito neighborhood on what is now the outskirts of the city. It was the first structure with a red tile roof, and it was dedicated to the Archangel Michael. It is said to have contained an image of the angel, which contained inside a small demon tied to a post. As people venerated the image of the archangel, they also acknowledged the demon, in case the angel decided not to hear their pleas. This eventually gave the chapel an evil reputation as more came to ask for favors from the demon, favors that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> ask of a saint or angel. The demon began to be blamed for misfortunes that befell in the area, as, the legend said, when they occurred, the demon image would be found untied. Eventually, the image of the archangel with the demon inside was taken away and eventually disappeared.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error went into {{banishment}}. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.|$|E

25|$|In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen writes {{critically}} of {{conspicuous consumption}} and its function in social-class consumerism and social stratification. Reflecting historically, he traces said economic behaviors {{back to the}} beginnings of the division of labor, or during tribal times. Upon the start of a division of labor, high-status individuals within the community practiced hunting and war, notably less labor-intensive and less economically productive work. Low-status individuals, on the other hand, practiced activities recognized as more economically productive and more labor-intensive, such as farming and cooking. High-status individuals, as Veblen explains, could instead afford to live their lives leisurely (hence their title as the leisure class), engaging in symbolic economic participation, rather than practical economic participation. These individuals could engage in conspicuous leisure for extended periods of time, simply following pursuits that evoked a higher social status. Rather than participating in conspicuous consumption, the leisure class lived lives of conspicuous leisure as a marker of high status. The leisure class protected and reproduced their social status and control within the tribe through, for example, their participation in war-time activities, which while they were rarely needed, still rendered their lower social class counterparts dependent upon them. During modern industrial times, Veblen described the leisure class as those exempt from industrial labor. Instead, he explains, the leisure class participated in intellectual or artistic endeavors to display their freedom from the economic need to participate in economically productive manual labor. In essence, not having to perform labor-intensive activities did not mark higher social status, but rather, higher social status meant that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have to perform such duties.|$|E

[...] The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket ('The Threat from [...] the Darkness) condemning Islamic spiritual leaders [...] "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire." [...] In October 2005, Politiken, another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association.
