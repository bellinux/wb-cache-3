5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> <b>and</b> a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E

5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> contraception, natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E

In January 2006, after publicly announcing her opposition to Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, Cantwell, along with 18 other Democrats and all 53 present Republicans, voted for the cloture motion. The success of this motion ended an unlikely attempt to filibuster the confirmation of Judge Alito that was being led by Senator John Kerry and Senator Ted Kennedy. Alito was confirmed the next day {{by a vote of}} 58–42, with most Democrats, including Cantwell, voting against the confirmation.|$|E

25|$|Ion Iliescu, {{a former}} Communist Party {{official}} marginalized by Ceauşescu, attained national recognition {{as the leader}} of an impromptu governing coalition, the National Salvation Front (FSN) that proclaimed the restoration of democracy and civil liberties on 22 December 1989. The Communist Party was initially outlawed by Ion Iliescu, but he soon revoked that decision; as a consequence, Communism is not outlawed in Romania today. However, Ceauşescu's most controversial measures, such as bans <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> contraception, were among the first laws to be changed after the Revolution, and their legality has not been widely questioned since then.|$|E
25|$|Many {{religious}} traditions {{have taken a}} stance <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> <b>and</b> these stances span a broad spectrum, as highlighted below. Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; although there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was and how grave a sin it was held to be, it was seen as at least as grave as sexual immorality. Some early Christians believed that the embryo {{did not have a}} soul from conception, and consequently, opinion was divided {{as to whether or not}} early abortion was murder or ethically equivalent to murder.|$|E
50|$|First {{plans for}} a revote {{appeared}} in July 2008: the term of the current European Commission would be extended until the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, member states would agree not {{to reduce the number}} of Commissioners and Ireland would hold another vote in September or October 2009 after receiving guarantees <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> taxation <b>and</b> military neutrality. On 12 December 2008 the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen confirmed that a second referendum would be held, after an EU leaders summit agreed to keep 1 Commissioner per member state and to incorporate legally binding guarantees <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> taxation <b>and</b> military neutrality in the Croatian Accession Treaty.|$|R

25|$|The ACNA has {{attempted}} to incorporate {{the full spectrum of}} conservative Anglicanism within Canada and the United States. As a result, it accommodates Anglo-Catholic, charismatic, and evangelical theological orientations. It also includes those who oppose and those who support women's ordination. Women can serve as clergy members in some dioceses, while other dioceses maintain an exclusively male clergy. Women are ineligible to serve as bishops. The ACNA defines Christian marriage exclusively as a lifelong union {{between a man and a}} woman and consequently condemns homosexual relationships, as well as extra-marital relations, that are non-celibate as sinful. The church holds a pro-life position <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> euthanasia.|$|E
25|$|He {{retired from}} the House of Commons in 1978, and was created a life peer on 17 April 1978 as Baron Rawlinson of Ewell, of Ewell in the County of Surrey. He harboured hopes of being {{appointed}} Lord Chancellor or Lord Chief Justice (the law having been changed in 1974 to permit a Roman Catholic to take the former position, widely seen {{at the time as}} a measure to permit Rawlinson to take the job) but his politics diverged from those of the new Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher, and he was never offered either position. In the Lords, he supported restrictions <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> divorce, and resisted the introduction of conditional fees in legal cases.|$|E
25|$|On {{this last}} point, Grayling's {{view is that}} for {{historical}} reasons religions have an inflated place {{in the public domain}} out of all proportion to the numbers of their adherents or their intrinsic merits, so that their voice and influence is amplified disproportionately: with the result that they can distort such matters as public policy (e.g. <b>on</b> <b>abortion)</b> <b>and</b> science research and education (e.g. stem cells, teaching of evolution). He argues that winning the metaphysical and ethical debates is already abating the problems associated with (c) in more advanced Western societies, even the US. He sees his own major contribution as being the promotion of understanding of humanist ethics deriving from the philosophical tradition.|$|E

He considers himself a feminist, is pro-choice <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> <b>and</b> opposes the de-funding of Planned Parenthood. Sanders has denounced institutional racism and called for criminal justice reform {{to reduce the number}} of people in prison, advocates a crackdown on police brutality, and supports abolishing private, for-profit prisons and the death penalty.

25|$|Unlike Bush, Clinton {{was able}} to unite his fractious and ideologically diverse party behind his candidacy, even when its {{different}} wings were in conflict. To garner the support of moderates and conservative Democrats, he attacked Sister Souljah, a little-known rap musician whose lyrics Clinton condemned. Furthermore, Clinton made clear his support {{of the death penalty}} and would later champion making school uniforms in public schools a requirement. Clinton could also point to his centrist record as Governor of Arkansas. More liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton's record <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> affirmative action. His strong connections to African Americans also played a key role. In addition, he organized significant numbers of young voters and became a symbol of the rise of the Baby Boomer generation to political power. Supporters remained energized and confident, even in times of scandal or missteps.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{has some}} of the strictest {{abortion}} laws in the world. One of the last acts of the military government under Pinochet was to outlaw abortion in all circumstances. Chile's abortion law criminalizes abortion even when it would save a pregnant woman's life. Therapeutic abortion was legal between 1931 and 1989 but is now is illegal under all circumstances. There have been proposed bills from Chilean legislators and s <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> reproductive rights, but they have never been passed. Estimates range between 120,000 and 160,000 for the number of Chilean women who have illegal abortions each year. Chile is considered to have one of the highest abortion rates in Latin America. Every year, nearly 40,000 teenage girls become pregnant. Emergency contraception was banned in 2008, making the distribution of emergency contraception illegal under all circumstances.|$|E
