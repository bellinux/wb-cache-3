5|$|The {{state of}} New York assumed {{maintenance}} of two highways linking the hamlets of Harford and Harford Mills—one directly connecting {{the two and}} a second, more circuitous route to the east—in the early 20th century. The direct route and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> road were improved to state highway standards {{as part of a}} project contracted out on October16, 1914, and were added to the state highway system on December10, 1915, as State Highway1075 (SH1075). Each end of SH1075 connected to the segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> route between modern NY38 and Owego Hill Road, which was rebuilt as part of an earlier project awarded on September19, 1906, and included in the state highway system on July5, 1908, as SH379.

When the hotel was seriously damaged by fire in 1946, Brundage spent about $2.5 million remodeling and modernizing it.

He sold the hotel in 1970, but later reclaimed it when the purchaser failed to make required payments.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the east–west highway running through Reed City was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. The business loop was created after US10 was moved to bypass downtown Reed City in the late 1950s. This realignment was completed, and the business loop commissioned, by 1960. Until 1986, the western half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> along Chestnut Street ran concurrently with US131 until that highway was moved to its current freeway routing.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins on}} April 1, with Makoto {{awakening}} from a nightmare {{of a girl}} dying on April 6 with a bell in her hand. As the week goes on, he occasionally experiences premonitions of the future, all of which come true.

In each route, the girl Makoto was close to dies on April 6 with a bell in her hand. Afterwards, Makoto finds that he has traveled back in time to April 1, retaining the memories of the previous six days. Concluding that he is trapped in an infinite loop, he vows to keep the girl alive and break free <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop.</b> He does so by rebuilding his relationships with her while dealing with the emotional problem troubling her. On April 6, the girl ends up in a situation similar to when she died in the last loop, but Makoto saves her, breaking free <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> and becoming her boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop)</b> raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
