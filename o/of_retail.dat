40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this article}} is to correct the record on the contribution of the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Retailing</b> to business-to-business (B 2 B) research in marketing. In particular, we refute the assertion of LaPlaca and Katrichis (2009) that the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Retailing</b> "does not regularly publish research concerning business-to-business marketing. " Our analysis of recently published (2002 - 2008) articles in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Retailing</b> shows that less than 19 % are devoted to B 2 C or C 2 C topics. Our comparison of the Journal of Retailing's relative emphasis on nine B 2 B content areas indicates parity with other marketing journals for some topics and a lesser emphasis for others. The key B 2 B topics of marketing strategy and channels of distribution appear relatively more frequently in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Retailing</b> than they do in other marketing journals reviewed by LaPlaca and Katrichis (2009). Hence, any estimate of the contribution of B 2 B research to marketing knowledge that dismisses the impact of the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Retailing</b> contains a downward bias. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Notwithstanding the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>retailing</b> to urban economies, the role <b>of</b> <b>retailing</b> in {{the marketing of}} urban places has been an area neglected by both academics and practitioners alike. It is acknowledged that the principles of marketing can be applied (albeit with modification) to the context of urban places. The theoretical implications of this are considered using Corsico's (1993) metaphors {{of the city as}} enterprise, market and commodity. Such issues are considered via a survey of place marketing actors within the specific context of the marketing of towns and cities as shopping destinations in urban places classified as sub-regional and above. Particular attention is paid to responsibility for the marketing <b>of</b> the <b>retail</b> provision, the emphasis given to retail in the marketing/promotional activities of various urban stakeholders, the perceived role <b>of</b> <b>retailing,</b> and the factors influencing the nature <b>of</b> the urban <b>retail</b> provision. Promotion <b>of</b> <b>retailing</b> was found to be important for all urban stakeholders {{to a greater or lesser}} degree. However, prime responsibility lay with town centre managers and shopping centre managers. The implications for both theory and practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} some of the recent progress in the study of the history <b>of</b> <b>retailing,</b> with particular reference to analyses <b>of</b> the British <b>retail</b> market during the twentieth century. Design/methodology/approach Three themes were addressed, each of which has significant potential to enhance our understanding of the historical development <b>of</b> the <b>retail</b> sector. The paper considered both conceptual and empirical contributions to the discussion on the history <b>of</b> <b>retailing,</b> with particular reference to the business management literature. The approach involved a review of recently published literature. Findings Whilst there have been a number of important additions of late to the retail history literature, considerable scope remains for engagement with, and contribution to, the theory building taking place within business management. Practical implications The author identifies some of the lacunae within research on the history <b>of</b> <b>retailing.</b> Originality/value The paper illustrates some of the ways in which the study <b>of</b> <b>retailing</b> history can be productively linked with debates within contemporary studies of business management. </p...|$|R
