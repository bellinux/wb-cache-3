5|$|Although {{preliminary}} {{reports from}} Reuters suggested an Oblivion release {{in tandem with}} the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced, during a conference call with analysts on October 31, 2005, that Oblivions release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with Oblivion. News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing Hot Coffee minigame controversy, worse than average sales for the company's flagship , sudden drops in share prices, and delays for <b>other</b> <b>company</b> products.|$|E

The Gate to the Mind’s Eye, a film in the Mind's Eye series, was the first film to win the award. Macross Plus, an original video animation, was the first film to feature Japanese anime to be nominated for the award; the only other film featuring anime to be nominated is the Wachowski brothers' The Animatrix, a series of animated videos set in the fictional universe of The Matrix series. The film production company Walt Disney Television Animation has had nine of its films nominated for the award, more than any <b>other</b> <b>company,</b> and DisneyToon Studios, a division of Walt Disney Television Animation, has had eight of its films nominated for the award.|$|E
5|$|The Sa'iqa battalion's <b>other</b> <b>company</b> was occupying {{positions}} {{just north}} of Abu Sultan. Despite receiving the order to retreat during the night of October 17–18, the Egyptians were heavily outnumbered {{and the intensity of}} the fighting prevented them from withdrawing from their positions. Consequently, Heikal ordered artillery barrages on the area, including the Sa'iqa company's position, inadvertently leading to friendly-fire casualties. Soon after the firing subsided, Israeli paratroopers attacked at morning, and severe fighting, including hand-to-hand combat, ensued. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but the Sa'iqa held its position. At night, both companies retreated. The 73rd Battalion sustained 85 casualties, including 11 officers, throughout the fighting on October 18, and subsequently was withdrawn to be reconstituted.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of the}} {{southern}} territories' government during this time was in effect the Company's regional administrator. The first of these was appointed in 1890, soon after the Pioneer Column's establishment of Fort Salisbury, the capital, on 12 September that year. From 1899, the administrator governed {{as part of a}} ten-man Legislative Council, originally made up of himself, five other members nominated by the Company, and four elected by registered voters. The number of elected members rose gradually under Company rule until they numbered 13 in 1920, sitting alongside the administrator and six <b>other</b> <b>Company</b> officials in the 20-member Legislative Council. The Company's Royal Charter, which originally ran out in October 1914, was renewed for a further ten years in 1915.|$|E

In August 2003, Magic and Medicine by The Coral became the 700th album to top the UK chart—fewer than four years later, Not Too Late by Norah Jones became the 800th album to do so.|$|E
5|$|Villani and the Buonaccorsi {{had gained}} an unsavory {{reputation}} {{as early as}} 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for barratry {{for his part in}} building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, Avignon, and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite WalterVI of Brienne to become the next signor of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and <b>other</b> <b>company</b> partners for nearly a year.|$|E

5|$|Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, {{along with}} John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to {{establish}} their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue {{the development of a}} viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, REL publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with <b>other</b> <b>company</b> with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company, {{which was founded in}} 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas movie for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using Tweening instead of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined with the Computer Division of LucasFilm. Coincidentally, Steve Jobs, a main Apple shareholder and former CEO, worked under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his <b>other</b> <b>company</b> Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.|$|E
5|$|The United Fruit Company {{had been}} formed in 1899 by {{the merger of}} two large American corporations. The new company had major {{holdings}} of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter of bananas. By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million US dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions {{in the country that}} allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no <b>other</b> <b>company</b> would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually no taxes, which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic ocean, allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65 million US dollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government.|$|E
