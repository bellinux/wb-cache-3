500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in <b>our</b> <b>individual</b> responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear {{what she has to say}} and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E

500|$|Gandhi criticised {{as well as}} praised Christianity. He was {{critical}} of Christian missionary efforts in British India, because they mixed medical or education assistance with demands that the beneficiary convert to Christianity. According to Gandhi, this was not true [...] "service" [...] but one driven by ulterior motive of luring people into religious conversion and exploiting the economically or medically desperate. It {{did not lead to}} inner transformation or moral advance or to the Christian teaching of [...] "love", but was based on false one-sided criticisms of other religions, when Christian societies faced similar problems in South Africa and Europe. It led to the converted person hating his neighbours and others religions, it divided people rather than bringing them closer in compassion. According to Gandhi, [...] "no religious tradition could claim a monopoly over truth or salvation". Gandhi did not support laws to prohibit missionary activity, but demanded that Christians should first understand the message of Jesus, and then strive to live without stereotyping and misrepresenting other religions. According to Gandhi, the message of Jesus wasn't to humiliate and imperialistically rule over other people considering them inferior or second class or slaves, but that [...] "when the hungry are fed and peace comes to <b>our</b> <b>individual</b> and collective life, then Christ is born".|$|E

30|$|We {{implement}} a large-scale OLG model à la Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987) in which heterogeneous households by {{level of education}} endogenously choose consumption and the times spent {{in the market and}} in home production. Demographics, the educational attainment, and technological progress are exogenous. Firms are assumed to operate in perfectly competitive markets and produce under constant returns to scale. To account for the full effect of demography on the economy, we assume Spain to be a closed economy. Hence, changes in the population structure might have an impact on input prices. Moreover, to better capture the accumulation of capital over time, we consider the historical evolution of public pension expenditures. Thus, <b>our</b> <b>individuals</b> contribute a fraction of their labor income to the pension system and receive pension benefits when retired.|$|R

40|$|According to Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan [1651; 2008 (Touchstone, New York), English Ed], "the life of man [is] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short," and {{it would}} need {{powerful}} social institutions to establish social order. In reality, however, social cooperation can also arise spontaneously, based on local interactions rather than centralized control. The self-organization of cooperative behavior is particularly puzzling for social dilemmas related to sharing natural resources or creating common goods. Such situations are often described by the prisoner's dilemma. Here, we report the sudden outbreak of predominant cooperation in a noisy world dominated by selfishness and defection, when individuals imitate superior strategies and show success-driven migration. In <b>our</b> model, <b>individuals</b> are unrelated, and do not inherit behavioral traits. They defect or cooperate selfishly when the opportunity arises, {{and they do not}} know how often they will interact or have interacted with someone else. Moreover, <b>our</b> <b>individuals</b> have no reputation mechanism to form friendship networks, nor do they have the option of voluntary interaction or costly punishment. Therefore, the outbreak of prevailing cooperation, when directed motion is integrated in a game-theoretical model, is remarkable, particularly when random strategy mutations and random relocations challenge the formation and survival of cooperative clusters. Our results suggest that mobility is significant for the evolution of social order, and essential for its stabilization and maintenance...|$|R

Secondly, <b>our</b> <b>individuals</b> could have more than one output. This idea was inspired on the divide and conquer principle, a program is decomposed in subprograms, and so, we are expecting to make the original problem easier by breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems.

2500|$|In what {{is perhaps}} Layton's most {{complete}} articulation of his political philosophy, a foreword he wrote for Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom, he explains that, [...] "The idealist current holds that human society {{has the potential to}} achieve liberty when people work together to form a society in which equality means more than negative liberty, the absolute and protected right to run races against each other to determine winners. Idealists imagine a positive liberty that enables us to build together toward common objectives that fulfill and even surpass <b>our</b> <b>individual</b> goals."

It's almost as if ideas are pre-existing forms within this space... The landmasses that might exist in this mind space would be composed entirely of ideas, of concepts, that instead of continents and islands you might have large belief systems, philosophies, Marxism might be one, Judeo-Christian religions might make up another." [...] He subsequently believed that to navigate this space, magical systems like the tarot and the Qabalah would have to be used.|$|E

2500|$|Schopenhauer {{believed}} that Kant had ignored inner experience, as intuited through the will, {{which was the}} most important form of experience. [...] Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body. According to Schopenhauer, the entire world is the representation of a single Will, of which <b>our</b> <b>individual</b> wills are phenomena. In this way, Schopenhauer's metaphysics go beyond the limits that Kant had set, but do not go so far as the rationalist system-builders who preceded Kant. [...] Other important differences are Schopenhauer's rejection of eleven of Kant's twelve categories, arguing that only causality was important. [...] Matter and causality were both seen as a union of time and space and thus being equal to each other.|$|E
