5|$|Aarhus has {{the highest}} ratio <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> in Denmark, 14.8% of the population, outside the Copenhagen area. During the 1990s there was {{significant}} immigration from Turkey and in recent years, there has been high growth in the overall immigrant community, from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008. The majority <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and north Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} <b>of</b> <b>immigrants.</b> The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E

40|$|Some {{immigrant}} women face triple discrimination due to their, gender, ethnicity and immigrant status. The voices <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> women are absent from literature on immigration, furthermore the experience <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> women are omitted as prominent literature largely presents the male immigration experience. In addition, {{immigrant women}} have been pathologised {{as much of the}} psychological literature views them through a deficit perspective, affirming that immigrant women are at risk of psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. This research adopts a strengths perspective in order to investigate resilience <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> women in New Zealand. This research explores the communal and individual resilience <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> women using a feminist qualitative framework. The women were interviewed by means of semi-structured, in depth interviews and the data was analysed by means of thematic analysis in order to report the experiences, meanings and realities <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> women’s lives. The analysis revealed that collective roles such as the role of mother, “co-madre”, the benevolent woman, the breadwinner and the role of spirituality and religious beliefs contributed to the resilience <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> women. It was also found that individual constructs such as individual spirituality, the emergence into a contemporary paradigm that allowed women to break free from traditional life, as well as the establishment of identities of independence and empowerment aided women’s resilience. The findings highlighted the complex and contradictory nature <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> women’s stories presenting a challenge to the pathology discourse <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> women evident in the literature and within society...|$|R
40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on {{quantitative}} research carried out on a statistically representative sample of Italian primary schools with a high concentration <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students. Research data show that schools with a higher number <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students offer a greater number and {{a wider variety of}} intercultural initiatives. The presence <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students serves as an effective stimulus in enhancing intercultural approaches. Furthermore, the opinions of head teachers about the proposal of ‘separate classes’ for immigrant students and the proposed ‘limit of 30 % on the presence’ <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students are negative. These judgements do not change in a statistically significant manner in relation to concentration <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students: in particular, higher rates <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students are not related to more positive opinions. Continuing education on intercultural issues is widely adopted, mainly on behalf of teachers and less often on behalf of head teachers and other school personnel. Finally, activities by ‘linguistic facilitators’ and ‘linguistic and cultural mediators’ are not significantly related to a decrease in perceived concern regarding problematic situations...|$|R

5|$|Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended {{mainly from}} the Goan Catholic settlers, who {{migrated}} to Canara from Goa, a state north of Canara, between 1560 and 1763 in three major waves. The first wave <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> came to Mangalore to escape the trials of the Goa Inquisition of 1560. These migrants were welcomed by the native Bednore rulers of Canara for their agricultural skills. They were followed by a second major wave precipitated by the Portugal–Adil Shahi wars between 1570 and 1579. A final influx <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> arrived during the Portugal–Maratha wars in Goa during the late 17th and early 18thcenturies. According to Mangalorean historian Alan Machado Prabhu, the Mangalorean Catholics numbered about 58,000 {{by the time of}} the capture of Canara by Hyder Ali in 1765.|$|E
