50|$|Completing his story, {{the aged}} Homer muses about <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> winged <b>creatures,</b> {{how they could}} only be killed by a stake through the heart, and how they fear <b>the</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross. On <b>the</b> Isle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mists, Eurylochus - who was {{attacked}} by <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> in <b>the</b> cave - has transformed into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> and flies off freely into the world.|$|R

5|$|To {{implement}} the transformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> {{based on its}} alignment, Alex Evans developed an exporter program to export 3D Studio Max's models and animations, and Roberts created one to import them and apply them to the lion. Each version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> was then loaded, and interpolation code was written, {{as well as a}} blended animation between two similar ones. The system has a two-way blend: one for the alignment, and the other for how fat the creature is. As there {{was not going to be}} many creatures on one map, the team were able to use CPU resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single creature.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bleacher <b>Creatures</b> {{is their}} use of chants and songs. <b>The</b> most distinguished <b>of</b> these is <b>the</b> Roll Call, which is done at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> every home game.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{recreate}} the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, RSP studied natural phenomena such as volcanoes, instead of relying on archived footage of atomic blasts, and recreated the effects digitally. They also replaced the Sydney cityscape on the horizon with views of Nagasaki. The walking bear featured in the Yukon scenes was created with computer graphics by Weta Digital, while Make-Up Effects Group built a 12 foot tall animatronic bear, that was used for shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> dying after it {{had been hit by}} poisoned arrows fired by hunters.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the fictional}} {{archipelago}} of Earthsea, the story centers around a young mage named Ged, {{born in a}} village {{on the island of}} Gont.

5|$|The nuckelavee is {{a mythical}} sea {{creature}} that {{appears as a}} horse-like demon when it ventures onto land. Writer and folklorist Ernest Marwick considered it {{very similar to the}} Norwegian nøkk, the nuggle of the Shetlands and the kelpie. A unique and solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers, its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands. Islanders were terrified <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer. It was often found in the vicinity of a beach, but would never come ashore if it was raining.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of a large, unusual creature in Muskrat Lake {{has been the subject}} of anecdotes since 1916. The creature's name was originally cited as Hapyxelor, alternately spelled Hapaxelor, but changed simply to Mussie, short for The Monster of Muskrat Lake, sometime later. Humphries, a man from Cobden, was a well-known proponent of Mussie's existence. Around the area, many people's knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> come from his vehement, albeit inconsistent, tales of observing it once.|$|E
5|$|Bruce is {{kept under}} {{observation}} at a secret desert base, while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk's powers. David tries to recreate Bruce's failed experiment, {{but instead of}} turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to absorb any material he touches or energy to which he is exposed. He hands himself over to the military after telling Betty that he had murdered his wife {{in front of the}} child Bruce. Bruce has a nightmare about the event, leading to a more powerful transformation of the Hulk. Talbot is killed in an explosion created when he attempted to use a special syringe to gain a sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> The Hulk escapes the base and rampages across the desert to San Francisco, battling Army forces sent after him. When Betty calms Bruce into his human form, General Ross realizes the Hulk is uncontrollable and that Bruce should be executed.|$|E
5|$|Flight of the Hippogriff is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} for families, located adjacent to Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. The ride opened in 2000 as the Flying Unicorn. Similar to the Dragon Challenge, this ride was re-themed {{prior to the}} opening of the Wizarding World. The roller coaster's back-story is that Hogwarts's Care of Magical Creatures professor, Hagrid, is teaching young wizards to fly on a hippogriff (as Harry does in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) by using a wicker replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> A recreation of Hagrid's Hut is passed on the way for a lesson from Hagrid himself on how to properly approach a hippogriff.|$|E
50|$|All {{the work}} was hand done by the artist Adam Brandejs, with {{assistance}} from makeup artist Crystal Pallister for <b>the</b> coloring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b> <b>The</b> pictures show the actual 19 genpet units that display at art galleries. Genpets have been displayed at multiple Fine Art galleries and museum displays in both North America and Europe.|$|R

5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|Overseeing {{the visual}} effects {{department}} for New Moon was Susan MacLeod, {{who had previously}} worked with Weitz during the production of The Golden Compass. MacLeod enlisted Tippett Studio to create the computer generated wolves, while Prime Focus of Vancouver handled {{the effects of the}} vampires. To prepare for the aggressive task of making the wolves look real, Tippet artists studied wolf culture. They also were able to reflect leadership and human muscle size by adjusting certain features of the wolves, such as their fat and tallness. In February 2009, a group of artists were able to travel to Wolf Mountain Sanctuary, outside of Los Angeles, and see real wolves. The artists were able to observe the behavior of both the timber and arctic wolves, who ran in packs of three to five. The idea was to give everyone a deeper feeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> that they were creating.|$|E
5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a missing link. Carter was {{inspired}} to write the episode by an essay by E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was a throwback to the Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a previous project was used for the costume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The fur {{trade was}} key to <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian interior. In Europe, hats from beaver pelts had become especially fashionable and valuable, and <b>the</b> forests <b>of</b> North America were {{home to many}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b>|$|R
5|$|Boogeyman 2 {{was first}} {{announced}} in October 2006 {{due to the}} financial success of its predecessor with Jeff Betancourt, film editor of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, When a Stranger Calls and The Grudge 2, making his directorial debut and Brian Sieve attached as writer. The film was slated to start development in January 2007 in Los Angeles, California. It was produced by Ghost House Pictures, a film production company created by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert which specializes in creating horror films. Betancourt stated {{that he wanted to}} avoid usage of CGI as well as present a new take on the Boogeyman rather than rehashing the storyline of the first film; this led to a more grounded version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> in the film. As a result, and due to the film's low budget, he focused especially on the atmosphere and writing. Storyboards were used extensively to plan out the film and minimize wasted effort and resources by make-up artists on unused prosthetics; the limited budget meant that most effects could only be filmed once. The former hospital Linda Vista Community Hospital served as the primary filming location for the mental institution.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Corona Borealis {{was linked}} to the legend of Theseus and the minotaur. It was {{generally}} considered to represent a crown given by Dionysus to Ariadne, the daughter of Minos of Crete, after she had been abandoned by the Athenian prince Theseus. When she wore the crown at her marriage to Dionysus, he placed it in the heavens to commemorate their wedding. An alternate version has the besotted Dionysus give the crown to Ariadne, who in turn gives it to Theseus after he arrives in Crete to kill the minotaur that the Cretans have demanded tribute from Athens to feed. The hero uses the crown's light to escape the labyrinth after disposing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> and Dionysus later sets it in the heavens. The Latin author Hyginus linked it to a crown or wreath worn by Bacchus (Dionysus) to disguise his appearance when first approaching Mount Olympus and revealing himself to the gods, having been previously hidden as yet another child of Jupiter's trysts with a mortal, in this case Semele. Corona Borealis was one of the 48 constellations mentioned in the Almagest of classical astronomer Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> at a safe distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E
