5|$|I-695 turns south past MD 43 and {{interchanges}} with US 1 (Belair Road) {{south of}} White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) {{a short distance}} after US 1 in Rossville. This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully directional interchange where the carriageways of both routes crossed <b>over</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> onto the opposite side, then crossed <b>over</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again; {{at the site of}} each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional flyovers. In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did).|$|E
5|$|Male crickets {{establish}} their dominance <b>over</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by aggression. They start by lashing {{each other with}} their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, {{at the same time}} each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{dominance}} hierarchies {{among the}} females, and the females do not form coalitions. Males {{in the group}} are generally {{related to each other}} and thus tend to form strong affiliations, and only form dominance hierarchies during the breeding season. This is especially the case among males of the same age. Neither males nor females are dominant <b>over</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> an egalitarian social system that is unique to Central American squirrel monkeys. In South American species, either the females (S. boliviensis) or males (S. sciureus) are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable dominance hierarchies. Groups of Central American squirrel monkeys generally do not compete or fight with each other. Male Costa Rican squirrel monkeys are known to have very close bonds with each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{longevity}} of Spain's empire in South America {{can be explained}} partly by the successful administration of the colonies.

25|$|In late May and June 1945, {{when the}} Yugoslav army started {{emptying}} its prison camps in Slovenia, prisoners from the Teharje camp and the Stari Pisker prison were brought by trucks {{at night to}} the abandoned Barbara Pit mine in Huda Jama. Slovene Home Guard POWs that were singled out in Slovenj Gradec, Velenje, Kranj and Celje were {{the first ones to}} arrive on the last week of May. NDH troops were brought on foot. Once arrived, groups of 5-6 prisoners with hands tied with wire were stripped, ordered to kneel above a mine shaft and shot in the head, or were hit with a mine hammer or a pickaxe. In some cases, groups of 20-30 prisoners were tossed into a mine shaft, followed with hand grenades to finish off the victims. A number of prisoners were thrown in alive. Once the shafts were filled with corpses, the remaining prisoners were sent in the direction of Zagorje in northwest Croatia where they were killed, while the bodies were covered with lime to speed up decomposition. The mine was then enclosed with 400 cubic meters of concrete and wooden barriers. Those still conscious tried to climb <b>over</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to reach the hatch, but could not escape the sealed mine.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Raw, Owens entered a feud with Dolph Ziggler, {{with the two}} trading victories <b>over</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> on back to back episodes of Raw. On the February 15 episode of Raw, Owens won the Intercontinental Championship for a second time, defeating former champion Dean Ambrose, Stardust, Tyler Breeze and Ziggler in a fatal five-way match. At Fastlane, Owens successfully defended the Intercontinental Championship against Ziggler. On March 12, Owens defeated AJ Styles in a 30-Minute Iron Man match at a live event in Atlantic City, New Jersey to retain his championship. At WrestleMania 32, Owens defended the Intercontinental Championship in a ladder match against Sami Zayn, Dolph Ziggler, The Miz, Stardust, Sin Cara and Zack Ryder; Owens lost the title when Ryder won the match after Zayn took {{him out of the}} match. The night after WrestleMania on Raw, Owens faced AJ Styles, Chris Jericho, and the returning Cesaro in a fatal four-way match to determine the #1 contender for Roman Reigns' newly won WWE World Heavyweight Championship; however, Owens lost the match when Styles pinned Jericho. He resumed the feud with longtime rival Sami Zayn after he attacked him on Raw, which led to a match at Payback, where Owens defeated Zayn. At Extreme Rules, Owens faced Zayn, Cesaro and Miz in a fatal four-way match for the Intercontinental Championship, but failed to regain the title when Miz pinned Cesaro. Despite not winning the Intercontinental title, this match meant Owens had become the only other WWE wrestler, besides The Undertaker, to appear on every pay-per-view event in their debut year on the main roster. The following night on Raw, Owens defeated AJ Styles to qualify for the 2016 Money in the Bank ladder match, but he failed to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} {{showed that}} the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and {{that the way to}} improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide <b>over</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Lewis and Davidson had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so {{there is no need for}} a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.|$|E
