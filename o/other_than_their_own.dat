5|$|Ethnic {{heritage}} cooking, both Sephardic and Ashkenazi, {{has made}} a comeback with the growing acceptance of the heterogeneous society. Apart from home cooking, many ethnic foods are now available in street markets, supermarkets and restaurants, or are served at weddings and bar mitzvahs, and people increasingly eat foods from ethnic backgrounds <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Overlap and combinations of foods from different ethnic groups is becoming standard as a multi-ethnic food culture develops.|$|E
5|$|Ministers may be {{designated}} by the Prime Minister {{to be in charge}} of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Such Ministers were formerly known as Ministers without portfolio. The Prime Minister may retain any department or subject in his charge. Some Ministers are appointed as Second Ministers for portfolios <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> to assist the primary Minister in his or her duties. For instance, with effect from 1 April 2009 during the 11th Parliament, Lim Hwee Hua, who was a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, also held the posts of Second Minister for Finance and Second Minister for Transport.|$|E
5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> to nurse.|$|E

30|$|For educators, such {{as parents}} is {{important}} that babies are able to interact in close proximity just like Silvana and Fleur. This helps them build affective connections with <b>others</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> family. Even so, Silvana and Fleur are ten and nine months, they can teach us how each have {{a different way of}} affectively connecting, producing many different senses through actions and being able to reciprocate, engage and be aware of others. Affective gaze, touch, smiles are affective actions that enable young children for creating a close affective connections and should be valued as a form of being with others.|$|R
5|$|Balukas was {{not just}} talented at pool but was an {{all-around}} good athlete. Starting at age 16, and for two other years, she was {{invited to participate in}} ABC-TV's Superstars. Held in Rotonda, Florida, the event pitted championship athletes from one sport competing in sports <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> specialties, vying for cash prizes totaling $69,000. In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, she finished second taking titles in tennis and bowling where she won with 192 points. The winner that year was speed skater Anne Henning. Other competitors included, diver Micki King, tennis and golf pro Althea Gibson, Skier Kiki Cutter, sprinter Wyomia Tyus, and Tennis champ Martina Navratilova. The second place win was bittersweet for Balukas, because based on the award of prize money for placing at Superstars ($13,100), she lost amateur standing and was thereafter banned from competing in high school sports, also becoming no longer eligible for a college athletic scholarship.|$|E
5|$|On next day, B-24s of 2nd Bomb {{division}} of the Eighth Air Force bombed Gotha. JG 1 (under Oesau), JG 11 and JG 3 were sent to intercept. Due to high winds, the bombers were ahead of the escorts unprotected. Two groups of JG 1 met them before Gotha and 9 B-24s were claimed as a result. Since B-17s of 1st Bomb division also bombed Schweinfurt, other fighter units also arrived to intercept, eventually involving almost all the Western day fighter units of the Luftwaffe. This caused some confusion among pilots landing on airfields <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> This tested the directive of Schmid. Oesau led one of two such improvised formations successfully, with the other led by Hauptmann Borris of I./JG 26 Oesau added 4 fighters to his score between January and March 1944, and his tally stood at 117. On 8 May 1944 he claimed a Thunderbolt shot down over Hanover; his last kill.|$|E

25|$|Medical tourism {{refers to}} people {{traveling}} {{to a country}} <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> to obtain medical treatment. In the past this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home. However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower priced medical treatments. The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or illegal in the home country.|$|E
25|$|The White Horse Sessions {{proved to}} be the last Nightnoise album. Cunningham left the band {{following}} its release, and was replaced by Irish fiddler John Fitzpatrick. The group recorded new material—both original compositions and covers of classic songs—but they were all made for albums <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Nightnoise officially disbanded towards the end of 1997.

25|$|The initial view, {{reported}} by Horace Smith-Dorrien, {{was that the}} British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough and that the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10–12 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution. Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest {{in a letter to}} his father.|$|E
25|$|The specialists {{fell into}} three categories. First there were species describers, then specialists in species {{recognition}} and then specialists in gross taxonomy. There were however considerable degrees of overlap. Also then, as now, few could entirely resist {{the lure of}} groups <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> and this was especially true of those in small countries where they were the sole 'expert', and many famous specialists in one order also worked on others. Hence, for instance, many works which began as butterfly faunas were completed as general regional works, often collaboratively.|$|E

25|$|The {{discrimination}} {{enforced by}} the hukou system became particularly onerous in the 1980s after {{hundreds of millions of}} migrant workers were forced out of state corporations, co-operatives and other institutions. Attempts by workers classified as rural to move to urban centers were tightly controlled by the Chinese bureaucracy, which enforced its control by denying access to essential goods and services such as grain rations, housing, and health care, and by regularly closing down migrant workers' private schools. The hukou system also enforced pass laws similar to those in South Africa. Rural workers required six passes to work in provinces <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> and periodic police raids rounded up those without permits, placed them in detention centers, and deported them. As in South Africa, the restrictions placed on the mobility of migrant workers were pervasive, and transient workers were forced to live a precarious existence in company dormitories or shanty towns, suffering abusive consequences. Anita Chan comments further that China's household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in apartheid South Africa, which were designed to regulate the supply of cheap labor.|$|E
25|$|The {{protected}} mode of the 80286 was not utilized until {{many years after}} its release, {{in part because of}} the high cost of adding extended memory to a PC, but also because of the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs. For example, in 1986 the only program that made use of it was VDISK, a RAM disk driver included with PC DOS 3.0 and 3.1. A DOS could utilize the additional RAM available in {{protected mode}} (extended memory) either via a BIOS call (INT 15h, AH=87h), as a RAM disk, or as emulation of expanded memory. The difficulty lay in the incompatibility of older real-mode DOS programs with protected mode. They simply could not natively run in this new mode without significant modification. In protected mode, memory management and interrupt handling were done differently than in real mode. In addition, DOS programs typically would directly access data and code segments that did not belong to them, as real mode allowed them to do without restriction; in contrast, the design intent of protected mode was to prevent programs from accessing any segments <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> unless special access was explicitly allowed. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode environment that allowed all programs access to all segments (by putting all segment descriptors into the GDT and assigning them all the same privilege level), this undermined nearly all of the advantages of protected mode except the extended (24-bit) address space. The choice that OS developers faced was either to start from scratch and create an OS that would not run the vast majority of the old programs, or to come up with a version of DOS that was slow and ugly (i.e., ugly from an internal technical viewpoint) but would still run a majority of the old programs. Protected mode also did not provide a significant enough performance advantage over the 8086-compatible real mode to justify supporting its capabilities; actually, except for task switches when multitasking, it actually yielded only a performance disadvantage, by slowing down many instructions through a litany of added privilege checks. In protected mode, registers were still 16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64kB segments, just like in real mode.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s BSA {{developed}} its Youth Protection program, {{to educate}} youth, leaders and {{parents about the}} problem as a whole, and to introduce barriers to sexual abuse of children using the Scout program to reach victims. [...] "Two deep" [...] leadership dictates that no adult member [...] can be alone with any youth member (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> child). [...] Before joining, youth must discuss with their parents a pamphlet on sexual abuse and adults must take youth protection training and, since 2003, new adult members must pass a criminal background check (adults who were already members had to pass a background check by 2008). [...] The Youth Protection Plan from the organization is linked to in a CDC report on such programs.|$|E

50|$|Tula {{was aware}} of the {{revolution}} that had resulted in freedom for the enslaved in Haiti. Tula argued that, since the Netherlands were now captured by the French, they should get their freedom as well. The three demands of Tula were: an end to collective punishment, an end to labor on Sunday, and the freedom to buy clothes and goods from <b>others</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> masters. There were two attempts at negotiating with the enslaved. The first one was carried out by Father Schink. When Father Schink spoke with Tula, he refused to accept anything less than freedom. Schink reported back to Baron Westerholt, and the latter decided to get more reinforcements and attack. He attempted a last negotiation, but when he was turned down by the rebels, he ordered that any slave with a weapon be shot. In the ensuing fight, the rebels were defeated. Ten to twenty of them were killed, and the rest escaped.|$|R

In January 1876 the LNWR informed the ACR that they could no longer lend the engine in use, {{as a result}} of the recent court case. Three choices were suggested by the LNWR: that the line be bought outright, that a proper working arrangement be made, or that the ACR [...] "might buy the engine and carriages now on the line".

500|$|Hellenic Nomarchy proclaims {{that society}} must {{be governed by}} laws {{established}} by common agreement {{of the people and}} that the establishment and preservation of liberty requires a Nomarchic form of government. Although this term was uncommon in the Greek literature of that time, it is used as an alternative term of democracy. The intent of Hellenic Nomarchy was to show that the sole power and authority of the [...] "law" [...] (...) could only be established through democracy. In this spirit, the author was following the principles stressed by ancient Greek literature and philosophy concerning the subject. The work also argues that Greeks should not have any leader <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> laws. This principle follows from the works of Rigas Feraios, who stressed in his Revolutionary Manifesto, some years before, that law is the supreme master of men. Feraios also praised democracy as the most successful system of government.|$|E
500|$|The {{dispute over}} the {{authenticity}} of the biblical edicts has prompted interest in this passage from the Cyrus Cylinder, specifically concerning the question of whether it indicates that Cyrus had a general policy of repatriating subject peoples and restoring their sanctuaries. The text of the Cylinder is very specific, listing places in Mesopotamia and the neighboring regions. It does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on the return of Babylonian deities to their own home cities. It emphasises the re-establishment of local religious norms, reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus – a theme that Amélie Kuhrt describes as [...] "a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus." [...] She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions {{and that there was no}} general policy as such. Lester L. Grabbe, a historian of early Judaism, has written that [...] "the religious policy of the Persians was not that different from the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them" [...] in tolerating – but not promoting – local cults, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> gods.|$|E
