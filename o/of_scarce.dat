5|$|Construction in Norway {{has always}} been {{characterized}} {{by the need to}} shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and to make the most <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials.|$|E
5|$|Environmental concerns. In {{addition}} to concerns about {{air and water}} pollution, Norwegian architectural design has also emphasized integration with the natural landscape. More recently, architects have also worked with engineers {{to make the most}} out <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> resources, e.g., energy, water, etc.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} {{important}} for its dragonfly communities, with a strong population <b>of</b> <b>Scarce</b> Chaser (found in only six other areas in England), together with a strong population of White-legged Damselfly. Red-eyed Damselfly is also found. The river is also important for aquatic plants, including Loddon Pondweed.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|The SSSI is {{economically}} {{important to}} the area because of the tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from {{the large numbers of}} visitors. Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat {{is likely to be the}} long-term solution, and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> habitats at the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> and valuable nutrients.|$|E

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> resources.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui dynasty, Yang, the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane. The main reason was the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Coupled with natural disasters, the conscription of more and more men for {{the war and the}} hoarding <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> grain reserves for the army's needs increased provincial discontent. As a result, from 611 on, rural revolts broke out across the empire, and with the Emperor's prestige and legitimacy diminished by military failure, ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and only as unrest spread within the empire and the powerful Eastern Turks turned hostile, did he realize the gravity of the situation: in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, {{with the goal of}} supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Because of the Helium Control Act (1927), which banned the export <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, the Hindenburg, like all German Zeppelins, was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.|$|E

40|$|Rationing occurs if {{the demand}} for a certain good exceeds its supply. In such {{situations}} a rationing method has to be specified {{in order to determine}} the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>scarce</b> good to the agents. Moulin (2000) characterized rationing methods in both the discrete and the continuous framework. In the present paper the discrete model and stochastic rationing methods will also be considered. We characterize a stochastic rationing method, which allocates the units <b>of</b> the <b>scarce</b> supply randomly to the individuals...|$|R

5|$|The shingle ridge {{that protects}} the reserve from the sea and extends to Blakeney Point attracts biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift, bird's foot trefoil and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat. In the damper areas, sea wormwood, sea {{lavender}} and scrubby sea-blite also thrive. The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other saltmarsh specialists. The upper saltmarsh has a number <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

25|$|Another of Wieser's {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} Economics is the Alternative Cost Theory (now called the Opportunity Cost Theory), {{which had been}} ignored by Alfred Marshall and British economists.

25|$|While the Sandinistas {{encouraged}} grassroots pluralism, {{they were}} perhaps less enthusiastic about national elections. They argued that popular support was {{expressed in the}} insurrection and that further appeals to popular support {{would be a waste}} <b>of</b> <b>scarce</b> resources. International pressure and domestic opposition eventually pressed the government toward a national election. Tomás Borge warned that the elections were a concession, an act of generosity and of political necessity. On the other hand, the Sandinistas had little to fear from the election given the advantages of incumbency and the restrictions on the opposition, and they hoped to discredit the armed efforts to overthrow them.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} Hecksher-Ohlin model {{predicts that}} trade liberalization {{leads to a}} decline in the rate of return <b>of</b> the <b>scarce</b> factor <b>of</b> production. However, the empirical evidence of the falling labor share in some developing countries contrasts with the theory. We show that if a simple change in technology is introduced into the standard model, conditions exist for the rate of return <b>of</b> the <b>scarce</b> factor <b>of</b> production to increase. In particular, the price of the exported good and the amount of capital the country owns can serve as determinants whether the rate of return of the abundant factor will increase...|$|R
