Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines.

5|$|After the battle, St Vincent and Collingwood joined Vanguard in the 4th BS.

The Admiralty order meant that the Grand Fleet spent far less time at sea. In late February 1917, the 4th BS conducted tactical exercises for a few days. In January 1918, Collingwood and some of the older dreadnoughts cruised off the coast of Norway for several days, possibly to provide distant cover for a convoy to Norway. Along {{with the rest of the}} Grand Fleet, she sortied on the afternoon of 23 April when radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea, after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British to be caught and no shots were fired.

25|$|The {{separation}} of tithed produce from untithed produce was also subject to regulation. The individual(s) separating {{one from the}} other had to be ritually clean, and had to include the best produce in the tithe if a kohen (priest) lived nearby. During the act of separation, the produce was not permitted to be counted out to determine which fell under the tithe, nor to be weighed for that purpose, nor to be measured for the same reason, but instead the proportion that was to become the tithe had to be guessed at. In certain situations, such as when tithed produce became mixed with non-tithed produce (<b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> uncertainty as to whether it had), the tithed produce had to be destroyed. Anyone who made mistakes in the {{separation of}} tithed produce, and anyone who consumed any of the tithe, was required to pay compensation as a guilt offering.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a system for {{checking}} for copying errors, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a more rapid rate of variation than nuclear DNA. This 20-fold higher mutation rate allows mtDNA to be used for more accurate tracing of maternal ancestry. Studies of mtDNA in populations have allowed ancient migration paths to be traced, such as the migration of Native Americans from Siberia or Polynesians from southeastern Asia. It has also been used to show that there is no trace of Neanderthal DNA in the European gene mixture inherited through purely maternal lineage. Due to the restrictive all or none manner of mtDNA inheritance, this result (no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA) would be likely unless there were a large percentage of Neanderthal ancestry, <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> strong positive selection for that mtDNA (for example, going back 5 generations, only 1 of your 32 ancestors contributed to your mtDNA, so if one of these 32 was pure Neanderthal you would expect that ~3% of your autosomal DNA would be of Neanderthal origin, yet you would have a ~97% chance to have no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA).|$|E

Jacques cried when her ex-husband won the award, and divulged to her son that she [...] "wasn't crying out of professional resentment or even envy about Joan Le Mesurier... but from an unhappiness that, through her own actions, she lost John <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> now no-one with whom to spend her life".|$|E

500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here <b>or</b> <b>there.</b> <b>Was</b> it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{exception}} can {{be found}} in the Cart judgment. Having affirmed the position taken in Anisminic, Lord Dyson then qualified his statement by emphasizing that [...] "the scope of judicial review should be no more (as well as no less) than is proportionate and necessary for the maintaining of the rule of law". On the facts of the case, he found it was neither proportionate nor necessary for the maintenance of the rule of law to require unrestricted judicial review. By enacting the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, Parliament had rationalized the system of administrative tribunals and had created the Upper Tribunal to hear appeals from lower tribunals, thus avoiding the ordinary courts from being overwhelmed by judicial review applications. As the system of tribunals provided ample opportunity for the correction of errors of law, this substantive policy reason precluded the need for all decisions of the Upper Tribunal to be subject to judicial review. Thus, judicial review would only be permitted from an Upper Tribunal decision if it would [...] "raise some important point of principle or practice" [...] <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> [...] "some other compelling reason".|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} for {{leave to appeal}} are laid out in Section 1(4). No conditions attach to an appeal where all parties consent, but when {{the permission of the}} High Court is sought, the judge may only grant leave if he [...] "considers that...the question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights of one or more parties to the arbitration agreement". Under Sections 1(5) and 1(6), the High Court may ask for additional reasons as to why the arbitrator reached the decision that he did, but only if one of the parties gave notice to the arbitrator that reasons would be required, <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> [...] "some special reason why such a notice was not given". In Universal Petroleum Co v Handels und Transport GmbH, the Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of Sections 1(4) and 1(5). The dispute came from a highly detailed [...] "Schedule of Further Reasons" [...] ordered by the High Court because the judge felt that there was an ambiguous element in the reasons given. The appellate judges found that Section 1(5) required judges to order further reasons only to deal with points of law arising from the award. Material ambiguity was [...] "inadmissible and irrelevant for the purpose of the exercise of any jurisdiction under section 1 of the Act".|$|E
