5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for the}} viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered {{techniques}} <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> {{movement and}} editing that influenced later films. New {{techniques such as}} telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of National Socialist ideals.|$|E
5|$|There {{are mainly}} three types <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> systems. In fixed camera systems, the camera {{does not move}} at all and the system {{displays}} the player's character in a succession of still shots. Tracking cameras, on the other hand, follow the character's movements. Finally, interactive camera systems are partially automated and allow the player to directly change the view. To implement camera systems, video game developers use techniques such as constraint solvers, artificial intelligence scripts, or autonomous agents.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that the three different types <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> have their own sets of characteristics. Here, we compare the performance of these types <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> for single-molecule nanoscopy.|$|R

5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> trickery.|$|E
5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of the}} camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under the same set of views. An early example of this kind <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> system can be seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
40|$|Calculation of {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> {{required}} to capture the scene is an essential problem in a practical light field based free viewpoint video (FVV) system. Existing methods calculate the Nyquist rate by assuming a band-limited signal and perfect reconstruction of an arbitrary view using linear interpolation, which often results in an impractically high number <b>of</b> <b>cameras.</b> This paper proposes a new method based {{on the concept of}} effective sampling density (ESD). It is demonstrated that there is a trade-off between the depth information accuracy, the required number <b>of</b> <b>cameras,</b> and the desired rendering quality, which could be exploited to minimize the number <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> for a given objective. Theoretical and numerical results show that the resulting number <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> is significantly lower than what was reported in other studies with only a few percent reduction in the output PSNR. Moreover, it is shown that the methods proposed in those studies are special cases of the one presented in this paper...|$|R

5|$|Key issues include {{how much}} footage was shot; {{that it was}} blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the {{cameraman}} stopped filming at that point. Despite the presence <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c.17minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film {{of the death of}} the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{thought that}} {{work on a}} boat might be photogenic, but, having no experience, {{could not get a}} job on one. He was {{eventually}} accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue <b>of</b> <b>Camera</b> Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{thought that}} the {{character}} would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a British accent and had high expectations for the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding efficient locations <b>of</b> surveillance <b>cameras,</b> where we distinguish between two different problems. In the first, the whole area must be monitored and the number <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> should be as small as possible. In the second, {{the goal is to}} maximize the monitored area for a fixed number <b>of</b> <b>cameras.</b> In both <b>of</b> these problems, restrictions on the ability <b>of</b> the <b>cameras,</b> like limited depth of view or range of vision are taken into account. We present solution approaches for these problems and report on results of their implementations applied to an authentic problem. We also consider a bicriteria problem with two objectives: maximizing the monitored area and minimizing the number <b>of</b> <b>cameras,</b> and solve it for our study case...|$|R
40|$|In a free {{viewpoint}} video system, {{the scene}} is captured by a number <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> {{and it would be}} desirable to optimize the configuration <b>of</b> <b>cameras,</b> such as their location or orientation, to improve the rendering quality. This paper introduces a mathematical representation of the multi-camera geometry, called the correspondence field (CF), which can be used to quantify the suitability <b>of</b> a <b>camera</b> configuration for a given arrangement of objects in the scene. The correspondence field describes the spatial topology of the intersecting rays <b>of</b> <b>cameras,</b> arranged as a number of layers or surfaces in the field <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>cameras.</b> The paper derives the topology of CF for certain camera arrangements and analyzes the impact <b>of</b> changes in <b>camera</b> location or orientation on this topology. It demonstrates that CF can be used to find the optimum camera configuration for a given objective. It also presents simulation results of this method using our light field simulator...|$|R
40|$|In {{a network}} <b>of</b> <b>cameras,</b> it is {{important}} that the right subset <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> takes care <b>of</b> the right task. In this work, we describe a general framework to evaluate the contribution <b>of</b> subsets <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> to a task. Each task is the observation of an event of interest and consists of assessing the validity of a set <b>of</b> hypotheses. All <b>cameras</b> gather evidence for those hypotheses. The evidence from different cameras is fused by using the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. After combining the evidence for a set <b>of</b> <b>cameras,</b> the remaining uncertainty about a set of hypotheses, allows us to identify how well a certain camera subset is suited for a certain task. Taking into account these subset contribution values, we can determine in an efficient way the set of subset-task assignments that yields the best overall task performance...|$|R
5|$|Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) {{was hired}} for the film, having {{previously}} worked on Alien 3. ADI founders Tom Woodruff, Jr. and Alec Gillis also had {{experience working with}} Stan Winston on Aliens. ADI based their designs and modifications of the Alien creatures on the film's script, which included the creatures having pointed tails for swimming, making their head domes and chins more pointed, and establishing them to appear more vicious using techniques <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> angles and shot duration. After receiving the director's approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models.|$|E
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E
5|$|While the {{majority}} of the meerkats filmed were partially habituated, the cinematographers had to move carefully to avoid scaring the animals. The crew used radios to keep in contact with one another as they followed the meerkat groups around. Although the park normally prohibits low-flying aircraft, the production crew was given permission to film for three days using a low-flying helicopter. Mounted to its front underside was a new type <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> that was not affected by the shaking of the helicopter. Full-color scenes depicting the birth of meerkat pups were obtained by filming captive meerkats at the Cotswold Wildlife Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The climatic vault heist {{required}} {{four weeks}} of preparation with every scene and camera angle determined in advance. The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming. The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing {{the capabilities of the}} prop vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a Porsche Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower of sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|E
