5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and <b>orders</b> for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones {{and a few other}} employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the <b>orders</b> could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of <b>orders</b> was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone <b>orders</b> could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle {{the tens of thousands of}} <b>orders.</b> Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E

5|$|There are {{sections}} of the Temple known as <b>Orders,</b> each of which focus on a particular theme, for instance ancient Egypt, Norse culture, Tantric Hinduism, or vampirism. Others focus on a particular skill, for instance the Order of Uart focuses on the visual arts and the Order of Taliesin on music. <b>Orders</b> {{can be understood as}} schools of different aspects of magic providing different paths of initiation. <b>Orders</b> are led by grand masters, who will usually be the founder of the order. In longer-lived <b>orders</b> the founder may have a successive grand master. <b>Orders</b> are founded by members of the fourth degree. When members reaches the second degree of initiation, they are expected to join an order of their own choosing.
