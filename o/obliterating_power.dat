40|$|Stakeholder-collaboration is {{a process}} for {{collaborative}} learning among stakeholders within the agri-food system. The goal {{of this process is}} to facilitate stakeholder consensus building and problem solving. This is motivated by the fact that collaborative learning among agri-food stakeholders is an important condition for improvements in food production. Stakeholder-collaboration strives towards certain kinds of learning which includes learning about factual matters, as well as norms and values which are prevalent in agri- food production. It has, however, proved hard to achieve good results from this process in practical application. The overall aim of this thesis is to develop a better understanding of two aspects of stakeholder-collaboration, namely learning and power, and how they relate to one another. The thesis is based upon two case studies of agri-food stakeholders from two different regions in Sweden. Both apply a two step method. In the first step, an action research oriented approach is used to experience stakeholder-collaboration in a real life setting. The second includes a qualitative analysis of learning and power and is inspired by a constructionist perspective on learning, critical power analysis and Habermas´ communication theory. One conclusion that can be drawn from this work is that the way in which stakeholder-collaboration is designed has consequences for how the participants perceive the process and how they choose to respond. In this thesis, both the design of the process and the responses given to it, are conceptualized as an exercise of power since they affect the participants´ possibilities for learning. Power and learning are understood as reciprocal relationships between the participating stakeholders. Therefore, instead of trying to <b>obliterate</b> <b>power</b> in order to facilitate learning, stakeholdercollaboration should be designed {{in a way that makes}} the exercise of power among stakeholders productive and not restricting...|$|R

50|$|A tornado {{touched down}} just {{northeast}} of Carmi in White County, Illinois at 03:54 UTC on March 1 (9:54 p.m. CST), snapping {{the trunks of}} hardwood trees at EF1 strength. It rapidly intensified to EF3 strength farther to the east as it crossed Illinois Route 1, completely destroying a single-wide mobile home and rolling four to five vehicles. A residence was moved about 3 ft off its foundation, with a majority of its second floor swept away, a four-wheeler flipped upside down, a refrigerator tossed atop the rubble, and an associated garage completely destroyed. A small brick outbuilding nearby was severely damaged, a double-wide mobile home was <b>obliterated</b> and several <b>power</b> poles were snapped in this area as well. The tornado then crossed 1675 East Street and North 1750 East Street, narrowly missing the city of Crossville, Illinois to the south. EF3 damage was again inflicted to a residence that sustained major damage to its structure, had its garage destroyed, and had a vehicle rolled about 30 yd. Just past 1800 East Street, one small barn storing farm equipment was decimated while a larger outbuilding had its main support beams break loose from the concrete pads, forcing the roof beams to buckle. Damage to these structures was rated EF2. Another large barn nearby was severely damaged and a small brick outbuilding was destroyed, with damage to those structures rated EF1.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first panoramic study of minkan (citizen publications) in China from the 1950 s until the 1980 s. The purpose {{of doing so}} is to recover the thoughts and practice <b>obliterated</b> by state <b>power</b> by examining unofficial magazines as having social, political and historical functions. Moreover, it attempts to examine this recent history {{against the backdrop of}} the much older history of Chinese print culture and its renaissance. The study of unofficial magazine in post- 1949 China contributes to the recovery of a lost past resistance. It is an exercise in remembering in the context of marginalisation and exclusion by official history. Furthermore, it examines the reconstruction of the narrative of Chinese modern history, and the building up of a civil society that is independent of both the state elite and the new apolitical bourgeoisie in Mainland China. Minkan in this thesis has multiple connotations: as unofficial magazine, as civic expression, and as a way of resistance. The media of minkan take in various formats: public squares, posters, walls, book series and so on. By researching the lifespan of a minkan I attempt to make transparent both the idea and the concrete dynamics of its practice. Drawing on the theories of civil society and the public sphere, this study explores the creative practice of minkan as a revival of the concept of ‘moveable words’ in the Chinese print tradition.

5000|$|It {{is later}} {{revealed}} that M.M. stands for Mei Mishima, daughter of Souichiro Mishima, founder of Mishima Electronics. Ten years ago Mei, her father, and her twin sister Mai came to Earth in a spaceship. One day {{when her father}} was busy working Mei escaped from the spaceship to go sightseeing on Earth, only to get lost. Sanpeita and his friend, Izumi Makihara, then helped her get back home, and from there the three played together every day. One day, however, when Mei got lost inside the spaceship she discovered girls who looked exactly like her (and by extension her twin sister), asleep inside a row of test tubes. Mai then appeared, revealing that she had known about this and her father's projects, one of which included the [...] "Nano Ball", a seed that when given time to germinate inside a host, {{was a source of}} limitless power. When their father arrives and warns them of the danger, Mai tells him that she has no intentions of stopping what he started, and that she plans to use the power of the Nano Ball to create a perfect world for her and her sister. Mai then hands the Nano Ball to Mei, despite their father's attempts to stop her, and Mei's memories, including all of her memories of playing with Sanpeita and Izumi, are <b>obliterated</b> by the <b>power</b> of the Nano Ball. Mei escapes, and their father, who has been mortally wounded by the Nano Ball, gives her Kemeko, and sends her off into space, telling her to forgive Mai. Since then Mei lived as one with Kemeko, dedicating her life to protecting Sanpeita and the Nano Ball inside him. However, living with him is a constant reminder of what she lost, and she is devastated by not being able to recall any of the memories with Sanpeita that she kept in her journal.|$|R
40|$|A {{federal court}} {{decision}} {{has opened up}} a new front {{in the debate over}} industrial relations law, writes GEORGE WILLIAMS JUSTICE Jeffrey Spender of the Federal Court has raised major questions about who regulates workplace relations in Australia. Recently he found that the Etheridge Shire Council in far north Queensland falls under state and not federal law. This affects both the WorkChoices law still in force and Kevin Rudd’s replacement system, to be introduced into Parliament {{in the second half of}} this year. At stake are the rights and entitlements of thousands of employers and their employees. The Howard government won the first round in the battle with the states when the High Court upheld the WorkChoices law in 2006. The court found that the federal parliament can regulate industrial matters under the corporations power in section 51 of the Constitution. But only three types of “constitutional corporations” - foreign, trading and financial corporations - can be covered by federal law. The Rudd Government proposes to use this same power to enact a replacement for WorkChoices. But Spender has opened up a new front in the debate, exposing an unresolved legal question of central importance to local government and hundreds of other organisations in areas such as education, health and child care. While the High Court upheld WorkChoices, it was not asked to provide further guidance on when an organisation is a constitutional corporation. The result is that, although WorkChoices was valid, we did not know how far it extends. Earlier High Court decisions dealt with this question without setting out an easily applied test. The court said that a company is a trading corporation when it has “substantial trading activities,” that is, when its trading activities “form a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation. ” Most Australian businesses that make money through buying and selling goods and services clearly fall within this definition. This is why the Howard government based WorkChoices on the corporations power and why Justice Ian Callinan in dissent in the High Court warned, “The reach of the corporations power, as validated by the majority, has the capacity to <b>obliterate</b> <b>powers</b> of the state hitherto unquestioned. ” Despite this, it is unclear whether many organisations employing thousands of workers fall under federal law. These bodies are often non-profit corporations involved only incidentally in trade and commerce. Many private schools, for example, fit into this category. Even where they have education and not revenue as their primary goal, they can still be a constitutional corporation if they do enough trading, such as through collecting school fees and selling memorabilia. The High Court’s “substantial trading activities” approach was manageable when being a constitutional corporation was only of occasional relevance, such as in regard to the coverage of federal trade practices law. It is now problematic because the outcome of the test is the decisive factor for thousands of businesses in whether they must comply with federal or state law, two very different paths of workplace regulation. The test can be notoriously difficult to apply. Judges tend to form an instinctive judgment about whether the business of a corporation is enough to make it a constitutional corporation. The High Court has not been more precise - by stating a required dollar amount or percentage of the body’s turnover, for example -nor is it clear that it could do this. The result is that it cannot be said with certainty whether bodies such as local councils are covered by federal law until this is decided by a court. The Federal Court did this in finding that the Etheridge council is not a constitutional corporation. Even then, this might be overruled on appeal by the Full Federal Court or the High Court. This could take many months or years to resolve. The picture is further complicated because the test must be applied to each individual employer and not to an industry as a whole. This makes it likely that some large local authorities, such as the Brisbane City Council, are covered by federal law while others such as the Etheridge council are not. A particular council might even be covered in one year when it does a lot of trading, but not in a following year if its business changes. Bodies with fluctuating trading activities might drift in and out of federal coverage. Many organisations are operating with considerable uncertainty. They face the high cost of legal advice to determine which law they should follow as well as the anxiety that follows from lawyers often being unable to give a definitive answer without the case being taken to court. If the body makes a choice of law and gets it wrong, it will end up with a legal mess. Some lower courts have found that universities or charities such as the Red Cross or RSPCA are trading corporations and are covered by federal law. But these judgments can still be overruled by the High Court. That court might over the next few years offset its wide reading in the WorkChoices case of what can be regulated under the corporations power with a more restrictive approach as to which bodies fall under the power. It might more strictly apply its substantial trading activities test or even jettison the test entirely in favour of a new approach based on the purpose for which an organisation was formed. There were hints of this in argument before the High Court in the WorkChoices case. Justice Kenneth Hayne kept coming back to the whole question of defining a trading corporation by its activities. When the Constitution was drawn up in the 1890 s there was no suggestion that a local council or a religious, charitable or educational corporation would be classed as a trading corporation. If the High Court changes direction, universities and other bodies that believe they fall under federal law could be in for a rude shock. The unnecessary costs of this federal-state conflict need to be avoided. There are two ways to do so. One is for the Commonwealth to unilaterally withdraw from coverage of organisations whose status as a constitutional corporation is uncertain. The other, better option is to bring about a truly national system of workplace relations. It is unlikely the states will cede their powers to the Commonwealth, meaning that a national system must be founded upon cooperation. I authored a report earlier this year for NSW on how this might be achieved, but the negotiations between governments have yet to produce results. Until they do, the uncertain position of local government bodies and many other employers will continue. • George Williams is the Anthony Mason Professor at the University of New South Wales and a visiting fellow at the ANU College of Law.

40|$|The federal government’s Work Choices laws {{could affect}} many {{thousands}} more workers in education, health and child care, writes George Williams QUEENSLAND {{is in the}} middle of a legal tug of war. The issue is whether local councils fall under Work Choices or the state industrial system. While Workplace Relations Minister Joe Hockey has written to councils urging them to sign up to Work Choices, this is being fiercely resisted by the Queensland government and the Australian Workers Union. The battle has opened up a new front in the political debate over Work Choices. It has also exposed an unresolved legal question of central importance to local government around Australia and to hundreds of other organisations in areas such as education, health and child care. The Work Choices law broke with past practice in being based not on the Commonwealth’s power over conciliation and arbitration but on its power over corporations. The corporations power in section 51 of the constitution allows the federal parliament to make laws for “foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. ” Only these three types of “constitutional corporation” can be regulated, the most common of which are trading corporations. Late last year the Howard government won a clear victory when a majority of the High Court upheld the Work Choices legislation. The court found that the corporations power can be used to regulate the industrial conditions of people working for a constitutional corporation. However, the judges were not asked to decide, and carefully avoided in their judgments, the question of when an organisation is a constitutional corporation. The result is that, although we know Work Choices is valid, we do not know how far it extends. Earlier High Court decisions dealt with this question without setting out an easy to apply test. The court said that an incorporated body is a trading corporation when it has “substantial trading activities,” that is, when its trading activities “form a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation. ” Most Australian businesses formed to make money through buying and selling goods and services clearly fall within this definition. This is why the Howard government based Work Choices on the corporations power and why Justice Callinan in dissent in the High Court warned: “The reach of the corporations power, as validated by the majority, has the capacity to <b>obliterate</b> <b>powers</b> of the state hitherto unquestioned. ” Despite this, it is unclear whether many other organisations employing thousands of workers fall under Work Choices. These bodies that lie at the edge of the federal scheme are often non-profit corporations that are involved only incidentally in trade and commerce. Many private schools, for example, fit into this category. Even where they have education and not profit as their primary goal, they can still be a constitutional corporation if they do enough trading, such as through collecting school fees and selling memorabilia. In 1979 a majority of the High Court held that the Western Australian National Football League was a trading corporation because it had major commercial activities. These included hundreds of thousands of dollars generated by gate receipts, broadcasting and television rights and promotion, sponsorship and advertising. The case showed how an organisation created to promote sport, art, education or good health, or engaged in charitable work or government or providing community services like child care can be a trading corporation. The difficulty lies in working out just when this is the case. The High Court’s “substantial trading activities” approach was manageable when being a constitutional corporation was only of occasional relevance, such as in regard to the coverage of federal trade practices law. It is now problematic because the outcome of the test is the decisive factor for thousands of businesses in whether they must comply with Work Choices or a state regime, two radically different paths of workplace regulation. The “substantial trading activities” test can be notoriously difficult to apply. Judges tend to form a largely instinctive judgment about whether the business of a corporation is substantial enough to make them a constitutional corporation. The High Court has not been more precise, such as by stating a required dollar amount or percentage of the body’s turnover, nor is it clear it could do this given the many forms of Australian business. The result is that it cannot be said with certainty whether a range of bodies, like local councils, are covered by Work Choices until this is specifically addressed by a court decision. This can take months or, with appeals, even years in each case. The picture is further complicated because the “substantial trading activities” test must be applied to each individual employer and not to an industry as a whole. Hence, it is likely that some local councils are covered by Work Choices and others are not. A council may even be covered in one year when it does a lot of trading, but not in a following year if its business changes. Bodies with fluctuating trading activities may thus drift in and out of federal coverage. Even if Joe Hockey is right in his view that most councils are covered by Work Choices, it may be impossible to work out which are and which are not. Many organisations, such as charities with limited financial means, are operating with considerable uncertainty. They face the high cost of legal advice to determine which law they should follow, Work Choices or the state law, and the anxiety that follows from lawyers often being unable to give a definitive answer without the case being taken to court. If the body makes a choice and gets this wrong, it will end up with a legal mess. It may even incur fines and other penalties for breaching whichever law it thought did not apply to it. Some lower courts have found that a body such as a university or a charity such as the Red Cross is a trading corporation. However, these judgments could be overruled by the High Court. That court may over the next few years offset its wide reading of what can be regulated under the corporations power with a more restrictive approach as to which bodies fall under the power. It may, for example, more strictly apply its “substantial trading activities” test or even jettison the test entirely in favour of a new approach based on the purpose for which the organisation was formed. There were hints of such change in argument before the High Court in the Work Choices case. Justice Hayne kept returning to the question of defining a trading corporation by its activities. When the Constitution was drawn up in the 1890 s there was no suggestion that a local council or a religious, charitable or educational corporation would be classed as a trading corporation. Commonwealth Solicitor-General David Bennett QC argued for the federal government in the Work Choices case. While not challenging the “substantial trading activities” test, even he seemed to suggest that it ought to be applied more strictly. Despite lower court findings, he cast doubt on whether local councils or bodies such as the Salvation Army and the Red Cross qualify as trading corporations. If the High Court does change direction, bodies such as universities that currently comply with Work Choices may find themselves outside the federal system. If this occurs they will need to undo all their federal compliance work, and agreements such as Australian Workplace Agreements that are not available under state schemes will be void. The chance to examine this issue could arise in respect of local councils in Queensland. Until the High Court has tackled this over the coming years in one or more test cases, the question of which bodies are bound by Work Choices will remain unclear and a source of frustration. At stake in this legal debate are the fundamental rights and entitlements of thousands of employers and employees. The outcome will also determine the reach and effectiveness of the Work Choices law. Federal government figures say that the regime applies to 85 per cent of the workforce. The coverage could be far less and that of the state schemes greatly increased if the High Court narrows the definition of a constitutional corporation. This would take Australia one step further from the Howard government’s goal of one national law for labour regulation. • George Williams is director of the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law, University of NSW.
