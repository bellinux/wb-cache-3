25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E

In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen that we thought through carefully the postwar aspects of what we were going to do once the military campaign was <b>over.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think it's now very public knowledge that that was not well handled. It was not well thought through, it was not well executed. And we lived with the consequences of that." ...|$|E

500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> went out the front door and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E

Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{the victory}} of the Popular Front in the {{elections}} became known I, already an elect member of Parliament, showed up at the prison of Oviedo the next morning, went {{to the office of the}} Director, who had fled in a mad panic because he had behaved like a genuine criminal toward the Asturian prisoners interned after the revolution of October 1934, and there I found the Administrator to whom I said, [...] "Give me the keys because the prisoners must be released this very day." [...] He replied, [...] "I have not received any orders", and I answered, [...] "I am a member of the Republic's Parliament, and I demand that you hand over the keys immediately to set the prisoners free." [...] He handed them <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> assure you that it was the most thrilling day of my activist life, opening the cells and shouting, [...] "Comrades, everyone get out!"

2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evert {{went into}} the 1982 Australian Open, having never won the tournament down under, which she wanted to rectify that fact and the gap on her grand slam resume. [...] Evert's {{opponent}} in the final was Navratilova, who was the defending champion. [...] The final was tied as one set apeice, and {{went into the}} pivotal and crucial third set, which in the second game Evert broke Navratilova to go up two games to none. [...] But in the third game, Evert failed to hold serve and lost the game. Subsequently, Evert quickly took the break advantage back in the fourth game to lead three games to one, and held serve to go up four games to one, which Evert said [...] "I thought...this is it." [...] Evert would quickly come back to reality, when feisty Navratilova, held serve in the sixth game of the set, then broke Evert in the seventh game of the set to narrow the gap to four games to three. [...] All this time, Evert was thinking about last years final, which eluded her grasp. [...] This one would be different however because in the eight game would break Navratilova, and the ninth would go to 30-love on a splendid crosscourt forehand, which at match point she hit a blazing winner {{to the other side of}} the court. [...] This was Evert's first Australian Open, which completed her career grand slam, and her fourteenth slam title for her career just ten days before her twenty-eighth birthday. [...] Later, Evert told reporters [...] "I have wanted this tournament so badly. [...] Then it was <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had won it...it was a very emotional moment for me because this title meant so much...the Australian title has been the missing link in my career.

2500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} role in 1999, a recast was opposed by viewers and costars. When Jackson's {{departure}} {{had previously been}} rumored in 1996, Anthony Geary (Luke) told TV Guide that he [...] "went to (the GH powers) and said, 'If we lose him, then let's kill Lucky.' Jonathan is too {{much a part of}} us to replace him." [...] Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: [...] "When all the actors {{who are going to be}} working with the character don't want it, it's kind of too bad that they still do it. But I don't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do." [...] The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson's popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in The Free Lance–Star: [...] "His hard work has paid off and many fans can't even remember there was ever someone else in the role." [...] Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by People magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, Zap2it named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: [...] "The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. Thank goodness we're getting to see it." [...] During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. Zap2it named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: [...] " [...] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?" [...] When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: [...] "I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did that in due time." [...] Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character. In April 2008, Allison Waldman of The Huffington Post named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on General Hospital, stating: [...] "He's still the real Lucky to many people, even though two other actors have subsequently played the part." ...|$|E

2500|$|His fast bowling {{gave him}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Typhoon Tyson", and despite his short career he achieved status as the fastest England bowler in living memory. Don Bradman called him [...] "the fastest bowler I have ever seen" [...] and Richie Benaud agreed, writing [...] "For a short time, Frank Tyson blasted all-comers". Tom Graveney wrote 'I cannot believe any bowler was faster than Tyson at that time'. When fielding in the slips he had 'to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still. the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots'. His Northants colleague Jock Livingston said 'When really firing, Tyson was the quickest of all {{over a period of}} three or four overs'. Livingston had seen Harold Larwood bowl Bodyline and batted against the Australian fast bowlers Miller and Lindwall in the Sheffield Shield. At the Aeronautical College in Wellington, New Zealand in 1955 metal plates were attached to a cricket ball and a sonic device was used to measure their speed, with Tyson's bowling measured at [...] 89mph (142km/h), but he was wearing three sweaters on a cold, damp morning and used no run up, Brian Statham bowled at 87mph (139km/h). He certainly bowled faster than 89mph in matches, and Tyson claimed that he could bowl at 119mph (190km/h), but this cannot be proven. The best that can be said was that he was noticeably faster than his contemporaries Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham, Peter Heine and Neil Adcock. His great fast bowling rival Fred Trueman ‘was forever being told that when it came to bowling I was very fast, but on his day Frank Tyson was faster than me' and it was Tyson who kept Trueman out of the England team in 1954–55. When they played together in a Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough in 1957 the captain Godfrey Evans insisted Trueman bowl into the headwind so as to give the faster Tyson the advantage of the tailwind. Dickie Bird, the famous England umpire, wrote [...] "he was certainly the quickest bowler I ever seen through the air, and on one occasion the quickest bowler I never saw through the air". When playing for [...] at Scarborough in 1958 [...] "I opened the innings against him and hit his first three deliveries through the off side for four. With supreme confidence I went on to the front foot for the fourth ball. Tyson dropped one short. It reared up and hit me on the chin. I went down as if I'd just been {{on the receiving end of}} a right hook...I still carry the scar to show my folly that day. There was blood all <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw stars. I could hear bells ringing in my head...". Dickie came back to score his then highest first class score of 62 and Tyson took 4/30. When they met in Australia in 1998–99 Tyson joked 'You're looking well Dickie. See you still have the scars though'.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{afterward}} {{about his}} one-day presidency, Carmona told The Miami Herald {{that he had}} been [...] "misunderstood because ... the opposition wasted too much time forming a cabinet and naming the high military command," [...] whereas if the coup had [...] "been hatched in advance, those key decisions would have already been made." [...] He regretted not stressing his plan to appoint [...] "a 35-member representative council to help him run the nation" [...] and to hold assembly elections in 90 days and a presidential election (in which he would not run) in December. He said he had suspended the assembly [...] "because the new government would never have accomplished its goals with a congress so stacked to favor one party." [...] He also denied any link to Carlos Andrés Pérez. [...] "There is no connection between me and him," [...] Carmona said. [...] "I did not receive one cent from him. I am not manipulated." [...] "There was no rebellion or coup" [...] Carmona told The New York Times after the counter-coup. [...] "There was simply a vacuum of power that came about after the military announced the resignation of the president." [...] Carmona said he had accepted the interim presidency because he was told by military officers that Chávez had resigned. [...] "I was called by them to fill that role," [...] he said. [...] "I was called by officers and others to take <b>over.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> had the courage to take that step." [...] He told The Guardian that he took [...] "full responsibility" [...] for the actions he made, emphasizing that [...] "there was no premeditation, no conspiracy" [...] behind the coup and his elevation to the presidency. He said that after the April 11 march on Miraflores, he had been phoned by someone (whom he would not name) who said that Chávez had quit and offered him the presidency. [...] "Everything happened so fast that mistakes were made," [...] Carmona said. [...] "If I could go back in time, I would have had a triumvirate, the power would have been shared – but everything was so quick." [...] When asked if he had been [...] "used by the military," [...] he replied: [...] "There might have been people who used me, you never {{know what is going on}} underground," [...] but he insisted that he [...] "acted purely in the higher interests of the country." [...] One Western diplomat told The Miami Herald that during Carmona's brief presidency [...] "everybody was saying what a great guy he was, professional, straight, ethical" [...] but that after his ouster [...] "everyone is pointing fingers at him for being a dope." [...] Carmona himself told the Herald that he would remain a [...] "civic activist" [...] but would leave politics: [...] "I have never been a politician; that is not my world," [...] Carmona said.
