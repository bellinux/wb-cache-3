500|$|New {{formations}} {{and play}} sets {{continued to be}} developed. Emory Bellard, an assistant coach under Darrell Royal at the University of Texas, developed a three-back <b>option</b> <b>style</b> offense known as the wishbone. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense {{that depends on the}} quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including Bear Bryant at Alabama, Chuck Fairbanks at Oklahoma and Pepper Rodgers at UCLA; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes. [...] The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the spread offense, developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to [...] "spread" [...] the field both horizontally and vertically. [...] Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently. In the rankings of the most victorious programs, Michigan, Notre Dame, and Texas are ranked first, second, and third in total wins.|$|E

He credits his coach there, Mike Russell, as serving as a mentor for him both as a football player and becoming an exemplary citizen. Atwater also is sixth on Lutheran North's all-time passing yards in a season with 1,097 yards in his junior year.|$|E

50|$|An Evergreen {{option is}} an option where the buyer {{has the right to}} {{exercise}} by providing a pre-determined period of notice. This option could be either American or European in nature or alternatively it could be combined with <b>option</b> <b>styles</b> that have non-vanilla exercise rights. For example, an ‘Evergreen-Bermudan’ option provides the buyer of the option with the right to exercise at set specific points in time after providing the other counterparty with a pre-determined period of notice of their intent to exercise the option. Evergreen options provide sellers with a period of time to prepare for settlement once the buyer has exercised their rights under the option. Embedding evergreen optionality within on and off-balance sheet products can enable counterparties (such as banks that must adhere to Basel III) to lengthen their inflow or outflow obligations.|$|R

50|$|A Bermudan {{option is}} an option where the buyer {{has the right to}} {{exercise}} at a set (always discretely spaced) number of times. This is intermediate between a European option - which allows exercise at a single time, namely expiry - and an American option, which allows exercise at any time (the name is jocular: Bermuda, a British overseas territory, is somewhat American and somewhat European—in terms of both <b>option</b> <b>style</b> and physical location—but is nearer to American in terms of both). For example, a typical Bermudian swaption might confer the opportunity to enter into an interest rate swap. The option holder might decide to enter into the swap at the first exercise date (and so enter into, say, a ten-year swap) or defer and have the opportunity to enter in six months time (and so enter a nine-year and six-month swap); see Swaption: Valuation. Most exotic interest rate options are of Bermudan style.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, the {{dividends}} {{of valuable}} {{experience in the}} young players showed as the Lakers not only won their first ever Division II playoff game, but advanced to the 2001 National Championship. Behind a potent offensive attack, Grand Valley State posted a perfect 10-0 regular season (September 11, 2001 game was canceled) {{with an average of}} 58.4 points per game and 48.0 points average margin of victory. GVSU's march to the championship game was not easy, however, as GLIAC Player of the Year quarterback and Harlon Hill Runner-Up Curt Anes, was injured in the Lakers' first playoff game. Grand Valley responded with a first round 42-14 victory over Bloomsburg, a 33-30 second round win over Saginaw Valley State, and a semi-final win over Catawba College, 34-16. One of the backup quarterbacks used during this run was actually a wide receiver brought in to run an <b>option</b> <b>style</b> offense when the other young backup ran into difficulty. In the championship game against North Dakota, the Lakers took a 14-10 lead with 2:46 left in the game, but the Fighting Sioux responded with a last minute drive of their own to take the title, 17-14. QB Curt Anes set the Division II record for passing efficiency in 2002 (min. 15 attempts per game) with a 221.6 rating (271 attempts, 189 completions, 3 interceptions, 3,086 yards, 48 TD passes).|$|E

5000|$|The lattice-based model {{entails a}} tree of short rates - a zeroeth step - {{consistent}} with today's yield curve and short rate (often caplet) volatility, {{and where the}} final time step of the tree corresponds to {{the date of the}} underlying bond's maturity. Using this tree (1) the bond is valued at each node by [...] "stepping backwards" [...] through the tree: at the final nodes, bond value is simply face value (or $1), plus coupon (in cents) if relevant; at each earlier node, it is the discounted expected value of the up- and down-nodes in the later time step, plus coupon payments during the current time step. Then (2), the option is valued similar to the approach for equity options: at nodes in the time-step corresponding to option maturity, value is based on moneyness; at earlier nodes, it is the discounted expected value of the option at the up- and down-nodes in the later time step, and, depending on <b>option</b> <b>style</b> (and other specifications - see below), of the bond value at the node. https://books.google.com/books?id=wF8yVzLI6EYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Valuation+of+fixed+income+securities+and+derivatives https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232352/http://janroman.dhis.org/stud/BDT%20Thesis.pdf For both steps, the discounting is at the short rate for the tree-node in question. (Note that the Hull-White tree is usually Trinomial: the logic is as described, although there are then three nodes in question at each point.)

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Continuous Workout Mortgage (CWM), a two in one product: a fixed rate home loan coupled with {{negative}} equity insurance, to advocate its viability in mitigating financial fragility. In order {{to tackle the}} many issues that CWMs embrace, we perform a range of tasks. We optimally price CWMs and take a systemic market-based approach, stipulating that mortgage values and payments should be linked to housing prices and adjusted downward to prevent negative equity. We illustrate that amortizing CWMs can be the efficient home financing choice for many households. We price CWMs as American <b>option</b> <b>style,</b> defaulting debt in conjunction with prepayment within a continuous time, analytic framework. We introduce random prepayments via the intensity approach of Jarrow and Turnbull (1995). We also model the optimal embedded option to default whose exercise is motivated by decreasing random house prices. We adapt the Barone-Adesi and Whaley (1987) (BAW) approach to work within amortizing mortgage context. We derive new closed-form and new analytical approximation methodologies which apply both for pricing CWMs, {{as well as for}} pricing the standard US 30 -year Fixed Rate Mortgage (FRM) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the price and}} characteristics of an exotic option called the Volatility-Cap-Target-Level(VCTL) option. The payoff function is a simple European <b>option</b> <b>style</b> but the underlying value is a dynamic portfolio which is comprised of two components: A risky asset and a non-risky asset. The non-risky asset is a bond and the risky asset can be a fund or an index related to any asset category such as equities, commodities, real estate, etc. The main purpose of using a dynamic portfolio {{is to keep the}} realized volatility of the portfolio under control and preferably below a certain maximum level, denoted as the Volatility-Cap-Target-Level (VCTL). This is attained by a variable allocation between the risky asset and the non-risky asset during the maturity of the VCTL-option. The allocation is reviewed and if necessary adjusted every 15 th day. Adjustment depends entirely upon the realized historical volatility of the risky asset. Moreover, it is assumed that the risky asset is governed by a certain group of stochastic differential equations called affine jump-diffusion models. All models will be calibrated using out-of-the money European call options based on the Deutsche-Aktien-Index(DAX). The numerical implementation of the portfolio diffusions and the use of Monte Carlo methods will result in different VCTL-option prices. Thus, to price a nonstandard product and to comply with good risk management, it is advocated that the financial institution use several research models such as the SVSJ- and the Seppmodel in addition to the Black-Scholes model. Keywords: Exotic option, basket option, risk management, greeks, affine jumpdiffusions, the Black-Scholes model, the Heston model, Bates model with lognormal jumps, the Bates model with log-asymmetric double exponential jumps, the Stochastic-Volatility-Simultaneous-Jumps(SVSJ) -model, the Sepp-model...|$|E
