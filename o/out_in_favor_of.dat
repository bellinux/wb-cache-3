5|$|Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese {{aircraft}} downed were {{credited to}} this weapon, {{with the high}} point being 48.3% {{for the second half}} of 1942. In 1943 the revolutionary Mark 14 Gun Sight was introduced which made these guns even more effective; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II. They were subsequently phased <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> the heavier 40mm Bofors AA guns.|$|E
50|$|The qualifiers from Group C won all {{of their}} games against the teams from Group D. The closest match was the Kazakhstan-China game, where the Chinese got through when they outscored the Kazakhs 11-5 in the final 3 minutes when the score was tied.

On April 30, 2013, Ryan came <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> same-sex couples adopting children.

50|$|Horizon was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Dornier 328 turboprop, intending {{to replace the}} Fairchild Metroliners with this new aircraft which promised jetliner speed and comfort. The second Dornier 328 prototype was painted in Horizon colors. Twelve were delivered between November 1993 and November 1995, but they were quickly phased <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1997 <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> fleet standardization of the Dash 8.|$|R
5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun, one of {{the most}} heavily produced anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War, entered service in 1941, and replaced the /90 M2 Browning MG on a one-for-one basis.

In 2004, LLL was phased <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> a new super group known as La Legión Extranjera or the Foreign Legion in English, which meant that Los Vipers now regularly teamed with foreign wrestlers, especially NWA-TNA performers such as Abyss.|$|E
5|$|On social issues, Gillibrand is {{generally}} liberal, supporting abortion rights, legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2017, she came <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> single-payer healthcare, and cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which would gradually expand the existing Medicare program {{to cover all}} Americans. She is a strong advocate for government transparency, being {{one of a few}} members of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information.

5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Andrew T. Wood, {{a lawyer}} from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters would {{decide whether to}} ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document {{as part of their}} convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six weeks before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.|$|E
5|$|The Sami peoples {{were subject}} to forced collectivization, {{with more than half}} of their {{reindeer}} herds collectivized in 1928–1930. In addition, the traditional Sami herding practices were phased <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding. Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices, this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero, which became the cultural center of the Sami people in Russia. Those Sami resisting the collectivization {{were subject to}} forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin's death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in urbanized areas, although some herd reindeer across much of the region.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E
50|$|The {{desire for}} a less flammable, less {{hazardous}} fuel led the U.S. Air Force to phase <b>out</b> JP-4 <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> JP-8; the transition for USAF operations in Great Britain was made in 1979, and the change was completed throughout the USAF {{by the end of}} 1995.|$|R

5|$|The {{signature}} {{issue of}} the session, however, was Fields' request for the bond issue. He engaged in a debate with opponents of the issue that was published in Bingham's Courier-Journal {{as well as the}} Louisville Herald and Louisville Post, two papers owned by James B. Brown. Ultimately, the issue was approved by the General Assembly, which was considered a major victory for Fields. Still, the bond issue had to be approved by the state's electorate. The Courier-Journal continued the fight against the issue, while Desha Breckinridge's Lexington Herald came <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> it. Fields spent ten weeks criss-crossing the state speaking in favor of the bond issue, but on election day, it was rejected by a margin of 90,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{turnaround}} from a 281 {{season in}} 1992 {{was the largest}} single-season turnaround in school history and was the second-best {{in the country that}} year. Tech hoped to improve upon a 14 all-time record in bowl games, while Indiana hoped to do likewise for its 34 historical bowl-game record. In the week prior to the game, bad weather in Virginia caused travel delays that prevented many fans and the Virginia Tech marching band from arriving at the game early. Two days prior to the Independence Bowl, Tech was shocked by the death of Dr. Richard Bullock, who served as the team's physician from 1971 to 1988. Bullock designed a special football neck protector worn by players during the 1980s and 1990s before being phased <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> more advanced padding.|$|E
