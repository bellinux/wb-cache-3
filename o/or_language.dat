5|$|Although no {{linguists}} {{claim that}} panlectal grammars have psychological validity, and polylectal diasystems {{are much more}} likely to be cognitively real for bilingual and bidialectal speakers, speakers of only one dialect <b>or</b> <b>language</b> may still be aware of the differences between their own speech and that of other varieties.|$|E
5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying {{adjacent}} territory form a dialect continuum <b>or</b> <b>language</b> complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while others are not. Adjacent dialects typically have relatively high degrees of mutual intelligibility, but the degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the client computer and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server <b>or</b> <b>language,</b> the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E

5|$|Meena then realises {{that she}} has {{fallen in love with}} Rahul. When Rahul plans to sneak away, she argues, not wanting to earn the villagers' distrust. Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to {{disperse}} his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her. Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Meena's father and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional <b>or</b> <b>language</b> barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve.|$|E

25|$|Between times 1 to 2 is {{termed the}} {{acquisition}} period. Between times 2 to 3 is termed the incubation period (1982: 520). Further, {{he states that}} {{it is not enough to}} consider only the time that has passed between 2 and 3 to make statements about attrition. It is also necessary to consider the duration, relative success, and nature of the acquisition period and the duration and content of the incubation phase (Gardner 1982: 520). The acquisition period is the time where language learning <b>or</b> <b>language</b> experience occurs, mainly from the first to the last lesson. During the incubation period, no language training <b>or</b> <b>language</b> usage occurs and the forgetting may begin. He says that now that language learning is not active anymore, a study about language attrition can be conducted (Gardner 1982a: 2).|$|E
