40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} mixtures with pectin, <b>oxidised</b> <b>starch</b> and glucose syrup were investigated using small deformation dynamic oscillation. The {{composition of the}} mixture, pH and temperature course of analysis were designed to imitate the development of confectionery products. In the absence of added calcium, preparations of low methoxy pectin with glucose syrup form viscous solutions, which remain crystal-free at subzero temperatures. Samples of <b>oxidised</b> <b>starch</b> and glucose syrup. on the other hand, exhibit solid-like behavior due to the crystalline nature of the amylose-like helices. Mixtures of the two polyssacharides with the co-solute show clearly the phase inversion from liquid to solid-like behavior with increasing amounts of starch in the formulation. The transformation {{is reflected in the}} textural properties of samples which vary from thick solutions to firm gels. The viscoelasticity of the system can be modified further by the introduction of high methoxy pectin. 1 hus preparations of high methoxy pectin and glucose syrup form rubbery gels whose amorphous nature undergoes a glass transition during cooling. The energetic requirement for the formation of the biological rubber was in good agreement with corresponding data in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Corn starch was {{oxidised}} by {{hydrogen peroxide}} at temperatures 20, 30, 40 and 50 °C. The oxidised starches were examined for {{the content of}} carboxyl groups, carbonyl groups, amylose and for water binding capacity and water solubility. Susceptibility to retrogradation and pasting characteristics were also determined. The {{results indicate that the}} effectiveness of oxidation process increased with increased temperature of modification. Temperature of modification influenced content of amylose in <b>oxidised</b> <b>starch.</b> Water binding capacity at 60 and 80 °C and water solubility at 80 °C increased with increased temperature of modification. Starch oxidised at 50 °C had the lowest susceptibility to retrogradation and had the highest rheological stability.  ...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} behaviour of an <b>oxidised</b> <b>starch</b> AP {{as well as}} that {{of calcium}} onto haematite have been studied both individually and together. While the adsorption density of starch AP onto haematite is enhanced in the presence of calcium, the adsorption of calcium onto haematite is not promoted by starch AP. Flocculation tests on haematite ore fines in the presence of starch AP and calcium chloride reveal that the sequence in which calcium and starch are added governs the settling rates and turbidity values. Zeta potential, viscosity and conductivity measurements, and calcium ion binding studies with starch AP indicate calcium-starch interactions. Possible mechanisms involved in such interactions with respect to haematite flocculation have been discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the effects of sodium hypochlorite oxidation and a heat–moisture treatment of potato starch on the physicochemical, pasting and textural properties of potato starches {{in addition to the}} water vapour permeability (WVP) and mechanical properties of potato starch films produced from these starches. The carbonyl contents, carboxyl contents, swelling power, solubility, pasting properties and gel texture of the native, oxidised and heat–moisture treated (HMT) starches were evaluated. The films made of native, <b>oxidised</b> and HMT <b>starches</b> were characterised by thickness, water solubility, colour, opacity, mechanical properties and WVP. The <b>oxidised</b> and HMT <b>starches</b> had lower viscosity and swelling power compared to the native starch. The films produced from <b>oxidised</b> potato <b>starch</b> had decreased solubility, elongation and WVP values in addition to increased tensile strength compared to the native starch films. The HMT starch increased the tensile strength and WVP of the starch films compared to the native starch...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of enrichment of <b>oxidised</b> <b>starches</b> with mineral compounds on their physicochemical properties and capability for free radical generation. Potato and spelt wheat <b>starches</b> were <b>oxidised</b> with sodium hypochlorite and, afterwards, modified with ions of potassium, magnesium and iron. The modified starches were analysed for: content of mineral elements, colour parameters (L*a*b*), water binding capacity solubility in water at temperature of 50 and 80 °C, and susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis with α-amylase. In addition, thermodynamic characteristics of gelatinisation was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the number and character of thermally generated free radicals was assayed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Based on the results achieved, it was concluded that the quantity of incorporated minerals and changes in the assayed physicochemical parameters depended not only on the botanical type of starch but also on the type of the incorporated mineral element...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of Cu(II) ions used as a catalyst {{on the effectiveness of}} potato starch oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, and compares the physicochemical properties of the modified starches. The <b>starch</b> was <b>oxidised</b> by H 2 O 2 alone and with the addition of Cu(II) ions at three concentrations: 0. 1, 0. 2 or 0. 3 g per 100 g d. m. of <b>starch.</b> The <b>oxidised</b> <b>starches</b> were examined for the content of carboxyl groups, carbonyl groups, amylose and copper, and for water-binding capacity and water solubility at temperatures of 60 and 80 8 C. Colour parameters (L a b), susceptibility to retrogradation, thermodynamic characteristics of pasting, intrinsic viscosity and pasting characteristic by RVA were also determined. The results indicate that the concentration of Cu(II) ions added as a catalyst has an effect on both the effectiveness of the oxidation process and the physicochemical properties of starch...|$|R
40|$|Elaboration {{of cocoa}} syrups {{by the use}} of {{modified}} starches such as acetylated distarch adipate (ADA) and <b>oxidised</b> <b>starch</b> (OS) were described and analysed the influence of different amounts of ADA and OS on physical and sensory properties of cocoa syrups. The sensory, textural and rheological properties of syrups produced in the laboratory conditions were compared to the properties of commercially pro-duced ones. The quantity of modified starch added affected textural and rheological properties of syrups. All analysed syrups showed non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic flow and thixotropy. Values of yield stresses, viscosities of Casson, and consistency coefficients of syrups prepared in laboratory conditions increased with an increase in the addition of modified starches. Key Words: cocoa syrups, modified starches, rheology, sensory propertie...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of an <b>oxidised</b> <b>starch</b> with natural haematite {{has been investigated}} through adsorption studies, X-ray photoelectron and FTIR spectroscopic techniques. The adsorption density is found to vary with pH, with the maximum adsorption {{taking place in the}} pH range 4 to 10. Adsorption isotherms at 30 and 50 °C show that the adsorption density varies also with temperature. The infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectra of adsorbed starch on haematite indicate evidence of chemical interaction and hydrogen bonding. Further, the direct {{interaction of}} ferric ion with starch has been studied through binding in solution, SEM-EDAX analysis, viscosity and conductivity measurements, and these results suggest chemical interaction between iron and starch. Based on the above findings, probable adsorption mechanisms in this system have been postulated...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: In {{order to}} avoid the {{microbiological}} risks linked to human serum albumin macroaggregates (MAA) used for lung perfusion scintigraphy, we developed a new starch-based Tc- 99 m potential radiopharmaceutical. METHODS: Microparticles were prepared from <b>oxidised</b> <b>starch</b> coupled to natural polyamine for Tc- 99 m complexation. Suspensions were formulated as ready-to-use kits for easy one-step labelling procedures. RESULTS: Particle-size analysis, electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy were performed for microparticle characterisation, and gave a typical size distribution ranging from 7 to 63 microm, with a homogenous population of spherical or oval-shaped microparticles. Radiochemical purity exceeded 95 %, and was stable for at least 8 h. When challenged with histidine and human plasma, labelling was also stable. Dynamic scintigraphic acquisitions and biodistribution studies conducted on healthy Wistar rats showed a tracer accumulation with more than 80 % of the ID in the lungs after 15 min. CONCLUSIONS: With clinically significant characteristics such as a lung half-life of 3 h, a lung-to-vascular ratio of 900, and a lung-to-liver ratio of 90, starch-based microparticles exhibit all the qualities for an effective new lung perfusion agent...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous {{thermoplastic}} starch (TPS) {{films were}} produced by compression moulding of solution spray-dried TPS powder and by direct solution casting. <b>Oxidised</b> potato <b>starch</b> {{was used as}} a feedstock for production of plasticised formulations containing glycerol or urea, or their combinations with maltodextrin (DE = 19. 1) as processing aid. The crystallinity index of freshly moulded films made from solution spray-dried powder was significantly lower than that for casted films. FTIR analysis showed that starch interacted in hydrogen bond formation with glycerol and urea plasticisers, reducing the glass transition temperature to 136 °C and 106 °C, respectively. Formulations containing maltodextrin did not show a Tg. Glycerol-plasticised and co-plasticised films immediately started to retrogradate in the presence of moisture, while urea based systems only showed slow recrystallization at the highest moisture exposure. In line with retrogradation behaviour, urea plasticised and co-plasticised films exhibited a more ductile behaviour, whereas glycerol based ones showed more brittle behaviour. ...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxypropylated and <b>oxidised</b> potato <b>starch</b> (HONPS) {{was used}} {{together}} with glycerol {{and water to}} produce thermoplastic starch. The amount of glycerol was kept constant at 22 parts by weight per 100 parts of dry starch. The thermoplastic starch was converted into films/sheets using three different processing techniques; casting, compression moulding and film blowing. The last two methods represent typical thermoplastic conversion techniques requiring elevated processing temperatures. By means of size-exclusion chromatography, {{it was found that}} compression moulding and film blowing led to some degradation of high-molecular weight amylopectin as well as of high-molecular weight amylose-like molecules. The degradation was significantly less pronounced for the cast films. The morphology of the specimens was quite complex and phase separations on different levels were identified. In the cast films and, to a lesser extent, in the compression-moulded specimens, a fine network structure could be distinguished. Such a structure could however not be ascertained in the film-blown material and this is discussed in terms of the thermo-mechanical treatment of the starch materials. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} bean starch {{oxidation}} at different active chlorine concentrations (0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 %) on the physicochemical, crystallinity, pasting and morphological properties of starch was investigated. The carbonyl content, carboxyl content, starch colour, swelling power, solubility, gel hardness, X-ray crystallinity, pasting properties, gelatinisation characteristics and morphology of the starches were evaluated. The bean <b>starch</b> <b>oxidised</b> with 0. 5 % active chlorine had the {{characteristic of a}} slightly crosslinked starch. As compared to the native and 0. 5 % active chlorine-oxidised starches, active chlorine at 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % increased the carbonyl content, carboxyl content and solubility of the starches. Moreover, these concentrations of active chlorine decreased the swelling power, gel hardness, relative crystallinity, breakdown, peak viscosity and setback, {{as compared to the}} native and 0. 5 % active chlorine-oxidised starches. The <b>starch</b> granules <b>oxidised</b> with 1. 5 % active chlorine had imperfections in their structure, and its surface appears to be rougher than the other granules...|$|R
