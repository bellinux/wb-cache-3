Methods We selected and genotyped 80 men and postmenopausal women heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolaemia (main group) as well as 11 healthy control subjects. Patients were subgrouped based on their response to <b>oral</b> fat <b>tolerance</b> test. The <b>oral</b> fat <b>tolerance</b> test was defined as pathological when postprandial triglyceride concentration was higher than the highest triglyceride concentration observed in healthy subjects (220 mg/dl) at any time (2, 4, 6 or 8 h). Results In the pathological subgroup, men had significantly higher incremental area under the curve after <b>oral</b> fat <b>tolerance</b> test than postmenopausal women. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed a gender association of TaqIB and I 405 V influence on postprandial lipaemia in this subgroup. Conclusion In conclusion, it seems that gender and TaqIB polymorphism of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene were both associated with the distribution of triglyceride values after <b>oral</b> fat <b>tolerance</b> test, only in subjects with a pathological response to <b>oral</b> fat <b>tolerance</b> test. Specifically, men carrying the B 2 allele of the TaqIB polymorphism showed a higher postprandial triglyceride peak and a delayed return to basal values compared with women carrying B 2.

40|$|CONTEXT: Cirrhosis, {{diabetes}} mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, {{and protein}} calorie malnutrition are important issues in cirrhotic patients {{because they can}} increase the progression of liver disease and worsen its prognosis. OBJECTIVE:To determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in cirrhotic patients being evaluated for liver transplantation and their impacts on a 3 -month follow-up, and to compare fasting glycemia and <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in consecutively included adult patients. Diabetes mellitus was established through fasting glycemia and <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in this population. HOMA-IR and HOMA-&# 946; indexes were calculated, and nutritional assessment was performed by subjective global assessment, anthropometry and handgrip strength through dynamometry. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus was found in 40 patients (64. 5 %), 9 (22. 5 %) of them by fasting glycemia and 31 (77. 5 %) of them by <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test. Insulin resistance was found in 40 (69 %) of the patients. There was no relationship between diabetes mellitus and the etiology of cirrhosis. Protein calorie malnutrition was diagnosed in a range from 3. 22 % to 45. 2 % by anthropometry, 58. 1 % by subjective global assessment and 88. 7 % by handgrip strength. Diabetes mellitus identified by <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test was related significantly to a higher prevalence of infectious complications and deaths in a 3 -month period (P = 0. 017).

50|$|Mucosal {{immunology}} is {{the study}} of immune system responses that occur at mucosal membranes of the intestines, the urogenital tract and the respiratory system, i.e., surfaces that are in contact with the external environment. In healthy states, the mucosal immune system provides protection against pathogens but maintains a tolerance towards non-harmful commensal microbes and benign environmental substances. For example, in the oral and gut mucosa, the secretion of IgA provides an immune response to potential antigens in food without a large and unnecessary systemic immune response. Since the mucosal membranes are the primary contact point between a host and its environment, a large amount of secondary lymphoid tissue is found here. The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, or MALT, provides the organism with an important first line of defense. Along with the spleen and lymph nodes, the tonsils and MALT are also considered to be secondary lymphoid tissue. The mucosal immune system provides three main functions: serving as the body's first line defense from antigens and infection, preventing systemic immune responses to commensal bacteria and food antigens (primarily food proteins in the Gut-associated lymphoid tissue, so-called <b>oral</b> <b>tolerance),</b> and regulating appropriate immune responses to pathogens encountered on a daily basis.|$|E
50|$|The {{major focus}} of Dr. Weiner’s career has been the study of MS, which he began in 1972 as a {{resident}} in neurology at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He has published over 200 articles on all aspects of MS including basic studies, animal models and clinical trials.In 1983, he alongside Dr. Stephen L. Hauser, now Chairman of Neurology at University of California, San Francisco, published a seminal article on the treatment of MS in The New England Journal of Medicine. This demonstrated in a controlled trial a profound effect of the immunosuppressant and chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide in stopping active, progressive MS. The article introduced the timed 25-foot walk (ambulation index) that subsequently has become a classic clinical measure in MS. In 2000, Weiner founded the Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The Partners MS Center encompasses both adult and pediatric patients the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Massachusetts General Hospital, respectively. Both are member hospitals of the Partners HealthCare system in Boston. The Partners MS Center {{has served as a}} model for the comprehensive care of MS patients and includes clinical care and research, an infusion center and dedicated MRI magnet. The Partner’s MS Center has 4000 patient visits per year. Dr. Weiner established the CLIMB Study (Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis at Brigham and Women’s Hospital). The CLIMB natural history study of MS, which in an analogous fashion to the Framingham Heart Study; follows over 2000 patients with annual exams, blood studies, and MRI imaging to understand the course of MS over time.

40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>tolerance</b> is {{the process}} whereby local or {{systemic}} pro-inflammatory immune responses against specific antigens are prevented following their oral admin-istration.

Furthermore, it has been proposed that defects in the mechanisms underlying <b>oral</b> <b>tolerance</b> contribute to intestinal disorders such as food allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases. Understanding how <b>oral</b> <b>tolerance</b> is established might result in novel therapeutic approaches to such dis-orders.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the importance of}} the <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test for the diagnosis of glucose intolerance (GI) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM- 2) in women with PCOS. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 247 patients with PCOS selected at random. The diagnosis of GI was obtained from the two-hour <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test with 75 g of glucose according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) (GI: 120 minutes for plasma glucose = 140 mg/dL and < 200 mg/dL), and the diagnosis of DM- 2 was obtained by both the <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test (DM: 120 minutes for plasma glucose = 200 mg/dL) and fasting glucose using the criteria of the American Diabetes Association (impaired fasting glucose: fasting plasma glucose = 100 and < 126 mg/dL; DM: fasting glucose = 126 mg/dL). A logistic regression model for repeated measures was applied to compare the <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test with fasting plasma glucose. ANOVA followed by the Tukey test was used for the analysis of the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with and without GI and/or DM- 2.

The percentage of obese patients was 64 %, the percentage of overweight patients was 18. 6 % and 17. 4 % had healthy weight. The <b>oral</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> test identified 14 cases of DM- 2 (5. 7 %), while fasting glucose detected only three cases (1. 2 %), and the frequency of these disorders was higher with increasing age and BMI.
