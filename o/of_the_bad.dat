5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} {{surfaces of the}} plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the mouth}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Axe River, on 1 August 1832, Black Hawk and Winnebago prophet and fellow British Band leader White Cloud advised the band against wasting time {{building}} rafts {{to cross the}} Mississippi River, because the U.S. forces were closing in, urging them instead to flee northward and seek refuge among the Ho-Chunk. However, most of the band chose to try to cross the river.|$|E

5|$|Oxygen renewed {{the show}} for a , with Tanisha Thomas (from season two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Girls Club) as the host. In this season, Natalie Nunn (season four), Amber Buell (season three) and Lea Beaulieu (season five) competed for true love. The second season {{consisted}} of eight one-hour episodes aired between April 18, 2011, and June 13, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibility}} of the recovery {{was transferred to the}} Governor of Svalbard on 30 August, since there were no survivors. In addition, police personnel from the mainland were transferred to Svalbard to work with the investigation and recovery. The work was supplemented by local volunteers. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> weather, which included fog and snow, it was often impossible to transport workers to the plateau, and work therefore started in the valley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, {{the format of}} the show changed drastically. The maximum age dropped from 31 to 28. The cast of season two were given {{mandatory}} non-profit jobs to help them build a work ethic and to experience the stabilizing effect of being interdependent with others, for example in teamwork and commitment, to equip them for success in later life. Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, decision making, and building cooperation. Season two was the first and only season <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Girls Club to do this, and was also the last to air 30-minute episodes.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} <b>the</b> <b>baddest,</b> or one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baddest,</b> girls in <b>the</b> house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|R

5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too drunk to perform. He became more popular in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> press he received, {{and as a result}} extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts that limited his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because {{he was one of}} the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or be in an elevator with Silva, but he was not one of them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, however, had no {{intentions}} {{of letting the}} British Band escape. The Warrior, a steamboat outfitted with an artillery piece, patrolled the Mississippi River, while American allied-Dakotas, Menominees, and Ho-Chunks watched the banks. On August 1, the Warrior arrived at the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Axe River, where the Dakotas told the Americans that they would find Black Hawk's people. Black Hawk raised a white flag {{in an attempt to}} surrender, but his intentions may have been garbled in translation. The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought that the Indians were using the white flag to set an ambush. When they became certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on the Warrior was injured.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bad Axe {{began at}} about 9:00 am on August 2 after the Americans {{caught up with}} the {{remnants}} of the British Band a few miles downstream from the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Axe River. The British Band was reduced to roughly 500 people by this time, including about 150 warriors. The warriors fought with the Americans while the Native noncombatants frantically tried to cross the river. Many made it to one of the two nearby islands, but were dislodged after the steamboat Warrior returned at noon, carrying regulars and Menominees allied with the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights was the {{penultimate}} {{engagement of}} the 1832 Black Hawk War, fought between the United States state militia and allies, and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk. The battle {{took place in}} what is now Dane County, near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. Despite being vastly outnumbered and sustaining heavy casualties, Black Hawk's warriors managed to delay the combined government forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River. This reprieve was temporary; when the militia finally caught up with the fleeing band it resulted in the Bad Axe massacre at the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Axe River.|$|E
5|$|Eventually NSB felt {{confident}} that they had found a technical solution that would be satisfactory, and ordered another six units to allow all trains on the Dovre, Bergen and Sørland Lines to be hauled with the class. Units 2227–2232 were delivered in 1987, and put into regular service on the Sørland Line. Although better than the first series, the second series was also prone to technical problems, and never entered regular service on the Bergen Line. During the 1990s, they were also put into service on the regional rail services on the Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. The units were never well-liked by NSB, in part because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> name the first series had given, and partly {{because the number of}} available units was unpredictable. It also took a while for NSB to discover that asynchronous locomotives needed to be operated differently. The locomotives had been designed to haul a six-car train, but NSB regularly needed to haul eight-car trains, and therefore instead used the more powerful El 16.|$|E

50|$|Divorce courts require proof {{be given}} that the grounds {{actually}} exist. This {{can be accomplished by}} providing testimony from a hired detective with documentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spouse’s <b>bad</b> behavior or from someone who witnessed or has first-hand knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spouse’s <b>bad</b> behavior. There are defenses a spouse can use to convince the court {{that he or she is}} not at fault in order to have the grounds dismissed and possibly prevent a fault divorce. These defenses include collusion, condonation, connivance, and provocation.|$|R
5|$|The {{members of}} the British Band, and the Fox, Kickapoo, Sauk, Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi that later joined them, {{suffered}} unknown numbers of dead during the war. While some died fighting, others were tracked down and killed by Sioux, Menominee, Ho-Chunk, and other native tribes. Still others died of starvation or drowned during the Band's long trek up the Rock River toward the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Axe. The entire British Band was not wiped out at Bad Axe; some survivors drifted back home to their villages. This was relatively simple for the Potawatomi and Ho-Chunk of the band. Many Sauk and Fox found {{return to their homes}} more difficult, and while some returned safely, others were held in custody by the army. Prisoners, some taken at the Battle of Bad Axe, and others taken by U.S.-aligned Native American tribes in the following weeks, were taken to Fort Armstrong at modern Rock Island, Illinois. About 120 prisoners – men, women, and children – waited until the end of August to be released by General Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|While {{the band}} fled west, Commanding General Henry Atkinson trimmed his force {{to a few}} hundred men {{and set out to}} join militia commanders Henry Dodge and James D. Henry to regroup and {{resupply}} at Fort Blue Mounds. Under the command of Atkinson, around 1,300 men from the commands of Henry, Dodge, Alexander Posey and Milton Alexander crossed the Wisconsin River between 27 July and 28 July near present day Helena, Wisconsin. The well-fed and rested militia force picked up Black Hawk's trail again on 28 July near present-day Spring Green, Wisconsin, and relatively quickly closed the gap on the famished and battle-weary band of Native Americans. On 1 August, Black Hawk and about 500 men, women, and children arrived at the eastern bank of the Mississippi, a few miles downstream from the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Axe River. On arrival, the leaders of the band, including Black Hawk, called a council meeting to discuss their next move.|$|E
5|$|Several storylines {{formed the}} {{background}} for the opening match, which saw the fan favorite team <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bad</b> Guys (Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, Davey Boy Smith and The Headshrinkers) square off against the villainous team of The Teamsters (Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart). Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since September 1993 when Ramon won the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels, the former champion, had been stripped of the belt. WWF President Jack Tunney scheduled a battle royal, in which Ramon and Rick Martel were the final participants remaining. They faced each other on Monday Night Raw, and Ramon won the match and was awarded the title. Michaels claimed {{that he was the}} rightful holder of the belt and refused to acknowledge Ramon as the champion. Diesel was serving as Michaels' bodyguard but soon became an active wrestler and carried on Michaels' feud with Ramon. In {{the months leading up to}} Survivor Series, Ramon had also developed a feud with Jeff Jarrett, and the two faced each other several times with the Intercontinental Championship on the line. Ramon's friend, the 1-2-3 Kid, took Ramon's side in these feuds, and the two formed an occasional tag team. The Headshrinkers had also been feuding with Michaels and Diesel since dropping the WWF Tag Team Championship to them on August 28. The Headshrinkers had several rematches but were unable to regain the belts. Finally, Davey Boy Smith was involved in a feud with his real-life brother-in-law Owen Hart and Hart's other brother-in-law, Jim Neidhart. Owen Hart had turned on his brother Bret at the 1994 Royal Rumble, after which Smith got involved on Bret's side and Neidhart took Owen's side.|$|E

Aiming to recreate the more raw, primal sound of all former related projects such as The Birthday Party, Grindermans lyrical and musical content diverged significantly to Nick Caves concurrent work with <b>The</b> <b>Bad</b> Seeds, whose last studio album, Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus (2004), was primarily blues, gospel and alternative-orientated {{in stark contrast to}} <b>the</b> raw sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early <b>Bad</b> Seeds albums.
