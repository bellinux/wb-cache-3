However, there are <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> feasibility study occurred in construction industry in which this issue is seldom being given attention by the developers. Hence, there are four objectives in this research that aims to be achieved, which include to identify the causes <b>of</b> <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> feasibility study in construction industry, to determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> feasibility study in construction industry, to highlight the types <b>of</b> <b>abuses</b> occurred in feasibility study in construction industry, and {{to examine the relationship between}} the causes and effects <b>of</b> <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> feasibility study in construction industry.

The results of data analysis showed that there are occurrences <b>of</b> <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> feasibility study where types <b>of</b> <b>abuses</b> occurred in feasibility study, causes and effects <b>of</b> <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> feasibility study in construction industry are determined and ranked according to their mean frequencies.

5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine.

This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E
