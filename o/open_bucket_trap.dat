Two chaining treatments were applied to the study area: standard surface level chaining, and roller-ball chaining with an elevated striking height of 0. 6 m. Larvae were sampled by digging and searching uniform areas of soil t the base of redberry juniper trees, where the larvae are found. Soil was also sampled for moisture content in May 1998. Brown boards on the ground and white buckets in the air, both coated with Tanglefoot@ stickun- 4 were used to capture adult flies and monitor their activity. Brown boards capture mostly male flies, and white buckets capture female flies almost exclusively. Chaining did not significantly affect populations of larvae within one season, or have an effect on soil moisture. In plats receiving the standard chaining treatment, 65 % less flies were captured on <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> than in the controls.

Traps baited with cut sugarcane caught significantly more weevils than those without sugarcane.
