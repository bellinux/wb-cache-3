5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E

The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls on <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.|$|E
5|$|On <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale, Kota Kinabalu may {{sometimes}} only refer to, especially by local inhabitants, the city centre or {{central business district}} near the sea facing Gaya Island. On {{the other end of}} the scale, it may also refer to the metropolitan area which includes urban Kota Kinabalu (Greater Kota Kinabalu), and the surrounding towns of Papar and Kinarut in the south, and Tuaran and Tamparuli in the north, being within its zone of influence.|$|E

5|$|The spores are 4–7 by 2–3µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and {{embedded}} in the gleba. A 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the Phallaceae family, including Mutinus elegans, have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3µm diameter) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar scar is a circular indentation at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spore, and it most likely results during {{the separation of the}} attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium.|$|E
5|$|A Syndicate surgeon {{attempting}} to procure the alien fetus is killed {{by one of}} the alien rebels, who assumes his form. Krycek finds the dead surgeon and the fetus missing, and tells Spender that the rebels are now going to succeed in their goals to halt colonization. The Syndicate and its families gather at El Rico Air Force Base. Shortly after Fowley arrives, a white light appears around <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hangar. It is revealed to be the rebels, who surround and immolate the entire Syndicate—except for The Smoking Man and Fowley—who escape by car.|$|E
5|$|A more {{traditional}} Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighborhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade {{gathered in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. At <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the Znak pitanja("?").|$|E
50|$|Passengers {{could not}} pass {{from one side}} of a {{carriage}} to another while in motion.

5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons {{that they can use}} as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E
5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. There is a baggage rack {{at the end of}} the car. On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand {{until it reaches}} a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process {{is referred to as}} gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|Races over short distances, or sprints, {{are among}} the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games {{featured}} only one event, the stadion race, which was a race from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused around athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.|$|E
5|$|The Kop {{was built}} in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0. In 1906 the banked stand at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground was {{formally}} renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal. The hill {{was the site of}} the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool. At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators {{and was one of the}} largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supportersc than some entire football grounds.|$|E

Later that night, the West Stand burned down due to an {{electrical}} fault. Darlington's attendance record, of 21,023 against Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup fourth round, was set two months later. Under the management of Lol Morgan, they won promotion to the Third Division in 1966. A crowd of 16,000 watched the draw against Torquay United {{on the last day of}} the season which ensured they finished as runners-up, but they were relegated the following year.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in an Ultimate X match, which {{involved}} A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin, and the champion, Petey Williams, who {{was accompanied by}} Coach D'Amore. D'Amore was banned from ringside in the opening minutes of the contest. Styles at one point was climbing across the cables to retrieve the championship, when Sabin springboarded off the far top rope and performed a dropkick in mid-air to Styles. This caused Styles to perform a front-flip in mid-air and land {{on his back in}} the center of the ring. The finish of the match saw Williams and Sabin both hanging on the ropes, each holding <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> belt. Styles then springboarded off the far top rope and grabbed the belt in mid-flight. After he landed on the mat, he was declared the official winner.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} route also {{follows the}} river {{along the edge}} of the Laramie Mountains to an area near the current towns of Casper and Glenrock. In 1847, during the first Mormon emigration, Brigham Young established a ferry near present-day Casper known as Mormon Ferry. The next year the ferry was moved a few miles downriver. The ferry was free for Latter Day Saints, but charged a toll for other users. The ferry was manned by groups of Mormons every summer from 1848 until 1852. In 1853 John Baptiste Richard built a toll bridge near the ferry site, which would eventually put all ferries on the North Platte out of business. In 1859, Louis Guinard built the Platte Bridge near the site of the original Mormon Ferry. Guinard also built a trading post at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge which eventually became Fort Caspar.|$|E
