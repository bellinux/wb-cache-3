5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|Lead has no {{confirmed}} biological role. Its prevalence in {{the human}} body—at an adult average of 120mg—is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500mg) and iron (4000mg) among the heavy metals. Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body. A small amount <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> (1%) is stored in bones; the rest is excreted in urine and feces {{within a few weeks}} of exposure. Only about a third <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> is excreted by a child. Continual exposure may result in the bioaccumulation <b>of</b> <b>lead.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore <b>of</b> <b>lead,</b> often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction and use <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall}} of Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E

5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The {{regulation}} <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> {{in drinking water}} applications with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 made a reduction <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys.|$|E

50|$|Each type of Turk's head knot is {{classified}} {{according to the}} number <b>of</b> <b>leads</b> and bights and method of construction. The number of bights {{is the number of}} crossings it makes as it goes around the circumference of the cylinder. The number <b>of</b> <b>leads</b> is the number of strands around the circumference of the cylinder, before doubling, tripling, etc. Depending on the number <b>of</b> <b>leads</b> and bights, a Turk's head may be tied using a single strand or multiple strands. Mathematically, the number of strands is the greatest common divisor of the number <b>of</b> <b>leads</b> and the number of bights; the knot may be tied with a single strand if and only if the two numbers are coprime. For example, 3 lead × 5 bight (3×5), or 5 lead × 7 bight (5×7).|$|R

5|$|After antiquity, mention <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> {{poisoning}} {{was absent}} from medical literature {{until the end}} of the Middle Ages. In 1656 the German physician Samuel Stockhausen recognized dust and fumes containing lead compounds as the cause of disease, called since ancient Roman times morbi metallici, that were known to afflict miners, smelter workers, potters, and others whose work exposed them to the metal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels <b>of</b> <b>lead.</b> Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, {{second only to the}} manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily {{for the benefit of the}} birds and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E
50|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>leads</b> {{is always}} even. For 0.3 inch spacing, typical lead counts are 8, 14, 16, 18, and 28; less common are 4, 6, 20, and 24 lead counts. To {{have an even}} number <b>of</b> <b>leads</b> some DIPs have unused not {{connected}} (NC) leads to the internal chip, or are duplicated, e.g. two ground pins. For 0.6 inch spacing, typical lead counts are 24, 28, 32, and 40; less common are 36, 48, 52, and 64 lead counts. Some microprocessors, such as the Motorola 68000 and Zilog Z180, used lead counts as high as 64; this is typically the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>leads</b> for a DIP package.|$|R
