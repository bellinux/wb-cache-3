500|$|When {{thinking}} of a band name, someone suggested [...] "corn", but the band rejected that name, so Shaffer had the idea to spell the name with both a [...] "K" [...] instead of a [...] "C", and a backwards [...] "R", so the band's name would appear as [...] "KoЯn". The logo was designed by vocalist Jonathan Davis. Silveria explained, [...] "the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. But <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> established, it makes the name cool." ...|$|E

Watts remarked that he got ill whenever he stopped working. In July 2008 {{it was announced that}} the Rolling Stones were leaving EMI and signing with Vivendi's Universal Music, taking with them their catalogue stretching back to Sticky Fingers. New music released by the band while under this contract will be issued through Universal's Polydor label. Mercury Records will hold the US rights to the pre-1994 material, while the post-1994 material will be handled by Interscope Records (once a subsidiary of Atlantic).|$|E
500|$|The tone of {{baseball}} rivalries {{changed in the}} early 1990s; fraternization between players who had moved to different teams or knew each other from various ventures kept baseball rivalries to a [...] "friendly" [...] level. However, Major League Baseball's 1994 divisional re-alignment solidified the rivalry between the Phillies and Mets. The Pittsburgh Pirates, {{former members of the}} National League East and in-state rivals of the Phillies, moved into the newly created National League Central Division, and the Atlanta Braves, former members of the National League West, entered the division. Prior to the switch, the East Division contained seven teams, spread out over a wider geographical area, including the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs, as well as the expansion Florida Marlins. Members of all 28 teams, including the Phillies and Mets, drew together during the 1994 labor stoppage, but players from both teams were {{on opposite sides of the}} argument even then. Dykstra claimed that he was losing $30,000 ($ in current dollars) per day for every day he did not work during the strike. While other players chastised Dykstra for his comments, Mets pitcher and player representative John Franco intimated that if someone crossed the picket line, as Dykstra suggested, <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> back in I'll be the first to kick his [...]|$|E

500|$|Steven Lisberger stated on October 28, 2010, {{before the}} film's release, that a sequel was in {{planning}} and that Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, screenwriters for Tron: Legacy, were {{in the early stages}} of producing a script for the new film. Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 could be the first installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy. Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010). On April 8, 2011, director Joseph Kosinski talked about the sequel: [...] "We're working on the story right now. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a script we're all really happy with, we'll take it to the powers that be and see if we can go back to the grid. I think we will pick up with where Tron: Legacy left off with Sam and Quorra in the real world and what does that mean and the possibilities it opens up for the next chapter. It's that relationship between the two of them that's the next step." [...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E

[...] Wallenda lives by the mantra [...] "Never Give Up". [...] He believes that through hard work, one can achieve anything they desire. [...] "I think [...] what life is about", he remarks.

2500|$|According to creator Eric Kripke, {{the show}} {{originally}} {{was intended to}} focus on the weekly monsters, with Sam and Dean Winchester merely being [...] "an engine to get us in and out of different horror movies every week". His sole desire was to merely [...] "scare the crap out of people". However, a few episodes in, Kripke and executive producer Bob Singer noticed the onscreen chemistry between Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. This revelation caused them to change the series to focus more on the brothers than the monsters, basing the weekly monster around the storyline they wanted for the Winchesters. According to Kripke, [...] "...sometimes we don't even have the monster until way late in the break, <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> all the angst and the drama done first." ...|$|E
