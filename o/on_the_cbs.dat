40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} and compare scoring patterns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB 2 ̆ 6 M) in healthy men and women between 30 and 59 years of age. Methods: Following criterion testing on 5 individuals, 90 healthy volunteers who met the inclusion criteria and consented to participate in the study were tested <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M. The subjects were recruited through quota sampling in three age categories: 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, and 50 to 59 years, with 15 men and 15 women in each age category. The groups were not matched for any anthropometric variables. Results: Women within the age category of 50 to 59 years had significantly lower scores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M compared with all other age and gender categories. Conclusions: The results from this study indicate that although <b>the</b> items <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M were appropriate for the 30 - to 59 -year age categories, some items still posed a challenge to healthy participants because most were unable to score full points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M. The normative data from the present study could help clinicians put <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M scores of middle-aged patients into context. These data may also be useful in making recommendations regarding the safe integration of patients back into the community following mild stroke...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the support}} vector machine (SVM) is applied as a {{learning}} machine for the secondary structure prediction. As an encoding scheme for training the SVM, position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is adopted. To improve the prediction accuracy, three optimization processes such as encoding scheme, sliding window size and parameter optimization are performed. For the multi-class classification, the results of three one-versus-one binary classifiers (H/E, E/C and C/H) are combined using our new tertiary classifier called SVM_Represent. By applying this new tertiary classifier, the Q 3 prediction accuracy reaches 89. 6 % <b>on</b> <b>the</b> RS 126 dataset and 90. 1 % <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 513 dataset. Also the Segment Overlap Measure (SOV) is 85. 0 % <b>on</b> <b>the</b> RS 126 dataset and 85. 7 % <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 513 dataset. Compared with the existing best prediction methods, our new prediction algorithm improves the accuracy about 13 % in terms of Q 3 and SOV, the two most commonly used accuracy measures. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{high-performance}} {{method was}} developed for protein secondary structure prediction based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dual-layer support vector machine (SVM) and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs). SVM is a new machine learning technology that has been successfully applied in solving problems {{in the field of}} bioinformatics. The SVM’s performance is usually better than that of traditional machine learning approaches. The performance was further improved by combining PSSM profiles with the SVM analysis. The PSSMs were generated from PSI-BLAST profiles, which contain important evolution information. The final prediction results were generated from the second SVM layer output. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 513 data set, the three-state overall per-residue accuracy, Q 3, reached 75. 2 %, while segment overlap (SOV) accuracy increased to 80. 0 %. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 396 data set, the Q 3 of our method reached 74. 0 % and the SOV reached 78. 1 %.

Having been rapidly aged to a teenager, Victoria returned to the soap opera and was portrayed by Heather Tom. Tom portrayed the character into her early adult years and remained in the role for twelve years. Due to creative differences, Tom left the soap opera in 2003 and Heinle, who took over on March 21, 2005, was cast in the role.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel method for predicting the secondary structure of proteins, PREDICT (PRofile Enumeration DICTionary), {{in which the}} nearest-neighbor method is applied to a pattern space. For a given protein sequence, PSI-BLAST is used to generate a profile that defines patterns for amino acid residues and their local sequence environments. By applying the PSI-BLAST to protein sequences with known secondary structures, we construct pattern databases. The secondary structure of a query residue of a protein with unknown structure can be determined by comparing the query pattern {{with those in the}} pattern databases and selecting the patterns close to the query pattern. We have tested <b>the</b> PREDICT <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 513 set (a set of 513 non-homologous proteins) in three different ways. The first test was based on a pattern database derived from 7777 proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), including those homologous to proteins in <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 513 set and gave an average Q 3 score of 78. 8 % per chain. In the second test, in order to carry out a more stringent benchmark test <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 513 set, we removed from the 7777 proteins all proteins homologous to <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 513 set, leaving 4330 proteins. Pattern databases were constructed based on these proteins, and the average Q 3 score was 74. 6 %.
