5|$|Division champions are {{the primary}} {{separation}} criteria due to being non-closed competition. It includes title holders and interim title holders. Interim champions who become undisputed champions are listed only <b>once.</b> <b>People</b> with multiple title reigns will have each of them counted. Tournament wins are secondary due to many tournaments being country specific and thus not generally a national achievement to win. Runners-up and The Ultimate Fighter runners-up are not included.|$|E
5|$|Agatha is {{reconnected}} to the PreCrime system. While {{attempting to}} comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains {{that as he}} {{could not afford to}} let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: <b>once</b> <b>people</b> are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.|$|E

25|$|Gender egalitarian {{cultural}} principles, {{or changes}} in traditional gender norms, are one possible solution to occupational segregation {{in that they}} reduce discrimination, affect women's self-evaluations, and support structural changes. Horizontal segregation, however, is more resistant to change from simply modern egalitarian pressures. Changes in norms may reinforce the impact of occupational integration in that <b>once</b> <b>people</b> see women in traditionally male-dominated occupations, their expectations about women {{in the labor market}} might be changed.|$|E
25|$|The {{directed}} pathway {{was a more}} {{deliberate and}} directed process initiated by humans {{with the goal of}} domesticating a free-living animal. It probably only came into being <b>once</b> <b>people</b> were familiar with either commensal or prey-pathway domesticated animals. These animals were likely not to possess many of the behavioral preadaptions some species show before domestication. Therefore, the domestication of these animals requires more deliberate effort by humans to work around behaviors that do not assist domestication, with increased technological assistance needed.|$|E

Driven by Metamotivation, people are more spontaneous, free to be themselves, and explore their ultimate potential to create a fulfilled life.|$|R

But <b>once</b> <b>people</b> started hearing that and liking it, that's what built my confidence. I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was everything. To be the only person featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big."

2500|$|To {{respond to}} {{widespread}} criticism of Gamergate as misogynistic, posters on 4chan created a second Twitter hashtag, #NotYourShield, intended {{to show that}} Gamergate was not about opposition to feminism or wanting to push women out of gaming. In the 4chan post that may have coined the hashtag, it was framed {{as a way to}} [...] "demand the SJWs stop using you as a shield to deflect genuine criticism". Many of the accounts used to tweet the tag seemed to be sockpuppets that had copied their avatars from elsewhere on the internet; the methods used to create it have been compared to #EndFathersDay, a hoax manufactured on 4chan using similar methods. Quinn said that in light of Gamergate's exclusive targeting of women or those who stood up for women, [...] "#notyourshield was, ironically, solely designed to be a shield for this campaign <b>once</b> <b>people</b> started calling it misogynistic".

2500|$|The PNP {{mayor of}} Guaynabo, Héctor O'Neill, bought a few English-language stop signs in 1998, as {{to save some}} money (English signs were cheaper than Spanish ones because of economies of scale in the United States). At the {{suggestion}} of Rios Gracia 137, one of Guaynabo's Municipal Policemen who was in-charge of the Uniform Crime Reporting Office. Rios took a step further by creating the concept of Guaynabo City in all federal agencies in the United States (who had designed an English-language sign for his police unit), O'Neill had Ríos' sign design painted and {{placed in front of}} the police unit's office. He took the concept further and had a graphic artist redesign a new corporate identity for the city's police department. As he feared it would happen once he approved the proposed designs (O'Neill's candid reaction once he saw the proposed design for the police's patrol cars was reported in San Juan's El Vocero newspaper: [...] "This looks gorgeous! Yet, I fear this will be all fucked up <b>once</b> <b>people</b> get to know about this!"), he was soon reprimanded by pro-independence citizens of town and Spanish language purists in Puerto Rico for his use of English but was publicly praised by Don Eleuterio, who is also a native.
