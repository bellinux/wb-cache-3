5|$|Brown {{supports}} expanding solar, wind, {{and nuclear}} power, and offshore drilling exploration {{as a means}} to reduce the country's dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil.</b> But, when faced with the controversial issue of whether an offshore wind farm should be allowed in the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.|$|E
5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries their dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, {{there have been}} concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the {{threat to national security}} because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
25|$|Problems {{associated}} with oil supply include volatile oil prices, increasing world and domestic petroleum product demand, dependence <b>on</b> unstable imported <b>foreign</b> <b>oil,</b> falling domestic production (peak oil), and declining infrastructure, like the Alaska pipeline and oil refineries.|$|R

The only person that senses Melissa's discomfort is her grandmother, Elvira (Chaplin). However, Melissa feels completely isolated when Elvira is carted off to a retirement home.|$|R
5000|$|One {{historian}} opined that, [...] "if anything proves {{more remarkable}} than the ambitious {{scope of this}} study, it {{is the extent to}} which Painter accomplishes his objectives. It may also be the most important book yet written <b>on</b> America's <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> policy." [...] Others described it variously as [...] "exemplary" [...] and [...] "superb". The 1987 UK edition has not been out of print since its original publication.|$|R
5|$|Germany and Europe {{as a whole}} {{was almost}} totally {{dependent}} <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> imports. In an attempt to resolve the persistent shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched Fall Blau (Case Blue), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields. The Red Army launched a counter-offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces, who were trapped in Stalingrad on 23 November. Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but {{this turned out to be}} infeasible. Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war. Soviet forces continued to push the invaders westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk and by the end of 1943 the Germans had lost most of their territorial gains in the east.|$|E

25|$|Imports of {{petroleum}} products fell from 1.85% GDP in 2009 to 0.86% GDP in 2016. The U.S. was less reliant <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> {{than it has}} been in nearly 30 years.|$|E
40|$|Sri Lanka {{should look}} at {{alternative}} fuel sources to reduce its dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oils.</b> Diesel is the highest used petroleum product in the transport sector. Biodiesel extracted from non edible oils like Rubber Seed Oil (RSO) is one such alternative fuel that is feasible in Sri Lanka. However RSO contains high amount of free fatty acid (FF A). This lowers the yield of methyl ester (biodiesel) formation if alkaline esterification is performed directly. Therefore a two-step trans-esterification process is used to convert high FFA non-edible oils to_biodiesel. First step is acid easterification to reduce the FFA of oil and the second step is alkaline esterification to produce bio diesel from oil with FFA reduced. ln this study two of the major factors that affect {{the efficiency of the}} acid esterification step were investigated. The properties of biodiesel produced with standard biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel were also compared...|$|R
50|$|The Equato-Guinean {{budget has}} grown {{enormously}} {{in the past}} 3 years as royalties and taxes <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> company <b>oil</b> and gas production have provided new resources to a once poor government. The 2001 budget foresaw revenues of about 154 billion CFA francs (154 GCFAF) (about U.S.$200 million), up about 50% from 2000 levels. Oil revenues account for about two-thirds of government revenue, and VAT and trade taxes are the other large revenue sources.|$|R

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} interest in biofuels – bioethanol and biodiesel – derived from common agricultural staples or waste. Increased domestic production of these fuels could reduce US expenditure <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> and improve energy security if methods of producing and transporting the fuels do not involve heavy inputs of fossil fuels, as current agriculture does.|$|E
25|$|Propane autogas is a {{domestically}} produced {{alternative fuel}} which {{costs less than}} conventional fuels. Over the past 30 years, propane autogas has cost, on average, 30 percent less than gasoline and 40 percent less than diesel. More than 90 percent is produced in the U.S. (and an additional 7 percent from Canada), which lessens American dependency <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil.</b> The fuel burns substantially cleaner than gasoline or diesel.|$|E
50|$|Edwards endorses the {{widespread}} goal of 80% reductions {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions below 1990 levels by the year 2050. He has denounced the Bush administration for not signing the Kyoto treaty and supports the McCain-Lieberman bill to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This would involve capping emissions, reducing the cap every year, and auctioning off the right to emit a certain quantity of greenhouse gases. He would then use this estimated $10 billion to fund research for alternative energy sources, {{in an effort to}} end the United States reliance <b>on</b> imported <b>foreign</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Democratic {{plan for}} {{achieving}} {{an end to}} American dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> countries for <b>oil</b> consists of repealing tax incentives given to oil companies, higher penalties for price gouging gasoline products, increasing tax incentives and funding for {{the research and development}} of technologies intended to improve fuel-efficiency and creating viable alternative fuel supplies such as biofuels.|$|R
30|$|High {{gasoline}} prices, global warming, {{pollution and}} dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> sources of <b>oil</b> are four major issues {{the world is}} facing today.

25|$|Economics {{professor}} Robert Pollin {{has influenced}} the national discussion {{about how best}} to stimulate the US economy and promote sustainability. He and colleagues at the Political Economy Research Institute have developed a plan for national recovery that shows, for example, that investing in clean energy (wind power, solar, and biofuels) will create about three times as many good-paying jobs than conventional projects will, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
25|$|In China, {{due to an}} {{increasing}} need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel. This is probably because China prefers not to be dependent <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil,</b> instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing {{during the first half}} of 2009, the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.|$|E
25|$|Gingrich also {{published}} Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less: A Handbook for Slashing Gas Prices and Solving Our Energy Crisis, which outlines {{a plan for}} reducing both gas prices and America's dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil.</b> Throughout the book, Gingrich argues that gas prices and overall rising energy costs are a reflection of bad government policy rather than a scarcity of resources. Gingrich proposes tapping into American oil reserves along with pursuing other energy resources including nuclear, coal and renewable energy resources.|$|E
50|$|GasHole is a {{documentary}} {{film about the}} history of oil prices and the future of alternative fuels. The film was completed in 2008, premiered and released directly to DVD in 2010.

5|$|From {{the start}} of the war, a British {{blockade}} on shipments to Germany affected the Reich economy. The Germans were particularly dependent <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> supplies of <b>oil,</b> coal and grain. To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered an attack on Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|R

The museum's {{holdings}} began with its first director, Franjo Stiplovšek, who brought them from Krško (the Aumann collection); they were later expanded and divided into archeological, ethnological, and historical exhibitions (the last focusing on the peasant revolt). There is also a gallery focusing <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> and domestic <b>oil</b> paintings.|$|R
25|$|McAuliffe has {{declined}} to go into detail on his stance on many of his own views on energy and environmental policy, sticking to broad outlines. McAuliffe believes human activity has contributed to global warming, and characterizes clean energy as a national security issue. He supports reducing dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> through investment in technologies such as carbon capture and storage, solar farms, and offshore wind turbines. McAuliffe was endorsed by billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer and the League of Conservation Voters.|$|E
25|$|The Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program (EEETP) aims {{to improve}} air {{quality in the}} US and reduce {{dependence}} <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> supplies. There are three key areas of research; electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production. Buildings, which account for 39% of US electricity consumption as of 2012, are a key area of research as the program aims to create affordable, carbon-neutral homes by 2020. Research also takes place into higher efficiency solar panels, geothermal electricity and heating, lower cost wind generators and the economic and environmental feasibility of potential hydro power plants.|$|E
25|$|Current {{technology}} for plug-ins {{is based on}} the lithium-ion battery and an electric motor, and the demand for lithium, heavy metals and other rare elements (such as neodymium, boron and cobalt) required for the batteries and powertrain is expected to grow significantly due to the incoming market entrance of plug-ins and electric vehicles in the mid and long term. Some of the largest world reserves of lithium and other rare metals are located in countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests, raising concerns about the risk of replacing dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> with a new dependence on hostile countries to supply strategic materials. Even though the metals used in electric vehicle batteries are rare, they can be recycled.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{knowledge}} of the existence of oil reserves in Venezuela for centuries, the first [...] oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early 1910s. In 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez replaced his ailing predecessor, Cipriano Castro, as the president of Venezuela. [...] Over the next few years, Gómez granted several concessions to explore, produce, and refine oil. [...] Most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends, and they in turn passed them <b>on</b> to <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> companies that could actually develop them. [...] One such concession was granted to Rafael Max Valladares who hired Caribbean Petroleum Company (later acquired by Royal Dutch Shell) to carry out his oil exploration project. On 15 April 1914, upon the completion of the [...] (now called MG-I) oil well, the first Venezuelan oilfield of importance, , was discovered by Caribbean Petroleum in the Maracaibo Basin. [...] This major discovery encouraged a massive wave of <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> companies to Venezuela in an attempt {{to get a piece of}} the action.|$|R
5000|$|In the spring, the U.S. makes a {{deal with}} Russia to send [...] of oil by tanker, but the oil {{companies}} involved subsequently make {{a deal with}} China, which, equally hungry for oil and with greater financial reserves, outbids the U.S. This leaves America in a state of chaos, as well leading to soul-searching on whether China has now become the world's economic superpower. The country considers fast-tracking development of alternative energy sources, but there is little that can be done in the short-term to alter an economy structurally dependent <b>on</b> cheap <b>foreign</b> <b>oil.</b> Later, the U.S. government, showing unexpected diplomatic skill, resurrects the Russian oil deal by agreeing to a $16 billion long-term investment in its oil industry, and the China-bound tankers change course to the United States.|$|R
50|$|When the Energy Office {{was closed}} in 1995, NYSERDA took on {{critical}} energy efficiency, energy assessments, energy planning, and policy analysis functions.

Simultaneous global events highlighted the need for energy security and less reliance <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> sources of <b>oil,</b> and signaled a renewed need for increased focus on protecting the environment.|$|R
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016, Sioux Indians and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe began a protest against {{construction}} of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, {{also known as the}} Bakken pipeline, which, if completed, is designed to carry hydrofracked crude oil from the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota to the oil storage and transfer hub of Patoka, Illinois. The pipeline travels only half a mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and is designed to pass underneath the Missouri River and upstream of the reservation, causing many concerns over the tribe's drinking water safety, environmental protection, and harmful impacts on culture. The pipeline company claims that the pipeline will provide jobs, reduce American dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> and reduce the price of gas.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{organization}} Republicans for Environmental Protection ("REP") gave Brownback a grade of 7 {{percent for the}} 107th United States Congress, but in 2006, increased the rating to 26%. Senator Brownback supported {{an amendment to the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005, offered by Senator Jeff Bingaman, (D-NM), requiring at least 10 percent of electricity sold by utilities to originate from renewable resources. He has also supported conservation of rare felids & canids. He has voted for increased funding for international conservation of cranes. Brownback has supported oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and in the Gulf of Mexico, as a way to reduce dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil.</b> He has promoted the use of renewable energy such as nuclear, wind, solar, and hydroelectric sources to achieve energy independence.|$|E
25|$|If {{energy for}} {{hydrogen}} production were available (from wind, solar, fission or fusion nuclear power etc.), {{use of the}} substance for hydrocarbon synfuel production could expand captive use of hydrogen {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10. Present U.S. use of hydrogen for hydrocracking is roughly 4Mt per year. It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil. Coal liquefaction would present significantly worse emissions of carbon dioxide than does the current system of burning fossil petroleum, but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in US oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in North America.|$|E
40|$|How can {{countries}} in Asia avoid the pitfalls {{faced by the}} United States, with its oil problems?

50|$|Offshore {{exploration}} and drilling were first {{undertaken in the}} early 1970s, and it became more widespread and advanced as the decade progressed. Chinese and <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> experts believed that offshore deposits were extensive and could equal onshore reserves. Offshore operations relied heavily <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> technology. In 1982 thirty-three <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> companies submitted bids for offshore drilling rights; twenty-seven eventually signed contracts. By the mid-1980s, when offshore exploration results were disappointing and {{only a handful of}} wells were actually producing oil, China began to emphasize onshore development. To continue offshore exploration, China established the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) to assist <b>foreign</b> <b>oil</b> companies in exploring, developing, extracting, and marketing China's oil.|$|R
40|$|CHDS State/LocalSince the 1970 s, every American {{president}} and many Congressional leaders {{have called for}} national energy independence as a top policy priority. Among many reasons the United States (U. S.) {{has been unable to}} deliver on this goal over four decades are certain environmental policies that may tend to inhibit efficiency in fuel consumption of vehicles. This study examines the unintended consequences of certain environmental policies for American homeland security. The analyses suggest that some environmental policies may have a deleterious effect on the ability of the United States to achieve a level of energy efficiency in the transportation sector that could contribute to achieving national energy security. This study suggests ways to achieve a level of sustainable energy security by reducing consumption in the most important petroleum consuming sector, that of automobile transportation. Some U. S. oil dollars may be directly supporting terrorist organizations or, at a minimum, go toward supporting the spread of radical Islamic Salafism that is inimical to U. S. and Western interests. This inquiry examines evidence to show that Americas continuing dependence <b>on</b> other <b>foreign</b> <b>oil,</b> especially oil from the Middle East, is perilous to homeland security and compels limits to U.
