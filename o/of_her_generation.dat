5|$|In Variety opinion, Johansson's {{roles in}} Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring {{established}} her {{as among the}} most versatile actresses <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>generation.</b> Johansson had five releases in 2004, three of which—the teen heist film The Perfect Score, the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long, and the drama A Good Woman—were critical and commercial failures. Co-starring with John Travolta, Johansson played a discontented and suspicious teenager in A Love Song for Bobby Long, {{which is based on}} the novel Off Magazine Street by Ronald Everett Capps. Variety David Rooney wrote that Johansson's and Travolta's portrayals rescued the film. Johansson earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama nomination for the film.|$|E

25|$|The {{closing down}} of the {{university}} system led Chang, like most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>generation,</b> away from the political maelstroms of the academy. Instead, she spent several years as a peasant, a barefoot doctor (a part-time peasant doctor), a steelworker and an electrician, though she received no formal training because of Mao's policy, which did not require formal instruction as a prerequisite for such work.|$|E

25|$|She {{received}} a strict {{education at the}} court of Baden in Karlsruhe, becoming a cultured woman.

Upon her marriage, she converted to the Russian Orthodox faith and took the name Olga Fyodorovna with the title of Grand Duchess of Russia.

25|$|The filly {{was never}} entered {{for any of}} the British Classic Races but proved herself the best <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>generation</b> by beating the winners of both The Derby and The Oaks in the space of three days at Newmarket in October 1831. In the {{following}} year she won the Ascot Gold Cup, the year's most important weight-for-age race in a run-off after being held to a dead heat by the St Leger winner Rowton. From the summer of 1832, few owners were willing to try their horses against her and she won several prizes by walkover or forfeit. She was retired from racing after sustaining an injury in the spring of 1834. She made little impact as a broodmare and died in 1841.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, {{reviews from}} feminists <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>{{generation}}</b> were more positive.

Petipa was so enamored with the stellar ballerina that he bestowed upon her the rarely held title of Prima ballerina assoluta, and {{over the course of the}} next eight years, Petipa staged many new ballets especially for her talents.|$|E
25|$|Eriksson's {{father was}} an innkeeper with the surname Lambert, but in 1797, her mother married E.

That same year, she married the choirmaster Johan Fredrik Wikström. In the first years of her career, she was considered pretty and nothing more; she had her breakthrough in 1820, when she played Ophelia instead of Carolina Kuhlman and was highly admired for her realistic interpretation of insanity.|$|E
25|$|Schooling came to her, {{as it was}} apt {{to come to a}} girl of her period, {{intermittently}} and in variety. She spent a year in a small {{boarding school}} in Plattsburg; an interval at a school kept at the Shurtliff homestead in Middlebury; attendance at the Middlebury Female Semimary; a winter at a village Academy in Rutland, where she recited Latin with boys preparing to enter college as sophomores; and a term or two at “Old T. C. A.” It was at Middlebury, in a one-story school house on Pleasant Street ,that she began the study of Latin, the subject of all others most useful in her adult life, as she declared. There, too, under Father Merrill, she wrote on the blackboard the list of English kings from Julius Caesar to William the Fourth, without a blunder. The feat was recalled by President John M. Thomas when in 1910 he conferred on her the degree of Doctor of Letters from Middlebury College, an honor which with characteristic modesty she accepted as a tribute to the women <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E

Grand Duke Andrei sat next to his hostess during the dinner, but accidentally spilt a glass of red wine on her. Mathilde, attracted to the young grand duke, seven years her junior, took the incident as good omen. Age 28, Mathilde had been the mistress of Tsar Nicholas II when he was heir to the throne. Their two-year relationship ended with Nicholas' engagement to his future wife, Alexandra. Mathilde was ambitious and eager to maintain her close relationship with the Romanovs. She subsequently began a long time affair with Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich of Russia, Nicholas and Andrei's first cousin once removed. As she was not in love with Sergei, but enjoyed his company and protection, Mathilde pursued a relationship with Grand Duke Andrei, the third Romanov to become involved with her. By July 1900, they became lovers, traveling together that summer to Biarritz and Paris. In the autumn 1901, they visited several Italian cities, including Venice, Padua, Florence and Rome. Grand Duke Sergei tolerated their affair, remaining a close and loyal friend to the famous ballerina, but {{the relationship between the two}} grand dukes grew tense. They tried to avoid each other and maintain civility while sharing the same woman for almost two decades.|$|E

This made a strong impression on him, and he soon fell in love with pop artists like Rauschenberg, and Warhol, and surrealists like Marcel Duchamp, artists that would contribute to his later art and lifestyle.|$|R
