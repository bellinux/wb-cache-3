5|$|A Windows {{compatible}} Kinect 2.0 {{was released}} on July 15, 2014. Kinect 2.0 was released as a standalone and optional item in October 2014; it is bundled with a digital copy of Dance Central Spotlight. The Kinect {{was the source of}} controversy due to the huge price of the system as a result of being bundled with the system. It was removed from the Xbox <b>One</b> <b>bundle</b> in May 2014 and production stopped entirely on October 25, 2017.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the game's standard edition, players can purchase the game's Season Pass, which adds new in-game items, locations, quests, and bosses. There is also a Day One Edition, which includes three different downloadable content items: [...] "Nothin' but the Hits" [...] gun, the Hardcore Hammer, and a Fizzie costume. Players who pre-ordered the game from Xbox Live Marketplace also got two additional weapons: the Accordes de la Muerte and the Hangover. A white Xbox <b>One</b> <b>bundle</b> was also released for the game. To promote the game, Insomniac organized a series of shows called the Sunset TV. They provided new information to players regarding the game prior to its release. Microsoft also launched a website called Sunset Overdrive: Walter's Workshop, which is a browser game that allows players {{to use some of}} the weapons featured in the game with footage captured in real-life.|$|E

The old man replied that <b>one</b> <b>bundle</b> was for “Remember” in [...] (20:8 in NJPS) and one was for “Observe” in [...] (5:12 in NJPS).

2500|$|It {{may seem}} from the Latency vs. Channels per bundle table that more {{information}} can be sent at a lower latency. [...] However, {{that is not the}} case. [...] More channels can be sent per bundle, but fewer bundles can be processed simultaneously by one device. [...] So, while eight 24-bit, 96kHz channels can be sent in <b>one</b> <b>bundle</b> at [...] ms latency, due to processing constraints, the CobraNet device may only be able to send and receive <b>one</b> <b>bundle</b> instead of the usual four. [...] The bundle capacity of CobraNet devices are unique to the particular device, and are not always the same. [...] The Channels per bundle vs. test case latencies table illustrates the bundle capacity for a Biamp AudiaFLEX-CM DSP device. [...] The Rx and Tx columns indicate the absolute maximum number of channels that can be received or transmitted. [...] The Rx/Tx column represents the maximum number of channels that can be received and transmitted simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|On December 18, 2014, Dovetail Games {{released}} Flight Simulator X on Steam titled Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition. It includes {{content that}} was {{provided with the}} original FSX: Gold Edition which includes FSX: Deluxe Edition, the Acceleration expansion pack and both official Service Packs and repackages them in <b>one</b> <b>bundle</b> and a single installation. The Steam Edition includes {{an overhaul of the}} multiplayer support to go through Steam rather than the now-defunct GameSpy, improved stability on Windows 7 and 8, and features minor performance tweaks including a complete recompile using VS2013.|$|E
2500|$|As long as {{multicast}} bundles {{are used}} sparingly, {{it is virtually}} impossible to exceed the bandwidth of a 100Mbit network with CobraNet data. [...] However, there are limitations to the maximum number of bundles that can be sent on a network, since the conductor must include data in its beat packets for every bundle on the network, and the beat packet is limited to 1,500bytes. [...] If each device is transmitting <b>one</b> <b>bundle,</b> there may be up to 184transmitters active simultaneously (for a total of 184 bundles). [...] If each device is transmitting four bundles, then only 105 transmitters can be active, although they would be producing a total of 421 active bundles. [...] The use of private bundles does not require any additional data in the beat packet, so these network limitations can be sidestepped by using private bundles.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{and after}} the mandate, all Xbox One {{consoles}} initially shipped with the Kinect sensor included. On June 9, 2014, cheaper Xbox <b>One</b> <b>bundles</b> were introduced, which {{did not include the}} Kinect sensor. Microsoft stated the decision to offer Xbox <b>One</b> <b>bundles</b> without Kinect was to [...] " [...] a choice to people that would allow people to buy an Xbox One and then ramp up to Kinect when they can afford to", while also allowing games to use processing power that was previously reserved for Kinect. An updated Xbox Development Kit issued in June 2014 allows developers to explicitly disable motion tracking functionality in games, allowing access to additional system resources that represent about 10% of the GPU processing power. These resources were previously reserved for Kinect skeletal tracking, regardless of whether the Kinect sensor was attached or in use.|$|R
50|$|Creating {{an optical}} disc usually {{involves}} first creating an optical disc image {{with a full}} file system designed for the optical disc, and then actually burning the image to the disc.

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the absence of one the four kinds of plants used for the lulav — the palm-branch, the etrog, the myrtle, or the willow — invalidates the others.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2002[...] The Gemara {{explained}} that this is because [...] says, [...] "And you shall take," [...] signifying the taking of them all together. Rav Hanan bar Abba argued that one who has all of the four species fulfills the requirement even if one does not take them in hand bound together. They raised an objection from a Baraita that taught: Of the four kinds used for the lulav, two — the etrog and the palm — are fruit-bearing, and two — the myrtle and the willow — are not. Those that bear fruit must be joined with those that do not bear fruit, and those that do not bear fruit must be joined with those that bear fruit. Thus a person does not fulfill the obligation unless they are all bound in <b>one</b> <b>bundle.</b> And so it is, the Baraita taught, with Israel's conciliation with God: It is achieved only when the people of Israel are united as one group..|$|E

An action button on top of the unit is provided for user setup in a new location, and the mute button allows the microphones to be turned off. The top half-inch of the unit rotates to increase or decrease the speaker volume. The Echo must be plugged in to operate since it has no internal battery.|$|R
50|$|Bundled pricing is the {{approach}} of selling products and their accessories or other options as one product for one price. Consumers will not need to purchase each item separately but <b>one</b> <b>bundled</b> item and priced as one product. This would also be appealing to customers as normally they would be on sales and has the original price still tagged on the product to emphasize the price difference. For instance, retailers will offer a bundle deal for purchasing a new computer with its accessories, such as keyboard and mouse pad (Quinonez, 2014).|$|R

50|$|The burial mound {{was first}} {{investigated}} in 1936 by its owner Spurgeon C. Mangum, a farmer. Mangum found human remains, various pottery fragments {{belonging to the}} Plaquemine culture, chunkey stones, and three fragments of a repoussé copper plate with an avian design similar to other plates found throughout the American Midwest and Southeast. These portray the Birdman motif important to the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC). The site underwent a series of test excavations in April 1951 {{as part of the}} Natchez Trace Park Survey. During these excavations, twelve extended burials and possibly <b>one</b> <b>bundled</b> burial were found.|$|R

Could there be any doubt in her mind that it had been resolved to circularize the provinces with Leaflet No. 3, or to issue a statistical diagram showing the proportion of married women to spinsters in New Zealand; or that the net profits of Mrs. Hipsley's Bazaar had reached a total of five pounds eight shillings and twopence half-penny? ...|$|E

Several of the effects, as, for instances, {{those with}} helices(1066.), with {{according}} or counter currents (1097. 1098.), {{and those on}} the production of lateral currents (1090.), appeared to indicate that a current could produce an effect of induction in a neighbouring wire more readily than in its own carrying wire, in which case it might be expected that some variation of result would be produced if a bundle of wires were used as a conductor instead of a single wire. In consequence the following experiments were made. A copper wire one twenty-third of an inch in diameter was cut into lengths of five feet each, and six of these being laid {{side by side in}} <b>one</b> <b>bundle,</b> had their opposite extremities soldered to two terminal pieces of copper. This arrangement {{could be used as a}} discharging wire, but the general current could be divided into six parallel streams, which might be brought close together, or, by the separation of the wires, be taken more or less out of each other's influence. A somewhat brighter spark was, I think, obtained on breaking contact when the six wires were close together than when held asunder.|$|E
50|$|Most {{optical disc}} {{authoring}} utilities create a disc image and copy {{it to the}} disc in <b>one</b> <b>bundled</b> operation, so that end-users often {{do not know the}} distinction between creating and burning. However, it is useful to know because creating the disc image is a time-consuming process, while copying the image is much faster. Most disc burning applications silently delete the image from the Temporary folder after making one copy. If users override this default, telling the application to preserve the image, they can reuse the image to create more copies. Otherwise, they must rebuild the image each time they want a copy.|$|R
