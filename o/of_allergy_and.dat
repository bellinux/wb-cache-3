40|$|P>Natural killer (NK) cells {{bridge the}} {{interface}} between innate and adaptive immunity and are implicated in the control of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV- 2) infection. In subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1), the critical impact of the innate immune response on disease progression has recently come into focus. Higher numbers of NK cells are associated with lower HIV- 1 plasma viraemia. Individuals with the compound genotype of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3 DS 1 and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -Bw 4 - 80 I, or who have alleles of KIR 3 DL 1 that encode proteins highly expressed on the NK cell surface, have a significant delay in disease progression. We studied the effect of HSV- 2 co-infection in HIV- 1 -infected subjects, and show that HSV- 2 co-infection results in a pan-lymphocytosis, with elevated absolute numbers of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, and NK cells. The NK cells in HSV- 2 co-infected subjects functioned more efficiently, {{with an increase in}} degranulation after in vitro stimulation. The number of NK cells expressing the activating receptors NKp 30 and NKp 46, and expressing KIR 3 DL 1 or KIR 3 DS 1, was inversely correlated with HIV- 1 plasma viral load in subjects mono-infected with HIV- 1, but not in subjects co-infected with HSV- 2. This suggests that HSV- 2 infection mediates changes within the NK cell population that may affect immunity in HIV- 1 infection.

25|$|In the United States {{physicians}} holding certification by the American Board <b>of</b> <b>Allergy</b> <b>and</b> Immunology (ABAI) {{have successfully}} completed an accredited educational program and evaluation process, including a proctored examination to demonstrate knowledge, skills, {{and experience in}} patient care in allergy and immunology. Becoming an allergist/immunologist requires completion of at least nine years of training. After completing medical school and graduating with a medical degree, a physician will undergo three years of training in internal medicine (to become an internist) or pediatrics (to become a pediatrician). Once physicians have finished training {{in one of these}} specialties, they must pass the exam of either the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP), the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics (AOBP), the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), or the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine (AOBIM). Internists or pediatricians wishing to focus on the sub-specialty of allergy-immunology then complete at least an additional two years of study, called a fellowship, in an allergy/immunology training program. Allergist/immunologists listed as ABAI-certified have successfully passed the certifying examination of the ABAI following their fellowship.|$|E
25|$|IgE, the IgE {{synthesis}} pathway, and the IgE-mediated allergic/inflammatory pathway are {{all important}} targets in intervening with the pathological processes of allergy, asthma, and other IgE-mediated diseases. The B lymphocyte differentiation and maturation pathway that eventually generate IgE-secreting plasma cells {{go through the}} intermediate steps of IgE-expressing B lymphoblasts and involves the interaction with IgE-expressing memory B cells. Tanox, a biotech company based in Houston, Texas, proposed in 1987 that by targeting membrane-bound IgE (mIgE) on B lymphoblast and memory B cells, those cells can be lysed or down-regulated, thus achieving the inhibition of the production of antigen-specific IgE and hence a shift of immune balance toward non-IgE mechanisms. Two approaches targeting the IgE pathway were evolved and both are in active development. In the first approach, the anti-IgE antibody drug omalizumab (trade name Xolair) recognises IgE not bound to its receptors and is used to neutralise or mop-up existing IgE and prevent it from binding to the receptors on mast cells and basophils. Xolair has been approved in many countries for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma. It has also been approved in March 2014 in the European Union and the U. S. for treating chronic spontaneous urticaria, which cannot be adequately treated with H1-antihistamines. In the second approach, antibodies specific for a domain of 52 amino acid residues, referred to as CεmX or M1’ (M1 prime), present only on human mIgE on B cells and not on free, soluble IgE, have been prepared and are under clinical development for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>allergy</b> <b>and</b> asthma. An anti-M1’ humanized antibody, quilizumab, is in phase IIb clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|Emory University {{research}} is heavily {{funded by the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Institutes of Health. The federal agency awarded the university nearly $300 million {{in the fiscal year}} of 2015. In 2015, Emory University was one of four institutions selected by the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Allergy</b> <b>and</b> Infectious Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research and reduce the global burden of the disease. In 2015, an Emory-led research consortium received a five-year, 15 million dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research human immune responses to Varicella zoster virus and pneumococcal vaccination. The university also received a $9 million grant over five years from the NIH to support one of three national Centers for Collaborative Research in Fragile X syndrome. The grant is a renewal of Emory’s National Fragile X Research Center, continuously funded by the NIH for more than 10 years. In 2015, the university received a $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) to better understand the role of reactive oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In 2015, the university received a $8 million grant over five years from the NIH to develop and validate mathematical models of how prior immunity affects recall immune responses to influenza viruses. The researchers will create and disseminate powerful, user-friendly modeling tools for use by the wider research community in developing more effective vaccines. In 2015, the university received a $3.6 million grant over five years from the NIH {{to examine the effects of}} maternal stress on brain function, development, and behavior in African-American infants, including the biochemical connection between the brain and the microbiome. In 2015, the university received a $3.5 million grant over five years from the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) for an Informatics Technology for Cancer Research award. Winship Cancer Institute and Emory School of Medicine researchers will develop software tools to help the cancer research community gain new insights from cancer imaging “big data” and develop new open-source cancer research applications. In 2015, the university received a $3.4 million grant from the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research Program to support a partnership between the Emory Vaccine Center and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi, India to study dengue virus infection in India.|$|E
