The IRA ownership of private equity is usually expressed {{as a percentage of}} ownership in the company or as a number of shares of stock. The IRS puts restrictions on private equity investments that can be made by an IRA. It cannot purchase stock that the IRA holder already owns. Earnings from the entity may be subject to UBIT if the company has earnings from debt or has earnings from the sale <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> most cases, neither the IRA holder nor any disqualified persons to the plan can be employed by the company while the IRA has an equity position in that company. The IRA cannot be a general partner in a LP or LLP, and it cannot invest in an S-corporation. Unlike prohibited transactions that are rules governing IRAs, the restriction on IRA investment in an S-corporation is an S-corp rule. A entity is not eligible for Subchapter S taxation if it has IRA shareholdersand its S-corp election is terminated if an IRA becomes a shareholder.|$|E

50|$|Though it is {{sometimes}} difficult to draw the limits between translation and localization, in general localization addresses significant, non-textual components <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> addition to translation (and, therefore, grammar and spelling issues that vary {{from place to place}} where the same language is spoken), the localization process might include adapting graphics; adopting local currencies; using proper format for date and time, addresses, and phone numbers applicable to the location; the choices of colours; and many other details, including rethinking the physical structure of a product. All these changes aim to recognise local sensitivities, avoid conflict with local culture, customs, common habits, and enter the local market by merging into its needs and desires. For example, localization aims to offer country-specific websites of the same company or different editions of a book depending on where it is published. It must be kept in mind that a political entity such as a country {{is not the same as}} a language or culture; even in countries where there exists a substantially identical relationship between a language and a political entity, there are almost certainly multiple cultures and multiple minority languages even if the minority languages are spoken by transient populations. For instance, Japan's national language is Japanese and is the primary language for over 99% of the population, but the country recognizes 11 languages officially, others are spoken by transient populations, and others are spoken as second or other languages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Nowadays, {{the effects}} of human {{societies}} have increased on environment due to technological and industrial development. So environment variations could affect human beings like other animal species. Given the importance of environmental costs, one can consider them as a parts of final cost <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> business units, so failure to report these costs in financial statements cause to firstly that environmental costs remain hidden and unknown to the management and necessary actions to control them fail to do, and secondly that failure to report environmental costs as a parts of final cost would undermine the most important qualitative characteristic of accounting information namely their reliability. This environmental accounting facilitates environmental costs management and reducing costs through making the relationships between costs and their underlying activities. Researches in recent years led to the criticism about the framework of traditional financial reporting {{and its ability to}} provide a complete list of company activities and its accountability. Social and environmental reporting is a tool to account companies against their performance. The reports should provide impartial information which allows beneficiaries to provide a reliable estimation of their social and environmental performance.

The main aim is to foster the designer empathy allowing her/him to directly feel the effect of the impairment in first person. Specifically, a desktop haptic device is employed to induce a programmable hand-tremor, that is typically observed in people affected by some kind of neurological diseases, on healthy subjects (i. e. the designers). The developed tool is based on a wrist-attached haptic interface with a workspace that is comparable to that of the arm of the user. Such device is able to exert controlled forces on the user's wrist and induces a hand-tremor whose frequency and amplitude are correlated with those measured on impaired people. The control of the device is based on a custom trajectory-tracking algorithm that takes as input tremor signals that are acquired on patients using an optical motion tracking system. In this paper, we present the employed haptic system, the structure of the control system and the experimental validation of the controller done through the acquisition of data on six patients affected by Parkinson's disease...|$|E

40|$|Currently, the {{electronic}} commerce (E-Commerce) knows an important growth, {{which results in}} the emergence of many commercial sites on the Internet network. The web sites of the providers propose to the consumers offers <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> electronic catalogues. Ontologies are generally used for the purpose of modelling the catalogues. In order to facilitate to the users the search of products or services, the commercial companies that are offering the same type of products gather their sites in electronic market places (E-Market Places) in which the transactions are guided by the use of a global catalogue that contains all the offers. We analyse in this paper the problems related to the E-Commerce, particularly the management problem of {{the electronic}} catalogues in the E-Market Places. For modelling the electronic catalogues, we propose a logical approach, based on Description Logics (DLs) issued from knowledge representation. We show how the reasoning services provided by knowledge representation systems based on DLs can support the operations of automatic cataloguing. The electronic commerce (E-Commerce) currently knows an important growth. The Internet network contributes to this growth at several levels by increasing the speed and the effectiveness of the commercial transactions, by improving the consumer services and by reducing the transaction costs [27].

40|$|Consumers’ {{perceptions}} of their resources in consumption tasks (that is, their abilities and endowments to perform consumption tasks) are many times not accurate. This misjudgement of resources negatively influences their performance in consuming or using products and services. Further, this carries on to influence consumers’ perceived value <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> order to represent this phenomenon, consumer calibration {{is defined as the}} agreement between the subjective and objective assessment of consumer resources required in a consumption task. Therefore, it is crucial to discover the role of consumer calibration in the consumption experience. This paper proposes that consumer calibration occurs at two levels: of the task and of the self. Consumer task calibration refers to the extent of error in the task-required resource appraisal, whereas consumer self-calibration is the degree of accuracy in one’s self-perception of abilities. This systematic literature review is conducted to explore the relationships between consumer self and task calibration, on the one hand, and consumer value, on the other hand. After screening 2297 studies, based on their relevance and quality, forty texts in three main academic domains of Marketing, Psychology and Information Systems are selected for analysis and synthesis. The results reveal that subjective and objective assessments of consumer resources and task-required resources influence consumer value through their impact on functional performance and emotional consequences. The findings also suggest that, although a relationship between consumer task and self-calibration exists, their relationship with consumer value and their emotional consequences need further scrutiny. Consequently, a model for the effect of consumer calibration on consumer value is developed, based on the relationships established in the literature reviewed and the interpretation of the findings in the studies reviewed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{the modern}} service economy, the {{consumer}} satisfaction {{is one of}} primary objectives that a company aims at achieving. Successful companies offer high quality <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> {{order to meet the}} consumers’ expectation, and, at the same time, they safeguard their own profits and increase market competitiveness. The consumer satisfaction is an indicator to estimate how likely a customer will make a purchase in the future and it is used as a metric very useful in managing and monitoring the company businesses. To address this issue, we present QuAM (Quality Assessment Model), a model for evaluating the overall quality and value of services supplied by a company, through the analysis of the consumer satisfaction. The quality is measured indeed, by the definition of some subjective criteria that are collected through a question form filled in by the consumers. The consumers’ judgments about the supplied items/services allow evaluating the reputation as well as the success of a company. In this work, QuAM has been applied in the electricity network domain, in order to assess an electricity company. In this domain, the overall evaluation of the organization is based on measuring service quality in terms of response times and cost. The quality of service often comes at a cost, with a concern that the pursuit of profit incentives by utilities may {{have a negative effect on}} the quality of service. The role of customers is crucial to estimate a market demand curve for service quality, and maximize the customers satisfaction means increasing profitability, productivity and the corporate image. QuAM has been designed by exploiting a fuzzy linguistic approach along with the Computing with Words (CWW) paradigm: the customers feedbacks are modeled through linguistic labels, which naturally fit to describe human judgments; then a linguistic operator (Linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging) allows aggregating all the collected judgments into a synthetic linguistic expression. Finally, heuristic measures enable a comprehensive company evaluation...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis contributes original knowledge through an inclusive design approach to lowering language and communication barriers in healthcare and suggests shifting the discussion from culture to context to lower intra-cultural hindrances towards learning English amongst some ethnic minorities. It offers an adaptable, scalable concept for gathering data on ethnic minorities (considering both different generations and religions) and employs a framework based analysis in design. Over the course of three studies grounded on theoretical insights from literature, primary research {{lead to the development}} and testing of innovative aids for communication, including educative and motivational elements. This research began by seeking to understand ethnic minority consumers (EMCs) perceptions of any barriers hindering their take-up <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> the UK, and their preferences. This is particularly significant as the UK s EMC population is predicted to double by 2051 and to diversify further, presenting challenges for social cohesion and planning future community goals. EMCs also represent a significant market for service and product providers. The research focussed on EMCs from the Indian Subcontinent based on religions and generations. It highlighted that first generation females lacking English and/or literacy (across religions and age groups) faced problems with services and issues around empowerment. The importance of improved access to healthcare was a strong theme. On investigating NHS staffs perceptions, five barriers were identified (Language barriers; Low-literacy; a Lack of understanding; Attitudes, gender and health beliefs; and Information retention) and that a female subgroup was particularly affected. This study sets out staffs perceptions of the aids currently employed and suggestions of what would help. It identified a (currently) low use of visual communication aids in adult-patient care and that pharmacist-patient communication in pharmacies was low. Ideally, staff would like patients to learn English and to use more low-cost visual communication aids. These findings lead to the development of innovative visual communication aids through inclusive and user-centred approaches and participatory design and brainstorming methods. This enabled the development of aids by considering the needs of NHS staff, EMCs lacking English and/or literacy and indigenous elderly people to promote better patient-staff communication including a take-away educational element for learning English at home...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project is to assess the {{environmental}} impacts associated with the wood pellet production. The study has extended to the entire life cycle of wood pellet, which includes the up- and down-stream processes. Therefore it leaves the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) the best method to carry out such study. LCA is a popular tool for evaluating environmental impacts <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> this study, the mainstream LCA methodology is adopted, which includes four steps starting from goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, to life cycle impact assessment, and interpretation. The {{results of the study}} will be used for the wood pellet producer to communicate with its customers and also facilitate a better environmental management. The entire life cycle of wood pellet can be divided into eight main processes. According to the results of inventory analysis, the Silviculture is the most fossil fueldependant process, while the Pellet Production is, however, the most energy-intense process. Regarding the emissions, the final Combustion process contributes most to the air emissions, but the Pellet Production has a remarkably high emission of hydrocarbons, which can be explained as incomplete combustion of a mass of biofuel. The resources use, on the other hand, is close related to the consumption of electricity, since the electricity production is included in the system. The process with bigger demand of electricity results in bigger amount of resources use. When it comes to the characterisation level, the inventory data have been aggregated and translated into real environmental impacts. There are at least six different environmental impacts are possible to be initiated from the wood pellets production. It is noted that the Silviculture and the final Combustion are the least environmental preferable processes, due to the relatively big environmental impacts potential in relation to these two processes. There are three valuation methods involved in the report to weigh the importance of the environmental impacts against from one to another. The results of the three valuation methods are somehow different, which is, however, only because the methods tend to weight the importance of the environmental impacts from different perspective, and there is no such best weighting method exits. At last, a sensitivity analysis is given to discuss the hot points in the report, which is about to test the uncertainties of the data. Plus a discussion part is made {{at the end of the}} report to discuss the account of carbon dioxide emission in bioenergy system, and a crude comparison of avoided green house gas emission of using different kind of wood energy...|$|E
