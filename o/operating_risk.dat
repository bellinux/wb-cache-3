5000|$|One {{important}} {{area of research}} that arose from earlier studies at Manitoba Hydro was the recognition and need to quantitatively evaluate the <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> associated with adding large generating units to a relatively small electric power utility. [...] This concern resulted in a major area of study on spinning or operating capacity reliability assessment that incorporated load forecast uncertainty, rapid start and hot reserve considerations, and the incorporation of interruptible loads. These studies were completed many years ago but are now being reconsidered and extended to incorporate renewable energy sources. The increasing penetration of wind power in modern electric power systems introduces new dimensions in risk evaluation in both the planning and operating domains. Considerable {{progress has been made}} in incorporating the inherent variability associated with wind power in both generating capacity adequacy and security evaluation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to investigate {{the effect of the}} segmental disclosure required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14 (SFAS 14) on the <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> of multisegment firms. This investigation is accomplished in two phases. A theoretical model establishing the relationship between segmental disclosure and <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> is developed in phase one. In the second phase, this model is employed in an empirical study that evaluates the effect of SFAS 14 on the <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> of the affected firms. The findings of each of these phases are summarized below. A theoretical model for measuring <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> is developed first. This model is developed by decomposing systematic risk into operating and financial risks. Then it is shown how the additional segmental disclosure provided by SFAS 14 can be used to assess the value of this measure of <b>operating</b> <b>risk.</b> First, the determinants of <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> are identified. Then it is argued that if the additional disclosure provided by SFAS 14 had an effect on the assessment of <b>operating</b> <b>risk,</b> this effect would be associated with the disclosure of segmental assets. This argument provides the basis for conducting an empirical study that evaluates the effect of the segmental disclosure provided by SFAS 14 on <b>operating</b> <b>risk.</b> In this dissertation, the empirical study examines the effect of disclosure of segmental assets on the <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> of firms that disclosed such information for the first time following the initiation of SFAS 14. A sample of these firms form the treatment group. The control group is composed of single-segment firms. The firms in the control group did not disclose segmental assets prior to or after SFAS 14 went into effect. A control group composed of multisegment firms is not used in this study because only two firms are available from the sample taken. Two hypotheses are tested. Hypothesis 1 simply tests whether SFAS 14 had an effect on the <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> of the affected firms. Hypothesis 2 then tests if SFAS 14 had a favorable effect on <b>operating</b> <b>risk.</b> The effect on <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> is evaluated by comparing changes in <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> from pre-regulation period to post-regulation period for the treatment group with those of the control group. In both hypotheses, the null hypothesis that SFAS 14 did not affect <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> is tested. The Mann-Whitney U test is employed to test Hypothesis 1. The Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test and multiple regression analysis are used to test Hypothesis 2. The empirical results indicate that neither of the null hypotheses could be rejected at any conventional level of significance. In short, the empirical results tend to suggest that the additional segmental disclosure provided by SFAS 14 did not have a favorable effect on the <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> of the affected firms. However it is advised that caution should be exercised in drawing inferences based on these results because of the potential effects on <b>operating</b> <b>risk</b> by factors not controlled for in this study. Finally, an alternative future study is suggested. Pending the empirical findings of the future study it is suggested that the empirical results presented in this study should be considered preliminary...|$|E

40|$|Larger {{amounts of}} {{variable}} renewable energy sources bring about larger amounts of uncertainty {{in the form of}} forecast errors. When taking operational and planning decisions under uncertainty, a tradeoff between risk and costs must be made. Today's deterministic operational tools, such as N- 1 -based methods, cannot directly account for the underlying risk due to uncertainties. Instead, several definitions of <b>operating</b> <b>risks,</b> which are probabilistic indicators, have been proposed in the literature. Estimating these risks require estimating very low probabilities of violations of operating constraints. Crude Monte-Carlo simulations are very computationally demanding for estimating very low probabilities. In this paper, an importance sampling technique from mathematical finance is adapted to estimate very low <b>operating</b> <b>risks</b> in power systems given probabilistic forecasts for the wind power and the load. Case studies in the IEEE 39 and 118 bus systems show a decrease in computational demand of two to three orders of magnitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The combined effect of these risks obviously influences the shareholders ’ earnings.

In order to better point out the size of the combined risk, we have made the graphical representation of the degree of combined leverage {{as a function of the}} operating result. Using this chart, we have made analyses regarding the dynamic of the combined risk for different intervals of evolutions of the operating result.
