5|$|At the Sahar International Airport in Mumbai, India, an obese American {{businessman}} dismissively {{makes his}} way past a paraplegic beggar. Later, while using the airport's toilet, the businessman is {{pulled out of the}} stall violently by the beggar that he passed earlier. Later, the businessman checks into a Washington, D.C. hotel and sits down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> Soon, blood streams out of his bodily orifices.|$|E
5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to see what is happening on both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 9, 1989, Whitley awoke and spoke with his mother briefly on the phone. He was then visited by his {{brother-in-law}} Lane Palmer, and the two had coffee and they were planning a day of golf and having lunch, after which Whitley had planned to start writing songs for Lorrie Morgan and himself to record when she returned from her concert tour.

25|$|Ireland's fifth {{victim was}} Maltese chef Emanuel Spiteri, aged 41, {{whom he had}} met at the Coleherne pub. Spiteri was persuaded to be cuffed and bound <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> Once more, Ireland demanded his PIN number but did not obtain it. He again used a noose to kill. After {{carrying}} out his post-murder ritual of cleaning and clearing the scene, Ireland {{set fire to the}} flat and left. He rang the police later to tell them to look for a body at the scene of a fire and added that he would probably not kill again.|$|E
25|$|The {{first person}} Christie {{admitted}} to killing was Ruth Fuerst, a 21-year-old Austrian munitions worker who supplemented her income by occasionally engaging in prostitution. Christie {{claimed to have}} met Fuerst while she was soliciting clients in a snack bar in Ladbroke Grove. According to his own statements, on 24 August 1943, he invited Fuerst to his home to engage in sex (his wife was visiting relatives at the time). Afterwards, Christie impulsively strangled her <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> with a length of rope. He initially stowed Fuerst's body beneath the floorboards of his living room, and buried her body in the back garden the following evening.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June 2002, Fulton, who {{was being}} held on remand in HMP Maghaberry since December 2001, {{was found dead in}} his prison cell with a leather belt around his neck. Fulton was found <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> rather than hanging from the ceiling, leading to {{speculation}} that he has death had been accidentally caused by autoerotic asphyxiation. Friends claimed he had expressed suicidal thoughts due to both his failure to recover from his close friend Wright's death, as well as fears he had that he was suffering from stomach cancer. Some reports suggested his unstable mental state had seen him stood down as leader several weeks before his death, with the LVF's power base transferred to Belfast. He was also afraid that rival loyalist inmates wished to kill him inside the prison.|$|E

25|$|Under {{consideration}} by party leaders {{as a possible}} candidate in the 1880 presidential election, Chandler went to Chicago to deliver a political speech on October 31, 1879. Keeping to his Radical roots Chandler spoke {{in front of an}} African American Young Men's Republican Auxiliary Club at McCormick Hall. Chandler said that he hoped one day blacks would be able to vote freely and safely, run for office, and make speeches throughout the nation including the South just as former rebels were allowed to vote, run for office, and speak in the North. Although he had earlier contracted a cold he was known to be his robust self that day. The next day he was found dead in one of his rooms at the Grand Pacific Hotel at 7:00 in the morning reclining <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|From then on, he {{conducted}} at many different occasions, but mainly during grand tours of various countries {{where he was}} paid handsomely for visiting. In particular, {{towards the end of}} his life, he {{made a lot of money}} by touring Russia twice, the final visit proving extremely lucrative and also being the final conducting tour before his death. This enabled him not only to perform his music to a wider audience, but also to increase his influence across Europe– for example, his orchestration was studied by many Russian composers. Not just fellow hyper-Romantic Tchaikovsky, but also members of The Five are indebted to these techniques, including Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, but even Modest Mussorgsky– often portrayed as uninterested in refined orchestration– revered Berlioz and died with a copy of Berlioz's Treatise on Instrumentation <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> Similarly, his conducting technique as described by contemporary sources appears to set the groundwork for the clarity and precision favoured in the French School of conducting right up to the present, exemplified by such figures as Pierre Monteux, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, Paul Paray, Charles Munch, André Cluytens, Pierre Boulez and Charles Dutoit.|$|E
25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E

500|$|Don Draper, on the {{elevator}} to SCDP's offices with Megan, is coughing profusely, sweaty, and feverish. A flirty former lover, Andrea Rhodes, walks into {{the elevator}} and starts to home in on Don before Don introduces Megan as his wife. Don tries to assuage a slightly perturbed Megan, who is upset over how many of Don's old flames they run into in Manhattan. Don works with new hire Michael Ginsberg and Ken Cosgrove on the pitch to Butler Footwear. Ginsberg goes rogue during the presentation and ends up pitching a commercial based on Cinderella, which the group had earlier rejected as being too cliche - although {{that was what the}} executives were expecting, and they reject the pitch they had earlier approved in favor of a Cinderella campaign. Don is enraged and admonishes Ginsberg for the act; Ginsberg doesn't seem to realize the seriousness of his transgression until Ken points out he {{was on the verge of}} being fired.
