NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> the North Ferry Company.

5|$|Many of the government-operated {{residential}} {{schools were}} run by churches of various denominations, {{with the majority}} administered by Roman Catholics. Between 1867 and 1939, the number of schools operating at one time peaked at 80 schools in 1931. Of those schools, 44 were <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> Roman Catholics; 21 were <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> the Church of England / Anglican Church of Canada; 13 were <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> the United Church of Canada, and 2 were <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> Presbyterians. The approach of using established school facilities set up by missionaries was employed {{by the federal government}} for economic expedience: the government provided facilities and maintenance, while the churches provided teachers and their own lesson-planning. As a result, the number of schools per denomination was less a reflection of their presence in the general population, but rather their legacy of missionary work.|$|E

50|$|Tubulin inhibitors thus act by {{interfering with}} the {{dynamics}} of the microtubule, i.e., growing (polymerization) and shortening (depolymerization). One class of inhibitors <b>operate</b> <b>by</b> inhibiting polymerization of tubulin to form microtubules and are called polymerization inhibitors like the colchine analogues and the vinca alkaloids. They decrease the microbule polymer mass in the cells at high concentration and act as microtubule-destabilizing agents. The other class of inhibitors <b>operate</b> <b>by</b> inhibiting the depolymerization of polymerized tubulin and increases the microtubule polymer mass in the cells. They act as microbule-stabilizing agents and are called depolymerization inhibitors like the paclitaxel analogues. These three classes of drugs seems to <b>operate</b> <b>by</b> slightly different mechanism.|$|R
