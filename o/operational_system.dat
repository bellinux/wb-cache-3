5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as an <b>operational</b> <b>system,</b> and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and receiver in the interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Luftwaffe to {{identify}} the radar chain and distinguish RAF fighter bases from those of other RAF commands undermined its ability to destroy the British fighter defences. The Luftwaffe underestimated British radar, and they had not realised its importance in the British <b>operational</b> <b>system.</b> To the contrary, OKL believed that the radar stations would benefit the German effort by sending RAF forces into large-scale air battles for the Luftwaffe to decimate. The RAF aircraft industry supported the losses and its pilots were replaced sufficiently to limit the RAF’s decline in strength and deny the Germans victory. Conversely, the RAF were able to ensure the serviceability rates and aircrew numbers of the Luftwaffe declined in August–September.|$|E

25|$|With an <b>operational</b> <b>system</b> now online, {{tactical}} considerations were developed. The {{first was}} airborne radar sets, installed on fighters. German pilots complained {{about this as}} it created drag and reduced {{the performance of their}} aircraft. They preferred to acquire the target visually once ground control had guided them onto the bomber stream. A second change involved the removal of AAA installations and searchlights from the line and grouping them around cities for their defence.|$|E

25|$|The first {{experimental}} system, Duga, {{was built}} outside Mykolaiv in Ukraine, successfully detecting rocket launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome at 2,500 kilometers. This {{was followed by}} the prototype Duga, built on the same site, which was able to track launches from the far east and submarines in the Pacific Ocean as the missiles flew towards Novaya Zemlya. Both of these radar systems were aimed east and were fairly low power, but with the concept proven, work began on an <b>operational</b> <b>system.</b> The new Duga-1 systems used a transmitter and receiver separated by about 60km.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{a public}} {{hydraulic}} power network was suggested by Joseph Bramah in a patent obtained in 1812. William Armstrong began installing systems in England from the 1840s, using low-pressure water, but a breakthrough occurred in 1850 {{with the introduction of}} the hydraulic accumulator, which allowed much higher pressures to be used. The first public network, supplying many companies, was constructed in Kingston upon Hull, England. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company began operation in 1877, with Edward B. Ellington as its engineer. Ellington was involved in most of the British networks, and some further afield. Public networks were constructed in Britain at London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. There were similar networks in Antwerp, Melbourne, Sydney, Buenos Aires and Geneva. All of the public networks had ceased to operate by the mid-1970s, but Bristol Harbour still has an <b>operational</b> <b>system,</b> with an accumulator situated outside the main pumphouse, enabling its operation to be easily visualised.|$|E

In early 1958 the two companies were awarded a contract for development of the weapon, designated WS-199C and given the code-name [...] "High Virgo".
