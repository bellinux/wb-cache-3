5|$|On April1, 1981, NY326 was realigned {{between the}} hamlets of Oakwood and Half Acre {{as the result}} of a highway {{maintenance}} swap between the state of New York and Cayuga County. As part of the swap, the state of New York assumed maintenance <b>of</b> <b>Half</b> Acre Road from Oakwood to Half Acre while maintenance of NY326's former routing between the two locations was transferred to Cayuga County. The former routing of NY326 on Oakwood Road is now designated as County Route168A (CR168A) in the town of Aurelius and CR168B in the town of Springport. The Genesee Street portion of old NY326 is now part of CR1. In the 1981 maintenance swap, the state of New York also assumed maintenance of the section <b>of</b> <b>Half</b> Acre Road between Half Acre (at NY326) and the US20/ NY5 concurrency. This portion <b>of</b> <b>Half</b> Acre Road is now NY931E, an unsigned reference route.|$|E

One piece was put aside for the Mint's coin collection by Eckfeldt.|$|E

5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations <b>of</b> <b>half</b> a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E

5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out <b>of</b> <b>half</b> a dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At {{the time in}} her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice {{at the age of}} 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E
5|$|After his {{quarrel with}} the Royalist court in exile, Rupert {{travelled}} to Heidelberg {{to visit his}} brother Charles Louis, now partially restored as Elector Palatine, where the two had an ambivalent reunion. Charles Louis and Rupert had not been friendly as children and had almost ended up on opposite sides during the Civil War. To make matters worse, Charles Louis had been deprived <b>of</b> <b>half</b> the old Palatinate under the Peace of Westphalia, leaving him badly short of money, although he still remained responsible under the Imperial laws of apanage for providing for his younger brother and had offered the sum of £375 per annum, which Rupert had accepted. Rupert travelled on to Vienna, where he attempted to claim the £15,000 compensation allocated to him under the Peace of Westphalia from the Emperor. Emperor Ferdinand III warmly welcomed him, {{but was unable to}} pay such a sum immediately—instead, he would have to pay in installments, to the disadvantage of Rupert.|$|E

The LEP decides to send in a 'blue rinse' – a {{biological}} bomb that kills all organic life— to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades with sleeping pills.|$|E

5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs <b>of</b> <b>half</b> {{the air and}} then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Bolton {{reached the}} Premiership in 1995 {{thanks to a}} 4–3 victory over Reading in the Division One {{play-off}} Final.

Bolton scored two late goals to take the game to extra time, scoring twice more before a late Reading consolation. The same year Bolton progressed to the League Cup Final, but were defeated 2–1 by Liverpool. Bolton were bottom for virtually all of the 1995–96 Premiership campaign and were relegated as they lost their penultimate game 1–0 to Southampton.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers was {{distributed}} both {{on television and}} online.

Chartjackers premiered on BBC Two on 12 September 2009 at 12:50p.m., as part of the channel's two-hour-long BBC Switch segment – it was uploaded to the YouTube channel BBCSwitch the same day. This practice of broadcasting an episode on BBC Two and uploading it to the BBCSwitch channel the same day continued throughout the series. Episodes were also streamed online through BBC iPlayer to UK residents for seven days after their initial broadcast. The show was not broadcast outside of the UK and, , is not available on DVD.|$|E

In the Third Round, Burnley were handed an away tie at Hull City, who at the time were struggling in the Football League Second Division and had won only two matches in the previous five months. Despite being without first-team regulars George Halley and Joe Anderson through injury, Burnley were expected to win comfortably, not having lost since 4September 1920. Hull City played above all expectations and Burnley suffered a 0–3 defeat after being 0–1 behind at half time.|$|E

He attacked Tony Blair and the BBC, and defended the BNP's right to freedom of speech. BNP Deputy Chairman Simon Darby later claimed that had Griffin been convicted, the BNP leader planned to go on hunger strike.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the direct}} carpool lane ramps between I-5 and SR55 were completed; {{these were the}} first in Orange County.
