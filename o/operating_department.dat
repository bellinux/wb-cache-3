5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the <b>operating</b> <b>department</b> because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Railway <b>operating</b> <b>department</b> {{undertook}} {{trials to}} improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel burner of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E

500|$|When {{the project}} was {{under the auspices of}} the Southern Railway, No. 36001 would have been {{numbered}} CC101. Bulleid advocated a continental style of locomotive nomenclature, based upon his experiences at the French branch of Westinghouse Electric before the First World War and those of his tenure in the rail <b>operating</b> <b>department</b> during that conflict. The Southern Railway number followed an adaptation of the UIC classification system where [...] "C" [...] refers to the number of driving axles – in this case three on each bogie. Since the design has six driving axles, the numbering would have been CC101CC105 for the initial batch, the final number being the locomotive identifier.|$|E
500|$|With the [...] "Scotch Arthurs" [...] in service, the Southern Railway had {{an ample}} fleet of express {{passenger}} locomotives for its Western section routes. As {{part of a}} process of fleet standardisation, the <b>Operating</b> <b>Department</b> expressed a desire replace obsolescent locomotives on the Eastern and Central sections with the King Arthur class. In May 1925, a batch of 25 locomotives (Nos.E793E817) based upon the Scotch Arthurs was ordered for construction at Eastleigh with smaller firebox grates and improved water heating surfaces. After the first 14 (Nos.E793E806) were built, {{it was decided to}} discontinue construction in favour of Maunsell’s new 4-cylinder Lord Nelson class design in June 1926.|$|E
30|$|For {{the most}} part, however, design {{programs}} existed along a continuum between a purely centralized approach, acting as an internal consultancy and providing <b>operating</b> <b>departments</b> with ready-made solutions; and a purely distributed approach, {{in which the}} primary function was to facilitate innovation in <b>operating</b> <b>departments</b> and provide training in design thinking. Thus most of the organizations interviewed for this study fell into the hybrid category, offering both ideation and facilitation/training.|$|R

[...] The Southern Railway number followed an adaptation of the UIC classification system where [...] "C" [...] refers {{to the number of}} coupled driving axles [...] in this case three.

500|$|The <b>Operating</b> <b>Department</b> {{intended}} to equip Nos.E793E807 with six-wheel, [...] capacity tenders {{for use on}} the former SECR lines of the Eastern section. These were to replace Scotch Arthurs Nos.E763E772 on boat train duties. This was because the [...] tenders attached to Nos.E763E772 were better suited to the longer routes of the Western section. The final ten engines (Nos.E808E817) were for the former LBSCR routes of the Central section, where short turntables restricted tender size to the [...] Ashford variety used on the Nclass. After the order was changed to the Lord Nelson class design, 14 Nclass tenders were fitted to Nos.E793E806 for use the Central section. The high draw-gear (the link between locomotive and tender) of the Nclass tenders necessitated modification to the frames beneath the cab.|$|E
500|$|In May 1925 Maunsell {{ordered a}} further ten {{locomotives}} from Brighton works (Nos.A800–A809), which only had vacuum brakes for the SECR stock on the Eastern section. They were delivered between July and December 1926. This group had modified suspension on the bogie and leading axle, {{in an attempt}} to address complaints from the crews of rough riding experienced with earlier members of the class. A further 20 members of the class were ordered in March 1926 (ten each from Ashford and Brighton works), despite strong reservations expressed by the <b>Operating</b> <b>Department</b> concerning [...] "the wisdom or desirability of placing so many large passenger tanks in service". These were allocated the numbers A610A629, and work had begun on building the frames and cylinders when the order was cancelled following an accident at Sevenoaks in 1927 involving locomotive No.A800. These numbers were later allocated to the first production batch of Uclass locomotives.|$|E

500|$|Bulleid {{adopted a}} new {{numbering}} scheme {{for all his}} locomotives based on Continental practice, following his experiences at the French branch of Westinghouse Electric before the First World War, and those of his tenure in the rail <b>operating</b> <b>department</b> during that conflict. [...] The Southern Railway numbers followed an adaptation of the UIC classification system of using letters and numbers to designate the powered and unpowered axles, together with a running number. Thus the first 4-6-2 locomotive became 21C1 – where [...] "2" [...] and [...] "1" [...] refer {{to the number of}} unpowered leading and trailing axles respectively, and [...] "C" [...] refers to the number of driving axles, in this case three. The remainder were numbered 21C2-21C19. The scheme was abandoned by British Railways in 1949 and the existing locomotives were renumbered under the British Railways standard system in the series 35001-35019; the final batch appeared in traffic as 35020-35029.|$|E
500|$|Three factors {{dictated}} {{the type of}} locomotive that could operate on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR): the heavy passenger train loadings; the poor track quality; and the weak, lightly built bridges. On {{the lines of the}} former London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) – inherited by the SECR in 1899 – beach pebbles had been used for ballast instead of conventional ballast, which has irregular shapes that lock together to keep the track in place. These economies in construction meant that only locomotives with low axle loadings could operate safely over the track. The SECR was therefore unable to follow a coherent strategy {{to reduce the number of}} locomotive types inherited from the two constituent railways. Despite increased passenger and freight traffic between [...] and the Kentish coast during the first decades of the 20th century, the <b>Operating</b> <b>Department</b> had to use mismatched classes of underpowered and obsolete 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 locomotives, which could operate within the restrictions imposed by the infrastructure. This resulted in frequent double-heading, adding to operational costs.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the accident, two Kand K1class engines were trialled on the London and North Eastern Railway's (LNER) Great Northern mainline {{under the supervision of}} that company's CME, Nigel Gresley, to gain an unbiased review of their riding qualities. Locomotives No.A803 (K) and No.A890 (K1), and KingArthurclass No.E782, were tested on the well-maintained LNER line between [...] and [...] in October 1927, where few problems were found with locomotive stability. On runs between Kings Cross and [...] with the LNER's dynamometer car, No.A890 was recorded at a top speed of [...] and A803 at , with no problems in riding. When these engines returned from the LNER, the Southern Railway's General Manager, Sir Herbert Walker ordered further trials to be led by Sir John Aspinall on the Western section main line near [...] These were terminated by the Southern Railway's <b>Operating</b> <b>Department,</b> as the riding of the locomotives at speeds near [...] rendered the locomotives unsafe. The instability of No.A890 at speed was attributed to the helical springs on the Bissel truck and bogie.|$|E

500|$|Three factors {{dictated}} {{the type of}} locomotive that could run on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR): increased freight and passenger train loadings, poor track quality, and weak, lightly built bridges. An increasing number of passengers used the SECR to reach the cross-Channel ferries at Dover and Folkestone between 1910 and 1913, and heavy goods trains between Tonbridge and Hither Green marshalling yard stretched the capabilities of existing locomotives and infrastructure. On {{the lines of the}} former London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), flint beach pebbles on a bed of ash had been used for ballast. Conventional track ballast has irregular shapes that [...] "lock" [...] together to keep the track in place, whereas the smooth pebbles used by the LCDR failed to prevent track movement under strain. The economies in construction meant that only locomotives with low axle loadings could run safely on the track. These restrictions meant that the SECR was unable to follow a coherent locomotive strategy that reduced costs and increased serviceability. The railway's <b>Operating</b> <b>Department</b> had to use mismatched classes of underpowered and obsolete 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 locomotives because they could run within the restrictions imposed by the infrastructure. This meant frequent double-heading that increased operational costs.|$|E
500|$|In October 1946, the Southern Railway {{announced}} a programme to electrify all lines in Kent and East Sussex in three stages. The Hastings line between Tonbridge and Bopeep Junction {{was to be}} part of the third stage. Track would have been slewed within the affected tunnels with only one train normally allowed in the tunnel. In an emergency, two trains would be allowed in the tunnel at the same time, but restricted to [...] Standard [...] wide stock would be used. Following the nationalisation of railways in the United Kingdom under the Transport Act 1947, the Southern Region of British Railways shelved new electrification schemes, concentrating on the construction of new steam locomotives. In 1952, the possibility of operating standard rolling stock on the line had been examined. The <b>Operating</b> <b>Department</b> objected to the use of single line sections through the various tunnels. The 1930s stock was refurbished with the aim of extending its service by a further ten years. The first two phases of the Southern Railways' electrification scheme were revived in 1955. This did not include the Hastings line and it was announced in 1956 that a fleet of diesel-electric trains would be constructed to operate the service until the line was electrified. At that time, the rolling stock built in the 1930s was overdue for replacement. The modernisation to the Hastings line and the introduction of the diesel-electric trains cost £797,000, [...] of which £595,000 was the cost of the first seven trains.
