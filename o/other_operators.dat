5|$|In 2009, Eurotunnel (the {{owners of}} the Channel Tunnel) {{announced}} that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations, in order to permit <b>other</b> <b>operators,</b> such as Deutsche Bahn, to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock. Under the deregulation of European railway service, high-speed lines were opened up to access by <b>other</b> <b>operators</b> on 1 January 2010; the Inter-Governmental Commission on the Channel Tunnel (IGC) {{announced that it was}} considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting. LCR suggested that high-speed rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics.|$|E

5|$|As of September 2017, {{there are}} 1,336 {{examples}} of all A330 variants in airline service, comprising 604 A330-200s, 38 -200Fs, and 694 -300s. The airline operators are Turkish Airlines (64), Air China (59), China Eastern Airlines (57), Delta Air Lines (42), China Southern Airlines (42), and <b>other</b> <b>operators</b> with fewer aircraft.|$|E
5|$|London has {{frequent}} river boat {{services on}} the Thames known as Thames Clippers. These {{run up to}} every 20 minutes between Embankment Pier and North Greenwich Pier. The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads. <b>Other</b> <b>operators</b> run both commuter and tourist boat services in London.|$|E

30|$|The {{theory of}} {{approximate}} solutions of delay partial differential equations has received less attention than delay ordinary differential equations. A situation which occurs in delay partial differential equations when the delay term is an operator of lower order {{with respect to}} the <b>other</b> <b>operator</b> term is widely investigated (see, for example, [7 – 9] and the references therein). In the case where the delay term is an operator of the same order with respect to <b>other</b> <b>operator</b> term, this is studied mainly in a Hilbert space (see, for example, [10] and the references therein). In fact there are very few papers where the delay term is an operator of the same order {{with respect to the}} <b>other</b> <b>operator</b> term, this being investigated in a general Banach space (see [11 – 14]) and in these works, the authors look only for partial differential equations under regular data. Additionally, approximate solutions of the delay parabolic equations in the case where the delay term is a simple operator of the same order with respect to the <b>other</b> <b>operator</b> term were studied recently in papers [15 – 19].|$|R
5|$|Temple Meads {{is managed}} by Network Rail and the {{majority}} of services are operated by the present-day Great Western Railway. <b>Other</b> <b>operators</b> are CrossCountry and South Western Railway. In the 12 months to March 2014, 9.5 million entries and exits were recorded at the station.|$|E
5|$|Feeder {{services}} to other research stations are operated by two Basler BT-67 (type converted DC-3/C-47), {{operated by the}} South African company Antarctic Logistics Centre International or <b>other</b> <b>operators.</b> Services are operated to Aboa (Finnish), Dome F (Japanese), Halley (British), Kohnen (German), Maitri (Indian), Neumayer (German), Novolazarevskaya (Russian), Princess Elisabeth (Belgian), SANAE IV (South African), Showa (Japanese), Tor (Norwegian) and Wasa (Swedish). In the 2007–08 season, 720 people were transported to Antarctica via DROMLAN. The airport is not open for commercial or other private flights.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s orders declined, with a {{total of}} 76 Comet 4s being {{delivered}} from 1958 to 1964. In November 1965 BOAC retired its Comet 4s from revenue service, while <b>other</b> <b>operators</b> continued commercial passenger flights with the Comet until 1981. Dan-Air {{played a significant role in}} the fleet's later history and, at one time, owned all 49 remaining airworthy civil Comets. On 14 March 1997 a Comet 4C serial XS235 and named Canopus, which had been acquired by the British Ministry of Technology and used for radio, radar and avionics trials, made the last documented production Comet flight.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} {{thirteen}} IC2-sets were built, {{all of which}} are in service. The largest operator is Lollandsbanen, who have 10; the only <b>other</b> <b>operator</b> is Vestsjællands Lokalbaner.|$|R

5|$|Police {{had found}} and arrested some {{suspects}} within 24 {{hours of the}} crime. From recordings made by a highway CCTV vehicle, {{a description of the}} bus, a white charter bus with a name written on it, was broadcast. <b>Other</b> <b>operators</b> identified it as being contracted by a South Delhi private school. They then traced it and found its driver, Ram Singh. Police obtained sketches of the assailants {{with the help of the}} male victim, and used a cell phone stolen from the two victims to find one of the assailants.|$|E
5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. <b>Other</b> <b>operators</b> draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} came in April 1985, following {{over a year}} {{of consultation}} with county council members, regulators, when two new routes were introduced. One operated in competition with Alder Valley, while the other took the place of services withdrawn by <b>other</b> <b>operators.</b> Following these changes Tillingbourne became the only operator to serve Chilworth, Albury and Shere. Two new vehicles were purchased for the routes. At the same time, all of Tillingbourne's services were renumbered into a new two-digit sequence, to avoid confusion with London Country routes. A year later, {{the second of the}} new services, circular route 23/25, was reduced in frequency from hourly to two-hourly, although much of the route was covered by extending another route. Another new service, linking Cranleigh and Godalming, was also introduced. In August 1986, operation of a number of council-contracted services, including a route from Redhill to Reigate and a local route in Horsham, were taken over from other companies.|$|E
50|$|Turkcell has {{international}} roaming agreements with 605 operators in 201 countries as of September, 2008. It {{claims to have}} more international GPRS roaming agreements than any <b>other</b> <b>operator</b> (356 operators in 143 countries as of August 31, 2008). It also applies discounted roaming costs when calling from a Turkcell mobile to a KKTurkcell number.|$|R
50|$|In February 2011, route Y100 Nottingham - Southwell - Newark (peak time only) commenced. The {{service was}} {{withdrawn}} on 16 April 2011 following {{an increase in}} activity from the <b>other</b> <b>operator</b> along the route.|$|R
50|$|The only <b>other</b> <b>operator</b> in World War II was the Royal New Zealand Air Force {{which used}} the type {{primarily}} as a bomber, operating from South Pacific Island bases. Some of these were transferred to the British Pacific Fleet.|$|R
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>operators</b> {{used the}} Comet either through leasing {{arrangements}} or through second-hand acquisitions. BOAC's Comet 4s were leased out to Air Ceylon, Air India, AREA Ecuador, Central African Airways, and Qantas Empire Airways; after 1965 they {{were sold to}} AREA Ecuador, Dan-Air, Mexicana, Malaysian Airways, and the Ministry of Defence. BEA's Comet 4Bs were chartered by Cyprus Airways, Malta Airways, and Transportes Aéreos Portugueses. Channel Airways obtained five Comet 4Bs from BEA in 1970 for inclusive tour charters. Dan-Air bought all of the surviving flyable Comet 4s from the late 1960s into the 1970s; some were for spares reclamation but most were operated on the carrier's inclusive tour charters; a total of 48 Comets of all marks were acquired by the airline.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{route to}} the town centre is the A338 spur road, a dual carriageway that connects to the A31 close to the Hampshire border. The A31 joins the M27 at Southampton and from there the M3 to London and the A34 to the Midlands and the North can be accessed. The main road west is the A35 to Honiton in Devon which runs through the South East Dorset Conurbation and continues east as far as Southampton, albeit as a non-primary route. The A350 in the neighbouring borough of Poole provides the only northern route out of the conurbation. National Express coaches serve Bournemouth Travel Interchange & Bournemouth University. There are frequent departures to London Victoria Coach Station and Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. Local buses are provided mainly by two companies, Wilts & Dorset, the former National Bus Company subsidiary and now owned by the Go-Ahead Group, and Yellow Buses, the former Bournemouth Council-owned company and successors to Bournemouth Corporation Transport, which began operating trams in 1902. <b>Other</b> <b>operators</b> serving the town include Damory Coaches and the Shaftesbury & District bus company.|$|E
