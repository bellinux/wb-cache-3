25|$|The AAIB {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} locked condition of the aircraft's elevators which prevented the aircraft rotating into a flying attitude. It was thought likely that the elevator gust lock became re-engaged during the pilots' pre-takeoff checks, and that it was not noticed until the takeoff was so far advanced that a successful abandonment within the <b>overrun</b> <b>area</b> could not be made. The re-engagement of the gust lock was made possible by the condition of the gust lock lever gate plate and gate-stop strip, to which non-standard repairs had been made.|$|E
500|$|The enquiry report {{submitted}} by the Civil Aviation Ministry said that Glušica slept for over 90 minutes during the flight. The Air India Express IX 812 [...] carrying 166 people from Dubai including the crew, crashed while negotiating a tricky landing at Mangalore city's [...] "table-top" [...] airport overlooking a ravine. The American National Transportation Safety Board says {{it was the first}} instance of snoring recorded on a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Analysis of the accident revealed that had the pilot [...] "deployed détente reverse thrust and applied maximum manual braking at touchdown", the aircraft could have been stopped within the paved <b>overrun</b> <b>area</b> of the runway. The captain had exacerbated the long landing by attempting a go-around following deployment of the thrust reversers.|$|E

5000|$|Blast pads, {{also known}} as <b>overrun</b> <b>areas</b> or stopways, are often {{constructed}} just {{before the start of}} a runway where jet blast produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway. <b>Overrun</b> <b>areas</b> are also constructed at the end of runways as emergency space to slowly stop planes that overrun the runway on a landing gone wrong, or to slowly stop a plane on a rejected takeoff or a takeoff gone wrong. Blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are marked with yellow chevrons. Planes are not allowed to taxi, take off or land on blast pads, except in an emergency.|$|R

50|$|In 2008 {{the airport}} {{completed}} two service roads {{around the end}} of Runway 28, near Interstate 390, in tunnels. The ground was graded upwards beyond the end of the runway to cover the tunnels. Earlier in the decade, a 500 ft <b>overrun</b> <b>area</b> was added to the east (10) end of this runway. An Engineered materials arrestor system (EMAS) of about 200 ft was added to this extension. The EMAS consists of soft rubberized concrete into which an overrunning aircraft's wheels can sink, and the aircraft ostensibly be stopped safely before it veers onto the grass.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Army Air Forces {{built the}} airport around 1942, {{when it was}} known as the Okanogan Flight Strip and Omak Flight Strip. The initial construction, which was {{completed}} in 1943, consisted of a [...] long, [...] wide paved runway running north and south, with graded sides and <b>overrun</b> <b>areas</b> which were [...] wide. It was constructed around the Donald Dodge and Grace Bell ranches, and served as a [...] long hard-surfaced emergency landing airfield strip primarily used by military aircraft on training flights, for which purpose it was approved by the United States Armed Forces.|$|R

25|$|Rotorua Airport {{opened in}} 1964, with a 1378m x 30m sealed runway that could {{accommodate}} National Airways Corporation's Douglas DC-3 and Fokker F27 aircraft. It replaced the old Whakarewarewa Aerodrome, which was located {{just north of}} Sala Street {{in what is now}} a residential area. In 2002, an extension to {{the southern end of the}} airport's runway brought its total length to 1622m. Plans to further increase the main runway's length in two stages, initially by 150 metres at the northern end followed by 487 metres at the southern end (including newly mandated <b>overrun</b> <b>areas),</b> were approved in 2008 after a lengthy consultation process and court battle.|$|R

50|$|Grant assumes {{control of}} the 747 and {{attempts}} to land it at Washington Dulles International Airport despite his limited piloting experience. He misses the approach, forcing him to pull the plane back up to circle around and try again. As the plane begins to climb, Grant recognizes the area surrounding Frederick Field, which is where he normally practices flying. Deciding to land the 747 there, with Jean's assistance, Grant makes a sloppy and fiery but safe landing. The 747 is slowed to a stop by ramming into a sand berm at the runway's <b>overrun</b> <b>area,</b> where emergency workers are able to safely evacuate the remaining passengers.|$|E
50|$|Overrun gear {{consisting}} of hook cables and/or elastic nets known as barriers {{are commonly used}} as a backup system. Barrier nets catch the wings and fuselage of an aircraft and use an arresting engine or other methods such as anchor chains or bundles of woven textile material to slow the aircraft down. On some land-based airfields where the <b>overrun</b> <b>area</b> is short, a series of concrete blocks referred to as an engineered materials arrestor system is used. These materials are used to catch the landing gear of an aircraft and slow it via rolling resistance and friction. Aircraft are stopped by the transfer of energy required to crush the blocks.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "Fatehgarh", means [...] "Town of Victory", and is {{so called}} because in 1710, Sikhs under the {{leadership}} of Banda Bahadur <b>overran</b> the <b>area</b> and razed the fort built during Balban's rule to the ground.|$|R

50|$|Secondary users {{occasionally}} {{include the}} United States Air Force (USAF), during Allied operations engaging United States and France. During Operation Allied Force, USAF KC-135s and U-2s operated {{out of the}} base. Istres was the home of U-2 detachment OL-FR (Operating Location-FRance). Istres was also utilized by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle {{in the case of}} a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL). The base's runway is 3750 m long and 60 m wide. An additional <b>overrun</b> <b>area</b> 1200 m long was built for Airbus Industries in 1992. It has the same characteristics as the runway, making it the longest runway in Western Europe and thus suited to Shuttle landings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the stopping distance of an aircraft {{involved in a}} runway overrun incident when the runway has been provided with an extension comprised of a material engineered to induce high levels of rolling friction and drag. A formula for stopping distance is derived that is shown to be {{the product of a}} known formula for the case of friction without drag, and a dimensionless constant between 0 and 1 that quantifies the further reduction in stopping distance when drag is introduced. This additional quantity, identified as the Drag Reduction Factor, D, is shown to depend on the ratio of drag force to friction force experienced by the aircraft as it enters the <b>overrun</b> <b>area.</b> The specific functional form of D is shown to depend on how drag varies with speed. A detailed uncertainty analysis is presented which reveals how the uncertainty in estimates of stopping distance are influenced by experimental error in the force measurements that are acquired in a typical evaluation experiment conducted to assess candidate overrun materials. Nomenclature a = acceleration d = Drag force d 0 = Initial drag force at entry into EMAS material f = Friction force g = acceleration of gravity m = mass, and ln(FH/f) r = Ratio of initial drag, d 0, to constant friction force, f t = time x = displacement A = Reference area, related to the area of a projection of an object on the plane that is perpendicular to the direction of motion CD = Drag coefficien...|$|E
25|$|The initial {{increase}} in length would allow operations by Airbus A320 aircraft to Australia, albeit with capacity restrictions, {{and the subsequent}} southern extension would allow these aircraft to serve the airport without capacity restrictions. The project was completed in 2009 and brought the combined length of the runway and <b>overrun</b> <b>areas</b> to 2,304 metres. These extensions, {{in conjunction with the}} already-completed upgrade of the terminal building and facilities, made the airport capable of handling international flights to Australia. Following the upgrade, Air New Zealand announced that it would begin flights between Rotorua and Sydney on 12 December 2009, the service being partially funded by the Rotorua District Council. To coincide with the introduction of international flights, the airport was renamed Rotorua International Airport.|$|R
50|$|Sochaczew has 40,000 {{inhabitants}} and {{is located}} in Greater Warsaw Area. In Sochaczew there is a military airport in Sochaczew-Bielice. There are plans of local governments to convert it into a low-cost airport for Łódź, western part of Mazowsze and nearby Warsaw agglomeration of 2,6 million inhabitants (54 kilometers to the east). There exists an association, “Stowarzyszenie Port Lotniczy Sochaczew”, supporting the project, and in 2006 {{it was decided to}} create a public limited company with the task to open the airport. The runway has 2500 m length and 60 m width, and a concrete-asphalt surface possessing a good pressure index, <b>overrun</b> <b>areas</b> for increased safety, and a parallel, grass-surfaced runway. It is possible to introduce rail link directly to the airport, even connected with trains to Warsaw. It is also possible to build a short section of trail tracks in order to introduce a direct rail link to Warsaw.|$|R
2500|$|It is now {{recommended}} practice for any new runway {{to have a}} clear area at least [...] long at each end, called a 'runway safety area', to allow additional space for an aircraft that overruns the runway to decelerate and stop in relative safety.
