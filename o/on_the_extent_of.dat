Hōshō was repaired within 15 days, but the termination of hostilities in September 1945 found the carrier still docked at Kure.|$|E
5|$|Tatuidris tatusia is {{the only}} species in Tatuidris, a {{monotypic}} genus and {{one of only two}} extant genera in the subfamily Agroecomyrmecinae. A new species, T. kapasi, was described by Lacau & Groc in 2012, but has now been relegated to a junior synonym under T. tatusia based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad geographic range. Analysis of DNA barcodes indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing allopatric differentiation.|$|E

5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E

25|$|Edwards {{syndrome}} is a chromosomal abnormality {{characterized by the}} presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 18th chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 18) or in part (such as due to translocations).

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} surgical procedures {{that can be}} employed to treat ovarian cancer.

For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, omentectomy, splenectomy, bowel resection, diaphragm stripping or resection, appendectomy, or even a posterior pelvic exenteration.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{studies have}} been {{utilised}} {{in the study of}} pre-historic population movements. On the whole, scientists agree that there is evidence for a migration during the Neolithic.

That is, results vary depending on what underlying mutation rates are assumed, and conclusions are drawn from how the authors 'envisage' their results fit with known archaeological and historic processes. Consequently, such studies must be interpreted with caution.|$|E

25|$|Fellowship – WELS {{teaches that}} {{all forms of}} Christian {{fellowship}} require complete unity in matters of doctrine (Romans 16:17, Ephesians 4:3-6). The LCMS, meanwhile, teaches that there are different levels of fellowship among Christians, so that altar fellowship (sharing in the Eucharist together), pulpit fellowship (exchange of preaching privileges among ministers of various congregations), and other manifestations of Christian fellowship (such as fellowship in prayer), are distinct. Thus, according to LCMS doctrine, members of different church bodies can engage in greater or lesser degrees of fellowship depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> their doctrinal disagreement.|$|E
