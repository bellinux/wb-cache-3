5|$|Although {{formerly}} {{common in}} its range, the species {{was on the}} brink <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> in Victoria by 1917.

5|$|Although the {{population}} of emus on mainland Australia {{is thought to be}} higher now than it was before European settlement, some local populations are at risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> The threats faced by emus include the clearance and fragmentation of areas of suitable habitat, deliberate slaughter, collisions with vehicles and predation of the eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US {{have been attributed}} to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam. From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> because of global warming.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} we do not {{currently}} know the total number of species, in the past nor the present, makes it very difficult to accurately calculate the non-anthropogenically influenced extinction rates. As a rate, it is essential to know not just the number <b>of</b> <b>extinctions,</b> but also the number of non-extinctions. This fact, coupled {{with the fact that the}} rates do not remain constant, significantly reduces accuracy in estimates of the normal rate <b>of</b> <b>extinctions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Approximately 35% of {{echinoderm}} genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although taxa that {{thrived in}} low-latitude, shallow-water environments {{during the late}} Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K–Pg boundary. The pattern <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} fungi, little {{information}} {{is available on the}} threat <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> for Russulaceae species, and they have not been assessed in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List.

5|$|By 1887 {{the threat}} <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> {{was on the}} wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England.

5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American alligator was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> throughout all or a significant portion of its range.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{damage to}} the fossilized leaves of {{flowering}} plants from fourteen sites in North America were used {{as a proxy for}} insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity. During the early Paleocene, however, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7million years after the extinction event.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, {{the sudden}} spate <b>of</b> <b>extinctions</b> {{occurred}} earlier {{than in the}} Americas. Most evidence points to the period immediately after the first arrival of humans—thought {{to be a little}} under 50,000 years ago—but scientific argument continues as to the exact date range. In the rest of the Pacific (New Guinea, New Caledonia, the rest of Australasia and Oceania) although in some respects far later, endemic fauna also usually perished quickly upon the arrival of humans in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. This section does not include any spate <b>of</b> <b>extinctions</b> post 1000 BCE (e.g. subatlantic New Zealand or Hawaii).|$|R

5|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} {{has the lowest}} level of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species's ability to adapt to environmental pressures and limits natural selection thus increasing their risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.|$|E

This species is apparently a cooperative breeder, with family groups helping to protect the nest and feed the young. The hooded pitohui is common and not at risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b>|$|E

5|$|The last {{surviving}} raphine species, the Rodrigues solitaire, probably became extinct before 1778. The dodo survived until 1662 or 1690.
