5|$|Distinctive nativity {{scenes and}} traditions {{have been created}} around the world, and are {{displayed}} during the Christmas season in churches, homes, shopping malls, and other venues, and occasionally <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> and in public buildings. Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy, and in the United States their inclusion <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> or in public buildings has provoked court challenges.|$|E
5|$|Harrison became {{chairman}} of the Committee <b>on</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Lands</b> and successfully promoted passage of the Land Act of 1800, which {{made it easier to}} buy land in the Northwest Territory in smaller tracts at a low cost. The sale price for public lands was set at $2 per acre. This became an important contributor to rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory.|$|E
5|$|Nativity scenes {{have not}} escaped controversy. A life-sized {{scene in the}} United Kingdom {{featuring}} waxworks celebrities provoked outrage in 2004, and, in Spain, a city council forbade the exhibition of a traditional toilet humor character in a public nativity scene. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) indicates that animals in living displays lack proper care and suffer abuse. In the United States, nativity scenes <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> and in public buildings have provoked court challenges, and the prankish theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace.|$|E

5|$|Historian Robert Powell {{opined that}} Wickliffe's break from party loyalty may explain {{his lack of}} {{committee}} appointments in his early years in the House. Beginning in 1829, however, he chaired the Committee <b>on</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Lands.</b> In this capacity, he attacked Clay's plan to distribute surplus revenue among the states as being unfair to younger states. He also differed with Clay over Clay's willingness to limit slavery. He wrote Clay concerning his slowness {{to respond to the}} problem of fugitive slaves; Clay never responded. Neither was Wickliffe loyal to the Jacksonian platform, however. In a letter to his brother, he lamented Jackson's attacks on the Second Bank of the United States. He publicly encouraged Kentuckians to strengthen the Whigs, despite his disagreements with Clay.|$|E
5|$|Its name {{derives from}} potlatch, {{a type of}} {{ceremony}} held by the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest; one such tribe lived along the river {{for hundreds of years}} before the arrival of whites. Pioneers settled the watershed and established farms and ranches in the late 19th century. After that, logging eliminated most of the forests within the watershed and the ecology of the river is {{still in the process of}} recovery. Fishing, hiking and camping are popular recreational activities on the river; 14 percent the watershed lies <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> Before logging and agriculture, many varieties of riparian and forest plants once populated the catchment, and several species of fish still swim the river and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Neither Burch nor Smith {{had owned}} the cave or {{the land around}} it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal {{government}} began regulating {{the use of public}} lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee <b>on</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Lands</b> and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|E
25|$|Cattle {{have been}} in {{trespass}} <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> in southern Nevada {{for more than two}} decades. This is unfair to the thousands of other ranchers who graze livestock in compliance with federal laws and regulations throughout the West. The Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service have made repeated attempts to resolve this matter administratively and judicially. An impoundment of cattle illegally grazing <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> is now being conducted as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|In November 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act, which {{authorized}} BLM and the Forest Service to use helicopters and motor vehicles {{to round up}} and transport feral horses <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1985 the United States House of Representatives Subcommittees <b>on</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Lands</b> and National Parks and Recreation held a joint {{subcommittee}} hearing on Greater Yellowstone, {{resulting in a}} 1986 report by the Congressional Research Service outlining shortcomings in interagency coordination and concluding that the area's essential values were at risk.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Edward T. Taylor, a Representative from Colorado, reintroduced {{a bill to}} set up the grazing bureau {{or service}} in the Department of Interior to {{administer}} range lands. The TGA regulates grazing <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> (excluding in Alaska) to improve rangeland conditions. The Grazing Service was merged with the General Land Office in 1946 to form the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).|$|E

25|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} {{the presence of}} feral mustang herds, particularly <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> Supporters argue that mustangs {{are part of the}} natural heritage of the American West, whose history predates modern land use practices, and thus the animals have an inherent right of inhabitation. However, others remain vehemently opposed to their presence, arguing that the animals degrade rangeland and compete with livestock and wild species for forage.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{club members}} Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an {{internal}} caucus, to promote changes to club positions. They favored a zero-cut forest policy <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> and, {{a few years}} later, decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam. JMS was successful in changing club positions on both counts.|$|E
25|$|The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 (TGA) regulates grazing <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> (excluding Alaska) {{to improve}} {{rangeland}} conditions. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages about 167 million acres (676,000km²) of publicly owned rangeland in the United States, with the United States Forest Service managing approximately 95 million acres (380,000km²) more. Permittees on federal rangelands {{are required to}} pay a fee, and the permit cannot exceed ten years but is renewable.|$|E

25|$|In general, cattlemen did {{not feel}} that fencing was wrong. They {{believed}} they were fencing land unsuitable for any other uses, especially farming. Further, they believed a method of leasing land was a way to give value to the government land in the Sandhills and allow fencing to be legal. The House Committee <b>on</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Lands</b> held hearings on leasing and grazing legislation between January and June 1902.|$|E
25|$|Garland ran {{successfully}} for the United States Senate in 1876 and was reelected in 1883. In the Senate, {{he served as}} a member of the Committees <b>on</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Lands,</b> the Territories and the Judiciary, serving as chairman of the Territories Committee in the 46th Congress. As a Senator, he made efforts to bring about tariff reform, internal improvements, as well as the regulation of interstate commerce and a federal prison system, federal aid to education and civil service reform.|$|E
