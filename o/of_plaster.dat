40|$|In this paper, the {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>plasters</b> based on lime – brick powder binder of varying composition (ceramics content from 0 to 80  %) are studied. The plasters are prepared with a constant water amount. The {{pore size distribution}} is thus influenced in a positive way; the total porosity increases with the ceramics content but the volume of capillary pores is reduced. It results in lower water vapor diffusion resistance factor while the apparent moisture diffusivity coefficient increases just moderately. The influence of ceramic on strength <b>of</b> <b>plasters</b> is not found very important. The thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>plasters</b> containing ceramics is lower than those with the pure lime what is again {{in agreement with the}} pore size distribution. It can be concluded that fine brick powder can be used as pozzolanic admixture in lime based plasters with a positive influence on its functional parameters. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{structures}} at Zaculeu {{were grouped}} around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, {{coated with a}} thick layer <b>of</b> <b>plaster.</b> Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally brightly painted. Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of corbel vaulting has been found and {{very little in the}} way of stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown and crew, {{working for}} the American Museum of Natural History in New York, {{collected}} a nearly complete articulated skeleton with a partial skull in 1915. These fossils were {{also found in the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, near Steveville, Alberta. Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer compared the finds, and, though they allowed that both specimens were from the same general locality and geological formation, they considered the specimen sufficiently distinct from the holotype to warrant erecting a new species, and described the fossils as Styracosaurus parksi, named in honor of William Parks. Among the differences between the specimens cited by Brown and Schlaikjer were a cheekbone quite different from that of S. albertensis, and smaller tail vertebrae. S. parksi also had a more robust jaw, a shorter dentary, and the frill differed in shape from that of the type species. However, much of the skull consisted <b>of</b> <b>plaster</b> reconstruction, and the original 1937 paper did not illustrate the actual skull bones. It is now accepted as a specimen of S. albertensis.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer <b>of</b> <b>plaster</b> that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

However, at some extreme cases, such as battlefield or catastrophe, it can help people to survive for a longer time without proper food or water consumption. C.

5|$|The {{old town}} {{comprises}} {{a large number}} of medieval and Renaissance buildings. The quai des Tanneurs ("tanners' quay") {{is one of the most}} picturesque streets in Alsace. A stream used to flow in the middle of the street until the beginning of the 20th century, the relic of a former noxious-smelling trade, since tanning required large amounts of flowing water for treating and washing animal skins. Most of the old tanner houses date back to the Middle Ages and have a tall attic to provide a ventilated space for drying leather. In the neighbouring streets, rue des Oies ("geese street") and rue des Veaux ("calf street"), many houses were covered with a coat <b>of</b> <b>plaster</b> in the 19th century in order to hide the timbering, which was considered too rustic.|$|E
5|$|In a later period, the two central {{cells of}} the rear wall have been {{combined}} by breaking the partition in between to house the Ganesha image. The old entrance was also widened during the conversion to the Ganesha temple. There are two other smaller entrances to the hall. All entrances bear marks of sockets for fixing wooden doors, added during the conversion, and still have doors. The hall also has traces <b>of</b> <b>plaster</b> and paintings, both added during the conversion and renewed in later times - possibly {{as late as the}} 19th century. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1882) records that the hall was plastered and white-washed. The paintings depicted Ganesha's childhood, marriage preparations, battle with demons and so forth, along with scenes of other Hindu deities like Devi, Krishna, Vishnu and Shiva. Some of the cells fitted with wooden doors were used for storage. Nine Sati memorials were added on the left wall during the conversion, each is {{in the shape of a}} long pillar with an arched top, and to the right of each pillar a hand raised above the elbow, with an open palm, signifies Sati's blessing. While three panels were plain, the other memorials were sculpted. All of them are worn out, but one of them hints that its subject may be the immolation of Sati on her husband's funeral pyre.|$|E

40|$|The case of Ascoli Piceno’s {{historic}} center, {{described by}} travellers and studiouses of various periods {{as a city}} of travertine, explains the phenomenon regarding the demolition <b>of</b> the <b>plaster,</b> in the ancient and modern buildings. The preservation <b>of</b> <b>plastered</b> surfaces is very complex, above all for the twentieth century’s fronts. The desire to see the natural material "on sight" after having worked to compose the architecture is particularly prevalent in public opinion and the dissenting voices {{are not able to}} deal effectively with these opinions available. Regulatory instruments, developed in various forms, including guides, technical standards and codifications are not, in most cases, sufficiently incisive interventions to prevent the plaster removal. The methods of intervention are therefore oriented towards the destruction <b>of</b> <b>plastered</b> surfaces, showing the wall, even if it’s presented as a set of parts - considered archaeological signs. They require a formal unit, through a plaster surface that imitates the natural stone of travertine. This report considers a representative area of the historical centre, affected by obvious processes of transformation with additions of monumental buildings.
