40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{questions of}} gender and genre in early writing by drawing on systemic linguistic theory, It is a longitudinal case study that compares the writing development of two children, {{a boy and a}} girl/ who learned to write in classrooms that adopted an approach to writing known in Australia as 2 ̆ 7 process writing 1, The children 2 ̆ 7 s written texts were analysed using the systemic functional grammar as developed by MAK, Hallidey and the models of genre and register as proposed by J,R, Martin. The children were followed for the first {{two and a half years}} of their schooling, from the first day of kindergarten to the middle of grade two. They were observed weekly during the daily ‘writing time’ and all texts were collected. Although the children were ostensibly 2 ̆ 7 free’ to determine both the writing topics and text types they produced, systemic analysis revealed that: 1) the majority of texts written were of one genre, the Observation genre, in which the children reconstructed their personal experience with family and friends and offered an evaluation of it. 2) a significant pattern of gender differences occurred within this genre, such that the boy reconstructed experience in terms of the male cultural stereotype of being an active participant in the world, while the girl reconstructed experience in terms of the female stereotype of being a more passive observer of experience. It is the strength of systemic linguistic analysis that it revealed how the choices the children made in language were constrained by a number of social and cultural contexts, including: a) the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s theoretical orientation to literacy; b) the models of spoken and written language available to the children; and c) the ideology of gender in the culture. In particular, the analysis made visible how children appropriate the meanings of their culture and socialise themselves into gender roles by constructing the ideology of gender in their writing. The study contributes to an understanding of genres by offering a revised description of the Observation genre, which derives from the <b>Observation</b> <b>Comment</b> genre originally identified by Martin and Rothery (1981). It also raises a number of implications for teacher training and classroom practice, including the need for: 1) increased teacher consciousness about gender and genre, especially an understanding that choices in language are socially constructed 2) a critical reassessment of the notion of 2 ̆ 7 free topic choice’ promoted by 2 ̆ 7 process writing 2 ̆ 7 pedagogy, a practice which may limit choice and tacitly support the gender status quo...|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationThis {{research}} project came about {{in response to}} two innovations introduced to the language-learning curriculum for the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE), the curriculum for the final two years of secondary schooling in Victoria. These innovations, which gave the teacher more control over oral assessment and introduced a vocationally oriented focus to the generalist curriculum, appeared to offer positive change to the curriculum. Yet a more detailed investigation into {{the structure of the}} curriculum led to a concern that it had the potential to set back rather than advance language learning. Central to this concern {{was the fact that the}} curriculum design seeks to foster language learning for interpersonal communication in an assessment model that is grounded in an outcomes- and competency-based framework, thus bringing together the ambiguity inherent in intercultural communication and the clarity demanded by a curriculum that focuses on behavioural outcomes. A need was identified for language-specific research to investigate the role of intercultural knowledge in communication and to propose a way for this knowledge to be incorporated into the curriculum framework. This {{research project}} took up this challenge with a focus on the Indonesian language. A topic was chosen from the curriculum as the basis for collecting authentic data in Indonesian settings. The topic was 'finding accommodation' and data collection focussed on finding accommodation in a kos, a type of room rental common for single people in Indonesia. Data were collected from research sites in two Indonesian towns over a period of six months in 2001. Four methods of data collection were used: ethnographic interviews, participant <b>observation,</b> <b>comment</b> banks and role-plays. Cultural themes in the data were identified through domain analysis and noticing, and themes identified in one source of data were verified in other sources. One source of data, the kos interview role-plays, was analysed using discourse analysis to help patterns emerge and thus develop a model for a generic text-type for teaching. This research project found that cultural knowledge and values are expressed in the course of communication in a kos interview that are different to what the learner might expect if approaching this text-type from a position grounded in Australian culture; that different norms to Australian norms can be identified and a workable pattern of these norms extracted from the data and incorporated into a framework for meeting the requirements of the VCE curriculum. The model for incorporating intercultural communication into the VCE curriculum proposed in this research project serves as a starting point for further research into the intercultural dimensions of Indonesian interaction in different settings with the aim of enhancing the resources available to teachers of Indonesian in Australia.
