40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a functional super Read Out Driver (sROD) demonstrator for the Phase II Upgrade of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) in the LHC experiment. The proposed front-end for the Phase II Upgrade communicates with back-end electronics using a multifiber optical connector with a data rate of 57. 6 Gbps using the GBT protocol. This functional sROD demonstrator aims to help in the understanding of the problems that could arise in the upgrade of back-end electronics. The demonstrator is composed of three different boards that have been developed in the framework of ATLAS activities: the Optical Multiplexer Board (OMB), the Read-Out Driver (ROD) and the <b>Optical</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Card</b> (OLC). The first two boards, OMB and ROD, are part of the current back-end system where OMB receives two optical fibers with redundant data from front-end, performs online CRC for data and send to ROD the data from the error-free fiber; and ROD is the main element of the back-end electronics and it is responsible for data processing. Both boards are a 9 U VME format. Moreover, the last board, OLC, has been developed as an evaluation board for studying high-speed optical links for the R&amp;D of the TileCal Upgrade. It includes two SNAP 12 optical connectors which are able to transmit and receive up to 75 Gbps and an Altera Stratix II GX FPGA as processing device. The scheme of the functional sROD demonstrator includes an OLC plugged in an OMB board where OLC receives data from upgraded front-end via a SNAP 12 connector at 57. 6 Gbps and decodes it using a GBT decoder. OMB reads decoded data from OLC via mezzanine connectors, performs online CRC and sends data to ROD via a SFP connector at 640 Mbps. Once ROD has received data, it performs the Optimal Filtering algorithms. This functional sROD demonstrator will be used to develop a prototype, in ATCA format, of the new ROD for the Phase II...|$|E

40|$|High {{speed and}} ultra low power serial data {{transmission}} over fiber optics plays an essential roll in detector front-end electronics readout for experiments at the LHC. The ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter front-end readout upgrade for the sLHC {{calls for an}} <b>optical</b> <b>link</b> system with a data bandwidth of 100 Gbps per each front-end board (FEB), a factor of 62 increase compared with the present <b>optical</b> <b>link</b> system.

40|$|Free-space <b>optical</b> <b>links</b> {{can provide}} high bandwidth, flexible, {{high-density}} interconnections between electronic elements within computers and switches. These links function with no physical contact but suffer from poor tolerances to misalignment. This thesis presents {{the design and}} implementation of an <b>optical</b> <b>link</b> which exploits the spatial redundancy between arrays of active optoelectronic elements {{in order to obtain}} a high misalignment tolerance between them. The system consists of four <b>optical</b> <b>links</b> operating between two printed circuit boards. Each <b>optical</b> <b>link</b> pair constitutes a bi-directional channel. Each of the links is designed to function at 1. 25 Gb/s, yielding an aggregate bandwidth of 5 Gb/s for the system. The system is design to function under +/- 1 mm and +/- 1 ° of lateral and angular misalignments, respectively, with a working distance between the boards varying from 5 cm to 22 cm. The design of the system makes it ideal for rack or shelf based optical interconnections. The design of this <b>optical</b> <b>link</b> exploits the spatial redundancy between a two-dimensional array of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) and a two-dimensional array of photodetectors (PD).
