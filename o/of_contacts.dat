40|$|Twists <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> {{structures}} in dimension 3 and higher are studied {{in this paper}} from a viewpoint <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> round surgery. Three kinds of new modifications <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> structures which are higher-dimensional generalizations of the $ 3 $-dimensional Lutz twists are introduced. One of the operations makes a contact manifold overtwisted in any dimension. Another one makes it weakly symplectically non-fillable. And the other one makes it strongly symplectically non-fillable. In other words, they make the overtwisted disc, the bordered Legendrian open books, and the Giroux domains, respectively. The first two modifications can be realized by sequences <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> round surgeries. The first operation can be applied anywhere <b>of</b> any <b>contact</b> manifold easily. Further, {{a version of the}} first operation keeps the homotopy classes <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> structures as almost contact structures, and the other version contributes to the Euler classes <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> structures...|$|R

5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period the Mahdi's family became wealthy from cotton {{production}} based on irrigation and migrant laborers, mainly their Baggara followers from Darfur and Kordofan. These western tribes {{had been the}} backbone of the original Mahdist movement. The riverine tribes were more inclined to side with the rival Khatmiyya movement. The government supported Abd al-Rahman in these commercial enterprises. Abd al-Rahman's economic activity, and the resulting wide range <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> with merchants and owners of pump-schemes for irrigating cotton fields, gave him influence among Sudanese engaged in commerce. As of 1 January 1922 the government suspended payment of allowances to Mahdist notables other than the old and those whose movements were restricted. The allowance of Abd al-Rahman was increased somewhat, but only so that he could support old women and other incapable people whose allowances had been stopped.|$|E

The effect of nano-modified coatings and welding process parameters on wear <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> tube for non-copper coated solid wires was reviewed.

The wear <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> tube increases with the increase of welding current.

5|$|The {{attacks on}} Bien Hoa forced {{a change in}} tactics for the Australians, and 1 ATF's mission was quickly changed from reconnaissance-in-force to a {{blocking}} operation designed to intercept withdrawing communist forces. Between 31 January and 1 February, the Australian battalions moved into company blocking positions {{and a number of}} minor contacts occurred, resulting in some Viet Cong casualties and the capture of more weapons and equipment. Once in position, the intensity of these clashes increased as the Australians sprung platoon ambushes. Indeed, during early February, the nature <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> in AO Columbus began to change, with the Australians increasingly faced by larger company-sized Main Force units located in static defensive positions. During the first week of February the Viet Cong began streaming through the AO, retreating from Saigon in the wake of heavy losses during Tet. Although the Viet Cong managed to avoid becoming decisively engaged, around 90 were killed and five captured, as the Australians maintained their blocking positions.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{generally}} satisfactory {{situation in}} Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems {{from time to}} time. He was on one occasion – probably because of his wide network <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> – {{the subject of an}} anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he therefore moved him to the University of Bologna. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{contact area}} plays an {{important}} role in defining friction at micro/nano-scale. Unlike at macro-scale where friction is independent <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> area between surfaces (Amonton’s law, [4, 14]), at small-scales friction is strongly dependent on contact area [4, 14, 15]. According to Bowden and Tabor, friction force directly depends on the real area <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> for a single asperity contact (Ff = τ Ar, where τ is the shear strength, an interfacial property, and Ar the real area <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> [16]). This law is effective at micro/nano-scale and any reduction in real area <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> directly reduces friction between surfaces at these scales. As a result, patterned surfaces directly reduce real area <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> as similar to the protuberances on lotus leaves.|$|R
5|$|The {{scheme of}} {{manoeuvre}} adopted by 1 RAR dictated that each company undertake a dispersed patrol program {{in their own}} tactical area of responsibility, a fact which {{would allow them to}} search more ground, but limit their ability to concentrate combat power in the event of contact. A Company, under Major John Healy, patrolled east; B Company moved north along the Song Be to Xom Xoai, while D Company patrolled south. C Company remained at LZ Queen to protect 105 Field Battery which had established a fire support base (FSB). Over the next two days the Australians patrolled relentlessly through the leech-infested swamps and dense jungle. At midday on 6 November A Company received two mortar rounds which failed to do any damage, but marked the start of a series of minor clashes. A Company had a number <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> during this time, with the Australians killing a Viet Cong scout for the loss of two wounded in one skirmish. A further contact soon after resulted in two more Viet Cong killed and one wounded. Intelligence gained from these incidents indicated the presence of a Viet Cong Main Force Regiment in the area, while documents recovered contained plans for attacks on ARVN outposts near Bien Hoa Airbase.|$|E
