5|$|Forecasters {{initially}} predicted {{wind shear}} from an upper level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days. However, the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear, {{and the system}} intensified into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing. The convection gradually consolidated over the system, and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60mph (95km/h) while passing 50miles (80km) north of the northern Leeward Islands. The structure <b>of</b> <b>Chris</b> continued to improve and become more symmetrical, and an upper level eye feature developed early on August 2. Outflow improved in all quadrants, as well, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h) shortly thereafter while located 120miles (195km) east of St. Thomas. Despite initial predictions <b>of</b> <b>Chris</b> intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west-northwestward, upper level shear dissipated the well-defined inner core of the storm, and Chris started to weaken.|$|E

In July 2011, Langford revealed {{that he had seen}} some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up.

The writer also commented on the introduction <b>of</b> <b>Chris's</b> father and said that he was [...] "delighted" [...] that Chris was finally getting his own drama, that was [...] "pretty realistic." [...] He added [...] "It's nice to see the father/son dynamic play out. I have the feeling that a lot <b>of</b> <b>Chris's</b> dad's issues stem from the fact that his son is gay and I hope the show will delve into those unresoved issues." ...|$|R
