6000|$|Thither they went. It was not new {{to either}} of them. Ostrander knew it {{as an artist and}} as an American reader of that French {{historic}} romance--a reader who hurried over the sham intrigues of the <b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> <b>Boeuf,</b> the sham pastorals of the Petit Trianon, and the sham heroics of a shifty court, to get to Lafayette. Helen knew it as a child who had dodged these lessons from her patriotic father, but had enjoyed the woods, the parks, the terraces, and particularly the restaurant at the park gates. That day they took it like a boy and girl,--with the amused, omniscient tolerance of youth for a past so inferior to the present. Ostrander thought this gray-eyed, independent American-French girl far superior to the obsequious filles d'honneur, whose brocades had rustled through those quinquonces, and Helen vaguely realized the truth of her fellow pupil's mischievous criticism of her companion that day at the Louvre. Surely there was no classical statue here comparable to the one-armed soldier-painter! ...|$|E

60|$|She {{thought nothing}} more {{of him that}} day in her {{finishing}} exercises. But the next morning as she went to open her window after dressing, she drew back with a new consciousness, and then, making a peephole in the curtain, looked over the opposite roofs. She had seen them many times before, but now they had acquired a new picturesqueness, which as her view was, of course, the reverse of the poor painter's sketch, {{must have been a}} transfigured memory of her own. Then she glanced curiously along the line of windows level with hers. All these, however, with their occasional revelations of the menage behind them, were also familiar to her, but now she began to wonder which was his. A singular instinct at last impelled her to lift her eyes. Higher in the corner house, and so near the roof that it scarcely seemed possible for a grown man to stand upright behind it, was an <b>oeil</b> <b>de</b> <b>boeuf</b> looking down upon the other roofs, and framed in that circular opening like a vignette was the handsome face of Major Ostrander. His eyes seemed to be turned towards her window. Her first impulse was to open it and recognize him with a friendly nod. But an odd mingling of mischief and shyness made her turn away quickly.|$|E
6000|$|On the 10th May, 1774, {{the whole}} court had {{assembled}} at the château; the <b>oeil</b> <b>de</b> <b>Boeuf</b> was full. The Dauphin had determined to depart {{as soon as}} the king had breathed his last. And it was agreed by the people of the stables, with those who watched in the king's room, that a lighted candle should be placed in a window, and should be extinguished as soon as he had ceased to live. The candle was put out. At that signal, guards, pages, and squires mounted on horseback, and everything was made ready for departure. The Dauphin was with the Dauphiness, waiting together for the news of the king's demise. AN IMMENSE NOISE, AS IF OF THUNDER, WAS HEARD IN THE NEXT ROOM; it was the crowd of courtiers, who were deserting the dead king's apartment, in order to pay their court to the new power of Louis XVI. Madame de Noailles entered, and was the first to salute the queen by her title of Queen of France, and begged their Majesties to quit their apartments, to receive the princes and great lords of the court desirous to pay their homage to the new sovereigns. Leaning on her husband's arm, a handkerchief to her eyes, in the most touching attitude, Marie Antoinette received these first visits. On quitting the chamber where the dead king lay, the Duc de Villequier bade M. Anderville, first surgeon of the king, to open and embalm the body: it would have been certain death to the surgeon. [...] "I am ready, sir," [...] said he; [...] "but whilst I am operating, you must hold the head of the corpse: your charge demands it." [...] The Duke went away without a word, and the body was neither opened nor embalmed. A few humble domestics and poor workmen watched by the remains, and performed the last offices to their master. The surgeons ordered spirits of wine to be poured into the coffin.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> Perdrix is a rosé wine {{produced}} in Switzerland. The {{history of the}} wine style {{dates back to the}} Middle Ages in the Champagne region of France and from there spread to the Canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland where it would become a popular dry rosé made from Pinot noir. The name [...] "Œil de perdrix" [...] means [...] "eye of partridge" [...] in French, a reference to the pale pink colour of the eye of a partridge in death throes. Until about a century ago, it was common for vineyards to have the red and white grapes unseparated unlike today where each vineyard has a unique grape. This gave white wine, red wine and what was called grey wine because the wine was neither white nor red. It is also an old name for very pale rosé wine made - not by the saignée method- but by [...] "pressurage direct", in which the juice of red grapes is drawn off and fermented with very little contact with the skins. With the modernization of viticulture and separation of grapes the term <b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> Perdrix disappeared in France but remained in the Canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. The Canton of Neuchâtel would export the <b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> Perdix primarily to the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland but also to other cantons, namely to the cantons of Geneva, Vaud and Valais. After the Second World War, the latter decided to start producing their own <b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> Perdrix. When the policy for wine of controlled origin (AOC) in Switzerland began, the Canton of Neuchâtel claimed the sole <b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> Perdrix AOC but it was refused and the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Valais and Neuchâtel, all have the <b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> Perdrix AOC today. The early origins of the American wine White Zinfandel can be traced to a California winemakers attempt at making an <b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> Perdrix style wine.|$|R

There, she displays open bodies, reconstructed from resin and marble {{in the style of the}} anatomic waxes of the 18th century which she had closely studied at La Specola Museum of Florence. Fluctuating between realism ("Flesh and bones", 1980) and slight abstraction ("The Tarot Arcana", 1993) or total abstraction ("Limps", 2007), she develops her recurrent theme of human finitude. She illustrates it with bronze, wood, sponge, glass, rubber or computer cables. In 1984 she is a laureate of the General Council of Ile de France for a marble work integrating a hologram.|$|E
5000|$|Oeil-de-boeuf, also <b>œil</b> <b>de</b> <b>bœuf,</b> (French, [...] "bull's eye"), and {{sometimes}} anglicized as ox-eye window, {{is a relatively}} small oval window, typically for an upper storey, {{and sometimes}} set on a roof slope as a dormer, or above a door to give light. Windows of this type are commonly found in the grand architecture of Baroque France. The term is also so often applied to similar round windows, like those found in Georgian architecture in Great Britain, and later Greek Revival and Colonial Revival styles in North America, that this must be {{considered part of the}} usage. The term initially applied to horizontal oval windows, but is also used for vertical ones.|$|E

In 1975, this wine experienced a stuck fermentation, and the pink, sweet style of White Zinfandel, that {{would go on to}} enjoy massive commercial success, was thus accidentally born. Bob Trinchero originally planned to name the new wine <b>Oeil</b> <b>de</b> Perdrix, but the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) demanded that Trinchero translate the name, so he added [...] "White Zinfandel" [...] to the label.|$|R

Even so, the building was executed from 1546 to 1551 set the mold of French classicism: it is of two stories with an attic richly embellished with Jean Goujon's panels of bas-reliefs; it is crowned by a sloping roof, a traditional feature of French building and practical in a rainy climate.
