5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes nitroglycerin, beta blockers and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates. Many of these drugs have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> that occurs with the pain, or by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E
5|$|The {{heart is}} cone-shaped, with its base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). The heart is typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle, similar to the response of skeletal muscle.|$|E

As part of the regeneration at the Brewery Site in the town centre, Dorchester South railway station will become the first solar powered railway station in the UK.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
