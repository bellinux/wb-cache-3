40|$|Purpose: Medication-related {{clinical}} {{decision support}} (CDS) has been identiﬁed as a method to improve patient outcomes but is historically frequently <b>overridden</b> and may be inappropriately so. Patients {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) are at a higher risk of harm from adverse drug events (ADEs) and these <b>overrides</b> may increase patient harm. The objective of this study is to determine appropriateness of <b>overridden</b> medication-related CDS <b>overrides</b> in the ICU. Materials and methods: We evaluated <b>overridden</b> medication-related alerts of four alert categories from January 2009 to December 2011. The primary outcome was the appropriateness of a random sample of <b>overrides</b> based on predetermined criteria. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs) that re-sulted from the <b>overridden</b> alert. Results: A total of 47, 449 <b>overridden</b> alerts were included for evaluation. The appropriateness rate for <b>overridden</b> alerts varied by alert category (allergy: 94...|$|R
40|$|Background: Electronic {{prescribing}} {{is increasingly}} used, {{in part because}} of government incentives for its use. Many of its benefits come from clinical decision support (CDS), but often too many alerts are displayed, resulting in alert fatigue. Objective: To characterize the <b>override</b> rates for medication-related CDS alerts in the outpatient setting, the reasons cited for <b>overrides</b> at the time of prescribing, and the appropriateness of <b>overrides.</b> Methods We measured CDS alert <b>override</b> rates and the coded reasons for <b>overrides</b> cited by providers at the time of prescribing. Our primary outcome was the rate of CDS alert overrides; our secondary outcomes were the rate of <b>overrides</b> by alert type, reasons cited for <b>overrides</b> at the time of prescribing, and <b>override</b> appropriateness for a subset of 600 alert <b>overrides.</b> Through detailed chart reviews of alert <b>override</b> cases, and selective literature review, we developed appropriateness criteria for each alert type, which were modified iteratively as necessary until consensus was reached on all criteria. Results: We reviewed 157   483 CDS alerts (7. 9...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying alert <b>override</b> {{has been}} the focus of much {{research}} in health informatics, with <b>override</b> rate traditionally viewed as a surrogate inverse indicator for alert effectiveness. However, relying on alert <b>override</b> to assess computerized alerts assumes that alerts are being read and determined to be irrelevant by users. Our research suggests that this is unlikely to be the case when users are experiencing alert overload. We propose that over time, alert <b>override</b> becomes habitual. The <b>override</b> response is activated by environmental cues and repeated automatically, with limited conscious intention. In this paper we outline this new perspective on understanding alert <b>override.</b> We present evidence consistent with the notion of alert <b>override</b> as a habitual behavior and discuss implications of this novel perspective for future research on alert <b>override,</b> a common and persistent problem accompanying decision support system implementation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although most outpatients are {{relatively}} healthy, many have chronic renal insufficiency, and high <b>override</b> rates for suggestions on renal dosing have been observed. To {{better understand the}} <b>override</b> of renal dosing alerts in an outpatient setting, we conducted a study to evaluate which patients were more frequently prescribed contraindicated medications, to assess providers' responses to suggestions, and to examine the drugs involved {{and the reasons for}} <b>overrides.</b> Methods: We obtained data on renal alert <b>overrides</b> and the coded reasons for <b>overrides</b> cited by providers at the time of prescription from outpatient clinics and ambulatory hospital-based practices at a large academic health care center over a period of 3 years, from January 2009 to December 2011. For detailed chart review, a group of 6 trained clinicians developed the appropriateness criteria with excellent inter-rater reliability (kappa = 0. 93). We stratified providers by <b>override</b> frequency and then drew samples from the high- and low-frequency groups. We measured the rate of total <b>overrides,</b> rate of appropriate <b>overrides,</b> medications <b>overridden,</b> and the reason(s) for <b>override.</b> Results: A total of 4120 renal alerts were triggered by 584 prescribers in the study period, among which 78. 2...|$|R

5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor.

40|$|Background Experts {{suggest that}} {{formulary}} alerts {{at the time}} of medication order entry are the most effective form of clinical decision support to automate formulary management. Objective Our objectives were to quantify the frequency of inappropriate nonformulary medication (NFM) alert <b>overrides</b> in the inpatient setting and provide insight on how the design of formulary alerts could be improved. Methods Alert <b>overrides</b> of the top 11 (n[*]=[*] 206) most-utilized and highest-costing NFMs, from January 1 to December 31, 2012, were randomly selected for appropriateness evaluation. Using an empirically developed appropriateness algorithm, appropriateness of NFM alert <b>overrides</b> was assessed by 2 pharmacists via chart review. Appropriateness agreement of <b>overrides</b> was assessed with a Cohen’s kappa. We also assessed which types of NFMs were most likely to be inappropriately <b>overridden,</b> the <b>override</b> reasons that were disproportionately provided in the inappropriate <b>overrides,</b> and the specific reasons the <b>overrides</b> were considered inappropriate.

In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana.

5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for <b>overriding</b> vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|Black was the <b>overriding</b> colour {{for this}} period, with one exception. Streamlined {{locomotives}} Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E

40|$|In both {{judicial}} decisions and critical commentary on statutory interpretation, {{the possibility of}} congressional <b>override</b> is generally considered a significant balance to the countermajoritarian reality that courts, through statutory interpretation, make policy. This Article demonstrates that the “check” on judicial power provided by <b>overrides</b> is not as robust as is typically assumed. Despite the importance routinely ascribed to <b>overrides,</b> the actual effect of <b>overrides</b> has received surprisingly little attention within the academic community. This is perhaps because one might assume that <b>overridden</b> precedents are functionally erased or reversed. But because Congress technically cannot overrule a prior decision, courts must determine whether the enactment of an <b>override</b> fully supersedes the prior judicial interpretation. Thus <b>overrides</b> raise unique, and previously largely ignored, questions of statutory interpretation. Using examples from employment discrimination, {{an area of the}} law where Congress frequently <b>overrides</b> Supreme Court decisions, this Article demonstrates that the Supreme Court and lower courts often narrowly construe the significance of congressional <b>overrides</b> and instead rely on the prior judicial interpretation of statutes as expressed in <b>overridden</b> precedents. Thus, for example, although Congress clearly disagreed with a Supreme Court decision holding that pregnancy discrimination is not sex discrimination, lower courts, noting that the statutory language of the <b>override</b> only explicitly references “pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,” continue to apply the reasoning employed by the Court in that <b>overridden</b> case when faced with sex discrimination claims in other contexts. I call this phenomenon reliance on “shadow precedents. ” The Article shows how reliance on shadow precedents threatens legislative supremacy and undermines the standard rationales offered for adherence to precedent. It argues that, in drafting <b>overrides,</b> Congress should strive to clarify {{the extent to which it}} disagrees with the prior judicial interpretation. It also argues that courts should adopt interpretive conventions that are more respectful of the significance of the enactment of an override: (1) a rebuttable presumption that an <b>override</b> supersedes the judicial interpretation of the pre-existing statutory language, thus requiring “fresh” interpretation of the original statute as well as the <b>override,</b> and (2) a clear rule that <b>overridden</b> interpretations are no longer binding on lower courts.

5|$|Japanese {{strategic}} {{plans for a}} decisive battle with the U.S. fleet were already established by September 1944. Anticipating the various options open to American landing forces, the Japanese operational order, code named Sho ("victory"), provided four scenarios to counter an invasion anywhere between the Philippines and the Kuriles. The plan was problematic for morale, however, because it broke with IJN tradition by assigning <b>overriding</b> importance to sinking U.S. supply vessels rather than U.S. warships. As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Soemu Toyoda flew out to the front in early October to rally the troops behind Sho.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolence is an <b>overriding</b> theme {{within the}} Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing {{in the strongest}} terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is {{nonetheless}} flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.|$|E

40|$|In Massachusetts, Proposition 2 Â½ limits local {{property}} taxes to 2. 5 % of assessed value (the "levy ceiling") and restricts the current limit on property tax revenue (the "levy limit") {{to an annual}} growth rate of 2. 5 %. Town residents can vote to <b>override</b> the 2. 5 % increase in the levy limit, but not if it exceeds the 2. 5 % levy ceiling. An <b>override</b> results in a permanent increase in the city or town's levy limit. We look at the role that Proposition 2 Â½ has played in the fiscal conditions of towns in Massachusetts. To do so, we develop a model of Proposition 2 Â½ <b>override</b> activity and local fiscal condition. We estimate the model using panel data on Proposition 2 Â½ <b>override</b> attempts since the mid- 1980 's {{as well as other}} town-level socioeconomic and fiscal information. Using a fixed effects estimator, we find that passing a reasonably sized <b>override</b> can significantly strengthen local fiscal condition, both in the short-run and long-run. Further, previous <b>override</b> attempts increase the likelihood of current <b>override</b> activity. The recent economic downturn has resulted in difficult times for local governments. Cuts in state aid have a disproportionate impact on poorer towns.
