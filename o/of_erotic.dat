40|$|The article {{presents}} four erotic poems by Franciszek Dionizy Kniaźnin: Spocznienie, Z Anakreonta, Ognie młodości and Pasterka, {{together with an}} editorial compilation. All poems come from the first book <b>of</b> <b>Erotics</b> published in 1779 and the goal underlying their selection was to present the variety of motifs intertwining in this anthology. The book has its direct addressee, namely the mythological Roman goddess of love, and a considerable part <b>of</b> Kniaznin’s <b>erotics</b> are dedicated to this emotion in which Cupid, Venus and Nymphs get people entangled. The first book also includes poems translated from Anacreon, Horace, Claudian, Durini or Sappho. These are paraphrases whose prevailing theme is Bacchic. Several poems reflect on the irreversibly passing human existence that cannot be prevented or stopped, or the ideal realm of shepherds governed by the natural impulse of the heart. The poems discussed herein show richness of forms and motifs introduced on the pages <b>of</b> <b>Erotics</b> by Franciszek Dionizy Kniaźnin, scantily discussed before.

40|$|In the literature, the Netherlands {{is known}} for its pragmatic and {{accepting}} approach of youth sexuality and young people’s sexual health. Comprehensive school-based sexual and relational education (SRE) is often assumed by scholars to be a key explanatory factor for the low prevalence rates of STIs, teen pregnancies, and abortions. Yet, it is surprising that actual SRE practices in Dutch secondary schools have hardly been researched. In the current qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 Dutch teachers to explore whether evidence of different discourses (i. e., "official discourse" or "discourse of erotics") could be found in their SRE teaching practices. Many interviewed teachers’ use of a discourse <b>of</b> <b>erotics</b> approach was reflected in the topics they discussed, their engagement with student diversity, and their recommended competencies. Yet, they also encountered various difficulties in fully incorporating a discourse <b>of</b> <b>erotics,</b> for instance, regarding how to discuss certain topics (e. g., homosexuality), or how to meet different students’ needs (e. g., in multicultural classrooms). The findings indicate that SRE discourse theories are useful not only for the theorization of effective SRE, but also for the evaluation of actual SRE practices. We conclude that closing the gap between SRE theories and practices, by paying attention to the discourse <b>of</b> <b>erotics</b> approach in teacher training programs, would benefit both teachers and students...|$|R
