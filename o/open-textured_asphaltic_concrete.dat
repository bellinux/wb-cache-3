POFA was grained and passed through 75 µm sieve; a number of trial mixes were prepared using the Marshal Mix design procedure with 5 % POFA to arrive at asphalt concrete mixtures that fulfill the Marshal criteria. The effects of POFA on stability, flow, stiffness and indirect tensile strength of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> (AC 14) mixtures at their respective optimum binder content were evaluated.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is on simple shear deformation of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> and its connection to the problem of permanent deformation (rutting) in <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements caused by heavy traffic conditions and high temperature. Emphasis is placed on the mechanics of damage (rutting) to the upper <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> layers. Rutting is a major problem in countries with a hot climate, heavy traffic, and unregulated axle weight. This research summarizes some information gathered from the literature on the importance given to the general problem of permanent deformation of asphalt mixtures and the procedures and constitutive models used to design <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> mixture, pavement structures, and to evaluate <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> stability. Results from this effort showed contact stresses are under-estimated in pavement structure, surface shear stress due wheel contact are not considered in asphalt concrete design, and equipment used in asphalt concrete laboratories are not suitable to simulate the state of stress at which an element under a wheel is subjected to. In this research, the behavior of an <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> mixture, used on a project in Arizona, is evaluated through fundamental mechanics and appropriate laboratory experimental verification. Much of the research effort is devoted to the design and development of a new compaction and simple shear apparatus.

This study therefore, evaluates {{the effect of the}} fineness of POFA on the mechanical properties of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> AC 14. Using 4 different categories of POFA fineness (based on 30 min of grinding, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min), a number of trial mixes were prepared using the Marshall Mix design procedure with 5 % POFA to arrive at asphalt concrete mixtures that fulfil the Marshall criteria. The effects of each POFA fineness category on the stability, flow, stiffness, indirect tensile strength and cantabro loss of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> (AC 14) mixtures at their respective optimum binder content were evaluated. The results show that Marshall stability, flow, stiffness indirect tensile strength and cantabro loss values were generally higher when POFA is grinded than that of controlled specimens, but after some period of grinding (peak of the curve), the values diminished.

This study present the laboratory evaluation of aggregate properties on coconut shell and the performance of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> that use coconut shell to replace the fine aggregate.

This study was designed to look at the portland cement concrete overlay alternative and especially the design of overlays for existing composite (portland cement and <b>asphaltic</b> cement <b>concrete)</b> pavements. Existing design procedures for portland cement concrete overlays deal primarily with an existing <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> pavement with an underlying granular base or stabilized base.

However, experience in the construction and operation of high dams (above 160 m) is not available, and their work is scarcely explored. In this regard, the paper discusses the results of computational prediction of the stress-strain state and stability of a high earth dam (256 m high) with the core. The authors considered <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> containing 7 % of bitumen as the material of the core. Gravel was considered as the material of resistant prisms. Design characteristics of the rolled <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> and gravel were obtained from the processing of the results of triaxial tests. The calculations were performed using finite element method in elastoplastic formulation and basing on the phased construction of the dam and reservoir filling. The research shows, that the work of embankment dam with vertical core during filling of the reservoir is characterized by horizontal displacement of the lower resistant prism in the tailrace and the formation of a hard wedge prism descending along the core in the upper resistant prism. The key issue of the safety assessment is to determine the safety factor of the overall stability of the dam, for calculation of which the destruction of the earth dam is necessary, which can be done by reducing the strength properties of the dam materials. As a results of the calculations, the destruction of the dam occurs with a decrease in the strength characteristics of the materials of the dam by 2. 5 times. The dam stability depends on the stability of the lower resistant prism. The destruction of its slope occurs on the classical circular-cylindrical surface. The presence of a potential collapse surface in the upper resistant prism (on the edges of the descending wedge) does not affect the overall stability of the dam...|$|R

The resulting tar mixtures were in general conformity with Mixes 4 T {base) and 7 T (surface) of ASTM D 1753 - 67. Although the Marshall stability was 3000 pounds at I 00 °F, the tar surface course has thinned in the wheel tracks and thickened outside the wheel paths.
