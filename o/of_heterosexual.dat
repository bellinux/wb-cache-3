5|$|Living as unwed {{partners}} is {{also known}} as cohabitation. The number <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> unmarried couples in the United States has increased tenfold, from about 400,000 in 1960 to more than five million in 2005. This number would increase by at least another 594,000 if same-sex partners were included. Of all unmarried couples, about 1 in 9 (11.1% of all unmarried-partner households) are homosexual.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} penile cancer in men, and cervical cancer in the female sexual partners <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> men. Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision of babies.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E

25|$|The anxiety <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> {{individuals}} (particularly adolescents whose construction <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> masculinity {{is based}} in part on not being seen as gay) that others may identify them as gay has also been identified by Michael Kimmel as an example of homophobia. The taunting of boys seen as eccentric (and who are not usually gay) is said to be endemic in rural and suburban American schools, and has been associated with risk-taking behavior and outbursts of violence (such as a spate of school shootings) by boys seeking revenge or trying to assert their masculinity. Homophobic bullying is also very common in schools in the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Despite their {{opposition}} to Law 2013-404, the center right parties maintains its support among the LGB electorate, but in a more fragmented way than in the past.

25|$|A non-representative {{survey on}} the sexual {{behaviour}} of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had {{a response rate of}} about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women.

We conducted an online survey <b>of</b> <b>heterosexuals</b> in sexual relationships to assess willingness to use CHTC and willingness to discuss relationship agreements within a couples counseling session. We found moderate levels of willingness to use CHTC and somewhat higher levels of willingness to discuss relationship agreements in a couples counseling session. The most frequently cited reason people were not willing was that they did not perceive themselves or their partners to be at risk for HIV. These results will be useful in planning for CHTC implementation for heterosexuals in the U. S...|$|R
50|$|The {{controversy}} also {{resulted in}} an audit of the review process used by Social Science Research. Critics have largely focused their attention on the few same-sex relationships in the data, faulting Regnerus for comparing the adult children <b>of</b> intact (<b>heterosexual)</b> families with those whose parents may have purportedly formed same sex relationships after the dissolution <b>of</b> a <b>heterosexual</b> union.|$|R
25|$|The Kinsey {{scale has}} been praised for dismissing the dichotomous {{classification}} {{of sexual orientation}} and allowing for {{a new perspective on}} human sexuality. However, the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum. Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to. In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females, Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants. Particularly, they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person's history when using the scale. They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> and homosexual experiences. When there are a substantial number <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> and homosexual experiences in one's history it becomes difficult for that individual to be fully objective in assessing the relative amount of each.|$|E
25|$|One of the earliest, {{and best}} known {{examples}} <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> separatist feminism was Cell 16.

Cultural historian Alice Echols cites Cell 16 {{as an example of}} feminist heterosexual separatism, as the group never advocated lesbianism as a political strategy, instead promoting the idea of celibacy or periods of celibacy in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{as to whether}} childhood gender stereotypes are inborn or are influenced by environmental factors. The presence of homosexual or heterosexual relationships in families influences play patterns in children: children of same-sex couples are raised differently, resulting in gender roles {{different from those of}} opposite-sex parents, according to the gender binary. A study by Goldberg, Kashy and Smith shows that sons of lesbian mothers play in a less-masculine way than sons of homosexual fathers or <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> parents.|$|E

25|$|In many jurisdictions where {{same-sex}} couples can access civil unions or registered partnerships, these are often intended as parallel institutions to that <b>of</b> <b>heterosexual</b> monogamous marriage.

Both are banned under Sections 205–206 of the Crimes Act 1961. In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage proper exists, bigamous same-sex marriages fall under the same set of legal prohibitions as bigamous heterosexual marriages.
