5000|$|Ned {{grew up in}} {{the village}} of Coeur d'Coeurs, next door to a girl named Charlotte Charles, nicknamed [...] "Chuck", on whom he had a {{childhood}} crush. During the pilot episode Ned and Emerson hear of a woman being murdered on a cruise ship, with a $50,000 reward for solving the crime. Ned learns that the woman is Chuck, whom he had not seen for almost 20 years. He revives her to ask her who killed her, but discovers that she doesn't know. He is about to touch her but cannot bring himself to do it, allowing her to live instead and inadvertently causing the larcenous funeral director to die. Chuck and Ned soon develop strong feelings for each other and begin a relationship; however, they cannot touch at all, as doing so would cause Chuck to die. However, Ned and Chuck find other ways to express affection: they kiss each other while encased in body bags and while holding a sheet <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> between their lips. Ned installed a glass window with a rubber glove in his car so she could sit next to him and hold his hand without touching it, and at another point, (Season 1, Episode 4) Chuck holds a prosthetic hand, pretending it's Ned's. With Chuck's presence encouraging him to take a greater role in life, Ned begins to become more involved in Emerson's cases, occasionally going undercover with Emerson and Chuck while searching for further information about the case; on one occasion (Season 2, Episode 8) he has even solved a murder aided only by Olive, Emerson and Chuck being otherwise occupied.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Plastic wrap is {{an example}} of an {{intervention}} developed to prevent or minimise heat loss in the newborn. Plastic wrap enables clinical staff easy of access and visualisation of the newborn at all times. Case presentation A 24 -week infant was placed in a plastic wrap as part of a clinical trial.

40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} {{aimed to}} investigate the efficacy and safety <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> applied after birth and during NICU in preterm infants for prevention of heat loss in preterm infants. The Medline (1950 to August 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 7, 2015), CINAHL (1982 to August 2015) and the Embase (1974 to August 2015) databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs with main outcomes related to the core temperature (baseline temperature and/or post-stabilization temperature), hypothermia, mortality rate and hyperthermia. The included studies were of low to moderate quality. Compared with unwrapped infants, plastic wrap {{was associated with a}} significantly higher baseline temperature and post-stabilization temperature both in infants < 28 weeks of gestation (mean difference [MD] = 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 85; MD = 0. 41, 95 % CI 0. 33 to 0. 50, respectively), and in infants between 28 to 34 weeks of gestation (MD = 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 21 to 0. 87; MD = 0. 64, 95 % CI 0. 45 to 0. 82, respectively). Use <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> was associated with lower incidence of hypothermia (relative risk [RR] = 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 63 to 0. 78). However, use <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> in preterm infants was not associated with decrease in mortality (RR: 0. 88, 95 % CI 0. 70 to 1. 12, P = 0. 31). Incidence of hyperthermia was significantly higher in the plastic wrap group as compared to that in the control group (RR = 2. 55, 95 % CI: 1. 56 to 4. 15, P = 0. 0002). Hyperthermia in the plastic wrap group was resolved within one or two hours after unwrapping the babies. Plastic wrap can be considered an effective and safe additional intervention to prevent hypothermia in preterm infants. However, its cost-effectiveness and long-term effect on mortality needs to be ascertained by conducting well-designed studies with longer follow-up period...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>wrap,</b> {{cling film}} (UK), cling wrap, food wrap, or {{pliofilm}} {{is a thin}} plastic film typically used for sealing food items in containers to keep them fresh {{over a longer period}} <b>of</b> time. <b>Plastic</b> <b>wrap,</b> typically sold on rolls in boxes with a cutting edge, clings to many smooth surfaces and can thus remain tight over the opening of a container without adhesive.

One material that can be used as an insulator is the plastic. This study was conducted to assess the effect <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> on the core temperature of pediatric aged 1 to 3 years who underwent cleft palate surgery. The study was conducted on 30 pediatric patients, aged 1 - 3 years, with ASA I physical status who underwent cleft surgery with general anesthesia. Patients were divided into two groups. One group used plastic wrap to be wrapped on the body, and another is the control group. Rectal temperature was recorded during anesthesia. Research data was tested statistically by the Mann-Whitney test. The results of statistical calculation indicated that the average core temperature during anesthesia in plastic wrap group was higher than the control group with a significant result (p < 0. 001). The average core temperature in the plastic wrap is 36. 17 ° C (0. 31 ° C) which is higher than the control group (35. 88 ° C (0. 43 ° C).

40|$|Hyperhydricity, an {{abnormal}} morphological appearance and physiological function, {{is an important}} problem in carnation tissue culture. The problem causes premature flowering, high occurrence of abnormal shoots, difficulty in transferring hyperhydric plantlets to soil, and low survival rate of plantlets. High relative humidity and the water potential are considered as the key factors involved in the abnormality. Furthermore, permeable culture vessel and gelling agent were assured to be high potential treatment to eliminate it. Objective {{of this research was}} to reduce  hyperhydricity in regenerants of carnation using different permeable vessel closures and gelling agents and to assess the multiplication and  acclimatization abilities of recovered shoots. Experiment was arranged in randomized complete block design with four replications. First factor was different types of closure, i. e. cotton wool, plastic wrap, parafilm and aluminium foil, while second one was gelling agents, i. e. bacto agar, phytagel, swallow agar, and Type 900 agar. The recovered shoots were then multiplied, rooted, and acclimatized. The results showed that hyperhydricity was successfully reduced by applying permeable closure (cotton wool and plastic wrap) in combination with Type 900 agar. The combination <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> and Type 900 agar was the most appropriate treatment in reducing hyperhydricity and producing good quality shoots. The treatment reduced the problem down to 23 % of total condition of hyperhydricity (100 %) and increased leaf chlorophyll content from 0. 0883 to 0. 1288 mg mg- 1. The plastic wrap was easily applied and cheaper material compared to cotton wool. The recovered shoots were able to produce 1 - 3 healthy axillary shoots and easily rooted on half-strength MS.

40|$|The {{cause of}} early {{cracking}} in newly poured concrete slabs {{is often the}} plastic shrinkage. Plastic shrinkage occurs during the first hours after casting when the concrete is exposed to premature drying. During this time the concrete still is plastic, and could be vibrated and surface finished. Thus, the actual hardening has not started. In cases when the shrinkage is subjected to resisting forces tensile stresses can arise in the material and cracks may occur. The plastic shrinkage {{is assumed to be}} due to two simultaneous water transport in the concrete mass, namely dewatering (water transport from the concrete slab’s interior to the surface) and evaporation (water leaving the surface). When the evaporation exceeds the dewatering, the surface will dry out and the risk of cracking increases. Factors affecting evaporation and dewatering also affect the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking formation. Previous research highlights, among other things, wind speed, air temperature, humidity, concrete consistency, cement, additives and variations of specimen thickness as risk parameters. To counter the plastic shrinkage cracking formation, some finishing work can to be done. The literature suggests, for example, water curing, membrane curing, application <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> and, if necessary, the establishment of windbreaks and sunshades. The master thesis includes eight laboratory tests in which the occurrence of plastic shrinkage cracks in concrete with vct 0, 38 has been studied at different cement types and under varying wind speed. The cement types that have been compared are ordinary Portland cement (byggcement) and base-cement (bascement). The Portland cement is now commonplace in the workplaces while the base-cement is going to be introduced on the market in 2013 and 2014. In order to study the phenomenon of plastic shrinkage cracks an experimental setup was built in which a concrete slab with dimensions 1200 x 400 x 80 mm was cast. The model is based on a previously used equipment but with some modifications and a more sophisticated measuring equipment. By making use of a wind machine a wind over the plate surface could be simulated. In the experimental tests the evaporation of the specimen, the concrete temperature, the air temperature, the relative humidity and the wind speed was measured. The evaporation measurement was performed by continuously weighing the concrete slab. The results from the experiments indicate that the base-cement gives rise to fewer cracks than the Portland cement. Also the time until the first crack was observed was longer for the base-cement which would mean that the possibility of curing the surface would increase. In the study no significant temperature variation between the cement types was observed. Further, a higher wind speed gave rise to a higher evaporation and a shorter time until cracking was noticed. The master thesis also includes studies of the phenomenon itself and theoretical analysis of different models of plastic shrinkage cracking formation. Various formulas have been studied and the measured evaporation agreed well with the theoretically calculated evaporation during the time the concrete was in its plastic state.

40|$|Iranian flat breads {{generally}} have short shelf life. The {{result of this}} situation is usually enormous bread wastage. Among {{the most important factors}} involved are lack of proper packing and storage methods. In this study, the best temperature for bread packing was determined and the effects of three types <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrapping</b> on Taftoon bread baked of the typical flour were investigated after 72 hours of storage. These wrappings included a two-layer wrapping of oriented polypropylene and polyethylene (OPP/PE) with a thickness of 60 µ, a three-layer wrapping of PP/PE/PE with a thickness of 70 µ, and a two-layer polyethylene with a thickness of 70 µ together with cardboard and plastic. Bread packing was carried out at two different temperature ranges (20 - 25 oC and 45 - 50 oC). Results from moisture measurements and water activity test indicated that the characteristics of breads packed in different wrappings showed significant differences (p&lt; 0. 01). Moisture percentage and water activity (aw) were lower in layers with higher permeability to moisture and water vapor and, consequently, algal growths reduced in these wrappings. Reduced moisture content, however, reduced the final bread quality score. It was also found that employing cardboard covered in polyethylene had no significant effect on bread shelf life during 72 hours of bread storage. Another finding from the present study was that packing a large number of 10 × 10 cm bread pieces within one single wrapping with cardboard and plastic was satisfactory and that the presence of the cardboard helped maintain bread shape during transportation and storage...|$|R

Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge {{on the surface of}} objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when {{at least one of the}} surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. This is because the charges that transfer are trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed. These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with insulated surfaces.|$|R
