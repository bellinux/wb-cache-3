The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to <b>occulting.</b> A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E

This <b>occult</b> infection has been reported also in healthy populations without evidence of liver disease. <b>Occult</b> HCV infection seems to be less aggressive than chronic hepatitis C although patients affected by <b>occult</b> HCV may develop liver cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma.

The persistence of very low levels of HCV RNA in serum and in PBMCs, along with the maintenance of specific T-cell responses against HCV-antigens observed during a long-term follow-up of patients with <b>occult</b> hepatitis C, indicate that <b>occult</b> HCV is a persistent infection that is not spontaneously eradicated.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the <b>occult</b> tradition is an inherent {{part of the}} production of vernacular literature during the Elizabethan period. I argue that <b>occult</b> discourses about language are drawn upon by writers of the period who seek to establish an English literature to rival that of the classical tradition. The quotidian nature of <b>occult</b> philosophies which vacillate between the scientific and the magical in the early modern period has been recognised in recent criticism. Taking into consideration the etymological root of the word <b>occult</b> as secret or hidden, this thesis departs from the traditional demarcations of <b>occult</b> studies. By removing the <b>occult</b> {{from the realm of}} the magus and dramatic sensationalism, this thesis begins with the premise that <b>occult</b> discourses are present within Elizabethan culture and are absorbed into textual practice. It adopts the term <b>occult</b> poetics to describe the processes of writing that rely upon <b>occult</b> discourses to imbue efficacious qualities and communicate esoteric knowledge within Elizabethan vernacular poetry. I examine John Dee, traditionally viewed as a magus-figure, and resituate him within discourses about language. I show that Dee believed the divine origins of language lay in geometry and number, and that his semiotics informs his hopes for Elizabethan imperialism. Contemporaneous to Dee’s depiction of Elizabeth as imperial queen is Edmund Spenser’s cry to establish English as a kingdom of language, which leads to experimentation with English verse that is based on the <b>occult</b> qualities of number and quantity. I consider how <b>occult</b> and emergent scientific discourses are engaged with in the new poetry in terms of cosmology with Fulke Greville and Giordano Bruno, and optics in George Chapman’s poetry. Finally, I approach the figure of Elizabeth as an <b>occult</b> body analogous to the lodestone who sits at the centre of language production through analysing Spenser’s The Faerie Queene...|$|R

However, its role in fibrosis progression remains uncertain. This retrospective study compared the fibrosis progression (defined as fibrosis progression {{by at least one}} stage) and progression to severe fibrosis (fibrosis stage 3 or 4) in HCV patients with <b>occult</b> HBV infection. <b>Occult</b> HBV infection was diagnosed by the detection of HBV DNA in the serum of 74 consecutive anti-HCV positive patients by PCR. Thirty-one patients (41. 9 %) had <b>occult</b> HBV infection. All 74 patients had a median of 2 (range 2 - 3) liver biopsies. The median time between the first and last liver biopsy was 57. 7 (range 15. 0 - 132. 8) months. Eleven of the 31 patients with <b>occult</b> HBV infection compared with 12 of the 43 patients without <b>occult</b> HBV infection had fibrosis progression (35. 5 % versus 27. 9 %, respectively, p = 0. 608). Six of the 31 patients with <b>occult</b> HBV infection compared with 8 of the 43 patients without <b>occult</b> HBV infection developed severe fibrosis (19. 4 % versus 18. 6 %, respectively, p = 0. 946). In conclusion, chronic HCV patients with <b>occult</b> HBV co-infection does not seem to progress more than patients without <b>occult</b> HBV infection.

We retrospectively compared the cases of 102 patients with <b>occult</b> OGIB and 325 patients with overt OGIB, all having undergone CE. The diagnostic yield of CE and identification of various lesion types were determined in cases of <b>occult</b> OGIB versus overt OGIB. Results.

The small-bowel lesions in cases of <b>occult</b> OGIB were diagnosed as ulcer/erosive lesions (n= 18, 18 %), vascular lesions (n= 11, 11 %), and tumors (n= 4, 3 %), and those in cases of overt OGIB were diagnosed as ulcer/erosive lesions (n= 51, 16 %), vascular lesions (n= 31, 10 %), and tumors (n= 20, 6 %).
