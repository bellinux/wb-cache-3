25|$|One theory {{regarding}} {{the cause of}} depression {{is that it is}} characterized by an overactive hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) that resembles the neuro-endocrine response to stress. These HPA axis abnormalities participate in the development <b>of</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms, and antidepressants may serve to regulate HPA axis function.|$|E
25|$|Mood changes, {{including}} depression, {{can occur}} with hormone replacement therapy. However, many transgender women report significant mood-lifting effects as well. The risk <b>of</b> <b>depressive</b> side effects {{is more common}} in patients who take progestins. Medroxyprogesterone acetate, in particular, has been shown to cause depression in certain individuals, perhaps by affecting dopamine levels.|$|E
50|$|Depression {{has quite}} a well-evidenced link with a {{decrease}} in the motive to self-enhance. Depressives are less able to self-enhance in response to negative feedback than non-depressive controls. Having a depressive disposition decreases the discrepancy between one's own estimates of one's virtues and the estimates of a neutral observer, namely by increasing modesty. Illusions of control are moderated by melancholy. However, whilst the self-ratings <b>of</b> <b>depressives</b> are more in line with those of neutral observers than the self ratings of normals, the self ratings of normals are more in line with those of friends and family than the self ratings <b>of</b> <b>depressives.</b>|$|R

25|$|Some OHP {{research}} {{is concerned with}} (a) understanding the impact of economic crises on individuals' {{physical and mental health}} and well-being and (b) calling attention to personal and organizational means for ameliorating the impact of the crisis. Economic insecurity contributes, at least partly, to psychological distress and work-family conflict.

25|$|NSAAs {{may be an}} {{appealing}} option for {{those who wish to}} preserve sex drive and function and/or fertility, as well as for those who desire more selective action with fewer side effects than spironolactone and cyproterone acetate (which increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms, among other adverse effects). Bicalutamide specifically may also be a safer drug than cyproterone acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity relative to cyproterone acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, bicalutamide does have a very small risk of hepatotoxicity itself, as well as of interstitial pneumonitis.|$|E

500|$|A {{delusion}} can {{be defined}} as [...] "a false, unshakeable idea or belief which is out of keeping with the patient's educational, cultural and social background ... held with extraordinary conviction and subjective certainty", and is a core feature of psychotic disorders. The patient's delusions may be described as persecutory or paranoid delusions, delusions of reference, grandiose delusions, [...] erotomanic delusions, delusional jealousy or delusional misidentification. Delusions may be described as mood- (the delusional content in keeping with the mood), typical of manic or depressive psychoses, or mood-incongruent (delusional content not in keeping with the mood) which are more typical of schizophrenia. Delusions of control, or passivity experiences (in which the individual has the experience of the mind or body being under the influence or control of some kind of external force or agency), are typical of schizophrenia. Examples of this include experiences of thought withdrawal, thought insertion, thought broadcasting, and somatic passivity. [...] Schneiderian first rank symptoms are a set of delusions and hallucinations which have been said to be highly suggestive of a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Delusions of guilt, delusions of poverty, and nihilistic delusions (belief that one has no mind or is already dead) are typical <b>of</b> <b>depressive</b> psychoses.|$|E

Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will [...] "do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often [...] "untouched by major news organizations". He said the film was [...] "more despair-inducing than instructive", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a [...] "vitally important documentary" [...] that contains scenes that [...] "are {{enough to make you}} never want to go shopping again". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is [...] "hard to swallow but never feels preach-y or like a barrage <b>of</b> <b>depressive</b> factoids" [...] and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by [...] "the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette Week that it is a [...] "compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter".|$|E

40|$|Background Previously, we {{proposed}} a model for ordinal scale scoring in which individual thresholds for each item constitute a distribution by each item. This lead us to hypothesize that the boundary curves <b>of</b> each <b>depressive</b> symptom score in the distribution <b>of</b> total <b>depressive</b> symptom scores follow a common mathematical model, which is expressed {{as the product of}} the frequency <b>of</b> the total <b>depressive</b> symptom scores and the probability of the cumulative distribution function of each item threshold. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the boundary curves of the distribution <b>of</b> total <b>depressive</b> symptom scores in a general population. Methods Data collected from 21, 040 subjects who had completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaire as part of a national Japanese survey were analyzed. The CES-D consists of 20 items (16 negative items and four positive items). The boundary curves of adjacent item scores in the distribution <b>of</b> total <b>depressive</b> symptom scores for the 16 negative items were analyzed using log-normal scales and curve fitting. Results The boundary curves of adjacent item scores for a given symptom approximated a common linear pattern on a log normal scale. Curve fitting showed that an exponential fit had a markedly higher coefficient of determination than either linear or quadratic fits. With negative affect items, the gap between the total score curve and boundary curve continuously increased with increasing total depressive symptom scores on a log-normal scale, whereas the boundary curves of positive affect items, which are not considered manifest variables of the latent trait, did not exhibit such increases in this gap.
