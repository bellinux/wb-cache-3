5|$|Finnish {{society had}} {{experienced}} rapid population growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{congress}} is noteworthy {{because of the}} extent <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> which took place within the party.

The Eighth Five-Year Plan of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was approved at the congress, renewed its Marxist–Leninist credentials and emphasized the need to continue to improve the socialist-oriented market economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{top five}} {{conglomerates}} in Indonesia {{prior to the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis—the Salim Group, Astra International, the Sinar Mas Group, Gudang Garam, Sampoerna and the Lippo Group—were all owned by ethnic Chinese, with annual sales totaling Rp112 trillion (US$47 billion). When the crisis finally hit the country, the rupiah's plunge severely disrupted corporate operations. Numerous conglomerates lost a majority of their assets and collapsed. Over the next several years, other conglomerates struggled to repay international and domestic debts. Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from oligarchic arrangements established under the New Order; however, plans for reform proved too optimistic. When President B.J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with The Washington Post that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen, the rupiah's value plunged 5 percent. This unexpected reaction prompted immediate changes in policies, and Habibie soon began enticing conglomerates for their support in the reform plans. Most were initially fearful <b>of</b> <b>democratization,</b> but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Increased regional autonomy allowed surviving conglomerates to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces, and economic reforms created a freer market.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{paradigm}} of tourist studies there has recently been an acceptance <b>of</b> the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> tourism and consumption.

While tourist spaces may be becoming democratized, the relationships between tourists within those spaces are not. Increasingly tourists are relying on the performance and presence of other tourists who have similar interests and motives, what we call the role of the co-tourist, to facilitate the tourist experience. This paper addresses the importance of recognizing status and consumption for the study of tourism, posits the notion of a co-tourist, and ends with some reflections on the co-tourist in Santa Barbara, California. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the internet, including developments such as Web 2. 0, has led to new relationship realities between organizations and their stakeholders. One manifestation of these complex new realities has been the emergence <b>of</b> an internet-based <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> brand management. Research about this phenomenon has so far mainly focused on investigating just one or more individual themes and thereby disregarded the inherent multi-layered nature <b>of</b> the internet-based <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> brand management as a holistic, socio-technological phenomenon. The aim {{of this paper is}} to address this limitation through an investigation of the various socio-technological <b>democratization</b> developments <b>of</b> the phenomenon. To achieve this aim, a balanced and stakeholder-oriented perspective on brand management has been adopted to conduct an integrative literature review. The review reveals three key developments, which together form the essential parts of the phenomenon: (I) the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> internet technology, (II) the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> information, and (III) the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> social capital. The insights gained help to clarify the basic structures of the multi-layered phenomenon. The findings contribute also to the substantiation of a call for a new brand management paradigm: one that takes not only company-initiated but also stakeholder-initiated brand management activities into accoun...|$|R

In 1987, he co-authored the Contributions to the Slovenian National Program, published in the 57th issue of the Nova revija journal. The text was written as the response to the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts of 1986, and set the grounds for a political opposition to the Communist regime. It was also the first legally published publication openly advocating Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia. Pučnik's article was centred on issues <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> and political plurality, and openly stressed the need for Slovenia's full sovereignty in order to secure such development.|$|E
25|$|Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's son and {{successor}} as the president, {{began to}} liberalize {{the political system}} in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT. A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen island in 1993). With the advent <b>of</b> <b>democratization,</b> {{the issue of the}} political status of Taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously, the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was taboo.|$|E
25|$|For example, in {{the case}} <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> of Europe, {{especially}} in England before the Glorious Revolution, political institutions were dominated by the monarch. However, profits from increasing international trade extended de facto political power beyond the monarch to commercially-engaged nobles and a new rising merchant class. Because these nobles and the merchant class contributed to {{a significant portion of}} the economic output as well as the tax income for the monarch, the interaction of the two political powers gave rise to political institutions that increasingly favored the merchant class, plus economic institutions that protected the interests of the merchant class. This cycle gradually empowered the merchant class until it was powerful enough to take down the monarchy system in England and guarantee efficient economic institutions.|$|E

40|$|In {{my paper}} I have {{examined}} the United Nations role in the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo. In order to complete this purpose I have asked two questions • How has the UN contributed to the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo {{that has taken place}} so far? • What advantages and/or disadvantages has the UN presence in Kosovo had from a democratic perspective? The method I have used in my paper is a qualitative one, and more specified a qualitative text analysis. This means that I have examined a rather small number of sources, but in return I have analyzed these sources very carefully. In addition to the choice of a qualitative method I have used Robert A. Dahl’s theory about polyarcy as a definition of democracy. The results from my analysis are that the UN has done some work in favour <b>of</b> the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo, but the UN has also acted in a way which restrains <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo in many ways. The main reason why the UN hinders the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo is it’s unwillingness to let go of its power over the region to the local officials...|$|R
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that democracy has a significant and robust positive effect on GDP per capita. Our empirical strategy relies on a dichotomous measure of democracy coded from several sources to reduce measurement error and controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy on economic growth. Our baseline results use a dynamic panel model for GDP, and show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 % in the long run. We find similar results when we estimate the effect <b>of</b> <b>democratizations</b> on GDP year-by-year, controlling for the GDP dynamics linearly or using the estimated propensity to democratize based on past GDP dynamics. We obtain comparable estimates using regional waves <b>of</b> <b>democratizations</b> and reversals to instrument for democracy. Our results suggest that democracy increases future GDP by encouraging investment, increasing schooling, inducing economic reforms, improving public good provision, and reducing social unrest. We find little support for the view that democracy is a constraint on economic growth for less developed economies...|$|R
25|$|Other {{critics of}} the Mudawana point out that {{irrespective}} {{of the value of}} the reforms themselves, the process by which they were achieved is flawed, creates difficulties for their implementation, and can even be considered counter-productive to the process <b>of</b> <b>democratization.</b> It can be argued that while the reforms do represent a significant transformation of women’s rights, they also serve to solidify and expand the authority of the monarch as the defender or insurer of those rights. In the end, the civil society associations that lobbied for the reforms had to work within the existing authoritarian system, appealing directly to the king for change rather than working through a democratic political process. Ultimately, the credit for the reforms' successful enactment has been given to the monarchy. Finally, some characterize the high degree of debate and deliberation over the issue as a dividing influence in the end; a representative from one Moroccan women’s organization described the women’s movement in Morocco not as a movement, but an uncoordinated group of different organizations.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} international administrations on the development and functioning of political parties in post-conflict settings, using Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo as case studies.
