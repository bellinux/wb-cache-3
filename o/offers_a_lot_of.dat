500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] finished thirteenth {{place in the}} ratings for the week of May 23–29, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 16.4. It was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Series creator Matt Groening listed it as his ninth favorite episode of The Simpsons and added [...] "I have a peculiar love of TV clownery". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode: [...] "The invention of the Simpsons' arch enemy as a lugubrious yet psychotic Englishman in dreadlocks succeeds wonderfully in this super-fast, super-funny episode that works by constantly reversing the audience's expectations." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5. Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "throughout the episode we found great material; it really seemed clear that the show was starting to turn into the piece we now know and love. It’s hard for me to relate any deficiencies" [...] and added that [...] "almost every Bob episode <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun, and this episode started that trend in fine style." ...|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E

In a February 12, 2008 interview with N'Gai Croal, Wright talked briefly about the Wii version and how they plan on making the Wii controller a factor in that version of the game. In addition, representatives by EA and Maxis confirmed in an interview that a Wii version of Spore was in the early design process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has received mostly positive critical reception. IGN's Andrew Alfonso described Lili as a [...] "deadly Lolita-looking warrior". Luke van Leuveren of PALGN opined that Lili {{and the other}} new characters who debuted in Dark Resurrection [...] "fit well into the game and don’t feel tacked on." [...] James Mielke of 1UP.com, in 2007, deemed Lili [...] "the most substantial new character the series has seen in years". NowGamer described Lili as [...] "an instant hit" [...] for her [...] "flowery girly-girl appearance" [...] and [...] "light-footed fighting style", because, the site wrote, [...] "she’s a girl and girls love that kind of stuff." [...] Brian Soboleski of TeamXbox included Lili among the site's eleven [...] "hotties in the Xbox universe" [...] for [...] "her role of a childish, yet seductive, fighter whose self confidence made her even more appealing." [...] She was listed as the ninth-"sexiest female video game character of all time" [...] by Albert Costill of AMOG in 2013: [...] "She’s a cute, blonde bombshell that blends street fighting with gymnastics. It doesn’t {{get any better than}} that." [...] Kevin Wong of Complex listed her as the fifteenth-best Tekken character in 2013: [...] "If a player wants to kick ass and look impeccable doing it, Lili is the girl for the job." [...] Jayson Dubin of GameZone criticized Lili's [...] "faux originality" [...] in his 2006 review of Dark Resurrection: [...] "She's a decent character that <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> moves to learn. But when I control her, I don't feel like I'm in the next evolution of Tekken. I feel like I'm charge of a rehash." [...] Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said in 2012, [...] " [...] nice to see that someone finally found a way to work a character with daddy issues into the Tekken series," [...] but Writtin King of Game Informer included Lili in his 2012 ranking of the most [...] "ridiculous" [...] Tekken characters on the basis of her primary costume. [...] " [...] supposed to believe Lili is proficient in street fighting? Give me a break." [...] King additionally commented on her storyline of being housebound by her father for fighting in the tournament: [...] "In other words, she got grounded. I wonder if she lost her telephone privileges, too." [...] In an official fan poll hosted by Namco in 2012, Lili was the most-requested Tekken character for inclusion in Tekken X Street Fighter with 16.72% (14,764) of 88,280 votes, finishing two hundredths of a percentage point ahead of Jun Kazama.|$|E
