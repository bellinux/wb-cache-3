5|$|A large 2010 survey <b>of</b> <b>healthy</b> and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens.

40|$|Background: Vending {{machines}} and shops located within {{health care facilities}} {{are a source of}} food and drinks for staff, visitors and outpatients and they have the potential to promote healthy food and drink choices. This paper describes perceptions of parents and managers of health-service located food outlets towards the availability and labelling <b>of</b> <b>healthier</b> food options and the food and drinks offered for sale in health care facilities in Australia. It also describes the impact of an intervention to improve availability and labelling <b>of</b> <b>healthier</b> foods and drinks for sale. Methods: Parents (n = 168) and food outlet managers (n = 17) were surveyed. Food and drinks for sale in health-service operated food outlets (n = 5) and vending machines (n = 90) in health care facilities in the Hunter New England region of NSW were audited pre (2007) and post (2010 / 11) the introduction of policy and associated support to increase the availability <b>of</b> <b>healthier</b> choices. A traffic light system was used to classify foods from least (red) to most healthy choices (green). Results: Almost all (95 %) parents and most (65 %) food outlet managers thought food outlets on health service sites should have signs clearly showing healthy choices. Parents (90 %) also thought all food outlets on health service sites should provide mostly healthy items compared to 47 % of managers. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>healthier</b> beverage slots in vending machines increased from 29 % to 51 % at follow-up and the proportion of machines that labelled healthier drinks increased from 0 to 26 %. No outlets labelled healthier items at baseline compared to 4 out of 5 after the intervention. No changes were observed in the availability or labelling <b>of</b> <b>healthier</b> food in vending machines or the availability <b>of</b> <b>healthier</b> food or drinks in food outlets. Conclusions: Baseline availability and labelling <b>of</b> <b>healthier</b> food and beverage choices for sale in health care facilities was poor in spite of the support of parents and outlet managers for such initiatives. The intervention encouraged improvements in the availability and labelling <b>of</b> <b>healthier</b> drinks but not foods in vending machines...|$|R

5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas the presence <b>of</b> <b>healthy</b> trees can clean the air, increase property values, {{and reduce the}} temperature of the built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E

5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development <b>of</b> <b>healthy</b> gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in {{eucalypt}} forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands, fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands <b>of</b> <b>healthy</b> trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands, shrubland, and heath communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), bull banksia (Banksia grandis), marri (E.calophylla), Lasiopetalum floribundum, and Acacia saligna. It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (E. wandoo). The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption <b>of</b> <b>healthy</b> homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between serum trace elements, antioxidant capacity index and hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (HDCP). Methods: Forty cases <b>of</b> normal <b>healthy</b> pregnant women, twenty-one pregnant women with high blood pressure, twenty-eight pregnant women with early stage of mild preeclampsia and twenty-two pregnant women with early stage of severe preeclampsia were selected respectively. Then, the differences of blood routine examination and blood coagulation function of the four groups were compared. At the same time, the levels of the serum trace elements and oxidative stress related indexes in the placental villi tissue were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: The white blood cells and hematocrit of HDCP pregnant women {{were significantly higher than}} those <b>of</b> normal <b>healthy</b> pregnant women; platelet and fibrinogen levels were obviously lower than those <b>of</b> normal <b>healthy</b> pregnant women, while thrombin time was shorter than that <b>of</b> normal <b>healthy</b> pregnant women; levels of serum copper, zinc and manganese were also significantly lower than whose <b>of</b> normal <b>healthy</b> pregnant women, while iron level was distinctly higher than that <b>of</b> normal <b>healthy</b> pregnant women.

5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (<b>of</b> <b>healthy</b> colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E
