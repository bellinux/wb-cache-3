40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Some {{recent studies}} of noninvasive carotid imaging have {{identified}} high rates of inappropriate decision-making about endarterectomy compared with conventional arterial angiography (CAA), but there is substantial inconsistency across the published literature. CAA is usually regarded as {{the gold standard for}} carotid imaging, partly because <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> angiographic stenosis is a powerful predictor of ischemic stroke and hence of benefit from endarterectomy. However, there are very few published data {{on the extent to which}} predictive power varies with type <b>of</b> CAA or <b>the</b> number and quality <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stenosis obtained. METHODS: We analyzed measurements of stenosis made by 2 independent observers on 967 consecutive patients randomized to medial treatment alone in the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST). We determined prediction of 3 -year risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke (as a hazard ratio from a Cox model and as the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) in relation to <b>the</b> technique <b>of</b> angiography, <b>the</b> number and quality <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stenosis, and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> 2 independent measurements. RESULTS: Using 2 independent measurements of stenosis increased predictive power slightly, but the effect was much smaller than that attributable to <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> CAA and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stenosis. Prognostic value was greater in patients who had selective carotid injection CAA and at least biplane views (AUC, 0. 75; 0. 68 to 0. 82) than in patients with only a single view or aortic arch injection CAA (AUC, 0. 65; 0. 56 to 0. 73; P= 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prognostic value <b>of</b> CAA on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> angiography and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stenosis obtained has implications for the future development and validation of noninvasive methods of carotid imaging...|$|R

5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

For much of Halo 3, the Arbiter assists human forces in their fight against hostile Covenant forces alongside John-117. After the Flood arrive on Earth, the Arbiter persuades Rtas 'Vadum not to glass the entire planet to quell the infestation. Along {{with a group of}} humans and Elites, the Arbiter follows the Prophet of Truth's forces through a slipspace portal to the Ark, where he kills the Prophet. The Master Chief decides to activate the Halo under construction at the Ark to destroy the local Flood while sparing the galaxy at large; the Arbiter helps to retrieve the artificial intelligence Cortana so that the installation can be fired. During the escape, the ship he and the Master Chief are on split in two; while the Master Chief is presumed lost, the Arbiter crashes safely to Earth. After attending a ceremony honoring the dead, the Arbiter {{and the rest of the}} Elites leave for their homeworld.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a long shot {{of a group of}} dancers who have just {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. Standing still, Rihanna begins to click her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where she closes her eyes, which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camera.|$|E
