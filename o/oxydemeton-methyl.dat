40|$|The {{resistance}} {{mechanisms to}} <b>oxydemeton-methyl</b> were surveyed in two Iranian {{strains of the}} two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Bioassay was carried out on two strains, collected from Tehran and Rasht using dipping method. The results of bioassay indicated that resistance ratio was 20. 47 for resistant strain. The activity of esterase and glutathione S-transferase in resistant and susceptible strains showed that one of resistance mechanisms to <b>oxydemeton-methyl</b> was esterase-based resistance and glutathione S-transferase. The esterase activity of the resistant strain was 2. 5 and 2. 14 -fold {{higher than those of}} the susceptible strain for α-naphtyl acetate (α-NA) and β-naphtyl acetate (β-NA) respectively. The kinetic characteristics acetylcholinesterase (AChE) showed that the AChE of resistant strain had lower affinity to artificial substrates; acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine than that of susceptible strain. I 50 of <b>oxydemeton-methyl</b> for resistant and susceptible strains were 2. 68 × 10 - 6 M and 7. 79 × 10 - 7 M respectively. The results suggested that AChE of resistant strain is insensitive to <b>oxydemeton-methyl</b> and ratio of AChE insensitivity of resistant to susceptible strain were 3. 49 and 7. 8 -fold to <b>oxydemeton-methyl</b> and paraoxon, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Several {{experimental}} {{insecticide treatment}} combinations were evaluated and demonstrated very good efficacy against Bemisia argentifolii [silverleaf whitefly (WF) {{also known as}} sweetpotato WF, B. tabaci]. Adults and immatures were most effectively reduced compared to the untreated check by pyriproxyfen (S- 71639, Valent) treatments and fenpropathrin (Danitol®) plus acephate (Orthene®).

40|$|A method {{based on}} liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) -mass spectrometry (MS) /MS {{was developed for}} sensitive determination {{of a number of}} less gas chromatography (GC) -amenable organophosphorus pesticides (OPs; acephate, methamidophos, monocrotophos, omethoate, <b>oxydemeton-methyl</b> and vamidothion) in cabbage and grapes. For extraction, several solvents were evaluated with respect to the possibility of direct injection, matrix-induced suppression or enhancement of response, and extraction efficiency. Overall, ethyl acetate was the most favourable solvent for extraction, although a solvent switch was required. For some pesticide/matrix combinations, reconstitution of the residue after evaporation required special attention. Extracts were analysed on a C 18 column with polar endcapping. The pesticides were ionised using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation on a tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The final method is straightforward and involves extraction with ethyl acetate and a solvent switch to 0. 1 % acetic acid/water without further cleanup. The method was validated at the 0. 01 and 0. 5 mg/kg level, for both cabbage and grapes. Recoveries were between 80 and 101 % with R. S. D. < 11 % (n= 5). The limit of quantification was 0. 01 mg/kg and limits of detection were between 0. 001 and 0. 004 mg/kg. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|NY ranks {{number one}} in the country in {{production}} of fresh cabbage, and number two in processing cabbage. Valued at over $ 62 million per year, cabbage and other crucifers (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, radishes, kale, collards, turnips, rutabagas, turnip and mustard greens, Chinese cabbage, and several other specialty vegetables) rank second in economic importance among New York vegetables, just after potatoes. Because cabbage represents the great majority (84 %) of acres of crucifers in NY, the information in this Crop Profile pertains to this crop, except where explicitly noted. Crucifers are attacked by a wide variety of pests, and pest management is complex and costly for these extremely important vegetable crops. While producers use a variety of insecticides of varying classes, organophosphates, including chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, endosulfan, and <b>oxydemeton-methyl,</b> play a very important role in cabbage insect management. Organophosphates and carbamates are the only effective materials currently available for control of cabbage maggots. Their use in rotation with other classes of insecticides greatly aids in resistance management and control of diamondback moth and onion thrips, two of the most difficult insect pests to manage in cabbage. Aphid control without organophosphates could be significantly more problematic and expensive. Without the registration o...|$|E
40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that {{four out of}} six of the very polar organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), i. e. acephate, methamidophos, monocrotophos, omethoate, <b>oxydemeton-methyl</b> and vamidothion, could not be extracted from water using commonly available SPE cartridges. In addition, GC analysis on all six compounds {{was found to be}} troublesome due to their polar and thermolabile character. This initiated the development of an alternative highly sensitive and selective method for the determination of the above mentioned very polar OPs in water, based on LC-MS. Large volume (1 ml) water samples were directly injected onto an RP 18 HPLC column with a polar endcapping. The latter was essential for obtaining retention and maintaining column performance under 100 % aqueous conditions during the sampling. The compounds were ionized using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and detected on a tandem mass spectrometer operated in multiple reaction-monitoring mode. The detection limits were in the range of 0. 01 - 0. 03 μg/l. Compared to conventional GC methods, the developed LC-MS procedure is very straightforward, fast and more reliable. This application demonstrates the applicability of LC-MS for analysis of polar OPs in surface, ground and drinking water, as a more favourable alternative to GC. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), {{although}} is {{an occasional}} pest for wheat and barley in Konya province of Turkey, it causes severe damage on canarygrass, Phalaris canariensis L. every year. To determine yield losses caused by D. noxia on this plant, trials were arranged as factorial experimental design with 14 replications for two years. The 14 canarygrass plots were weekly sprayed by <b>oxydemeton-methyl</b> at 200 cc / 100 lt water and other 14 plots were left for natural aphid colonization. Aphid counting was done weekly during vegetation period. All yield components measured were significantly affected by D. noxia damage. The rates of reduction in these components were as follows: 81, 7 % in grain yield, 57, 1 % in panicula number per square meter, 55, 43 % in grain weight per ten panicula, 43, 97 % in grain number in panicula, 36, 44 % in plant height, 26, 95 % in 1000 kernel weight, and 11, 03 % in panicula length.

40|$|Abstract-In {{order to}} {{increase}} yield and quality of some fruits and vegetables, pesticides are repeatedly applied during the entire growth period. The {{aim of this study}} was to monitor <b>Oxydemeton-methyl</b> residuals (as a model pesticide) in cucumbers and tomatoes, as the most consumed vegetables and also grown in greenhouse farms of Shahrekord, Iran. The vegetable samples were collected in during a six-month period from two big greenhouse farms located in Shahrekord vicinity which use this pesticide. Sampling was accomplished after one week of any stage of pesticides spray application. Analyses were performed by Gas chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The average values of pesticide residuals in unwashed, washed and peeled cucumber samples were 0. 23 ± 0. 17, 0. 18 ± 0. 1, 0. 15 ± 0. 6 0. 08 ± 0. 5 (µg/kg) respectively. The average values of the residues in unwashed, washed and peeled tomato samples were 1. 61 ± 0. 8, 0. 85 ± 0. 09, 0. 67 ± 0. 04 (µg/kg) respectively. The results showed that the pesticide residuals in total cucumber and tomato samples were more than permissible limit. Peeling and washing were effective but didn’t decrease the pesticide level lower than the permissible limit. Consumers are recommended to wash and to peel cucumbers and tomatoes before they consume in order to reduce daily intake of the toxicants through the diet...|$|E
40|$|In a field {{experiment}} {{the effects of}} Sumicidin (super) 5 EC (fenitrothion), Metasystox EC 25 (<b>oxydemeton-methyl)</b> and Tamaron SL 600 (methamidophos), applied at different dosages, were evaluated against peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and its parasitoid Aphidius matricariae Haliday on Cardinal and Desiree (respectively partially resistant and susceptible potato cultivars to M. persicae). Sumicidin (super) 5 EC was found about 30 % more effective in reducing aphid populations than the other insecticides tested. The highest doses of each insecticide caused maximum aphid mortality; in general aphid mortality appeared dose dependent. Almost all the higher and lower doses of the tested insecticides were about 19 % more effective on Cardinal than on Desiree. The most significant result was the synergistic interaction at the lower doses with plant resistance, so that {{the same level of}} control was recorded with second highest dose on Cardinal as with the highest dose on Desiree. Also the same control level was achieved at the lowest dosage rate on Cardinal compared with the next higher dose on the Desiree. Sumicidin (super) 5 EC was found least toxic to the parasitoid, A. matricariae in terms of percent parasitism, emergence of parasitoids and number of mature eggs in the emerging female parasitoids; increase of about 22, 67 and 47 % respectively were found in parasitoid performance with Tamaron SL 600 which was found comparatively highly toxic. The highest doses of all insecticides were found clearly toxic to the parasitoid. In general, effects on the parasitoid were dose dependent. Maximum yield was obtained from the second highest dose of Sumicidin (super) 5 EC...|$|E
