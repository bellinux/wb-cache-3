5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there {{as part of a}} Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions the existence of a SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> served at the First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{officers}} involved {{received some}} punishment by Japanese authorities {{at the end}} of the war. After the end of the war, 11 Japanese officers were found guilty with one soldier being sentenced to death by the Batavia War Criminal Court. The court decision found that the charge violated was the Army's order to hire only voluntary women. Victims from East Timor testified they were forced into slavery even when they were not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> started menstruating. The court testimonies state that these prepubescent girls were repeatedly raped by Japanese soldiers while those who refused to comply were executed.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{atypical}} antipsychotics warn {{about the}} possibility of tardive dyskinesia in their package inserts and in the PDR. It is not possible to truly know the risks of tardive dyskinesia when taking atypicals, because tardive dyskinesia can take many decades to develop and the atypical antipsychotics are not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been tested over a long enough period of time to determine all of the long-term risks. One hypothesis as to why atypicals have a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia is because they are much less fat-soluble than the typical antipsychotics and because they are readily released from D2 receptor and brain tissue. The typical antipsychotics remain attached to the D2 receptors and accumulate in the brain tissue which may lead to TD.|$|E

At the age of 12, she and Martha were <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more advanced education, and they were sent to Elizabeth Sedgwick's 'School for Young Ladies' in Lenox, Massachusetts. The influence of this school was to them both a lasting benefit. On {{the return of the}} two sisters from Lenox, their pastor Rev.

After a year at home, she went to Boston, to take piano lessons. Her first winter was spent with the family of Mrs. George Bond, one of the ladies of Boston society. Her second winter in Boston was devoted to lessons in singing, and she stayed in the home of Dr. and Mrs. Henry I. Bowditch.|$|E

500|$|For {{both the}} gas {{proportional}} counter and liquid scintillation counter, what is measured {{is the number}} of beta particles detected in a given time period. Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or becquerels per kg (Bq/kg C, in SI units). Each measuring device is also used to measure the activity of a blank sampleâ€“ a sample prepared from carbon <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample's [...] In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.|$|E

500|$|Piller {{originally}} envisioned only casting actors {{between the}} ages of eighteen and twenty-five to simulate the connection between the Kazon and contemporary street gangs. He said that he wanted the casting choices to convey the alien species as [...] "young, angry people who never lived <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the kind of experience and perspective on the world that, say, the Klingons and Romulans might have". He wanted to emphasize that the Kazon were [...] "much more emotional, short fused, and therefore had fewer expectations" [...] through the actors' performances. The roles, however, were filled by actors outside this age range, with Piller explaining that the decision was reached {{on the grounds that the}} [...] "older actors gave more polished performances". He later regretted the choice of more mature actors, as he felt this conflicted with the writers' concept of the species, making them appear too much like Klingons. The Kazon also received comparisons to the Cardassians and Wood Elves by Uproxx's Donna Dickens.|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{anthropomorphic}} and animal-form petroglyphs have parallels in rongorongo, {{for instance}} a double-headed frigatebird [...] (glyph 680) on a fallen moâ€˜ai topknot, a figure which also appears on a dozen tablets. McLaughlin (2004) illustrates {{the most prominent}} correspondences with the petroglyph corpus of Lee (1992). However, these are mostly isolated glyphs; few text-like sequences or ligatures have been found among the petroglyphs. This {{has led to the}} suggestion that rongorongo must be a recent creation, perhaps inspired by petroglyph designs or retaining individual petroglyphs as logograms (Macri 1995), but not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been incorporated into the petroglyphic tradition. The most complex candidate for petroglyphic rongorongo is {{what appears to be a}} short sequence of glyphs, one of which is a ligature, carved on the wall of a cave. However, the sequence does not appear to have been carved in a single hand (see image at right), and the cave is located near the house that produced the Poike tablet, a crude imitation of rongorongo, so the Ana o Keke petroglyphs may not be authentic.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onwards, Piccard {{returned}} to her childhood interest in religion. She was ordained a deacon of the Episcopal Church in 1971, and on July 29, 1974, {{became one of the}} Philadelphia Eleven, the first women to be ordained prieststhough the ordinations were regarded as irregular, performed by bishops who had retired or resigned. Piccard {{was the first of the}} women to be ordained that day, because at 79 she was the oldest, and because she was fulfilling an ambition she had had since she was 11 years old. When asked by Bishop John Allin, the head of the church, not to proceed with the ceremony, she is said to have told him, [...] "Sonny, I'm <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> changed your nappies." [...] In September 1976, the church voted to allow women into the priesthood, and Piccard served as a priest in Saint Paul, Minnesota, until she died at the age of 86. One of her granddaughters, the Rev. Kathryn Piccard, also an Episcopal priest, said of her: [...] "She wanted to expand the idea of what a respectable lady could do. She had the image of the street-wise old lady." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} success {{achieved with}} cadaveric transplantation makes it unethical to consider using a kidney {{from a young}} live donor, especially from {{a woman in the}} reproductive period of life. There may still occasionally be circumstances in which a kidney from a parent could reasonably be used, especially if the parent is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> responsibility for a young family.

500|$|The four-storey tower {{house was}} named the Stirling Tower after the {{original}} lords of Edzell, the Stirlings of Glenesk, {{although it is not}} <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been built by them. It is [...] high, and measures [...] by [...] on plan. The walls are over [...] thick at the basement, narrowing to [...] on the first floor. The tower house is entered from the north, via a door protected by [...] "inverted keyhole" [...] shaped gun holes. A slot adjacent to the door would have held a draw-bar, to reinforce the entry, and several mason's marks remain around the door. The hall occupies the first floor, above two vaulted cellars. Marks in the wall show the position of a minstrels' gallery and a timber screen, which concealed a serving area accessed via a narrow stair from the cellar. The broad main spiral stair led up to three further storeys of private chambers, before reaching a caphouse, a small rooftop chamber giving access to a parapet walk. The four corners of the tower have bartizans, or open turrets, and similar projections occur halfway along each wall. The parapet is supported on projecting stones, or corbels, arranged in a pattern of two tiers which alternate, rendering the lower tier purely decorative. Edzell represents an early occurrence of this style, known as chequered corbelling, which became more widespread later in the 16th century.|$|E

Kanzaka has struck down this notion, saying that by the time Rowdy was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> marry and <b>have</b> children that Meiroon would have still been a child herself, so Rowdy married a human causing his grandson, Gourry, to be fully human instead of part-elf as it was commonly assumed.|$|R
