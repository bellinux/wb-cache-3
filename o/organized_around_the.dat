5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the month, an area of convection persisted in association with a broad low-level circulation about 565km (350mi) west-southwest of Diego Garcia. The disturbance tracked west-southwestward, and on March 2 the Météo-France (MFR) declared it as a weak depression. Initially in an area of moderate wind shear, the system at first failed to maintain deep convection. Early on March 4, convection increased and <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> center of circulation, and the MFR classified it as Tropical Depression Twelve, about 270km (170mi) southwest of the Agaléga Islands. Initially the MFR forecast that the depression would intensify further before striking Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed over the western Caribbean Sea on October 8, and it persisted until October 11, when a tropical wave reached {{the area and}} caused the convection to organize, resulting {{in the development of a}} low-level circulation.

Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on May16 and crossed Central America into the Pacific Ocean on May24. That day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather about 150mi (240km) southwest of the Costa Rican coastline. At that time, this system was associated with a monsoon trough embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Despite being disorganized, gradual development of this system was anticipated by the NHC. On May25, a broad low pressure area formed southwest of Nicaragua, after the tropical wave interacted with an eastward-moving Kelvin wave. Convection soon became <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> newly formed low, and the NHC noted that the formation of a tropical cyclone within the subsequent 48hours was likely. The NHC estimated that Tropical Depression Two-E developed at 1200UTC on May28 about 125mi (205km) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|Around May6, {{the monsoon}} trough {{extended}} across the southern Bay of Bengal, producing a vast field of thunderstorm activity. A broad low-pressure area {{formed by the}} next day and remained nearly stationary. Over the next few days, the convection varied in intensity until becoming more <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> nascent surface low on May10. At 03:00UTC on May10, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported the formation of a depression about 535km (330mi) west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Within nine hours, the depression further intensified into a deep depression. Around the same time, the system was classified as Tropical Cyclone 01B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Tropical Storm Nicholas {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that moved off the coast of Africa on October 9. It moved westward, and developed a broad area of low pressure along the wave on October 10. Convection <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> low early on October 12 while located 800miles (1300km) southwest of the Cape Verde islands. As upper level winds became more favorable, the system became better organized, though the circulation center initially remained located {{to the west of the}} area of heavy showers. The surface circulation of the large circulation envelope moved towards a position near the western edge of the deepest convection, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Nineteen late on October 13 while located 1,030miles (1,660km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.|$|E
5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Norman continued to the east, {{and later to}} the east-southeast as it interacted with a tropical disturbance {{off the coast of}} Mexico. Initially, re-development of Norman was not expected, as the disturbance was instead given the possibility for further development. On October 13, the NHC noted that the {{remnants of}} Norman were merging with the disturbance to its east; during the interaction, convection redeveloped and <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> remnant low of Norman, and early on October 15 it reformed into a tropical depression, near the coast of southwestern Mexico. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, Norman was predicted to re-attain tropical storm status before moving ashore. However, the center quickly became less-organized, turning northward and northwestward within the larger tropical disturbance. Late on October 15, it is estimated Tropical Depression Norman dissipated 23miles (37km) south and offshore of Manzanillo, Colima, although satellite imagery suggested the center may have dissipated inland.|$|E
