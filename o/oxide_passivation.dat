40|$|Aluminum oxide {{films were}} {{deposited}} on crystalline silicon substrates by reactive RF magnetron sputtering. The influences of the deposition parameters {{on the surface}} passivation, surface damage, optical properties, and composition of the films have been investigated. It is found that proper sputtering power and uniform magnetic field reduced the surface damage from the high-energy ion bombardment to the silicon wafers during the process and consequently decreased the interface trap density, resulting in the good surface passivation; relatively high refractive index of aluminum oxide film is benefic to improve the surface passivation. The negative-charged aluminum oxide film was then successfully prepared. The surface passivation performance was further improved after postannealing by formation of an SiOx interfacial layer.

50|$|An oxide {{thin-film}} transistor (TFT) {{is a particular}} kind of field-effect transistor made by depositing thin films of a semiconductor active layer as well as the dielectric layer and metallic contacts over a supporting substrate. The principal difference between amorphous silicon TFT and Oxide TFT is that the material of the electron channel is oxide or amorphous silicon. A common substrate is glass, since the primary application of TFTs is in liquid crystal displays and organic light emitting displays (OLEDs). This differs from the conventional transistor where the semiconductor material typically is the substrate, such as a silicon wafer. TFT electrical performance is dramatically degraded if a zinc-tin-oxide TFT is covered with a dielectric layer and does not undergo both types of annealing. In addition to silicon dioxide, successful passivation of zinc-tin-oxide TFTs is accomplished using thermally evaporated calcium fluoride, germanium oxide, strontium fluoride, or antimony <b>oxide</b> as <b>passivation.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{widely used}} and {{effective}} passivation approach {{for improving the}} performance of III-V semiconductor devices is the sulfide passivation. According to references and our experiments, InAs passivation using organic sulfide such as thioacetamide and octadecylthiol (ODT: C 18 H 38 S) had better stability against re-oxidation in air than inorganic sulfide such as ammonium sulfide. The ODT passivation shows better results than thioacetamide. This was why we chose ODT. We also had opportunity to compare ODT treatment with hydrofluoric (HF) treatment. In our experiments, the InAs nanowires (NWs) were first dipped into HF acid before passivation and then the PL measurements were performed afterward. It {{turned out that the}} PL signal showed no obvious change. But the HF acid treatment helped to etch off the surface oxides, as mentioned in the paper.
