What makes a descriptive theory descriptive and a normative theory normative? Focus is on subjective expected utility theories where it seems open to debate whether the appropriate use is normative or descriptive. My discussion, which takes arguments by Isaac Levi and Hugh Mellor as a point of departure, is mostly negative, showing that there are no obvious distinguishing features of theories qua theories.

On any particular day there are 'calm' periods where a number of frequencies in the 1 - 16 mHz range exist. The length of these periods may vary from {{a few hours to}} several hours. The 'disturbed' periods can occur at any time of the day. The length of disturbed periods, number of significant frequencies in the band, and their probability of occurrence show a tendency to increase with latitude up to the auroral zone, beyond which no significant increase has been seen. The regions of the disturbed electric field sometimes cover a wide range of latitudes (greater than 10 deg) and longitudes in the auroral zone. Some of these regions are well defined and fixed in space and may remain unchanged for several hours to sometimes more than a day.

Henceforth, when voting they tend to commit themselves into forced saving. We consider a pension scheme that is characterized by two parameters: the payroll tax rate (that determines the size or generosity of the system) and the 'Bismarckian factor' that determines its redistributiveness. Individuals vote sequentially. We examine how the introduction of myopic agents affects the generosity and the redistributiveness of the pension system. Our main result is that a flat pension system is always chosen when all individuals are <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> (all far-sighted <b>or</b> all myopic), while a less redistributive system may be chosen if society is composed of both myopic and far-sighted agents.
