500|$|The {{development}} of The Last of Us, an action-adventure survival horror video game, began after [...] release in October 2009. Sony Computer Entertainment published The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>on</b> June 14, 2013 for the PlayStation 3. The three-year development, led by studio Naughty Dog, was kept secret {{for the majority}} of development. In the game, players assume control of Joel, tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States, in an attempt to create a potential cure against an infection to which Ellie is immune. Creative director Neil Druckmann was inspired to include Infected as a main feature of the game after discovering the Cordyceps fungi. His story, set twenty years after the outbreak starts and much of civilization is destroyed, explored the possibility of the fungi infecting humans.|$|E
500|$|In March 2014, {{information}} concerning {{a release of}} The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>on</b> PlayStation 4 was leaked. This {{was followed by the}} appearance of the game, titled The Last of Us Remastered on the PlayStation Store on April 9, 2014; Naughty Dog announced the game on the same day. This enhanced version of the game features an increased draw distance, character models of higher resolution, improved lighting and shadows, and an upgraded combat mechanic. It runs a native 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, with the option to lock the game at 30 frames per second. At E3 2014, Sony announced that the game would be released on July 29, 2014. Some of the downloadable content from The Last of Us is bundled with Remastered, including [...] and some multiplayer maps, while others require a separate purchase.|$|E
500|$|When conceiving {{ideas for}} The Last of Us, Druckmann used {{a concept that}} he created {{as a student at}} Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the {{gameplay}} of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>on</b> this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl Ellie. Druckmann wrote The Last of Us with the intention of having the story [...] "rooted firmly within reality", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous [...] "light and loose" [...] feeling. [...] "It needed to go a little darker [...] to explore a sadder theme," [...] he explained. Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to [...] "talk to [...] in the same language". The game was released on June 14, 2013 to critical acclaim, with particular praise directed towards Druckmann's work on the story. He earned numerous awards for his work on the game, including a BAFTA, a DICE Award, a Game Developers Choice Award, a Golden Joystick Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award.|$|E

500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his concluding remarks, Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of our freedom to come and go as we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E
