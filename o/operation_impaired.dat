40|$|ObjectivesDelayed first-stage palliation of {{children}} with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and related pathologies {{can be associated with}} poor outcomes because of development of progressive pulmonary vascular disease and volume load effects on the systemic ventricle and atrioventricular valve. We examine the current era’s survival in this subgroup. MethodsFifty-five infants older than 2 weeks underwent the Norwood operation (2003 – 2007). Separate competing risk analyses were performed to model outcomes (death and transition to the next stage) after the Norwood operation and after bidirectional cavopulmonary connection. ResultsMedian age was 32 days (range, 15 – 118 days). Forty-seven percent had hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and 53 % had other complex univentricular variants. Mean ascending aortic size was 4. 4 ± 1. 9 mm, 10 % had impaired ventricular function, 11 % had moderate atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and 32 % had restrictive pulmonary venous return. Pulmonary blood flow was established through an aortopulmonary shunt (n =  30) or Sano shunt (n =  25). After the Norwood operation, patients required longer ventilation and more oxygen and nitric oxide and had higher inotropic scores compared with those undergoing the traditional management protocol. Competing risks analysis showed that 2 years after the Norwood operation, 39 % had died, and 57 % underwent bidirectional cavopulmonary connection. Four years after bidirectional cavopulmonary connection, 15 % had died, and 85 % underwent the Fontan operation. Overall 3 -year survival after the Norwood operation was 53 %. Factors associated with mortality were age, lower weight {{at the time of the}} Norwood <b>operation,</b> <b>impaired</b> ventricular function, longer circulatory arrest, and lower pre–bidirectional cavopulmonary connection saturation. ConclusionsChildren older than 2 weeks undergoing the Norwood operation frequently require postoperative pulmonary vasodilatation and high inotropic support. A significant hazard of death persists through all steps of multistage palliation. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance and volume load effects, such as systemic ventricular impairment and atrioventricular valve regurgitation, are commonly evident in patients in whom treatment fails or who do not qualify to proceed to the next stage of palliation. Those patients should be closely monitored for timely referral for heart transplantation when indicated...|$|E

Eq. 13 leaves {{the signs of}} the Gram entries unchanged; therefore, it does not modify the signature matrix. However, the shrinkage <b>operation</b> <b>impairs</b> the matrix rank, and a rank reduction step must follow to yield an acceptable Gram. Rank reduction implicitly affects the signature matrix. The spectrum demonstrated in Fig.  4 reflects these changes. The method of [22] is an alternating projections method. The involved sets include the set of N×N symmetric matrices with bounded absolute values (the bounds are defined according to (13)) and the set of N×N symmetric rank m matrices, that is, the set of matrices with m non-zero eigenvalues. Nevertheless, the imposed constraints do not improve the signature matrix sufficiently as another important property of ETFs, namely, tightness is not addressed by the optimization algorithm.|$|R

Considering the importance of understanding the variables that influence the success of these processes, this research had the main objective of evaluating human resource practices adopted to facilitate the incorporation of Banco Nossa Caixa (BNC) by Banco do Brasil (BB). The evaluation was based on employees’ perceptions of the actions taken in order to promote their allocation, integration, orientation, training and adaptation. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire, available on the company’s intranet. The sample consisted of 781 former BNC employees (that delivered valid responses to the questionnaire). For data analysis, descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques (factorial analysis, t-test, and variance analysis) were used. The results revealed that, in general, participants had a positive perception of the incorporation process, which suggests that the actions taken by BB were effective. They also indicate the bank´s consideration for the people and the organizational culture being incorporated, though there were perception differences between employee segments.

Experimental tests were performed on a surface grinding machine and tool wear was measured by the imprint method throughout the tests. Acoustic emission and cutting power signals were acquired during the tests and statistics were obtained from these signals. Training and validating algorithms were developed for the intelligent systems in order to automatically obtain the best estimation models. The combination of signals and statistics along with the intelligent systems brings an innovative aspect to the grinding process.
