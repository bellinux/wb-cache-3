40|$|The ICE 250 {trademark} Cleaning System was {{engineered}} to convert water into small ice particles {{for use in}} cleaning and decontamination applications. Ice crystals are produced in a special icemaker and pressured through a hose-nozzle onto the surface to be cleaned. The Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center and Ice Cleaning Systems, Inc., conducted a test of this system at Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 3 to evaluate the system's cleaning capabilities in an <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> environment. <b>Equipment</b> cleaned included an oil storage tank, a rod pumping unit, a road grader, and a wellhead. Contaminants were unrefined sour crude oil, hydraulic fluid, paraffin, and dirt, occurring separately and as mixtures.

A minimal amount of waste moisture was generated, thereby reducing cleanup and disposal costs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{investigates the}} use of a {{specially}} designed cylindrical metal cell, in order to obtain complex permittivity and tanδ data of highly insulating High Voltage (HV) transformer oil samples. The data are obtained at a wide range of frequencies and operation temperatures to demonstrate the polarization phenomena and the thermally stimulated effects. Such complex permittivity measurements may be utilized as a criterion for the service life prediction of <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> electrical <b>equipment</b> (OFEE). Therefore, by one set of measurements on a small oil volume, data may be provided on the impending termination, or continuation of the transformer oil service life. The oil incorporating cell, attached to the appropriate measuring units, could be described as a complex permittivity sensor. In this work, the acquired dielectric data from a great number of operating distribution network power transformers were correlated to corresponding physicochemical ones to demonstrate the future potential employment of the proposed measuring technique...|$|R

50|$|In 1908, James M. Thomas, {{a native}} of Shamrock, Illinois, moved to this area and opened a store. He named the post office that he {{established}} on July 9, 1910 {{in honor of his}} home town. Between 1915 and 1916, the Sapulpa and Oil Fields Railroad (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) built a line northward from Depew to Shamrock. In 1916, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway constructed a line that connected Shamrock and Drumright. The railroad bypassed the town by three-fourths of a mile, so the citizens moved their businesses closer to the railroad. This developed Shamrock as a major shipping point for <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> <b>equipment</b> and crude oil. The town adopted an Irish theme, with streets named Tipperary, Dublin, Killarney, Blarney, and Cork.|$|E

50|$|As a {{frontier}} settlement, Coffeyville {{had its share}} of violence. On October 5, 1892, four of the Dalton Gang were killed in a shootout during an attempted bank robbery; Emmett Dalton survived with 23 gunshot wounds and convicted at trial for his crimes. He served 14 years before being pardoned. The gang had been trying to rob the First National and Condon banks, located across the street from each other. Residents recognized them under their disguises of fake beards and attacked the gang members as they fled one of the banks. Four citizens, including a U.S. marshal, Marshal Charles T. Connelly, died defending the town. The town holds an annual celebration each October to commemorate the Dalton Raid and the citizens who were lost. After the discovery of its resources of plentiful natural gas and abundant clay, Coffeyville enjoyed rapid growth from 1890 to 1910, as its population expanded sixfold. From the turn of the 20th century to the 1930s, {{it was one of the}} largest glass and brick manufacturing centers in the nation.
