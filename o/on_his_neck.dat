5|$|The next day, Homer stays true to {{his word}} and remains calm. However, his new calm {{demeanor}} has taken away Bart's inspiration for his cartoon, so Bart and Milhouse set up a trap for Homer to trigger another outburst. Later, {{they go to the}} Internet company office, where they find the company has gone bankrupt. Homer reaches home and happens upon Bart's trap, but he keeps his calm throughout its run, causing lumps to develop <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> The trap ends with Homer falling into a pool full of green paint, prompting him to go berserk and storm through town. The police restrain him and Homer is admitted to the hospital. Dr. Hibbert arrives and tells Marge that Bart actually saved Homer's life by enraging him. Hibbert explains the lumps <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> were actually boils caused by suppressed rage and would have otherwise overwhelmed his system. Homer thanks Bart by taking him fishing, where he continues to make his father angry.|$|E

5|$|At the SSR, Carter learns {{from the}} {{crippled}} war veteran Agent Daniel Sousa that the chauvinistic and promotion-seeking Agent Jack Thompson is following a lead on club owner Spider Raymond, {{who is looking}} to fence Stark's inventions. Raymond indeed sells the formula to the silent Leet Brannis. Infiltrating the club in disguise, Carter breaks into Raymond's safe and discovers that the formula has already {{been turned into a}} weapon. By the time Thompson gets there, Raymond is dead, killed by a man in a green suit, who follows Carter back to her apartment and kills her roommate. Carter pushes him out a window, and notices that he has a scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> where his voice box once was. After attempting to comfort her, Stark's butler Edwin Jarvis takes Carter to see Dr. Anton Vanko at Stark Industries, who deduces that the weapon was created at a Roxxon Oil refinery.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{televised}} {{contest of}} Bound for Glory was the Steel Asylum {{to determine the}} number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. There were ten participants in this contest; those involved were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and Super Eric. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave to the ring, while SoCal Val accompanied Dutt. In this encounter, the ring was surrounded by a large red steel cage that domed with a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling. The objective was for a competitor to fight up the walls of the cage and escape via the hole in the center. The first person to complete the task won the match and became number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. The duration of the bout was 12 minutes and 7 seconds. After several minutes of fighting among one another, several wrestlers attempted to climb the cage but were stopped. At one point, Devine performed his signature Devine Intervention maneuver on Rave, with Rave landing awkwardly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> The winner of the contest was Lethal, who climbed the cage and escaped through the hole while everyone was preoccupied.|$|E

25|$|The VX victim, whom Shoko Asahara had {{suspected}} was a spy, was attacked at 7a.m. on 12 December 1994, {{on the street}} in Osaka by Tomomitsu Niimi and another Aum member, who sprinkled the nerve agent <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> He chased them for about 100 yards (90 metres) before collapsing, dying 10 days later without coming out of a deep coma. Doctors in the hospital suspected at the time he had been poisoned with an organophosphate pesticide. But {{the cause of death was}} pinned down only after cult members arrested for the subway attack in Tokyo in March 1995 confessed to the killing. Ethyl methylphosphonate, methylphosphonic acid, and diisopropyl-2-(methylthio) ethylamine were later found in the body of the victim. Unlike the cases for sarin (Matsumoto incident and Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway), VX was not used for mass murder.|$|E

He suffered second and third degree burns <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> chin, and legs partially due to not wearing a protective balaclava with his helmet. The burns prevented him from finishing two races where he was relieved by Martin Truex Jr. (at New Hampshire) and his DEI teammate John Andretti (at Pocono) {{in the middle of the}} races.
