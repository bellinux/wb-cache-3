25|$|Although Uganda's {{official}} {{policy is to}} promote tariffs that cover all costs, the NWSC tariff actually covers only <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs.</b> According to a 2003 published report, the second performance contract between the government of Uganda and NWSC provided for a tariff policy {{that in the long}} term covered operation, maintenance, and a part of the future investments. Although the current tariff structure does recover <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs,</b> the tariffs are not high enough to finance system expansion, leaving system improvement and extension investments to the national government and international donors. According to UN-Water, full cost recovery tariffs including investments would require a significant rise of tariffs. William T. Muhairwe in 2006 asserted that full cost recovery in least developed countries is a myth. According to him, tariffs would have to increase by 90 percent to provide full cost recovery.|$|E

An important aspect of this process is the identification of the staffing and associated cost of the various types of controls that will eventually make up the Control Plan.
