40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Korea’s fair disclosure regulation on the timeliness and informativeness of earnings announcements. The present regulation for Korean listed firms requires that if a company’s sales revenue, <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> (or <b>loss)</b> and net <b>income</b> (or <b>loss)</b> have changed by over 30 % compared to the prior year, the firm must disclose this information through a preliminary financial report (PFR) even before the company is audited by external auditors. To analyze {{the effects of this}} policy, we first investigate the timeliness of preliminary financial report disclosures. We examine the extent to which Korean listed companies actually comply with the requirement for prompt notification of information concerning material changes in financial performance. Second, we investigate the informativeness of preliminary financial reports by analyzing differential stock market reactions to different timings of preliminary financial report disclosures. Our empirical results reveal {{that more than half of}} our sample firms release their preliminary financial reports after external audits are completed, thereby potentially invalidating the effectiveness of the regulation. In addition, we find that preliminary financial reports have information value only if they are disclosed prior to annual audit report dates. This finding supports the notion that timeliness increases the informativeness of preliminary financial report disclosure by curbing insiders’ ability to potentially profit from their information advantage...|$|R

The accounts for the year to 2012 showed Waterstones, prior- and post-acquisition had made losses of £37.3 million2013 saw the start of an overhaul of the company's business strategy, with centralised decision making giving way to store-based decisions and a renewed emphasis on traditional bookselling techniques. Waterstones embarked on a major restructuring of staffing levels, with a company-wide consultation with 560 managerial staff to subsequently reduce roles within the company. This consultation led to Head Office staff departures and around 200 branch and regional managers leaving their posts. Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the University of Derby to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff, with the Folio Society to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops, and partnering with a new charity, BookTrust. By the end of 2013, Waterstones had cut its losses to £12.2 million, opened 12 further Café W and embarked on a capital investment in its store portfolio of £29.5 million.In 2014, the chain continued to manage its store footprint opening new stores, with locations in Ringwood, Blackburn and Southwold, its first branch to be without Waterstones branding, as well as closing stores in Eastleigh and St Neots.

However, looked from econometric side comparison between 3 points of accounting is not relevant. This fact based on reality that gross income is not final result in income statement, {{so it would}} be refracted if putted in value relevance model. This refraction resulted from proportion of marketing cost components and administrations are not counted in profit determination. Because of that, this research used <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> net income and transitory earning as independent variable and stock return as dependent variable.
