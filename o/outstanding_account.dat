There were many miscellaneous carved furnishings, picture frames and stands for tables, balustrades and paving-stones, and busts of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina. For the gardens he provided figures of Venus and Cupid, Jupiter, Flora, and, to guard the garden front door, a large figure of Cerberus on a pedestal, all long gone, but Stone's Hercules— and perhaps others— are preserved in the gardens at Blickling. In the garden Stone erected a large iron pergola painted green, surmounted by eight gilded balls. In 1638, he sent his son, Nicholas Stone the younger, to Italy, whence there returned an elevation of a new garden house just built in the Villa Ludovisi, Rome, [...] "for Mr Paston", and marbles, architectural books (Vignola, Vitruvius, and Maggi's Le fontane di Roma), and plaster casts sent home from Livorno.

50|$|The {{start of}} a new era began in 1981 when his work of ancient Greek {{religious}} anthropology, Homo Necans, was published in an Italian translation, followed in 1983 by an English translation.

He was Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Zurich (1969-1996); Visiting Professor of Classical Literature at the University of California for two years (1977 and 1988); Lecturer at Harvard in 1982; Dean of the Philosophical Faculty I at Zurich (1986-1988); and presented the Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews in Scotland (1989).

50|$|After the {{official}} opening in 1866, a campaign began {{to obtain a}} pipe organ for the Auditorium. The City's amateur musicians held two concerts which raised ₤120 for the Organ Fund, only to see the money used to settle the <b>outstanding</b> <b>account</b> for the Albert Bells instead. In 1869, the Adelaide Philharmonic Society was formed and the choir staged 25 concerts {{over the next six}} years to raise over ₤500 for the Organ Fund. The estimated cost of the organ was ₤1,200 and the Council had promised to contribute ₤600. In 1875 Council ordered an organ from the London manufacturers, William Hill & Son. As a compromise on the cost, the Council decided to have Hill & Son construct the organ so that it could be added to in later years. The total cost came to £2106.16s.9d. The opening concert was held on 2 October 1877 but it wasn't long before a campaign to enlarge the organ by adding solo stops began and this upgrade was completed in 1885. The hydraulic engine was replaced in 1923 by an electric motor but after frequent criticism that it was out of date, clumsy of operation, and needed complete retuning to international standard pitch, the Council eventually voted to replace the original century-old pipe organ in 1989.|$|E

5000|$|A {{plan for}} Fitzroy to {{relocate}} to Sydney had its beginnings in Easter 1979, when Fitzroy president Frank Bibby and Graeme Plum (Fitzroy committeeman 1979-1983) were invited by Kevin Humphries, president of the NSW Rugby League, to the Sydney Cricket Ground, for the 'Rugby League Marathon'. During the game Bibby and Plum {{concluded that there was}} a great opportunity for Australian football in Sydney and that Fitzroy should be a part of that. The club carried out a series of fact finding work, including lining up a deal with a licensed Australian rules club in North Sydney to act as a social club, finding sponsors and even lining up a bank to assist with finances, if they were given significant representation on the board. The promising initial findings encouraged some of those on the Fitzroy committee to consider a move was worthy of more investigation.In July 1980, President Frank Bibby stated publicly that Fitzroy was effectively bankrupt. The Club was $300,000 in debt and the deficit was expected to be $400,000 {{by the end of the}} VFL season in September. On 15 July, the Club defaulted on a cheque for $17,500 to the Australian Taxation Office, wages cheques were expected to be dishonoured that week; creditor could not be paid; an annual repayment of a major loan was six months overdue; a taxi company threatened the previous week to stop servicing the Club unless there was a significant payment on an <b>outstanding</b> <b>account,</b> and overdue maintenance work continued to force staff to work in sub-standard accommodation. Bibby proposed that Fitzroy relocate to Sydney. Fitzroy's solicitor David Cotter registered the name [...] "Sydney Lions." [...] The guernsey of the new Sydney Lions would have been the existing Fitzroy guernsey with the 'FFC' monogram replaced by a 'SFC' monogram.|$|E

The most <b>outstanding</b> <b>account</b> for precise timing has been the tau hypothesis. However, recent studies demonstrate that tau is not the only source of information in judging time-to-contact. By measuring reaction time in a time-to-contact discrimination task, we show that the η function, which is a specific combination of optical size and rate of expansion, explains both accuracy and the observed RT pattern. The results conform to the hypothesis that the observers initiate the response when η reaches a response threshold value...|$|E

In this paper, we establish an appropriate model for a customer to determine its optimal special order quantity when the supplier offers a special extended permissible delay for one time only during a specified period. We then establish two theorems for a customer to find the optimal special order quantity. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

Yes, there have been cuts; yes, the priorities of federal science policy have been modified; and yes, this is perfectly consistent with the agenda of a neo-liberal government, as Amend and Barney detail in their impres-sively balanced account. But, as they note, these shifts by no means amount to the evisceration of federal science that many others have alleged.
