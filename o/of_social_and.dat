5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion.

5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.

5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E

5|$|Characteristic of {{the turn}} of the 10th century in most Polish tribal {{settlement}} areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity. The gords were the centers <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> political life.

Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans.|$|E

With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
