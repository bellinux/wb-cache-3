5|$|The WMATA staff {{preliminary}} budget for 2011-12 shows an $89 million <b>operating</b> <b>deficit.</b> This deficit {{can be addressed}} by fare increases, service reductions, or increased subsidies from the participating local jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Seven of {{the lines}} are {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the Gjøvik Line is operated by the NSB-owned NSB Gjøvikbanen. The <b>operating</b> <b>deficit</b> is covered by the state for NSB's lines, while NSB Gjøvikbanen's routes are financed by a public service obligation. The trains have two sections, manned and unmanned. Validated ticket-holders can travel in the unmanned section, which have orange doors. Manned sections, with gray doors, have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets. Tickets are available at ticket machines at stations; if bought inboard, there is a 20 Norwegian krone (NOK) surcharge.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the venue cost NOK230 million, which was almost entirely financed through state grants. Hamar Municipality contributed by building a co-located fire station for NOK21 million. Local businesses also contributed with NOK8 million. Moelven Industrier and Fireguard both contributed in exchange {{for being able to}} use the venues for marketing large wooden structures. To finance the <b>operating</b> <b>deficit</b> after the Olympics, Hamar Municipality received a capital grant of NOK30 million, with the interest going to pay for running Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Operating costs were estimated at NOK7 million per year; the venue will receive income of NOK1 million from larger events, NOK1 million will come from free work from the fire department, and NOK1 million from advertisements. Similar to Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, the venue has two official names, Hamar Olympic Hall and Vikingskipet. The former cannot be used commercially by non-Olympic events, such as in merchandise.|$|E
50|$|In 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, {{through the}} Rubicon Foundation, to Vassar {{to help fund}} <b>operating</b> <b>deficits</b> in the current and {{succeeding}} years and to improve faculty salaries.|$|R
40|$|A key {{constraint}} for mainstream {{public housing}} {{is that the}} net revenues after rebates at least pay for operational costs, (net of interest paid or received). If {{this is not the}} case, any addition to stock expands the additional funding requirement to pay for the deficit. In these circumstances the only option for reducing or freezing the additional funding requirement is to sell stock and therefore reduce the number of households provided with longer term assistance. The rate at which these <b>operating</b> <b>deficits</b> are growing, and the timing of when they will outstrip current real levels of grant funding is of critical policy concern. Clearly continuation of the current trends may carry with it the risk of a potential paralysis of housing assistance policy development, and a possible forced withdrawal to private rental subsidies as the only method of continuing housing assistance, with the possibility of a future fiscal blow-out. The aims of this project were therefore to: clarify the impact of public housing <b>operating</b> <b>deficits</b> on the development of comprehensive and expansive housing assistance policies; develop suitable policy options for returning public housing to operational surpluses; and by so doing; provide a context for more comprehensive and expansive housing assistance policies. The project addressed four key research questions: How should <b>operating</b> <b>deficits</b> be defined? (addressed by discussion paper, and research questions). What are the trends in <b>operating</b> <b>deficits</b> and are they or are they not restricting stock additions to public housing? (addressed by public housing accounts analysis and CEO questionnaire/interview); What are the reasons for the development of <b>operating</b> <b>deficits</b> and what are the influences of particular cost components? (addressed by public housing accounts analysis and CEO questionnaire/interview); and How can the components of operating regimes be benchmarked, what are the relevant international comparisons and what policy options can housing authorities introduce to improve outcomes? (addressed by benchmark literature review, analysis of overseas benchmarks and comparison with SHA&# 039;s and Productivity Commission benchmarks) ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{debate between}} rail rapid transit and light rail was {{conducted}} {{without reference to}} any specific right-of-way or railroad tracks. The CPO's 1975 Regional Comprehensive Plan described a $1.5 billion rail-rapid transit system in San Diego featuring a system of [...] and 11 lines. However, by this time, it was widely acknowledged by public officials that the BART-like system {{would be much more}} expensive than light rail. Rail rapid plans were stalled due to high costs. Proponents of the rail rapid system were concerned about the low speed of at-grade streetcar systems. <b>Operating</b> <b>deficits</b> were also a concern.

5|$|The hall cost NOK134.6 million, {{of which}} NOK88.5 million was {{grants from the}} government. The hall opened on 6 May 1993, with a show {{televised}} on national television and with 5,000 guests. It was the 29th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway, and the world's largest cavern hall for public use. At the time of opening, the venue was estimated to incur an operating cost of NOK3 to 4 four million, and an <b>operating</b> <b>deficit</b> of NOK1.7 million. To finance this, the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues, but the fund only received NOK1 million, {{and the rest of}} the operating costs would have to be taken by the municipality. The venue is owned through Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg, originally owned 70% by Gjøvik Municipality and 30% by Lillehammer Olympiapark, but later taken entirely over by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|The {{restructuring}} {{also called}} for the reduction of four services on the Meråker Line and two services to Oppdal, terminating all commuter train services on the lines. For the service to Oppdal, NSB had an <b>operating</b> <b>deficit</b> of NOK1.7 million and 21,000 passengers in 1998. The Meråker Line had about {{twice the number of}} passengers. The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies, they were free to do so. As compensation, travelers between Trondheim and Rennebu and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to not pay for seat reservations on the intercity services. Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the commuter train services, so they could continue the service to Oppdal, but this was rejected by the ministry.|$|E

25|$|The city {{government}} has been in financial distress for many years. It has operated under the state's Act 47 provisions for twenty-one years. The act provides for municipalities that are near bankruptcy. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections operates the State Correctional Institution – Chester, a drug treatment facility, in Chester. The city is scheduled to exit the program in May 2018, which may force it into bankruptcy. Additionally, the city is expected to face an <b>operating</b> <b>deficit</b> of $9.2 million for 2016 which has led the new administration to address cutting government spending.|$|E
25|$|On October 31, 2014, the Nassau County {{legislature}} {{adopted a}} 2015 budget {{that will increase}} Nassau County's contribution to NICE bus from $2.6 million to $4.6 million in 2015 and promised not to raise fares outside of MetroCard fare increases (MetroCard {{is controlled by the}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority). This new $4.6 million contribution was hailed as a victory for Nassau County bus riders, although it will still leave NICE bus with a $6 million <b>operating</b> <b>deficit.</b> However, on December 11, 2014, Nassau County executive Ed Mangano proposed cutting $4 million from Nassau County's NICE bus contribution (in addition to cuts to numerous other Nassau County services) to replace the $30 million that will be lost after the shutdown of Nassau County's controversial school speed zone cameras.|$|E
25|$|Parliament granted NOK1.2 {{million to}} upgrade the mines, with the company having an <b>operating</b> <b>deficit</b> of NOK2.9 million that year. A further grant of NOK1.9 million was issued the {{following}} year. The population dropped to 72 while production was halted. In 1954 there was produced 5,000 tonnes of coal, mostly for the towns own consumption. By 1955 the estimates for continuing operation, mostly prominently the need for improved ventilation systems, reached an estimate of NOK20 million. A certain amount of production was resumed, reaching 15,000 tonnes in 1955. Parliament approved a new production plan on 20 March 1956, which set a production goal of 200,000 tonnes of coal annually. The company built a new power station, bath and a fire station, as well as additional housing. Ester I was re-opened and upgraded. Production gradually increased to 47,000 in 1958, before falling again, {{in part because of}} falling coal prices.|$|E

50|$|The Sacramento Symphony was {{established}} in 1948 and rapidly became a large regional orchestra made up of local professional musicians.

25|$|The annual <b>{{operating}}</b> <b>deficit</b> {{of running}} the airport had reached $300,000 per year, $130,000 of it in operating the Maple City ferry. The City of Toronto decided to ask the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to cover the deficit. Despite the deficit, {{and in the absence}} of a subsidy, the joint committee studying the airport recommended to the Harbour Commission to keep it open. The report outlined three options: keep it open as is, closing it and use the land for other uses (which would mean finding a location for the 140,000 takeoffs and landings elsewhere), or use it for a STOL airport. The Government of Canada agreed to grant an annual subsidy to the Harbour Commission to operate the airport, while the Government of Ontario agreed to pay for the costs of the airport ferry. The Government of Canada put a condition on the subsidy, that intergovernmental agreement needed to be reached on the future of the airport.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Government of Canada told the Harbor Commission {{that it was}} cutting its subsidy of the airport. In {{response}} to the subsidy cut {{and a decline in}} annual traffic, the Harbour Commission board faced with what it saw as only two options: expand or close the airport, chose to expand the airport. In November 1989, the Harbor Commission voted to build a temporary passenger terminal and allow access to four more airlines at the airport: Air Ontario, Simo Air, Intair and Canadian Partner. The Commission planned to increase flights by 120 per day and increase the number of passengers by 500,000. It would also impose a $1.50 per user fee on the carriers to fund the improvements and cover the <b>operating</b> <b>deficit.</b> Toronto City Council voted to approve the expansion, but wanted a 90-flight per day limit. Air Ontario's president William Deluce announced it would start 14 flights a day between the island, Montreal and Ottawa. While the expansion had the approval of the harbour commission and city council, it awoke opposition to the airport from the Toronto Island Residents Association, who felt that there would be too many flights, leading to noise and air pollution and it would contravene the 1983 operating agreement.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Toronto built Malton Airport as a {{secondary}} air field, {{but it was}} Malton that became Toronto's main airport. This fact meant that the island airport became used mainly for general civil aviation and lost money on its operations. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed {{the expansion of the}} airport as a way to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the airport deficits. An expansion of runways and facilities was completed in 1962, financed by the sale of Malton Airport to the Government of Canada. Despite the improvements, the island airport did not become a passenger airline hub, and its existence came into question, starting in the 1960s. In 1968, the site was proposed for a large housing development known as 'Harbor City.' In the 1970s, as part of a debate around airports serving Toronto, the airport became the focus of efforts to set up a network of airports in Canada serving Short-Take-Off-And-Landing (STOL) regional airlines. From a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s, the island airport went into decline even as several regional airlines operated at the airport from the 1970s onwards. The annual <b>operating</b> <b>deficit</b> forced its operator, the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC) to sell land to pay the ongoing deficit and by the 1990s, the airport was again facing questions about its continued existence.|$|E
50|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2009, NCTD {{projected}} annual <b>operating</b> <b>deficits</b> {{of more than}} $24 million by 2014. In response, NCTD made proactive changes to maintain transit services and related jobs, including reducing staff and renegotiating and restructuring various contracts. These changes closed a five-year, $80 million budget gap. The new business model also allowed NCTD to lower fares, increase service and ridership, and grow its financial reserves.|$|R
50|$|The {{project has}} been criticized by local {{residents}} and advocacy groups for issues such {{as a lack of}} travel time improvement, large annual <b>operating</b> <b>deficits,</b> vulnerability to accidents and a negative business case suggested by the original TransLink joint analysis.

[...] Atlanta’s solid waste and capital finance funds were also downgraded.|$|R
25|$|Construction {{of a new}} {{terminal}} and upgrading the airport to regional standard started in 1984. In February 1987 Vardø Municipality received operating permission from the government. The investments cost NOK11.4 million, of which NOK10 million was to be financed through a loan and the rest through subsidies {{from the government and}} the county. The latter was also responsible for covering the <b>operating</b> <b>deficit.</b> The upgraded airport opened on 6 April 1987. The first two months Norving continued its taxi route service to the airport, but from 1 June a regular concession scheduled service was introduced. Widerøe took over the services in 1991. At first the airport was served using Twin Otters, but from the mid-1990s the Dash 8 was introduced. From 1996, Svartnes and 25 other regional airports were taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). Widerøe lost the bid to operate the services between 2000 and 2003 to Arctic Air, but resumed services in 2003. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. There has several times been discuss whether to close down the airport, having in mind that Vadsø Airport is 67km away by road. In 2002 there was political support in Stortinget to close it if the road was upgraded, but neither happened. In 2015 Avinor stated that closing Vardø would give least passenger trouble related to the financial support in the country, but that no decision on it would be made before 2019. Because of lack of available aircraft for purchase, before 2030 all short airports must be extended, closed or be flown with very small planes. Vardø has no room for extension.|$|E
500|$|Norving {{announced}} on 10 December 1987 {{that they would}} terminate all operations outside Finnmark. This took effect on 8 January 1988, leaving Rørvik without a scheduled services. Manning of the airport was reduced from eight to six, but the airport remained open from 08 to 23. From the summer schedules of 1988, Rørvik was included in Widerøe's services along the Helgeland coast. [...] The airport had 7,244 passengers in 1988, and the combined subsidies per passengers was NOK511.

500|$|The {{airport is}} located at Høybuktmoen in Sør-Varanger, about [...] west of Kirkenes. The {{terminal}} has room for six category C aircraft (Airbus A320/Boeing 737). During summer the airport experiences a very high traffic peak with both scheduled and charter aircraft arriving at the same time, as both intend to correspond with Hurtigruten; this causes patronage to rise beyond the airport's capacity. Kirkenes Airport had a revenue of NOK26.4 million in 2009, of which commercial income made up fifteen percent, and an <b>operating</b> <b>deficit</b> of NOK45.4 million. The deficit is cross subsidized by profits at Avinor's largest airports. In 2013, the airport had 297,149 passengers, 8,643 aircraft movements and 367 tonnes of cargo.|$|E
