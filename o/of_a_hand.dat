5|$|Although {{repeated}} theft can be {{punishable by}} amputation {{of the right}} hand and aggravated theft by the cross-amputation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and a foot, only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007 and 2010. Homosexual acts are punishable by flogging, imprisonment or death. Lashings are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations.|$|E
5|$|Diane gives Marty {{a tape of}} Tommy's 1999 Olympic trial fight. Tommy {{was ahead}} after two rounds but quit before round three because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> injury. Marty realizes that Tommy faked his injury because of the poor {{coaching}} and abuse coming from his stepfather, who was serving as his cornerman. Marty and Tommy talk about Tommy's stepfather and Marty's former fighter. Marty tells Tommy that boxing is a team sport and that Tommy will never be alone in the ring. Tommy's renewed motivation as a fighter leads to a reconciliation with Stephanie.|$|E
5|$|Henrik {{improved}} to 36points {{in his second}} NHL season; he finished with five goals in his last six games, taking his season total to 16. In the opening game of the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs, Henrik scored the overtime winner against the first-seeded Detroit Red Wings to put the Canucks 1–0 ahead in the series; {{it was his first}} NHL playoff goal. Detroit went on to eliminate the Canucks in six games en route to winning the Stanley Cup. During the 2002–03 season, Henrik suffered a sprained left shoulder that forced him out of three games. He had sustained the injury during a game against the Edmonton Oilers on 14 December 2002. Henrik also missed a game on 23 February 2003 because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> injury. He played 78games during 2002–03 and finished the campaign with 39points.|$|E

5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and pulled out his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> into a monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the Varaha legend {{are found in the}} Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Shatapatha Brahmana. They narrate that the universe was filled with the primordial waters. The earth was the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and was trapped in it. The god Prajapati (the creator-god Brahma) {{in the form of a}} boar (varaha) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out. He also marries the earth thereafter. The Shatapatha Brahmana calls the boar as Emusha. The epic Ramayana and the Vishnu Purana - considered sometimes as the oldest of the Puranic scriptures - are the first to associate Varaha with Vishnu. Various Puranic scriptures including the Agni Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, the Devi Bhagavata Purana, the Padma Purana, the Varaha Purana, the Vayu Purana and the Vishnu Purana narrate the legend of Varaha with some variations.|$|E

25|$|Playing {{the first}} bone <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> is {{sometimes}} called setting, leading, downing, or posing the first bone.

Players, in turn, must play a bone with an end that matches one of the open ends of the layouts.|$|E
