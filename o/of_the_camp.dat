5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October1944, leaving over 500sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January6, 1945, {{all of the}} guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, or else they would be killed. When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the camp and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered the camp and returned the prisoners to their side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{concentration}} <b>camps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South African War remains hugely {{significant to}} Afrikaners, {{there has been}} surprisingly little research on them. This course will provide {{a new look at}} <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> by locating them in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late nineteenth century colonial world and drawing on a range of archival sources. Since high mortality was <b>the</b> great tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> a major focus will be a fresh look at the deaths, their causes and the reasons for the decline in mortality. There were more black camps than white camps and their history has been as much a political toy as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white <b>camps.</b> <b>The</b> course will attempt to place <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black <b>camp</b> inmates into perspective. It will conclude by considering <b>the</b> legacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> from <b>the</b> erection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vrouemonument to post-apartheid reconciliation and <b>the</b> forging <b>of</b> a new Afrikaner identity.

From Lang Vei, U.S Special Forces personnel worked jointly with a 14-man South Vietnamese special forces contingent and six interpreters; they were responsible for border surveillance, interdiction of enemy infiltration and assistance in the Revolutionary Development Program. To accomplish those tasks Willoughby had one Montagnard company, three South Vietnamese rifle companies and three combat reconnaissance platoons at his disposal. Early in January 1968, Detachment A-101 received reinforcements {{in the form of a}} Mobile Strike Force Company, consisting of 161 Hre tribesmen, along with six U.S. Special Forces advisors. Elements of this Mobile Strike Force Company operated from a fortified bunker about 800 meters west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> which served as an observation post.
