40|$|Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and cDNA-AFLP {{analysis}} {{have been}} used to study gene expression during peach fruit ripening. An EST repertoire (1007 sequences) has been constructed using transcripts in nectarine fruit cv. ‘Fantasia’ at climacteric stage. The EST repertoire was reduced to 696 unigenes: in these 579 (83 %) were singletons. EST analysis confirmed that in peach ripe fruit, genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and cell wall metabolism are highly represented. Three transcription factors (TFs) homologous to SEPALLATA 3, atb 2, bHLH 61 belonging to MADS, bZIP and bHLH families, respectively, have been identified. The abundance of the related transcripts suggests that these TFs play a regulatory role of ripening, as reporter in <b>other</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>species.</b> The EST repertoire has been included in a sequence database assembled by the Italian Consortium for Prunus spp genomic study to generate the first peach fruit microarray (µPEACH 1. 0).

Flowering and fruiting of twelve young mango trees belonging to four cultivars ('Cogshall', 'Irwin', 'Jose' and 'Kensington Pride') have been exhaustively described at the growth unit level during three successive growing cycles.

In this study, tissue breakdown caused by chilling injury was investigated using X-ray computed microtomography (X-ray μCT). This provided a unique insight in 3 -D changes in tissue structure and pore networks during chilling injury development. Evidence of cell collapse and cavity formation in severely chill injured fruit was apparent. In addition, microstructural evidence supporting the occurrence of intracellular water leakage was found. Quantitative analysis revealed that chilling injury was associated with, first, a decrease in porosity, pore size and pore connectivity due to cell leakage and tissue breakdown, which was followed by an increase in pore size due to cavity formation. Multivariate statistics identified pore connectivity and Euler number as the most important parameter in relation to chilling injury. The results support the hypothesis that changes in tissue and pore structure in mango fruit contribute significantly to the development of postharvest tissue disorders by drastic changes in tissue aeration and water movement, identical to what has been observed in <b>other</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>species.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Recently we have {{demonstrated}} that there are anatomical differences between dwarfing and vigorous peach rootstocks. These differences in xylem anatomy {{have been linked to}} the vigour control capacity of the specific rootstocks. Previously we showed that dwarfing peach rootstocks generally have lower mid-day stem water potentials and that this limits shoot growth during the most active period for vegetative growth. The key factor affecting shoot growth appears to be stem hydraulic conductance which is strongly influenced by xylem vessel diameters. Weighted mean xylem vessel diameters are smaller in dwarfing rootstock genotypes than in vigorous ones. Thus it appears that xylem vessel diameter is a genetically controlled, phenotypic trait that is the primary factor that determines the size-controlling capacity of graft-compatible peach rootstocks. This paper will summarize the physiological and anatomical evidence for this hypothesis that provides a mechanistic basis for understanding the size-controlling phenomenon associated with graft-compatible peach rootstocks.

Headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC) coupled with flame ionization detection (FID) {{is used as a}} very simple, efficient and non-destructive extraction method. A three phase 50 / 30 μm PDV/DVB/CAR fibre was used for the extraction process. The optimal sealing time for volatiles reaching equilibrium from whole fruit in the headspace of the chamber was 20, 16, 8 and 16 hours for lemon, lime, mandarin, and orange respectively. Optimum fibre exposure times for whole fruit were 2, 4, 2 and 2 hours for lemon, lime, mandarin, and orange respectively. Three chamber volumes (500, 1000 and 2000 ml) were evaluated for the collection of VOCs with the 500 ml chamber being selected. The 500 ml chamber produced the highest quality peak areas and quantity of extracted volatiles. As a result of fruit respiration, the percentage of oxygen (O 2) of all citrus fruit species in 500 ml chamber decreased from 21. 8 % to 18. 8 % in the 20 hours sealing time, while carbon dioxide (CO 2) contents increased to 2. 9 % also in the 20 hours sealing time. The results of this study showed the feasibility of this technique for identifying VOCs from four of the citrus fruit species and its potential as a routine method for physiological studies on citrus fruit or on <b>other</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>species...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{ripening}} of {{fleshy fruit}} is a developmentally regulated process unique to plants {{during which the}} majority of the sensory quality attributes are elaborated including aroma, flavour, texture and nutritional compounds. In climacteric fruit, the plant hormone ethylene is the key regulator of the ripening process as exemplified by the dramatic inhibition of fruit ripening that results from the down-expression of ACC (1 -amino-cyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid) synthase and ACC oxidase genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis. By contrast, the ripening of non-climacteric fruit is not dependent on ethylene but rather on cues of unknown nature though ethylene may contribute at least partly to the control of some aspects of the ripening process. The expression of the ripening-associated genes is regulated by a network of signalling pathways among which ethylene perception and transduction play a primary role. Building on the knowledge gained on the Arabidopsis thaliana model system, the importance of ethylene signalling in fruit ripening has been extensively studied. This chapter summarizes the present knowledge on the role of ethylene in fruit ripening and addresses the molecular mechanisms involved in ethylene perception and responses. It also highlights recent advances and prospects on the means by which the ethylene transduction pathway leads to diversified physiological responses and how ethylene signalling interacts with other hormones to activate the expression of ripening-related genes. While this review mostly refers to the tomato as major model for fruit research, it also gives insight on the ripening process in <b>other</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>species,</b> including nonclimacteric types...|$|E
5000|$|Navisporus fungi have pale brown {{to brown}} context, and a dimitic hyphal system, meaning they have both {{generative}} and skeletal hyphae. Ryvarden described the genus as {{being close to}} Pseudopiptoporus (published by Ryvarden simultaneously with Navisporus), but with dextrinoid skeletal hyphae, and lacking gloeopleurous hyphae. Navisporus spores are long, navicular (boat-shaped) and non-dextrinoid. N. terrestris is the only species in the genus that has a fruit body with a stipe, and also {{the only member of}} the genus that fruits on soil [...] All of the <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>fruit</b> as a stipeless (sessile) cap on dead wood, or alternately in effused-reflexed form—i.e., a crust fungus with margins that form caps.|$|R

40|$|Apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) {{flowers at}} the end of the winter but flower bud {{differentiation}} occurs the previous summer. During the winter, the flower bud enters dormancy and resumes growth prior to flowering. The time the flower bud remains dormant is genetically and also environmentally controlled and is a major factor in determining the adaptation of particular cultivars to particular ecological conditions. In apricot, as in <b>other</b> temperate <b>fruit</b> <b>species,</b> chilling is required for buds to emerge from rest, and chilling requirements vary greatly among cultivars. However, very little is known on the physiological changes underlying these events. To explore the relationship between pollen development and chilling requirements, anther and pollen development have been characterised in several apricot cultivars with different chilling requirements. For this purpose, sequentially fixed flower buds from dormancy to flowering were histochemically examined in two consecutive years. While the pattern of pollen development is highly conserved, differences in timing were observed among the different cultivars and years. These differences are discussed in relation to the chilling requirements for each cultivar.
