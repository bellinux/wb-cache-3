40|$|Background: When {{conducting}} a meta-analysis of a continuous outcome, estimated {{means and standard}} deviations from the selected studies are required in order to obtain an overall estimate of the mean effect and its confidence interval. If these quantities are not directly reported in the publications, they need to must be estimated from other reported summary statistics, such as the median, the minimum, the maximum, and quartiles. Methods: We propose a simulation-based estimation approach using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) technique for estimating mean and standard deviation based on various sets of summary statistics found in published studies. We conduct a simulation study to compare the proposed ABC method with the existing methods of Hozo et al. (2005), Bland (2015), and Wan et al. (2014). Results: In the estimation of the standard deviation, <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> method performs best in skewed or heavy-tailed distributions. The average relative error (ARE) approaches zero as sample size increases. In the normal distribution, <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> performs well. However, the Wan et al. method is best since {{it is based on the}} normal distribution assumption. When the distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed, the ARE of Wan et al. moves away from zero even as sample size increases. In the estimation of the mean, <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> method is best since the AREs converge to zero. Conclusion: ABC is a flexible method for estimating the study-specific mean and standard deviation for meta-analysis, especially with underlying skewed or heavy-tailed distributions. The ABC method can be applied using other reported summary statistics such as the posterior mean and 95 % credible interval when Bayesian analysis has been employed...|$|E

40|$|Phylogenetic {{inference}} is {{an attractive}} means to reconstruct transmission histories and epidemics. However, {{there is not a}} perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. <b>Our</b> <b>ABC</b> framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV- 1 epidemic...|$|E

Inferential tools for historical demography given these data sets are, at present, underdeveloped. In particular, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has yet to be widely embraced by researchers generating these data. Here, we demonstrate the promise of ABC for analysis of the large data sets that are now attainable from nonmodel taxa through current genomic sequencing technologies. We develop and test an ABC framework for model selection and parameter estimation, given histories of three-population divergence with admixture. We then explore different sampling regimes to illustrate how sampling more loci, longer loci or more individuals affects the quality of model selection and parameter estimation in this ABC framework. Our results show that inferences improved substantially with increases in the number and/or length of sequenced loci, while less benefit was gained by sampling large numbers of individuals. Optimal sampling strategies given our inferential models included at least 2000 loci, each approximately 2  kb in length, sampled from five diploid individuals per population, although specific strategies are model and question dependent.

40|$|Standard {{approaches}} to Bayesian parameter inference in large scale structure assume a Gaussian functional form (chi-squared form) for the likelihood. This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC {{relies on a}} forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring {{the distance between the}} model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Studies of {{the effects}} of mating order on fertiliza-tion success, classically {{analyzed}} as the proportional paternity of the second male, have advanced our understanding of the relative influences of postcopulatory male–male competition and female choice on sexual selection. However, results from these studies are often difficult to analyze because (1) distri-butions of offspring per dam rarely follow a normal distribu-tion and (2) proportional paternities are never normally dis-tributed. Previous studies partially account for these limita-tions by using nonparametric statistics. However, behavioral studies are often plagued by relatively small sample sizes and require a more powerful analytical approach. Here, we devel-op a new analytical framework for studying fertilization bias. Our Approximate Bayesian Computational (ABC) model overcomes many of the limitations of currently employed methods. We apply our model to analyze the effects of male mating order on paternity success in the brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei. Using <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> simulation, we find a marked first-male advantage: first males sired approximately 80 % of the offspring in our study. Next, based on re-analysis of four previously published datasets, we show that traditional statis-tical methods often over- or underestimate biases related to mating order. Moreover, by comparing our model to more traditional statistical tests, we show that the ABC method is robust to relatively small samples sizes and should therefore be useful for studying mating-order effects in a variety of systems.

We applied this method to simulated data and show that it has some power to detect sweeps that occurred more than 10, 000 generations in the past. We also applied it to 1, 000 Genomes and Complete Genomics data combined with high-coverage Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes to test for sweeps in modern humans since the separation from the Neanderthal–Denisovan ancestor.

The second split occurred between the North and South Amazonian populations in the transition between the Pleistocene and the Holocene eras (9, 100 - 11, 000 YBP).
