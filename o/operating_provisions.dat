40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the passage of six types of corporate antitakeover provisions (supermajority, classified boards, fair-price, reduction in cumulative voting, anti-greenmail and poison pills) and stockholder wealth. Our event study from a sample of 38 l firms that adopted 486 antitakeover provisions in the 1984 - 1988 period indicates a strongly negative effect on stockholder wealth, supporting the management entrenchment view of antitakeover provisions. Moreover, the empirical results of this paper indicate that the market reacts equally negatively to both non-operating provisions that require stockholder approval and to <b>operating</b> <b>provisions</b> that do not require stockholder approval. However, separate analyses of the antitakeover provisions provide some support for the argument that stockholders discriminate between individual provisions.

40|$|The NIOSH Nanotechnology Research Center (NTRC) was {{established}} in 2004 to develop, coordinate, and deliver an organized program of research to identify, investigate, and develop science-based solutions to workplace health and safety knowledge gaps in nanotechnology. The NTRC provides overall strategic direction and coordination of the NIOSH nanotechnology cross-sector research program ([URL] The responsibilities of the NTRC are {{in accordance with the}} legislative mandate issued to NIOSH in Section 20 (a) (4) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which states: " [...] . conduct special research, experiments, and demonstrations relating to occupational safety and health as are necessary to explore new problems, including those created by new technology in occupational safety and health, which may require ameliorative action beyond that which is otherwise provided for in the <b>operating</b> <b>provisions</b> of this Act. " Nanotechnology is a rapidly emerging material science technology that has been identified as a critical U. S. scientific and commercial enterprise with global economic benefits. Concern over the lack of knowledge about the potential health risks associated with the handling of pure, unbound engineered nanomaterials has been expressed by investors, entrepreneurs, government agencies, and public health advocacy groups. Such concerns create potential barriers to the growth of nanotechnology and the commercialization of products and devices that could help address serious global problems concerning energy, transportation, pollution, health, and food. Issues that have been raised about worker health and safety must be add ressed to ensure responsible development, societal benefit, and associated economic growth. Vision Statement: The NTRC facilitates responsible development of nanotechnology by identifying and addressing gaps in occupational safety and health knowledge. This vision is accomplished by creating a strategic plan of research, coordinating and facilitating the delivery of results, developing and disseminating science-based risk management recommendations, and providing national and world leadership.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{incentives and}} supplier-induced demand of care managers, middlemen between consumers and service providers in the Japanese social insurance program for long-term care. Care managers {{can be considered}} as pure gatekeepers in that their function is limited to referral to specialists and they themselves do not provide care. Rewards for care managers are rendered by capitation, which is considered as a cost-effective payment mechanism for insurers. However, many care managers actually work for firms that also <b>operate</b> service <b>provision</b> sectors. The service providers are rewarded by the fee-for-service payment and have motivation to induce excess consumer demand. Thus, the violation of neutrality of care managers might yield an financial burden on social insurance. In this study, we empirically analyze the behavior of care managers by checking whether they cause supplier-induced demand. Our estimation results detect the existence of care manager-induced demand for care managers who work for firms that jointly <b>operate</b> in service <b>provision</b> sectors; however, those who operate only care management do not induce demand. Based on the estimation results, we conduct a quantitative analysis and show that the care manager-induced produces a considerable financial burden on social insurance...|$|R

40|$|Minimizing {{the impact}} of climate change on farmer {{livelihoods}} is crucial, but adaptation efforts may have unintended consequences for ecosystems, with potential impacts on farmers' welfare. Unintended outcomes of climate adaptation strategies have been widely discussed, however, empirical exploration has been neglected. Grounded in scholarship on climate adaptation, environmental governance, social-ecological systems, and land-use change, this paper studies whether farmers' climate adaptation contributes to deforestation or forest conservation. The paper draws on interviews with 353 farmers from 46 communities in Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. Farmers {{in the area of}} study have implemented adaptation strategies that people around the world have used for centuries, including migration, diversification, savings, and pooling. The findings show that climate adaptation can increase deforestation or support forest conservation {{depending on the type of}} adaptation strategy farmers implement. Saving, based on cattle ranching, is a deforestation-driving strategy. The choice of this strategy is influenced by distance to the commercial and administrative center and cash benefits from the forest. Deforestation can have a negative impact on farmers' welfare, as well as harm biodiversity and contribute to increased climate change. Thus, deforestation-driving adaptation strategies may be ineffective. However, diversification, based on off-farm jobs and <b>operating</b> <b>provision</b> shops, is a conservation-driving strategy influenced by distance as well as by family size. Farmers who choose diversification to adapt may contribute to a virtuous circle in which livelihood improvement in the short term leads to enhanced social-ecological resilience in the longer term. The need for farmers to implement adaptation strategies thus represents great risk but also opportunities...|$|R
