50|$|With football's {{rapid growth}} in {{popularity}} in the late 19th century, several football clubs came into existence in Belgium. The first to register with the national association was Royal Antwerp. They were subsequently assigned the matricule number 1 when the Royal Belgian Football Association gave a matricule number to each registered club in November 1926, by <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b> Many matricule numbers no longer exist due to clubs ceasing to exist or merging with another club. When two (or more) clubs merge, they must choose which matricule number to keep. The new club begins the championship at the level where the former club with the same matricule number should have begun the season. Typically, they choose {{the one with the}} most honours. However, it has often occurred that a club with multiple championship titles have to merge with another less successful club in order to survive. In this case, the club with financial problems has to take the matricule number of the other club, and the honours are lost with the merger. For instance, when the seven-time champion, Antwerp-based club K. Beerschot VAC was struggling with financial difficulties in the third division in the late 1990s, they merged with then first division neighbour club KFC Germinal Ekeren to survive. The new club named KFC Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen started in the first division with the matricule number of KFC Germinal Ekeren, losing the honours of K Beerschot VAC, but keeping their installations and their purple shirt. Another famous example is that of five-time champion Daring Club de Bruxelles' merger with RR White into R White Daring Molenbeek in 1973.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We have cloned 10 novel {{full-length}} cDNAs of {{mouse and}} human HSP 40 /DNAJ homologs using {{expressed sequence tag}} (EST) clones found in the DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL DNA database. In this report, we tentatively designated them mHsp 40, mDj 3, mDj 4, mDj 5, mDj 6, mDj 7, mDj 8, hDj 9, mDj 10, and mDj 11. Based on {{the identity of the}} deduced amino acid sequences, mHsp 40, mDj 3, and mDj 11 are orthologs of human Hsp 40, rat Rdj 2, and human Tpr 2, respectively. We determined that mDj 4 is identical with the recently isolated mouse Mrj (mammalian relative of DnaJ). PSORT analysis (a program that predicts the subcellular localization site of a given protein from its amino acid sequences) revealed that hDj 9 has an N-terminal signal peptide; hence, its localization might be extracellular, suggesting {{that there may be a}} partner Hsp 70 protein that acts together with the hDj 9 outside of the cell. The same analysis indicated that mDj 7 and mDj 10 may have transmembrane domains. In order to simplify the complicated and confusing nomenclature of recently identified mammalian HSP 40 /DNAJ homologs, we propose here some new rules for their nomenclature. This proposed nomenclature includes the name of species with 2 lowercase letters such as hs (Homo sapiens), mm (Mus musculus) and rn (Rattus norvegicus); Dj standing for DnaJ; the name of types with A, B, and C, which were previously classified as type I, II, and III according to the domain structure of the homologs; and finally Arabic numerals according to the chronological <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> of the sequence data into the database...|$|E
40|$|Legal systems {{around the}} world vary widely in how they deal with the {{assignment}} of receivables. This legal variety {{makes it difficult for}} financiers to conduct their international receivables financing business. This thesis suggests an International Registration System for the Assignment and Security Interest of Receivables (‘IRSAR’) and proposes a model international convention for the IRSAR (‘proposed IRSAR Convention’), which could help financiers to overcome the obstacles they currently encounter. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, the international assignment of receivables would be regulated by a unified legal system with respect to priority and perfection. The IRSAR would facilitate international project financing. Furthermore, the IRSAR would enable companies to raise finance from greater ranges of investors {{around the world}} through international receivables financing and to dispose of non-performing loans more easily. The proposed IRSAR Convention would succeed the UN Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade in the attempt of establishing a registration system for international assignments of receivables. The proposed IRSAR Convention confines its scope of application by defining the assignor (or the security provider), inventing the concept of ‘Vehicle for the International Registration System’ (‘VIRS’). The proposed IRSAR Convention applies where the assignor or security provider is a VIRS. An assignment of a receivable where the assignor is a VIRS and a security interest in a receivable where the security provider is a VIRS could be registered in the IRSAR. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, priority of assignments of and security interests in receivables is determined by the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> in the IRSAR. The proposed IRSAR Convention would be a receivables version of the Cape Town Convention. With respect to the contents and effect of registration, it would prescribe a notice-filing system along the lines of that adopted in the UCC Article 9. With respect to the operation of the registration, it would adopt an automatic online registration system operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year like the International Registry under the Cape Town Convention.

The anonymous questionnaire-type poll {{has been carried out}} in the N family clinic during February 4 - 8 in 2008, patients aged 18 years old and older participated in the poll. 385 of questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 83, 9 percent. The statistical data analysis has been accomplished with SPSS version statistical package. Results. Respondents state that information about health and health care is very important (40, 6 - 62, 8 percent) and important (34, 7 - 51. 6 percent). The majority of medical information aspects are more relevant for women and for respondents with higher education. The expectations for medical information for 71, 3 - 86, 3 percent of respondents are fully satisfied. Respondents living in the city are satisfied with the level of information about the diagnosis of a disease, treatment ways, effect of medicine, medical tests and risk much more. More than a half of respondents (55, 9 percent) prefer partnership communication model, especially residents who live in the city (64 percent). Partnership model is used during the consultations of general practitioners the most often (53, 7 percent). The majority of respondents consider the communication with general practitioner positively. Doctor is attentive and observant during the consultations, she/he ensures confidentiality, moreover a doctor makes sure that the patients understand his/her guidelines and provides emotional support. Older people who are employed and have a higher education state that a doctor makes sure whether the patient understands his/her guidelines. Respondents with special high school education and people with disabilities state that material conditions do matter. Women, people from countryside and young people receive more emotional support. 66, 3 - 93, 5 percent of respondents claim that their expectations for the quality of health care and its accessibility are fully satisfied and satisfied.
