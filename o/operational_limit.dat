From February onwards, the C.200 was employed in repeated attacks upon Soviet airfields at Liman, Luskotova and Leninski Bomdardir. On 4 May 1942, the 22º Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre, which had reached its <b>operational</b> <b>limit,</b> was replaced by the newly formed 21º Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre, composed of 356a, 361a, 382a and 386a Squadriglia. This unit, commanded by Maggiore Ettore Foschini, brought new C.202s and 18 new C.200 fighters. During the Second Battle of Kharkov (12–30 May) the Italians flew escort for the German bombers and reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April, {{due to the}} {{likelihood}} of the ULBs' acoustic pulses having ceased because their batteries would have run down, the Towed Pinger Locator search gave way to a seabed search using side-scan sonar installed in a Bluefin-21 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. The first day's search was aborted because the sea bed was considerably deeper than the maximum operating depth of Bluefin. Scanning subsequently resumed and after covering 42 square miles in its first four dives, the submersible was reprogrammed to allow it to dive 604 feet lower than its <b>operational</b> <b>limit</b> of 14,800 feet, when the risk of damage was assessed as [...] "acceptable".|$|E

[...] Up until that point, submarines had been torpedo boats tied to the surface by the need to charge their batteries using diesel engines relatively often. The nuclear power plant of the Nautilus meant that the boat could stay underwater for literally months at a time, the only <b>operational</b> <b>limit</b> being the amount of food that the boat could carry. With resupply by mini-subs, even this could be overcome. The final limits would be for replacing equipment that wears out, the fatigue limit of the hull, and crew morale.|$|E

The <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> represent the acceptable dispersions in attainment of separation target conditions which assure safe separation. Safe separation is based on satisfying all specified separation design criteria except orbiter altitude at ALT interface airspeed.

2500|$|The sky {{was dark}} and the pilots lacked any visual ground references. Descent was {{controlled}} {{through the use of}} the vertical-speed wheel of the autopilot, combined with an altitude preselect (which illuminated a light when reaching preselected altitudes) in manual mode. While retaining use of the autopilot, the pilots reduced their speed to [...] at the request of air-traffic control at 19:07. At this point the pilots were working through the approach checklist. The captain halted the checklist at the point regarding the radio altimeter, as the aircraft was above its <b>operational</b> <b>limit,</b> and he wanted to control the plane's operation during further descent. At 19:11, the aircraft received permission to bear 180 degrees and descend to and maintain 1,000 meters (3,000ft) of altitude. Both navigational receivers were tuned to the ILS frequency.|$|E
2500|$|The LCA type {{was confronted}} with many {{challenges}} on D-Day; some presented by the Neptune plan, some by the enemy defences, and others by the weather. The initial seaborne assault on the Normandy coast broke with previous Allied practice, {{in that it was}} made in daylight. The invasion could occur 6 June because the date satisfied certain preliminary requirements. Of particular concern to landing craft, H-Hour was fixed forty minutes after nautical twilight. H-Hour was also fixed for three hours before high-water mark. The tide in the English Channel rises from west to east (high water in Utah area occurs approximately 40 minutes before it occurs in the Sword area), and so some difference in H-Hour were planned among the assault areas in order to provide the initial assault landing craft the full advantage of a rising tide. Among the many variable concerns to be considered by the planners was whether to land below, among, or above the line of Element 'C' obstacles. The sea conditions at many places along the coast (6' waves and [...] currents) were just at the outside <b>operational</b> <b>limit</b> of the LCA. The setting of the Transportation Area [...] from shore presented an additional complication for LCAs operating in the Western Task Force Area in these condition.|$|E

40|$|A Westinghouse 24 C- 2 {{combustor}} {{was investigated}} at conditions simulating {{operation of the}} 24 C Jet engine at zero ram over ranges of altitude and engine speed. The investigation was conducted to determine the altitude <b>operational</b> <b>limits,</b> that is, the maximum altitude for various engine speeds at which an average combustor-outlet gas temperature sufficient for operation of the jet engine could be obtained. Information was also obtained regarding {{the character of the}} flames, the combustion efficiency, the combustor-outlet gas temperature and velocity distributions, the extent of afterburning, the flow characteristics of the fuel manifolds, the combustor inlet-to-outlet total-pressure drop, and the durability of the combustor basket. The results of the investigation indicated that the altitude <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> for zero ram decreased from 12, 000 feet at an engine speed of 4000 rpm to a minimum of 9000 feet at 6000 rpm, and thence increased to 49, 000 feet at 12, 000 rpm [...] At altitudes below the <b>operational</b> <b>limits,</b> flames were essentially steady, but, at altitudes above the <b>operational</b> <b>limits,</b> flames were often cycling and either blew out or caused violent explosions and vibrations. At conditions on the altitude <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> the type of combustion varied from steady to cycling with increasing fuel-air ratio and the reverse occurred with decreasing fuel-air ratio. In the region of operation investigated, the combustion efficiency ranged from 75 to 95 percent at altitudes below the <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> and dropped to 55 percent or less at some altitudes above the <b>operational</b> <b>limits.</b> The deviations in the local combustor-outlet gas temperatures were within + 20 to - 30 percent of the mean combustor temperature rise for inlet-air temperatures {{at the low end of}} the range investigated, but became more uneven (up to +/- 100 percent) with increasing inlet-air temperatures. The distribution of the combustor-outlet gas velocity followed a similar trend. Practically no afterburning downstream of the combustor outlet occurred. At conditions of high inlet-air temperature several factors indicated that fuel vapor or air formed in the fuel manifolds and adversely affected combustion. The combustor inlet-to-outlet total-pressure drop can be correlated as a function of the ratio of the combustion-air inlet density to outlet density and of the inlet dynamic pressure. The walls of the combustor basket were warped and burned during 29 hours of operation...|$|R

5000|$|While the First World War saw the {{introduction}} of large scale mechanization in modern warfare, the lack of tactical experience of the commanders and the technical limitations of the weapon systems greatly limited their usefulness.
