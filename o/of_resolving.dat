5|$|After Sesame Streets first season, {{its critics}} forced its {{producers}} and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways <b>of</b> <b>resolving</b> conflict. These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life {{experiences of the}} show's cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effectiveness of public statements <b>of</b> <b>resolve</b> in international conflict. Several prominent theories, including domestic audience cost theory and theories regarding international reputation, suggest that issu-ing resolved statements can help a leader achieve a more favorable outcome in conflict bargaining. Because they entail costs for backing down, these statements are believed to credibly convey resolve to an adversary. This can help to alleviate the uncertainty created by private information about resolve and persuade the adversary to back down. Despite the prevalence of this theoretical logic, the effectiveness <b>of</b> statements <b>of</b> <b>resolve</b> at influencing conflict out-comes has rarely been subjected to direct tests, and some recent empirical work has raised doubts about statements’ effectiveness. This article {{is the first to}} directly examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>resolved</b> statements on conflict outcomes using large-N analysis. It introduces original data, created using content analysis, which directly measure the level <b>of</b> <b>resolved</b> statements made by US presidents during militarized interstate disputes (MIDs). Analysis of these data demonstrates that a higher level <b>of</b> <b>resolved</b> statements is indeed associated with a greater chance of prevailing in dis-putes. This finding is substantively significant and robust, providing support for the argument that public statements {{play an important role in}} international conflict...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Turbulence-resolving {{simulations}} {{have been}} performed using hybrid RANS-LES approaches for the turbulent flow around a three-element high-lift configura-tion. The main purpose is to explore the effect of some modeling-related numerical aspects on the simulation <b>of</b> <b>resolved</b> velocity and pressure fluctuations as potent noise-generating sources. Along with a presentation <b>of</b> <b>resolved</b> instantaneous and mean flow features, {{the impact of the}} time step and the spanwise extent of the com-putational domain is investigated. It is shown that the temporal resolution and the spanwise extension of the computational domain impose effects not only on the prediction of mean flow, but more significantly on the correlation <b>of</b> <b>resolved</b> turbu-lent structures, which may consequently affect the accuracy of flow-generated noise properties. ...|$|R

5|$|Studio Ghibli {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the series in 2006 titled Tales from Earthsea. The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, {{and in particular the}} use of a villain who could be slain as a means <b>of</b> <b>resolving</b> conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method <b>of</b> <b>resolving</b> this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways <b>of</b> <b>resolving</b> uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms <b>of</b> <b>resolving</b> Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Matching Dependencies (MDs) are a {{relatively}} recent proposal for declarative entity resolution. They are rules that specify, given the similarities satisfied by values in a database, what values should be considered duplicates, {{and have to be}} matched. On the basis of a chase-like procedure for MD enforcement, we can obtain clean (duplicate-free) instances; actually possibly several <b>of</b> them. The <b>resolved</b> answers to queries are those that are invariant under the resulting class <b>of</b> <b>resolved</b> instances. In previous work we identified some tractable cases (i. e. for certain classes of queries and MDs) <b>of</b> <b>resolved</b> query answering. In this paper we further investigate the complexity of this problem, identifying some intractable cases. For a special case we obtain a dichotomy complexity result. ...|$|R
