40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the acute honey bee poisoning events observed in several European countries during maize drilling, the dust drift topic has received increasingly more attention. We aimed to quantify the dust drift risk, develop reduction measures and innovate sowing techniques using an integrated experimental and modelling approach. To validate and finetune the dust drift CFD-models under development, the designs of three selected sowing machines and associated tractors were digitised. For the two pneumatic drills, the airflows around the machines and at the in- and <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> were measured. <b>Air</b> velocities at the outlets ranged from only 0. 11 m s- 1 for the pneumatic bulk drill up to 26. 1 m s- 1 for the pneumatic precision drill without deflector. The use of a deflector reduced the exit velocities to 13. 4 m s- 1 as well as the air velocities around the machine. Reference tracer seeds were developed with different qualities regarding dust production in order to measure the dissipation of dust around static operated drills and in field conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

By taking an independent metro vehicle duct as research object in this paper, supply <b>air</b> through <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> is simulated and {{compared with the}} actual test results from the angle of supply air velocity at each <b>outlet</b> and supply <b>air</b> volume through several <b>outlets</b> of <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> The {{results show that the}} relative deviation of simulation and test value of air velocity at most of the outlets are within or near ± 20 %, which is acceptable for the engineering applications. Moreover, the ratio of supply air volume through several outlets to the corresponding total supply air volume through main <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> or flat duct in the case of simulation is consistent with {{that in the case of}} experiment.

The collector {{consists of a}} 4. 5 m long <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> with a (20 × 5) cm cross-sectional area. The <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> consists of four channels so that the collector becomes more compact. The collector is studied under the weather conditions of Hilla city – Iraq with latitude and longitude equal 32. 3 ° N and 44. 25 ° E respectively and it is tilted by 45 ° with the horizontal plane. The effect of the {{air mass flow rate}} on the collector performance is also studied. The performance of the collector is analyzed with and without porous media stuffing. The measured parameters are the air and absorber temperatures, air speed and pressure drop. The temperatures are measured by means of type (K) thermocouples as this type covers the temperature range of the studied system. The values of the temperature are displayed by temperature data logger devices. The air speed and pressure drop are measured by digital anemometer and manometer devices respectively. The results of the studied system show that as the air mass flow rate increases, the temperature of both the flowing air and the absorber decrease, whilst the efficiency of the collector increases. The results also show that the addition of the steel wool porous material inside the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> increases the temperature of both the flowing air and the absorber, and by that increases the efficiency of the collector.

However, in practice, obstacles {{have been identified in}} the form of rejection from the community due to the outstanding issues that high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> have an impact on health. Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m. The results of the magnetic field strength analysis showed that the highest strength of magnetic field and electric field when the high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is completed and operated was magnetic field of 0. 00415 mT and electric field of 38. 4 V/m. The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT. Conclusion: Electromagnetic wave radiation of High-Voltage <b>Air</b> <b>Ducts</b> is not exceeded the allowed limit, so it will not cause a direct risk to health. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{underground}} <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> along peripheral {{walls of}} a building are a remediation method, which principle is to enable an air flow along the moist building structure’s surface to allow a sufficient evaporation of moisture from the structure. This measure reduces the water transport (rising moisture) into the higher parts of the wall where the high water content in masonry is undesirable. Presently, underground <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> are designed as masonry structures, which durability in contact with ground moisture is limited.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{technique}} for dehydration of dairy products is spray drying. This is an effective method for preserving biological products as it does not involve severe heat treatment and allows storage of powders at an ambient temperature. The maximum moisture content of a dairy powder (max 4 % for skim milk powder) is defined in the product specification {{in relation to the}} water activity, and this must be close to 0. 2 at 25 ◦C for optimum preservation. From an economic point of view, {{it is very important to}} operate as closely as possible to this limit. Many dairy manufacturers and researchers have demonstrated and reported that powder moisture is related to the <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature, but this is not always true. The aims of this study were to evaluate the direct and indirect relationships between <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature and moisture content of skim milk powder in relation to the spray-drying parameters (concentrate mass flow rate, absolute humidity of inlet air and inlet air temperature) using a thermodynamic approach. Our experiments showed that moisture content of skim milk powder can be close to 5. 1 ± 0. 0 % with variations in <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature of 77 to 87 ◦C. Other experiments showed that the powder moisture content can vary from 4. 6 ± 0. 0 % to 5. 2 ± 0. 0 % even when the <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature remains close to 86 ± 1 ◦C. These results indicate that there is no direct relationship between <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature and powder moisture content. It is preferable to use the Enthalpic Mollier-Ramzine diagram of wet air and certain transfer equations related to the Fick and Fourier laws to demonstrate that the powder moisture content is directly related to the relative humidity (RH) of the <b>outlet</b> <b>air.</b> The moisture content and water activity of skim milk powder were close to 5. 1 ± 0. 0 % and 0. 27 ± 0. 01 for <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> RH close to 7. 0 ± 0. 1 %, respectively, whatever the other drying parameter values. We demonstrated in this study that control of the RH of the <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> is at least as important as control of the <b>outlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature to optimize the moisture content of a dairy powder, regardless of the absolute humidity of the inlet air, concentrate mass flow rate or inlet air temperature...|$|R
