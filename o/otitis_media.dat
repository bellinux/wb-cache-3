5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infantsâ€™ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans and Inuit {{are more}} likely to be {{infected}} with colds and develop complications such as <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> than Caucasians. This may be explained by issues such as poverty and overcrowding rather than by ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|Preclinical {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} effects of MFGM-derived bioactive components on brain structure and function, intestinal development, and immune defense. Similarly, pediatric clinical trials have reported beneficial effects on cognitive and immune outcomes. In populations ranging from premature infants to preschool-age children, dietary supplementation with MFGM or its components {{has been associated with}} improvements in cognition and behavior, gut and oral bacterial composition, fever incidence, and infectious outcomes including diarrhea and <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
5|$|Primary Secretory <b>Otitis</b> <b>Media</b> (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{recurrent}} {{episodes of}} acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{and those with}} <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion or chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> have higher risks of developing conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Globally approximately 141nbsp&million people have mild hearing loss due to <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (2.1% of the population). This {{is more common in}} males (2.3%) than females (1.8%).|$|E
25|$|Periods of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} from <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> may have a detrimental effect on speech development in children. Some studies have linked <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> to learning problems, attention disorders, and problems with social adaptation. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> have more depression/anxiety-related disorders compared to individuals with normal hearing. Once the infections resolve and hearing thresholds return to normal, childhood <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> may still cause minor and irreversible damage to the middle ear and cochlea.|$|E
25|$|Pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccines (PCV) {{in early}} infancy, decreases {{the risk of}} acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in healthy infants. PCV is recommended for all children, and, if implemented broadly, PCV {{would have a significant}} public health benefit. Influenza vaccine is recommended annually for all children. PCV does not appear to decrease the risk of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> when given to high-risk infants or for older children who have previously experienced <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{there was}} {{considerable}} interest {{in the role of}} chronic <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period. Consistent with this, in a sample of young children with chronic ear infections recruited from a hospital otolargyngology department, increased rates of auditory difficulties were found later in childhood. However, this kind of study will suffer from sampling bias because children with <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{will be more likely to}} be referred to hospital departments if they are experiencing developmental difficulties. Compared with hospital studies, epidemiological studies, which assesses a whole population for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and then evaluate outcomes, have found much weaker evidence for long-term impacts of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> on language outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> is a {{group of}} {{inflammatory}} diseases of the middle ear. The two main types are acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (AOM) and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion (OME). AOM is an infection of abrupt onset that usually presents with ear pain. In young children this may result in pulling at the ear, increased crying, and poor sleep. Decreased eating and a fever may also be present. OME is typically not associated with symptoms. Occasionally a feeling of fullness is described. It is defined as the presence of non-infectious fluid in the middle ear for more than three months. Chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (CSOM) is middle ear inflammation of greater than two weeks that results in episodes of discharge from the ear. It may be a complication of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Pain is rarely present. All three may be associated with hearing loss. The hearing loss in OME, due to its chronic nature, may affect a child's ability to learn.|$|E
25|$|Complications {{of acute}} <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{consists}} of perforation {{of the ear}} drum, infection of the mastoid space behind the ear (mastoiditis), and more rarely intracranial complications can occur, such as bacterial meningitis, brain abscess, or dural sinus thrombosis. It is estimated that each year 21,000 people die due to complications of <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{bilateral}} acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{in infants}} younger than 24 months of age, without severe signs and symptoms, antibiotics should be prescribed.|$|E
25|$|Oral and topical pain killers are {{effective}} {{to treat the}} pain caused by <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Oral agents include ibuprofen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and opiates. Topical agents shown to be effective include antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops. Decongestants and antihistamines, either nasal or oral, are not recommended {{due to the lack}} of benefit and concerns regarding side effects. Half of cases of ear pain in children resolve without treatment in three days and 90% resolve in seven or eight days. The use of steroids is not supported by the evidence for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{caused by}} H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. Azithromycin is not, however, a {{first-line}} agent for this condition. Amoxicillin or another beta lactam antibiotic is generally preferred.|$|E
25|$|Adhesive <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{occurs when}} a thin {{retracted}} ear drum becomes sucked into the middle-ear space and stuck (i.e., adherent) to the ossicles and other bones of the middle ear.|$|E
25|$|Amoxicillin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of infections, including acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, Salmonella infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections.|$|E
25|$|A {{treatment}} {{option for}} chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with discharge is topical antibiotics. A Cochrane review found that topical quinolone antibiotics can improve discharge better than oral antibiotics. Safety {{is not really}} clear.|$|E
25|$|Facial nerve {{disorders}} may {{stem from}} a myriad of contributing factors: Bellâ€™s palsy, injury resulting from surgical error, trauma to the temporal bone, <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> multiple sclerosis, mumps, chicken pox, and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|An {{option for}} severe acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in which analgesics are not {{controlling}} ear pain is {{to perform a}} tympanocentesis, i.e., needle aspiration through the tympanic membrane to relieve the ear pain and to identify the causative organism(s).|$|E
25|$|Cefalexin {{can treat}} {{a number of}} {{bacterial}} infections including: <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> streptococcal pharyngitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. It {{may be used to}} prevent bacterial endocarditis. It can also be used for the prevention of recurrent urinary-tract infections.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} is usually done under general anesthesia. Risks {{of the procedures}} include mastoiditis, <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (acute or with effusion), shifting of the implanted device requiring a second procedure, damage to the facial nerve, damage to the chorda tympani, and wound infections.|$|E
25|$|Pseudoephedrine is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of nasal congestion, sinus congestion and Eustachian tube congestion. Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis, and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of allergic rhinitis, croup, sinusitis, <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> and tracheobronchitis.|$|E
25|$|When non-severe {{unilateral}} acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{is diagnosed}} {{in young children}} either antibiotic therapy is given or observation with close follow-up based on joint decision making between parent(s)/caregiver in infants 6 to 23 months of age. If the child worsens or fails to improve in 2 to 3 days antibiotics should be administered.|$|E
25|$|Pharyngitis is {{inflammation}} {{of the back of}} the throat, known as the pharynx. It typically results in a sore throat and fever. Other symptoms may include a runny nose, cough, headache, a hoarse voice. Symptoms usually last three to five days. Complications can include sinusitis and acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Pharyngitis is typically a type of respiratory tract infection.|$|E
25|$|Facial nerve paralysis* is most {{commonly}} caused in dogs by trauma, <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> {{or as an}} idiopathic condition. Signs include an inability to blink, drooping of the ear, and drooping of the lips on the affected side, although in chronic conditions fibrosis occurs and the ear and lips {{may appear to be}} in an abnormal position.|$|E
25|$|This {{hearing loss}} is mainly due to fluid {{in the middle}} ear or rupture of the tympanic membrane. Prolonged {{duration}} of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> is associated with ossicular complications and, together with persistent tympanic membrane perforation, contributes to {{the severity of the}} disease and hearing loss. When a cholesteatoma or granulation tissue is present in the middle ear, the degree of hearing loss and ossicular destruction is even greater.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} {{in which the}} device is implanted is usually done under general anesthesia. Risks of the procedures include mastoiditis, <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (acute or with effusion), shifting of the implanted device requiring a second procedure, damage to the facial nerve, damage to the chorda tympani, and wound infections. People may experience problems with dizziness and balance {{for up to a}} few months after the procedure; these problems generally resolve, but for people over 70, they tend not to.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones {{had become}} the class of {{antibiotics}} most commonly prescribed to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the U.S. FDA, such as acute bronchitis, <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> and acute upper respiratory tract infection, {{according to a study}} supported in part by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. In addition, they are commonly prescribed for medical conditions, such as acute respiratory illness, that are usually caused by viral infections.|$|E
25|$|Brereton {{was born}} in Pittsburgh, in 1890, the second son of William Denny Brereton and Helen (Hyde) Brereton. The family moved to Annapolis, Maryland while Brereton's older brother, William Jr., was a {{midshipman}} at the Naval Academy. His father was a successful mining engineer and a 4th-generation Irish-American. His mother was English and Episcopalian by birth. At the age of eight, Brereton suffered a recurring infection of the middle ear, purulent <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> which proved impossible to treat in the pre-antibiotics era.|$|E
25|$|Ofloxacin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein this includes pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> when there is a hole in the ear drum.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to weigh the benefits and harms before using antibiotics for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> As over 82% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one perforation, and 11 children to prevent one opposite-side ear infection. For every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child has an episode of either vomiting, diarrhea or a rash. If pain is present, treatment to reduce it should be initiated.|$|E
25|$|Achondroplasia can be {{detected}} before birth {{by the use of}} prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-facial hypoplasia. Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors such}} as season, allergy {{predisposition}} and presence of older siblings {{are known to be}} determinants of recurrent <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and persistent middle-ear effusions (MEE). History of recurrence, environmental exposure to tobacco smoke, use of daycare, and lack of breastfeeding have all been associated with increased risk of development, recurrence, and persistent MEE. Thus, cessation of smoking in the home should be encouraged, daycare attendance should be avoided or daycare facilities with the fewest attendees should be recommended, and breastfeeding should be promoted.|$|E
25|$|In severe or {{untreated}} cases, {{the tympanic}} membrane may perforate, allowing the pus in the middle-ear space to drain into the ear canal. If there is enough, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the perforation of {{the tympanic membrane}} suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, it is almost always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses are likely to resolve the infection and the ear drum nearly always heals.|$|E
