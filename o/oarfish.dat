However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, <b>oarfish,</b> barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E

25|$|<b>Oarfish</b> feed {{primarily}} on zooplankton, selectively straining tiny euphausiids, shrimp, and other crustaceans from the water. Small fish, jellyfish, and squid are also taken. Large open-ocean carnivores are all likely predators of <b>oarfish.</b>|$|E
40|$|The ovaries {{of a large}} dealfish, Trachipterus ishikawae, 2. 47 m {{in total}} length, caught off Kumano-Nada Sea, Pacific coast, and two {{medium-sized}} <b>oarfishes,</b> Regalecus russelli, 2. 92 m and 2. 65 m in total length, caught off Wakasa Bay, Sea of Japan, were examined histologically. The dealfish had mature ovaries, 2420 gin weight, those of the <b>oarfishes</b> being immature (180. 2 g and 185. 8 g). Microscopic examination revealed an ovarian cavity in the central axis of the tubular ovary in both the dealfish and <b>oarfishes.</b> In the former, in addition to ripe eggs, ovulation scars, atretic follicles, oocytes in the yolk vesicle, peripheral nucleoli and chromatin nucleolus stages were seen, whereas in the <b>oarfishes,</b> no ovulation scars were detected. The oocytes, in various developmental stages in both species, were attached to loose connective tissue, i. e., ovigerous lamellae, derived from a thick ovarian capsule of fibrous connective tissue, which was coated with thin mesothelium. Such ovarian architecture was classified as entovarian type, the developmental mode of the ovarian eggs being unequal...|$|R
40|$|Acanthomorpha (spiny-rayed fishes) is a clade of teleosts that {{includes}} more than 15 000 extant species. Their deep phylogenetic intrarelationships, first reconstructed using morphological characters, have been extensively revised with molecular data. Moreover, the deep branches of the acanthomorph tree are still largely unresolved, with strong disagreement between studies. Here, we review the historical propositions for acanthomorph deep intrarelationships and attempt to resolve their earliest branching patterns using a new morphological data matrix compiling and revising characters from previous studies. The taxon sampling we use constitutes a first attempt to test all previous hypotheses (molecular and morphological alike) with morphological data only. Our sampling also includes Late Cretaceous fossil taxa, which yield new character state combinations that are absent in extant taxa. Analysis of the complete morphological data matrix yields a new topology that shows remarkable congruence with the well-supported molecular results. Lampridiformes (<b>oarfishes</b> and allies) are the sister to all other acanthomorphs. Gadiformes (cods and allies) and Zeiformes (dories) form a clade with Percopsiformes (trout-perches) and the enigmatic Polymixia (beardfish) and Stylephorus (tube-eye). Ophidiiformes (cusk-eels and allies) and Batrachoidiformes (toadfishes) are nested within Percomorpha, the clade {{that includes}} most of modern acanthomorph diversity. These results provide morphological synapomorphies and independent corroboration of clades previously only recovered from molecular data, thereby suggesting {{the emergence of a}} congruent picture of acanthomorph deep intrarelationships. Fossil taxa {{play a critical role in}} achieving this congruence, since a very different topology is found when they are excluded from the analysis...|$|R
40|$|The Eocene (Ypresian) fauna of Bolca, Italy {{yields a}} famous {{assemblage}} of marine tropical teleosts. One {{of the most}} anatomically distinctive teleosts from Bolca is the enigmatic †Bajaichthys elegans, generally interpreted {{as a member of}} Lampridiformes (<b>oarfishes</b> and allies). Re-examination of the type and only specimen of †Bajaichthys contradicts this attribution, and we propose that its original description as a member of Zeiformes (dories) was in fact correct. †Bajaichthys bears numerous derived features of zeiforms not found in lampridiforms, including: a pelvic spine, a first vertebra closely associated with the neurocranium, and a reduced metapterygoid not contacting the quadrate. Lampridiform-like attributes, including a greatly elongated ascending process of the premaxilla, are known to be convergent between this group and Zeiformes. Using a combination of morphological and molecular data, we confirm this revised interpretation and resolve the position of †Bajaichthys within zeiform phylogeny. In terms of overall shape, the very elongate †Bajaichthys contrasts with deep-bodied Zeiformes and probably had distinctive ecological habits. Our inferred placement of †Bajaichthys and other fossil taxa with extended caudal peduncles (e. g. †Archaeozeus) suggests that the elongate morphotype is ancestral for Zeiformes as a whole, and that the deep-bodied geometry typical of extant taxa probably appeared several times independently. However, these inferences must be considered preliminary due to low support for patterns of relationships within Zeiformes. The systematic reattribution of †Bajaichthys expands the taxonomic diversity of the Bolca fauna as well as the morphological and ecological diversity of the zeiform clade...|$|R

25|$|The <b>oarfish</b> {{is thought}} to inhabit the epipelagic to mesopelagic ocean layers, ranging from 1,000 meters (3,300ft) and is rarely seen on the surface.

Some cryptozoologists have suggested that sea serpents are relict plesiosaurs, mosasaurs or other Mesozoic marine reptiles, an idea often associated with lake monsters such as the Loch Ness Monster.|$|E
