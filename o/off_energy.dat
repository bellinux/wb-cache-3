50|$|Dissipation is a decohering {{process by}} which the populations of quantum states are changed due to {{entanglement}} with a bath. An example of this would be a quantum system that can exchange its energy with a bath through the interaction Hamiltonian. If the system is not in its ground state and the bath is at a temperature lower than that of the system's, then the system will give <b>off</b> <b>energy</b> to the bath and thus higher-energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian will decohere to the ground state after cooling and, as such, they will all be non-degenerate. Since the states are no longer degenerate, then they are not distinguishable and thus this process is irreversible (non-unitary).|$|E

5000|$|Pryluky {{accepted}} the USSR's first Tu-160 (Blackjack) in April 1987, building its fleet up to 19 by 1994. By the mid 1990s, the Pryluky Regiment {{had lost its}} value as a combat unit. The 184th GvTBAP's 19 [...] "Blackjacks" [...] were effectively grounded {{because of a lack}} of technical support, spare parts and fuel. At this point in time, Ukraine considered the Tu-160s more of a bargaining chip in their economic negotiations with Russia. Certainly, they were of very limited value to Ukraine from a military standpoint, but discussions with Russia concerning their return bogged down.

50|$|Due to {{the efforts}} of {{scientist}} Piotr Phobos, the government was made to see the potential value of superhumans serving the state and Phobos soon opened a private school to train mutants. Mikhail Ursus was among the first of the many mutants trained by Professor Phobos. Unknown to both his students and the Soviet government, Phobos had built a device to siphon <b>off</b> <b>energy</b> from his students to give himself artificial powers of his own. The process tended to kill the subjects after a time, and Phobos explained their deaths as training casualties. When the second Red Guardian discovered Phobos's scheme, he managed to overpower her and went into hiding, but not before giving two of his students, Darkstar and Vanguard, graduation 'gifts' through which he could continue to siphon their power.|$|E

SETILive uses data provided by the Allen Telescope Array and presents it visually so that the public can collectively search for radio signals. The project focuses on radio frequencies that automated detection systems ignore due to the prevalence of man-made noise. Jill Tarter hopes that human analysts {{will be able to}} detect low signal-to-noise transmissions which confuse computers. The telescope scans the zone between a known star and a known planet where liquid water is possible. This is called the habitable zone. The website displays one to three different scans of an area of space. Its energy is measured and put into a waterfall display. Users must identify the areas of high energy—signals—by making two points through which a line is drawn. Users classify signals as: broken, continuous, or parallel. Users then must classify the signal as: erratic, wide, or narrow. Many of the signals are just satellites that give <b>off</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{stars that}} undergo nuclear fusion, fuel {{consists}} of atomic nuclei that can release energy by {{the absorption of}} a proton or neutron. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form helium through the proton-proton chain reaction or by the CNO cycle. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once iron-56 or nickel-56 nuclei are produced, no further energy {{can be obtained by}} nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving <b>off</b> <b>energy</b> when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement (ITER), inertial confinement(heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used[...]|$|E

As soon as they see it, they recognise it as Gigano Dragon and quickly report the discovery to Dino Tyranno. Dark Dragon tells Diamond Ryugu {{that he has a}} plan to restore Gigano Dragon's energy so that he will at last complete his revenge upon Tyranno. As the fossilised form of Gigano is driven away by Dr. Gale, his truck is attack by another truck driven by the fossil hunter Gomez. He steals Gigano's fossil, but it is soon stolen again by Dark Dragon's bats. Kaito and Rena observe a life force extractor attached to Gigano's fossil, and call in the Dino Knights. The kids try to stop Gigano from absorbing enough life force, but are unable to stop him from coming back to life. Gigano immediately challenges Tyranno to another fight to the finish. Drago Wing is sent to recover Gigano when it becomes clear that he doesn't have enough energy to fight Tyranno, but Gigano then siphons <b>off</b> <b>energy</b> from Drago Wing.

5000|$|The use of vagotomy {{to treat}} obesity {{is now being}} studied. The vagus nerve {{provides}} efferent nervous signals out from the hunger and satiety centers of the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. The circuit begins with {{an area of the}} hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively. Animals with lesioned VMH will gain weight {{even in the face of}} severe restrictions imposed on their food intake, because they no longer provide the signaling needed to turn <b>off</b> <b>energy</b> storage and facilitate energy burning. In humans, the VMH is sometimes injured by ongoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or surgery or radiation to treat posterior cranial fossa tumors. With the VMH disabled and no longer responding to peripheral energy balance signals, [...] "efferent sympathetic activity drops, resulting in malaise and reduced energy expenditure, and vagal activity increases, resulting in increased insulin secretion and adipogenesis." [...] "VMH dysfunction promotes excessive caloric intake and decreased caloric expenditure, leading to continuous and unrelenting weight gain. Attempts at caloric restriction or pharmacotherapy with adrenergic or serotonergic agents have previously met with little or only brief success in treating this syndrome." [...] The vagus nerve is thought to be one key mediator of these effects, as lesions lead to chronic elevations in insulin secretion, promoting energy storage in adipocytes. Vagotomy may have an impact upon ghrelin. In an open-label, prospective study of 30 obese patients (26 women), response has been variable; the intervention has generally been safe, although adverse events have included gastric dumping syndrome (n=3), wound infection (n=2), other (n=5), and diarrhea (n=6).|$|E
