He spent much of the time with Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma reviewing each of his hits to learn how to change his game to hit within the rules. Cooke said, [...] "The way I played before was to get the biggest hit possible every time no matter what," [...] and that now in [...] "certain situations, I just approach differently. I try to get the puck more than I did before." [...] Well into the 2011–12 season, teammate Craig Adams said of Cooke's play, [...] "I've noticed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> or so, he's been feeling more comfortable being physical again, obviously, within the rules. That {{was a big part of}} his game." [...] At season's end, he had scored a career-high 19 goals and posted only 44 penalty minutes, his lowest career total in a full NHL season.|$|E
