5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, <b>one</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> about it, {{and that was}} the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E
25|$|At the February council meeting, great {{opposition}} {{was raised to}} the proposed construction of a line along Forest Road at an estimated cost of £13,000, and so the scheme was dropped. <b>One</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> which {{came out of this}} meeting was the approval for top-covering two trams experimentally, at a cost of £85 each. Cars 33 and 94 made their appearance on 9 March with Bellamy-type roofs. This type of roof was the idea of C. R. Bellamy, the Manager of Liverpool Corporation Tramways, and consisted of a box-like structure over the main saloon, without covers over the canopies at each end. On the whole they were well received and increased receipts were taken on the cars, with the result that similar modifications to further cars, believed to be four in number, were made.|$|E

500|$|Universal Music Group took extreme {{measures}} {{to prevent the}} album from leaking, offering pre-release listening sessions for critics instead of sending out review copies. However, Universal Music Australia's online music store, getmusic.com.au, accidentally released the album for digital sale on 18February 2009, almost {{two weeks before the}} scheduled release date.

U2 reacted to the leak with some positivity. The Edge stated, [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> about that is a lot of our fans have already given us their thumbs up. Even though it was fans getting it for free." ...|$|E

Ryan Staake of Pomp referred the video to as a [...] "really weird VHS/karaoke video". The video resembles a faded karaoke tape with occasional sing-along lyrics {{on the bottom of}} the screen. Robyn does not appear in the video. Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork said that the video is [...] "complete with awkward/sexy dancing and footage of bustling city life". Erika Brooks Adickman of Idolator wrote a mixed review of the clip, stating, [...] "We’re guessing Robyn didn’t want the “hassle” of appearing, so instead we’re treated to—seemingly—random grainy footage of the streets of Japan and gyrating women as the words of the chorus appear karaoke-style on the screen. We can say <b>one</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> about the flick, if you were confused about the song’s lyrics, they’re fairly easy to read." ...|$|E
