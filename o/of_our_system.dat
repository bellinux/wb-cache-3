Jackson saying in his book The Crown and Canadian Federalism that {{this is part of}} a wider ignorance about Canadian civics. While David Smith researched for his 1995 book The Invisible Crown, he found it difficult to [...] "find anyone who could talk knowledgeably about the subject". Former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson said there is [...] "an abysmal lack of knowledge about the system" [...] and Senator Lowell Murray wrote in 2003: [...] "The Crown has become irrelevant to most Canadian's understanding <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>system</b> of Government", which he attributed to the [...] "fault of successive generations of politicians, of an educational system that has never given the institution due study, and of past viceregal incumbents themselves". These comments were echoed by teacher and author Nathan Tidridge, who asserted that, beginning in the 1960s, the role of the Crown disappeared from provincial education curricula, as the general subject of civics came to receive less attention. He said Canadians are being [...] "educated to be illiterate, ambivalent, or even hostile toward our constitutional monarchy". Michael Valpy also pointed to the fact that [...] "The crown's role in the machinery of Canada's constitutional monarchy rarely sees daylight. Only a handful of times in our history has it been subjected to glaring sunshine, unfortunately resulting in a black hole of public understanding as to how it works." [...] He later iterated: [...] "the public's attention span on the constitutional intricacies of the monarchy is clinically short".|$|E
