5|$|Malcolm II {{was born}} to Kenneth II of Scotland. He was {{grandson}} of Malcolm I of Scotland. In 997, the killer of Constantine is credited as being Kenneth, son of Malcolm. Since there is no known and relevant Kenneth alive at that time (King Kenneth having died in 995), it is considered an error for either Kenneth III, who succeeded Constantine, or, possibly, Malcolm himself, the son of Kenneth II. Whether Malcolm killed Constantine <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no doubt that in 1005 he killed Constantine's successor Kenneth III in battle at Monzievaird in Strathearn.|$|E
5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the controversies}} facing bite mark {{analysis}} {{are due to}} the lack of empirical supporting evidence. When searching the entire MedLine database from 1960–1999, only 50 papers in English were found that related to bite mark analysis. Of these 50 papers, most of which were published in the 1980s, only 8% came from well designed experimentation providing empirical data. The lack of research has led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis. This brings into question whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> enough scientific support for bite mark analysis to be employed in court.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{aspects of}} using a living trust {{as opposed to a}} will and probate include upfront legal expenses, the expense of trust administration, and a lack of certain safeguards. The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the {{one-time}} probate cost of 1 to 4% for probate, which applies whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a drafted will. Unlike trusts, wills must be signed by two to three witnesses, the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed. Legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedent's assets from mismanagement or embezzlement, such as requirements of bonding, insurance, and itemized accountings of probate assets.|$|E
25|$|After Big Brother {{revealed}} to the other housemates that Michael was the Insider, and that the Reuben story was pure fiction, Michael faced a strong backlash from several housemates angry at being duped in this way, especially from Anna who had little contact with her father. It was revealed on Michael's eviction night that Reuben {{is the name of}} one of Michael's real life friends. Despite no longer being the Insider, Michael continued to cause conflict in Week 5, hiding cutlery as well as hiding the housemates' toothbrushes from them, never revealing their locations even after he had been evicted, attempting to create doubts as to whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> another insider inside the house besides Michael. He was the 5th housemate to be evicted from the house on Day 36, with 20% of the merged vote.|$|E

25|$|The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States {{copyright}} law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes {{production and dissemination}} of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet. Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and {{signed into law by}} President Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users.|$|E
25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics have}} focused on the role of David as planner of Solomon's Temple and his {{possible}} role with the Freemasons. Although it is not known for sure whether Christopher was a Freemason <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> evidence suggesting that he was either part of the organisation or had a strong knowledge of its belief system. Based on personal admittance to contributing to A Defence of Freemasonry, contemporary verification of his participation in the volume and with Masonic meetings, there is enough to confirm [...] "his participation in Masonic affairs." [...] Furthermore, there are accounts of Smart attending meetings at the Bell Tavern in Westminster. The information available has led Marie Roberts to declare in her 1986 book British Poets and Secret Societies, [...] "It has been universally accepted by scholars that Christopher Smart... was a Freemason yet no record of his membership has been traced." [...] However, in the notes to Chris Mounsey's 2001 book Christopher Smart: Clown of God, Marie Roberts' 1986 book is referred to as [...] "an account of Smart's work which accepts his association with the Freemasons," [...] but in Mounsey's view, [...] "Since neither Smart's name nor his pseudonyms appear in the records of the Freemasons, it is highly unlikely he was ever one of their number." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{originally}} {{written and}} shot, when Apollo (Jamie Bamber) fires on the Olympic Carrier, {{it was made}} clear that he sees people inside.

[...] This was an [...] "enormous fight" [...] between Moore and the network, with the latter feeling this was another scene that was [...] "too dark" [...] and had the potential to turn away audiences; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact, they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order.
