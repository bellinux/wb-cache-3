5|$|Historical {{parallelism}} and {{the tradition}} of drawing inspiration from the Middle Ages have become keystones of Islamic ideology. Secular Arab Nationalism concentrates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Western Imperialism. Gamal Abdel Nasser likened himself to Saladin and imperialism to the Crusades. In his History of the Crusades Sa'id Ashur emphasised the similarity between the modern and medieval situation facing Muslims {{and the need to}} study the Crusades in depth. Sayyid Qutb declared there was an international Crusader conspiracy. The ideas of Jihad and a long struggle have developed some currency.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, {{it has been argued that}} Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|Vienne and Perez held several {{meetings}} on the track, one {{including the first}} appearance in France by the American sprinter Major Taylor, and then looked for further ideas. In February 1896 they hit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented two problems. The first was that the biggest races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix might be too provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.|$|E

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> escaping from life {{when it becomes}} too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing {{a picture of a}} grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Doomsday is a 2008 {{science fiction}} action horror film written and {{directed}} by Neil Marshall. The film takes place in the future in Scotland, which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in London, political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including Mad Max, Escape from New York and 28 Days Later.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, MGM was keen on remaking Grand Hotel (1932), {{and hoped}} to lure Grant into {{coming out of}} {{retirement}} to star. Hitchcock had long {{wanted to make a}} film based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Hamlet, with Grant in the lead role. Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to try to get him {{to play the role of}} Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait (1978), which eventually went to James Mason. Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in A Touch of Class (1973), The Verdict (1982) and a film adaptation of William Goldman's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade.|$|E

5|$|Madonna trained {{physically}} doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage.|$|E
5|$|The Paramount Television Network aired several programs, {{including}} the Emmy Award-winning children's series Time for Beany. Filmed in Hollywood, the programs {{were distributed to}} an ad-hoc network of stations across the United States. The network signed affiliation agreements with more than 50 television stations in 1950; despite this, most of Paramount's series were not widely viewed outside the West Coast. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which filed suit against Paramount for anti-trust violations, prevented the studio from acquiring additional television stations. Paramount executives eventually gave up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a television network, and continued to produce series for other networks. In 1995, after four decades of television production for other companies, Paramount re-entered the broadcast network field when the company and Chris-Craft Industries launched the United Paramount Network (UPN), a television network that operated until 2006. Paramount's television division is now owned by CBS Television Studios.|$|E
5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in between life and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E

5|$|Typically, such {{models are}} based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, {{physicists}} postulate a shape {{for the extra}} dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles, usually supersymmetric partners to analogues of known particles. One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is {{to start with the}} heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. This is a special kind of geometric object named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau. Calabi–Yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.|$|E
5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not to stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of high {{resolution}} imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is {{in contact with the}} heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface {{like the rest of the}} drop. In theory, it should follow the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line hinges <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.|$|E
