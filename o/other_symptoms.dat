5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>symptoms</b> include: headache, {{nausea and}} vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, {{the latter being}} an uncommon but highly specific finding.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, <b>other</b> <b>symptoms,</b> such as ataxia, tremor or sensory losses, do {{not have}} proven treatments.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. <b>Other</b> <b>symptoms</b> include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF {{can sometimes be}} felt or observed as a discharge from the nose or ear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Others</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{caused by}} an altered action of MCD can be {{abdominal}} pain and chronic constipation.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} stage <b>others</b> <b>symptoms</b> may occur: hyperthermia, {{increased}} muscle tone, spastic paralysis, choreic dyskinesias and coma.|$|R
50|$|Eczema {{should not}} be treated with oral antibiotics. Dry skin can be treated with lotions or <b>other</b> <b>symptom</b> treatments.|$|R
5|$|Both {{drug therapy}} and neurorehabilitation have shown {{to ease the}} burden of some symptoms, even though neither {{influence}} disease progression. For <b>other</b> <b>symptoms</b> the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is {{an altered}} level of consciousness {{as a result}} of liver failure. Onset may be gradual or sudden. <b>Other</b> <b>symptoms</b> may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages it can result in a coma.|$|E
5|$|If {{cerebral}} edema {{is suspected}} because of confusion, recurrent vomiting or <b>other</b> <b>symptoms,</b> computed tomography may be performed to assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as stroke.|$|E
40|$|Impairment {{of insight}} is {{considered}} as {{the hallmark of}} schizophrenia. Substantial proportion of patients with schizophrenia has either poor or absent insight. Insight is a multidimensional and dynamic construct which appears to have intricate links with <b>other</b> <b>symptom</b> dimensions of the psychotic illness. A better appreciation of the association that insight shares with <b>other</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters in psychosis could help us in gaining knowledge about aetiology, prognosis and treatment-related facets of the disorder. This {{is likely to have}} critical implications in the understanding and therapeutics of schizophrenia...|$|R
25|$|International {{pacemaker}} patient identification cards carry {{information such}} as patient data (among <b>others,</b> <b>symptom</b> primary, ECG, cause), pacemaker center (doctor, hospital), IPG (rate, mode, date of implantation, manufacturer, type) and lead type.|$|R
50|$|<b>Others</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{may also}} exist {{that are related}} to an {{increase}} in intracranial pressure. These symptoms seem to be present regardless of the malignancy of the melanin deposits within the central nervous system.|$|R
5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} {{uric acid}} levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result in}} <b>other</b> <b>symptoms,</b> including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|Venous sinus stenoses {{leading to}} venous {{hypertension}} appear {{to play a}} significant part in relation to raised ICP, and stenting of a transverse sinus may resolve venous hypertension, leading to improved CSF resorption, decreased ICP, cure of papilloedema and <b>other</b> <b>symptoms</b> of IIH.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with <b>other</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{and signs of}} liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} {{generally}} {{believed to have}} been bubonic plague, an infection by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, transmitted via a rat vector. <b>Other</b> <b>symptom</b> patterns of the bubonic plague, such as septicemic plague and pneumonic plague were also present.|$|R
30|$|The {{data on the}} {{symptoms}} experienced before death, absence of fetal movements was the primary symptom described (19.46 %) in the obits group; dyspnea and <b>other</b> respiratory <b>symptoms</b> in newborns and infants/toddlers (55.76 % and 56.66 % respectively); in children, adolescents, and young adults, headache and <b>other</b> neurologic <b>symptoms</b> (6.8 %) and in subjects 40  years or older symptoms were headache (17.39 %), followed by dyspnea and <b>other</b> respiratory <b>symptoms</b> (16.03 %); 149 (19.94 %) cases {{did not have any}} recorded data.|$|R

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. <b>Other</b> <b>symptoms</b> include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. <b>Other</b> <b>symptoms</b> may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, then-presidential {{candidate}} Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine was poisoned {{with a large}} dose of TCDD. His blood TCDD concentration {{was measured}} 108,000 pg/g of fat, which is the second highest ever measured. This concentration implies a dose exceeding 2mg, or 25 μg/kg of body weight. Also he suffered from chloracne for many years, but again after initial malaise, <b>other</b> <b>symptoms</b> or abnormal laboratory findings were few.|$|E

5|$|Meningitis is {{an acute}} {{inflammation}} of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. <b>Other</b> <b>symptoms</b> include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may {{be accompanied by a}} characteristic rash.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). <b>Other</b> <b>symptoms</b> present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of all of}} these hallmarks is not needed for a diagnosis. A clinical diagnosis is considered made when, with lentigines present there are 2 <b>other</b> <b>symptoms</b> observed, such as ECG abnormalities and ocular hypertelorism, or without lentigines, 3 of the above conditions are present, with a first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, sibling) with a clinical diagnosis.|$|E

For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and <b>other</b> <b>symptoms,</b> particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of Darwin's illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), {{and it may be}} the first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among <b>other</b> <b>symptoms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three {{days later}} Edwards likely killed Günter Steinhausen, {{a friend of}} Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt was posted missing in action. These {{personal}} losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in the last weeks of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent sleepwalking at night and <b>other</b> <b>symptoms</b> that {{could be construed as}} posttraumatic stress disorder.
