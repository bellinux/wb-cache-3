40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{traveling}} curved fronts by a {{mean curvature}} flow with constant driving force are studied. In the two-dimensional Euclidean space, the classification <b>of</b> all <b>traveling</b> fronts is completely carried out. It is proved that if the interface is a traveling front, {{then there are the}} following three possibilities: a line, a stationary circle, and a family <b>of</b> some <b>traveling</b> curved fronts. The explicit forms <b>of</b> all <b>traveling</b> curved fronts <b>of</b> this family are also obtained. It is proved that all traveling fronts can be represented by the graph except for stationary circles. Moreover we classify <b>of</b> all <b>traveling</b> fronts in the half plane with a prescribed contact angle on the boundary. For higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, the existence <b>of</b> rotationally symmetric <b>traveling</b> curved fronts is obtained. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{works have}} {{indicated}} {{the relationships between}} polynomially solvable combinatorial optimization problems and the core non-emptiness of cooperative games associated with them, and between intractable combinatorial optimization problems and the hardness of the problem to decide the core non-emptiness of the associated games. In this paper, we study the core <b>of</b> a <b>traveling</b> salesman game, which {{is associated with the}} traveling salesman problem. First, we show that in general the problem to test the core non-emptiness <b>of</b> a given <b>traveling</b> salesman game is NP-hard. This corresponds to the NP-hardness <b>of</b> the <b>traveling</b> salesman problem. Second, we show that the core <b>of</b> a <b>traveling</b> salesman game is non-empty if the distance matrix is a symmetric Monge matrix, and also that a traveling salesman game is submodular (or concave) if the distance matrix is a Kalmanson matrix. These correspond {{to the fact that the}} Monge property and the Kalmanson property are polynomially solvable special cases <b>of</b> the <b>traveling</b> salesman problem...|$|R

5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way <b>of</b> <b>traveling</b> made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed.
