25|$|An evocative {{description}} {{exists in}} words from 1867: ″Look at the dapper little fellow, how neatly {{he sits on}} the back of the old American horse, Reporter. Notice the jerry-hat, the open but determined, never-say-die, countenance, the polished boots, the burnished spurs, the tight-fitting breeches, the long waistcoat, creaseless coat, and general ′get-up′ of that wiry-looking, ten-stone, five-feet-five specimen of humanity, and tell me if he is a ′character′ when once seen that will never be forgotten.″ Charlie Canavan differs <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> - he states his weight 'when at man's age' did not exceed 9stone (126lb or 57kg).|$|E
25|$|After many years, Asad {{was again}} invited by another President of Pakistan, General Zia ul-Haq, in 1983 {{and that was}} his last visit to this country. When he arrived at Islamabad, which {{he had not yet}} seen, he was {{received}} at the plane with great honour and escorted to the Presidency. During his sojourn in Islamabad, there was a series of meetings with members of the Ansari Commission in order to prepare a kind of programme for the President for the future. Asad agreed with some, and as usual disagreed with others, which he found retrograde. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> he was firm and insistent that Muslim women should have exactly the same rights in the political sphere as had men, to the extent of becoming Prime Minister. Asad also spared some time to meet with his surviving friends in Lahore and Islamabad and {{at the request of the}} President made several radio and television appearances, as always spontaneous. On his return, he was besieged by letters from literally hundreds of admirers in Pakistan, offering him land, a house, everything but he refused politely, as his concept of Pakistan was beyond all these worldly trivialities.|$|E
500|$|Now, though, having irreparably {{destroyed}} his reputation and ties with both papal courts, Paul {{was left with}} no option other than to return to Constantinople. In 1394, {{he was back in}} the Byzantine capital, where he appeared before Patriarch Antony IV, before whom he confessed his sins, abjured his conversion to Catholicism, and pleaded for mercy. As Nicol writes, [...] "Only <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> did he protest that he had been wrongfully accused; for, despite rumours and tales contrived against him, he had never indulged in fornication, miracle-mongering, or the practice of magic". The Patriarch passed Paul's case on to the full patriarchal synod, before which Paul was obliged to repeat his confession twice, and then once more before an assembly of the people. The records of these sessions, kept by the patriarchal scribe Perdikes, are the main source on Paul's life. The final portion of the manuscript, containing the verdict, is missing, but both the synod and the people had recommended a pardon, so it is likely that he was forgiven. His subsequent life is unknown.|$|E

500|$|Edward Lycett Green, {{described}} by Havers, Grayson and Shankland as [...] "the emotional {{force behind the}} accusations", was next in the witness box. Although Lycett Green had not played on the first night, Clarke considered him a potentially dangerous witness who was capable of giving vital evidence. Lycett Green stated {{that he had seen}} Gordon-Cumming twice push counters over the chalk line when he should not have done so; he had considered accusing Gordon-Cumming at the time, but decided against it because he [...] "did not like to make a scene before ladies". At points in the examination by Asquith, Lycett Green contradicted the course of events outlined by Stanley Wilson—which Levett had also done—and <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> regarding a question the prince put to Levett; his answer was [...] "highly suspect". Havers, Grayson and Shankland later wrote that [...] "it is remarkable that he, the prime mover in the affair, seemed unable to say anything without qualifying it with some such remark as, 'I don't exactly remember'... The hedging by the principal accuser certainly weakens the defendants' case". They also thought that [...] "is refusal to remember anything was obviously humbug, a deliberate policy".|$|E

2500|$|Ironically, Irish Catholics and FitzGibbon agreed <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> {{apparently}} - Irish {{political and}} economic union with Great Britain (which eventually took place in 1801). Pitt had wanted Union with Ireland concomitantly with Catholic emancipation, commutation of tithes, and the endowment of the Irish Catholic priesthood. Union was opposed by most hardline Irish Protestants, as well as liberals such as Grattan. FitzGibbon had been {{a strong supporter of}} Union since 1793, but refused to have Catholic emancipation with the Union. [...] In the end, FitzGibbon's views won out, leading to the Union of Ireland with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland without any further privileges for Ireland's Catholic majority (or for that matter, Catholics {{in the rest of the}} new United Kingdom). FitzGibbon later claimed that he had been duped by the way in which the Act was passed (by the new Viceroy Lord Cornwallis promising reforms to Irish Catholics), and was bitterly opposed to any concessions during the short remainder of his life.|$|E
2500|$|Irwin's early {{experiments}} tested participants {{ability to}} identify random dot patterns as the same, or as different across saccades. The control condition for this experiment presented dot patterns in the same spatial location without saccades, meaning participants had a single fixation point. [...] A no-overlap control condition presented dot patterns in different spatial locations, while participants maintained fixation <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> This tested the ability of visual short-term memory in identifying two individual patterns. The experimental condition showed dot patterns in the same spatial location but were viewed at separate fixations, forcing the use of transsaccadic memory. For the experimental condition, participants underwent a calibration phase, where they were shown five points in separate location to fixate on individually, for less than two seconds. The next phase presented a single fixation point for less than two seconds, which {{was followed by a}} random dot pattern presented in a different location, acting as a saccade target. The dot pattern disappeared when the saccade was initiated. Another dot pattern then appeared in the same location. Participants had to identify whether the two patterns were the same or different.|$|E
2500|$|In England that {{familiar}} style known as Elizabethan and Jacobean prevailed throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. At {{the present time}} hardly {{a home in the}} land has not its old oak chest carved with the familiar half circle or scroll border along the top rail, or the arch pattern on the panels. The court cupboards, with their solid or open under parts and upper cornice supported by turned balusters of extravagant thickness, are to be seen wherever one goes. And chairs, real as well as spurious, with solid backs carved in the usual flat relief, are bought up with an avidity inseparable from fashion. Four-post bedsteads are harder to come by. The back is usually broken up into small panels and carved, the best effect being seen in those examples where the paneling or the framework only is decorated. The dining-hall tables often had six legs of great substance, which were turned somewhat after the shape of a covered cup, and were carved with foliage bearing a distant resemblance to the acanthus. Rooms were generally panelled with oak, sometimes divided at intervals by flat pilasters and the upper frieze carved with scroll work or dolphins. But the feature which distinguished the period was the fire mantle. It always must be the principal object in a room, and the Elizabethan carver fully appreciated this fact. By carving the chimney breast as a rule to the ceiling and covering the surrounding walls with more or less plain paneling, the designer, by thus concentrating the attention <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> often produced results of a high order. Caryatid figures, pilasters and friezes were among the customary details employed to produce good effects. No finer example exists than that lately removed from the old palace at Bromley-by-Bow to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The mantelshelf is [...] from the ground and consists of a deep quadrant mould decorated with flat scroll work of good design. The supporting pilasters on either side are shaped and moulded in the customary Jacobean manner and are crowned by busts with Ionic capitals on the heads. Above the shelf the large center panel is deeply carved with the royal coat of arms with supporters and mantling, and on either side a semicircular arched niche contains a figure in classic dress. The Elizabethan carver often produced splendid staircases, sometimes carving the newel posts with heraldic figures bearing coats of arms, etc. The newels of a staircase at Highgate support different types of Cromwellian soldiers, carved with great vivacity and life. But in spite of excellent work, as for example the beautiful gallery at Hatfield, the carving of this period did not, so far as England was concerned, compare with other epochs, or with contemporary work in other parts of Europe. Much of the work is badly drawn and badly executed. It is true that good decorative effects were constantly obtained at the very minimum of cost, {{but it is difficult to}} discover much merit in work which really looks best when badly cut.|$|E
50|$|Donnchadh died {{some time}} between 1693 and 1704. Many local traditions {{grew up around}} his death by {{drowning}} in the river Chonaig, near Dorusduain: {{it is said that}} he was returning from a visit to the Chisholm to purchase the lands of Affric, and that the deeds to Affric were lost in the incident (conveniently or inconveniently, depending <b>on</b> <b>one's</b> <b>point</b> of view).|$|R
