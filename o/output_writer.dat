5000|$|The NCR 315 Data Processing System, {{released}} in January 1962 by NCR, was a second-generation computer. All {{printed circuit boards}} used resistor-transistor logic to create the various logic elements. It used 12-bit slab memory structure using core memory. The instructions could use a memory slab as either two 6-bit alphanumeric characters or as three 4-bit BCD characters. Basic memory was 5000 [...] "slabs" [...] of handmade core memory, which was expandable {{to a maximum of}} 40,000 slabs in four refrigerator-size cabinets. The main processor included three cabinets and a console section that housed the power supply, keyboard, <b>output</b> <b>writer</b> (an IBM electric typewriter), and a panel of lights that indicated the current status of the program counter, registers, arithmetic accumulator, and system errors. Input/Output was by direct parallel connections to each type of peripheral through a two-cable bundle with 1-inch-thick cables. Some devices like magnetic tape and the CRAM were daisy-chained to allow multiple drives to be connected.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the novel Podróż w krainę dzieciństwa by Horst Bienek in the context of memory studies. It {{indicates}} how mnemonic conceptions are intertwined with the issue of the reminiscence and correlated with the writing technique called "poetic realism" by the author himself. The analysis is based on both the "cultural memory" theory introduced by Jan and Aleida Assmann and Maurice Halbwachs’ theory on "collective memory". The memory issues are strongly associated with the question of identity as well as with the manner of presentation of the urban space. In this view, one may expand the research by means of connecting the individual memory with the various texts of culture known to Bienek. Such an approach to Podróż w krainę dzieciństwa sheds new light on the literary <b>output</b> of the <b>writer</b> from Gliwice and provokes thoughts on the way the memory functions, not only in Bienek’s reminiscent novels, but also in his other works...|$|R

How a writer bears witness to his age is {{necessarily}} {{the expression of}} many things, not least the possibly quite peculiar nature of an author’s life. Literary works often emerge from complex upbringings, from periods of youthful isolation spent reading and writing. More still {{seem to have been}} written {{as a result of the}} fraught relationships that befall authors, perhaps because authors so often view their relationships with a degree of creative and critical distance. And yet, if a <b>writer’s</b> <b>output</b> evidences an unusual life, it also witnesses broader questions being asked by a community as a whole. At some level, even the most remarkable figures are typical of their age, and reflections of it. By the close of Paul Binding’s study of the life and works of Hans Christian Andersen (1805 – 75), we are reminded that extraordinary feats of originality and imagination are often the result of how unique minds enter wider discourses [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Mackiewicz's prose is {{extremely}} realistic: {{he believed that}} there are no untouchable subjects in writing. In 1957, he published Kontra, a narrative account of the particularly brutal and treacherous handover of thousands of anti-Soviet Cossacks back to the Soviets by the British soldiers in Austria; and in 1962 Sprawa pulkownika Miasojedowa ("Colonel Miasoyedov's Case"), a harshly realistic novel of the bombing of Dresden in World War II. His other best-known novels include: Droga donikąd ("The Road to Nowhere"), an account of life under Soviet occupation; Zwycięstwo prowokacji ("Victory of Provocation") on communism; and W cieniu krzyża ("In the Shadow of the Cross") on Catholicism. His voluminous <b>output</b> as a <b>writer</b> of fiction and a publicist has been undergoing a revival after many years of underground publishing and later marginal interest.
