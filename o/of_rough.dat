5|$|Due to its slow motion, Beryl dropped heavy {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}}, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island in Alabama. The rainfall caused some reports of flooding, while prolonged durations <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> waves resulted in severe beach erosion. The waves capsized a boat in Mobile Bay, killing {{one of its}} passengers. Overall damage was minor, totaling about $3million (1988USD, $5.46million 2009USD).|$|E
5|$|Early beefsteaks {{were held}} in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on crates and eating with their fingers off <b>of</b> <b>rough,</b> improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or {{residential}} basements. Food and drink were {{the focus of the}} evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of those present telling stories and singing amongst themselves. Brass bands were sometimes hired.|$|E
5|$|The Kimberley Process was {{developed}} to monitor the trade in rough diamonds and prevent their being used to fund violence.

5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning and weaving began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished cloth. At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, several {{ships were}} {{caught off guard}} by the late arrival of Jeanne. The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico, and two barges broke loose from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves. One barge was an oil rig tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, {{and there were no}} maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} area planted, the arable crops grown in Wales were: foods for stock-feeding, spring barley, wheat, maize, winter barley, other cereals for combining, oilseed rape, {{potatoes}} and other crops. The grassland was predominantly permanent pasture, with only 10% of the grassland being under five years old. Compared with {{other parts of}} the United Kingdom, Wales has the smallest percentage of arable land (6%), and a considerably smaller area <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> grazing and hill land than Scotland (27% against 62%).|$|E
5|$|Khaba is {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} built the Layer Pyramid, located at Zawyet el'Aryan, about 8km south-west of Giza. The pyramid's construction is typical of Third Dynasty masonry with mudbricks arranged in layers around a core made <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> blocks from the local bedrock. The pyramid was planned to be about 42 to 45 meters tall, but is now only 17 meters. It is unclear whether part of the pyramid has been eroded over time or its construction was never finished. While there are no inscriptions directly relating the pyramid to Khaba, his serekh appears on stone bowls that were discovered in a nearby mastaba, known as Mastaba Z500.|$|E

From there they could be transferred to provincial authorities at Hangzhou and finally to the empire's capital of Beijing where the party could be officially escorted back to Korea. Choe Bu and his officers were carried in sedan chairs, an accommodation provided by the Taizhou Battalion, although in spots <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> terrain Choe Bu and his officers were forced to walk on foot like the others.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} of the tel {{has revealed}} a small settlement, {{the only one}} of that period in eastern Arabia, on its northern side. It has been inferred that the village was settled by people who developed agriculture near the oasis, planted palm trees, tended cattle, sheep and goats and also ventured into fishing in the Arabian Sea. The small houses they built were made <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> stone with clay or mortar as binding material. The plastered floors in the houses were said to have been spacious. Excavations also hinted that the village had streets which separated the housing complexes.|$|E
5|$|The first British Isles side (now {{known as}} the British and Irish Lions) toured New Zealand and Australia in 1888. The side was privately organised, without the {{sanction}} or prohibition of England's Rugby Football Union, and toured New Zealand in April and May that year where they played against a number of provincial sides. Although the team was not representative of the best British and Irish players, it did include three internationals with the rest predominantly county representatives. Warbrick was in the Wellington team that faced the tourists on 13 May. The match was ill-tempered, with each side accusing the other <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> play, and eventually finished as a 3â€“3 draw.|$|E

5|$|These {{and other}} {{continuing}} fan activities eventually persuaded Universal Studios {{to produce a}} feature film, Serenity. (The title of Serenity was chosen, according to Whedon, because Fox still owned {{the rights to the}} name 'Firefly'). Numerous early screenings <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> film cuts were held for existing fans starting in May 2005 as an attempt to create a buzz to increase ticket sales when the final film cut was released widely on September 30, 2005. The film was not as commercially successful as fans had hoped, opening at number two and making only $40 million worldwide during its initial theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|After reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a hurricane in the eastern Atlantic, the Weather Bureau warned shipping lanes in the storm's path. Small craft warnings were issued for offshore areas from Block Island, Rhode Island south to Savannah, Georgia on September7 due to the threat <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> seas. After Carrie stalled on September11, the Weather Bureau gave Florida a slight chance of being affected by the storm, but the possibilities of the storm affecting the peninsula decreased after the hurricane curved northwards. After the storm was forecast to potentially impact Bermuda, schools were closed in preparation for Carrie, while vessels were warned of the oncoming hurricane. Most planes in Kindley Air Force Base on the island were evacuated, with the remaining planes weighted down by sandbags. After passing Bermuda, the storm was forecast to strike Nova Scotia, but instead Carrie curved towards the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planesâ€”weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bondsâ€”along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
