25|$|The {{growing number}} of people living to their 80s and 90s in the {{developed}} world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, persons older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10 to 20 years. <b>Other</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different types of services.|$|E
25|$|The book The Dance of Change states {{there are}} many reasons why an {{organization}} may have trouble in transforming itself into a learning organization.

The team {{may not be able to}} commit the time if an institution does not have the appropriate help or training. For an organization to be able to change, it needs to know the steps necessary to solve the problems it faces. As a solution, a mentor or coach who is well versed in the learning organization concept may be necessary.|$|E

500|$|Reactivating the {{battleship}}s {{would require}} {{a wide range of}} battleship modernization improvements, according to the navy's program management office. At a minimum, these modernization improvements include command and control, communications, computers, and intelligence equipment; environmental protection (including ozone-depleting substances); a plastic-waste processor; pulper/shredder and wastewater alterations; firefighting/fire safety and women-at-sea alterations; a modernized sensor suite (air and surface search radar); and new combat and self-defense systems. The navy's program management office also identified <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> would strongly discourage the Navy from reactivating and modernizing the battleships. For example, personnel needed to operate the battleships would be extensive, and the skills needed may not be available or easily reconstituted.

All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.'

However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{international}} observers noted {{issues in}} several human rights areas. Excessive force {{was seen to}} be used by police forces, security forces were able to act with impunity, mob violence was occasionally seen, and prison conditions continued to be harsh and sometimes life-threatening. However, the government was seen to make some effort to prosecute security forces who used excessive force. Other legal issues included limits on free speech and freedom of the press, lengthy pretrial detentions, and arbitrary arrests and detentions. Societal issues found included violence against women, human trafficking, and child labour. Corruption within the government is seen as a major issue, despite the Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau's (ACB) attempts to reduce it. The ACB appears to be successful at finding and prosecuting low level corruption, but higher level officials appear to be able to act with impunity. Corruption within security forces is also an issue. Malawi had one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. In 2015 Malawi raised the legal age for marriage from 15 to 18. <b>Other</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> have been raised are lack of adequate legal protection of women from sexual abuse and harassment, very high maternal mortality rate, and abuse related to accusations of witchcraft.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to improve the size or the shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable. Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position.

Virtually all of the PCs' support in western Canada, particularly in rural areas, transferred to Reform.

Nevertheless, the Liberals reckoned Reform as their main opposition on all <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> were not specific to Quebec.

2500|$|Creation and {{manipulation}} of front groups or infiltration of existing organizations. While the Communist {{presence in the}} [...] "united Front" [...] against the US/GVN was no secret, VC operatives took pains to screen {{the full extent of}} their influence, and stressed patriotism, anti-foreign sentiment, local grievances and <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> could mobilize support. Integral to this process was the creation of [...] "front" [...] groups to mask the true VC agenda. Such groups lent an aura of populist spontaneity and voluntarism while the VC worked them behind the scenes. Such entities could be seemingly innocuous farming cooperatives, or cultural groups, or anything in between. Party members either manipulated these new groups behind the scenes or infiltrated existing ones and gradually took over or influenced them towards the VC line. The goal was to enmesh {{as many people as possible}} in some group which could then be manipulated. Thus for example a traditional, apolitical rice harvest festival would be eventually twisted into mobilizing demonstrations against a government official or policy. Members of a farming cooperative might be persuaded into signing a petition against construction of an airfield. Whatever the exact front, issue, or cover used, the goal was control {{and manipulation}} of the target population.|$|E

[...] He concluded [...] "the game is a strong and rather noticeable improvement over the original release, though much of it does feel outdated on the PlayStation 3. EA has done a great job of expanding nearly every facet of the game, [...] with last-gen visuals, a frustrating city layout and <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> plagued the original release, it's still far from perfect." [...] Game Informers Matt Helgeson also scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "it still doesn't solve the problems I have with the game as a whole, which remain largely the same." [...] He concluded [...] "The Godfathers uninspired craftsmanship falls short of being a truly compelling game experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Through {{cases such as}} Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, Talton v. Mayes, Winters vs. United States, United States v. Winans, United States v. Nice, and United States v. Sandoval {{the court}} set many {{precedents}} and provided building blocks {{for much of the}} new legislation concerning Native Americans. One of the basic decisions that had to be made in most of these cases was how to classify the Indian nations and what rights they were to have. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock provides an excellent example of the implementation of the paternal view of Native Americans as it refers back to the idea of Indians as [...] "wards of the nation." [...] Some <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> came into play were the hunting and fishing rights of the natives, especially when land beyond theirs affected their own practices, whether or not Constitutional rights necessarily applied to Indians, and whether tribal governments had the power to establish their own laws. As new legislation tried to force the American Indians into becoming just Americans, the Supreme Court provided these critical decisions. [...] Native American nations were labeled [...] "domestic dependent nations" [...] by Marshall in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, one of the first landmark cases involving Indians. Some decisions focused more on the dependency of the tribes, while others preserved tribal sovereignty, while still others sometimes managed to do both.|$|E
