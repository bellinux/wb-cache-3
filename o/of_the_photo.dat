5|$|Hexagonal BN {{is used in}} xerographic {{process and}} laser {{printers}} as a charge leakage barrier layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> drum. In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing oxygen sensors, which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo,</b> {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} its premiere in Milan, Cannibal Holocaust was confiscated under {{the orders of}} a local magistrate, and Ruggero Deodato {{was arrested and charged}} with obscenity. As all copies were to be turned over to the authorities, the film was {{distributed}} internationally via subterfuge. In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in France, the magazine Photo suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made Cannibal Holocaust a snuff film. Following the publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Photo</b> article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.|$|E
5|$|The figure {{arrives at}} Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has {{strapped}} a camera to Valestra's corpse {{and sees the}} murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted {{by the police and}} rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains that she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had embezzled money; her father repaid, but they put out a hit on him. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves and presses him for information; Reeves insists that Batman is the cloaked killer. He professes his ignorance but Joker believes Reeves needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape and told Valestra's mob their location.|$|E

Al Jazeera could not verify <b>the</b> authenticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photographs. It had obtained them from Tamils who said they had obtained <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> from someone in the Sri Lankan military. The Sri Lankan government reacted by calling <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> lies and fabrications. It claimed that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> were <b>the</b> same as those broadcast by Channel 4 News in May 2010.

5|$|The book on Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photos,</b> but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goahtis, and <b>the</b> richness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era.|$|R

Only 10 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> need to be annotated by spontaneous speech of a few words regarding one or two semantic categories (e. g. what or where), while all photos can be effectively retrieved using high-level semantic queries in words (e. g. who, what, where, when) and clustered by the semantics as well. We use low-level image features to construct <b>the</b> relationships among <b>photos,</b> but train semantic models using Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) based on fused speech and image features to derive <b>the</b> “topics ” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photos.</b> <b>The</b> sparse speech annotations serve as the user interface for <b>the</b> whole personal <b>photo</b> archive, while photos not annotated are automatically related by fused features and semantic topics of PLSA...|$|R

To this end, laser scanners in conjunction with registered cameras are used to gather both the geometric and the color information.

The color mapping for high-quality reconstructions <b>of</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> models is not without problems. In practice, <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> overlap.
