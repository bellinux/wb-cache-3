5|$|A later popular Polish legend {{related to}} the history of the Polish {{coronation}} weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Bolesław's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Bolesław notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend.|$|E
5|$|Pflueger's {{social and}} {{business}} connections spanned the city, including three private men's clubs which he joined: the Bohemian Club, the Olympic Club and The Family. He designed buildings and interior architecture {{for the latter}} two. Pflueger was highly placed in several important planning organizations: He {{was the chairman of}} a committee of consulting architects on the Bay Bridge project and he served on the committee responsible for the design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> International Exposition in 1939. Pflueger was {{a board member of the}} San Francisco Art Association starting in 1930, and served variously as chair and director. While on the board, Pflueger helped the organization found the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA).|$|E

5|$|Zorin, who {{had escaped}} in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton, but Bond {{grabs hold of}} the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the {{framework}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Bridge. Sutton attacks Zorin, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin pursues them with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death {{in the waters of}} San Francisco Bay. An enraged Mortner attacks Bond using sticks of dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship cable free, which causes Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin. The dynamite explodes, killing Mortner and Scarpine and destroying the airship. General Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's strategy. Afterwards, Bond and Sutton make love in the shower of the Sutton home.|$|E
5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E
5|$|During the 1929 {{stock market}} crash and {{subsequent}} economic depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed, while the region attempted to spur job growth by simultaneously undertaking two large infrastructure projects: construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay. After the United States joined World War II in 1941, the Bay Area became a major domestic military and naval hub, with large shipyards constructed in Sausalito and across the East Bay to build ships for the war effort, and Fort Mason acting the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, the United Nations was chartered in San Francisco to help prevent the kind of devastation that occurred over the past decade, and on September 1951, Japan officially surrendered to the Allied forces in San Francisco, with the Treaty of San Francisco entering into force a year later. In the years immediately following the war, the Bay Area saw a huge wave of immigration as populations increased across the region. Between 1950 and 1960, San Francisco welcomed over 100,000 new residents, inland suburbs in the East Bay saw their populations double, Daly City's population quadrupled, and Santa Clara's population quintupled.|$|E

5|$|The Bay Area hosts an {{extensive}} freeway and highway {{system that is}} particularly prone to traffic congestion, with one study by Inrix concluding that the Bay Area's traffic was the fourth worst in the world. There are some city streets in San Francisco where gaps occur in the freeway system, partly {{the result of the}} Freeway Revolt, which prevented a freeway-only thoroughfare through San Francisco between the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the western terminus of Interstate 80, and the southern terminus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Bridge (U.S. Route 101). Additional damage that occurred {{in the wake of the}} 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake resulted in freeway segments being removed instead of being reinforced or rebuilt, leading to the revitalization of neighborhoods such as San Francisco's Embarcadero. The greater Bay Area contains the three principal north-south highways in California: Interstate 5, U.S. Route 101, and California State Route 1. U.S. 101 and State Route 1 directly serve the traditional nine-county region, while Interstate 5 bypasses to the east in San Joaquin County to provide a more direct Los Angeles–Sacramento route. Additional local highways connect the various subregions of the Bay Area together.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{planning}} for BART {{began with the}} setting up in 1957 of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based special-purpose district body that governs the BART system. The district initially began with five members, {{all of which were}} projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, Contra Costa County, the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, and Marin County. Though invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART in 1957, preferring instead to concentrate on building expressways. In 1962 San Mateo County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents. The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo's departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART's projected cost. Another important factor in Marin's withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Bridge, an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and San Mateo resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.|$|E
