5|$|During {{the regular}} season, games were played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> and a doubleheader on Saturday; in each doubleheader {{one of the}} two games was {{shortened}} to seven innings.

5|$|Davies' {{next project}} was The Grand, a period soap drama {{set in a}} Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was {{designed}} to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9pm <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>night.</b> After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting {{a show about}} alien {{encounter}}s. He talks about an encounter in a town called Springfield. At Moe's <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>night,</b> a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he actually saw an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The next Friday night, the pair camp out in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident on tape.|$|E

25|$|The modern uniform {{was first}} issued {{at the start}} of the 1999 season. The overshirt was changed to the grey base with red piping and sleeves {{shortened}} so the undershirt was visible and pants were changed to grey with red piping. Also the socks changed to a plain red. The cap changed slight as the 'P' was thinned, giving a more stylistic look. In the 2002–2003 season, the Major A team wore a black undershirt and socks, as well as a black with red brimmed cap instead of the traditional red for night games played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>night.</b> The night uniform was scrapped by 2004 and the singular uniform for all senior teams returned.|$|E

An emphatic 7–2 (on aggregate) victory over Scarborough in the semi-final, including 4 goals from star striker Rodney Jack, resulted in Torquay United's third appearance at Wembley. However, United lost 1–0 to Colchester United in the Wembley final (played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> due an England game the following day meaning that thousands of fans were unable to get to the game).

25|$|Arnold's Wildcats were {{a highly}} {{successful}} team, as they finished the regular season as minor premiers with a 22–4 record. After another successful regular season, the Wildcats entered the finals brimming with confidence. The Wildcats easily accounted for long-term rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi Finals to then find themselves against the highly-rated Eastside Spectres in the Grand Final. The Wildcats had {{a unique opportunity to}} win back-to-back titles, a feat only achieved by two other teams to that point {{in the history of the}} NBL. Everything looked on track when the Wildcats were able to defeat the Spectres in Game 1 in Melbourne by 26 points (109–83). Perth had hit fever pitch and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86–81). Game 2 was played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> and Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90–80) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships. Hansen was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 17.3 points per game over the three games.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{magazine}} praised Beyoncé's [...] "sexy" [...] vocals on {{the track}} which they hailed as a [...] "slinky club banger".

Sal Cinquemani, writing for Slant Magazine {{described it as a}} [...] "post-disco slink". The Quietus writer Mof Gimmers wrote, [...] "The cocaine soul bears down again, with the excellent 'Blow' which grooves along like Kelis <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>night,</b> before gnashing its teeth into the gonzo pop of Cameo or Parliament." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described it as a [...] "delicious throwback funk" [...] song. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times felt that the [...] "sumptuous" [...] song allowed Beyoncé [...] "to flex her impressive stylistic chops". Spins Anupa Mistry praised the collaboration of Timbaland and Pharrell on the [...] "nimble and funky" [...] track [...] "Blow" [...] as [...] "mighty" [...] and [...] "genius". Similarly, Claire Lobenfeld from Complex who felt that Justin Timberlake and Timbaland [...] "lost their ability to make their distinctive, infectious love-pop" [...] on Timberlake's album The 20/20 Experience, noted that [...] "Blow" [...] proved the opposite: [...] "The two have reinvigorated the overused private-parts-as-candy trope by writing one of Bey's friskiest songs ever. Add some Pharrell production... and you have one of the smoothest pieces of filth of the year." [...] Ryan Dennehy from AbsolutePunk found [...] "trademark" [...] Timbaland production in [...] "Blow" [...] and opined, [...] "Bey wisely co-opts Timbaland himself to deliver a steamy hook that interlocks with her own vocals."

Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's a great new era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair than meets the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a big story for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes you might see in the pub <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> with an appetite for life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's a great thing that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that he does have this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant when we can explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E
