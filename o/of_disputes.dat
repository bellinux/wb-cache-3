5|$|Hill {{also argued}} that if the Electoral Act {{actually}} appeared to confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as the determination <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> about election results is a non-judicial function. Also, the doctrine of separation of powers meant that non-judicial power cannot be conferred on a Chapter III Court such as the High Court.|$|E
5|$|In 1501, Prince Arthur {{arrived in}} Ludlow for his honeymoon with his bride Catherine of Aragon, before dying the {{following}} year. The Council in the Marches of Wales continued to operate, however, {{under the guidance}} of its president, Bishop William Smyth. The council evolved into a combination of a governmental body and a court of law, settling a range <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> across Wales and charged with maintaining general order, and Ludlow Castle became effectively the capital of Wales.|$|E
5000|$|Another way is for an {{existing}} court {{to be given}} the role of the court <b>of</b> <b>disputed</b> returns. Commonly, the phrase [...] "the x court shall be the court <b>of</b> <b>disputed</b> returns". In this case, a separate court is not created, but the existing court is made into and given the jurisdiction of the court <b>of</b> <b>disputed</b> returns. The High Court of Australia, the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Supreme Court of Victoria are each invested as courts <b>of</b> <b>disputed</b> returns in this manner.|$|R
40|$|Religion is alive, {{especially}} - {{and increasingly}} - {{in the global}} South. What impact does religion have in everyday life as provider of normative orientations? This research investigates the role <b>of</b> religion in <b>disputing</b> processes in Gorongosa, Mozambique, where both traditional religion and Christianity are tremendously popular. The author compares the religiously-oriented modes <b>of</b> <b>disputing</b> with the secular and formal modes <b>of</b> <b>disputing</b> advocated by government actors. The study reveals that different religions provide different normative orientations to people that strongly impact modes <b>of</b> <b>disputing,</b> not only within the religious realm but also within secular realms <b>of</b> <b>disputing...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the war Wiśniowiecki {{engaged in}} a number of {{conflicts}} with neighbouring magnates and nobles.

40|$|For {{any type}} <b>of</b> {{institutionalized}} <b>dispute</b> resolution, legitimacy {{is a crucial}} characteristic, as legitimate dispute resolution promotes, for instance, general trust in state institutions and participation in economic activity. A lack of legitimacy will prevent the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution, and thereby its use. Although many textbook definitions limit the meaning of legitimacy to legality, in its every-day use legitimacy {{is in fact a}} much broader concept. It encompasses different criteria relating to the nature <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution: is a form <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution properly embedded in a reliable institutional environment?, and: are its outcomes properly underpinned? Virtualization concerns the ways in which information and communication technologies affect administration, communication, accessibility and assessment. As an example <b>of</b> virtualization in <b>dispute</b> resolution, a scenario about on-line feedback is scrutinized.

5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Confusion in naming {{began when}} the tree was {{described}} by all three men with three different names. In Paris, Linnaeus gave the plant the name Rhus succedanea, while it was known commonly as grand vernis du Japon. In London the specimens were named by Miller as Toxicodendron altissima and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as Rhus Sinese foliis alatis. There are extant records from the 1750s <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> over the proper name between Philip Miller and John Ellis, curator of Webb's garden in Busbridge. Rather than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart observed a specimen in Utrecht in 1782 and named it Rhus cacodendron.|$|E

5|$|From 1950 to 1952, {{there were}} a series <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> between EES {{director}} Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding Scientific Associates. When {{it was founded in}} October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech, and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech. However, Rosselot's participation in Scientific Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three months, Blake was able to {{establish}} a network of earthen defences in Taunton, including a basic perimeter and several forts. The Royalists began the second, and bloodiest, siege in late March 1645, initially under Sir Richard Grenville.

After five days of intense fighting, which had once again driven the defending army back to a small central perimeter including the castle, the Royalists retreated in the face of a Parliamentarian relief army commanded by Ralph Weldon.|$|E

30|$|This work {{attempts}} to deepen {{our understanding of}} the complexity <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> transformation, but also has some limitations. First, focusing on details of case filing may lead to insufficient understanding of the entire legal practice. Second, this study {{attempts to}} clarify the importance of studying case filing through both dispute transformation and dispute resolution. By using empirical studies on the case-filing procedure to respond to various theories <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> transformation and dispute resolution, the focus of this study is a little scattered. Third, this study attempts to advance the concept <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> formatting in order to uniformly discuss and evince the process <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> transformation during case filing. Although this concept is defined and compared from the perspectives of inner meaning and outer extension, this concept requires further refinement.|$|R

5|$|Owain Gwynedd's {{grandson}} Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173–1240), wrested concessions {{through the}} Magna Carta in 1215 and receiving the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 {{at the council}} at Aberdyfi, became the first Prince of Wales. His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd also secured {{the recognition of the}} title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. Later however, a succession <b>of</b> <b>disputes,</b> including the imprisonment of Llywelyn's wife Eleanor, daughter of Simon de Montfort, culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England. As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn's fealty to England in 1277. Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest, the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn's death and his brother prince Dafydd's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage for their lands to Edward I. Llywelyn's head was carried through London on a spear; his baby daughter Gwenllian was locked in the priory at Sempringham, where she remained until her death 54years later.|$|E
5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of the}} Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> between the two.|$|E
5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a control post staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E

5|$|The {{accounts}} differ as {{to exactly}} how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure was the result <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al-Dinkizli. Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir not to pay Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury {{did not have the}} funds to pay the miri dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al-Dinkizli pressed Zahir to pay the amount, arguing that mass bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh to pay the amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the miri dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} date for Corgis {{appearing in the}} show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership of 59 members. A general breed standard was drawn up, and Corgis {{began to appear in}} conformation shows. Until this point, neither breed had been specifically bred for looks. Members of this club were primarily interested in the Pembroke variety, although the Cardigan variety also appeared. At that point the breeds were referred to as the Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire varieties; the names were later shortened. There were a number <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> between breeders of the two types in early shows, as judges who were breeders of one type would often favour them. The Welsh Corgi appeared at Crufts {{for the first time in}} 1927.|$|E
5|$|Boniface was {{energetic}} {{in defending}} the liberties of his see, and clashed with King Henry over {{the election of}} Henry's clerk Robert Passelewe to the see of Chichester. Robert Grosseteste, the Bishop of Lincoln, had examined Passelewe, and found him unfit for episcopal office, and Boniface then quashed the election in 1244. He was also involved in disputes with the king's half-brothers, especially Aymer de Valence, who was Bishop of Winchester. He also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops, who resented his attempts to supervise their affairs closely. In 1250 Boniface attempted a visitation of his province, and this disturbed his suffragan bishops, who protested that Boniface was taking exorbitant amounts of money during his visits. They appealed to the pope, who reaffirmed the right of Boniface to conduct his visitation, but set a limit on the amount that could be taken from any monastery or church. After the visitation, Boniface left England again, and only returned in 1252, after the pope had decided the bishops' appeal in Boniface's favour. After his return, he continued to assert his rights and settled a number <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> with his bishops. He secured professions of obedience from all but three of the 37 bishops consecrated during his time as archbishop. He also set up a court at Canterbury that heard appeals from the ecclesiastical courts of his suffragan bishops.|$|E
