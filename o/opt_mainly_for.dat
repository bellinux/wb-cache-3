She is seen in several different kimono clothes of varying colours with her long, dark hair arranged in various ornate traditional Japanese styles.

5000|$|During {{the period}} in the 1950s and 60s, National {{produced}} {{a wide range of}} amateur radio equipment which was advertised extensively in the amateur radio ARRL publication QST. Usually new equipment was first shown in this publication in order to initiate marketing of a new item. The company would <b>mainly</b> <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> the inside back cover which they believed would gain prominence for their new wares. In addition, around Christmas time each year National would produce tempting advertisements festooned with holly leaves. In the late 1950s, National asked the readers of QST what they wanted in a new ham radio receiver, with the result being the National NC-300 (and its successor, the NC-303). It featured a rare 30-35 MHz input for converters for 50, 144 and 220 MHz use (220 MHz equipment was very rare at the time). In 1965, National introduced the solid state HRO 500, which did not incorporate the HRO dial system, but instead relied on a direct readout rather than a conversion scale or chart. At the time, Popular Electronics magazine reviewed the HRO 500 as [...] "possibly the best amateur receiver ever". Today, many National radios are collected, restored and operated by vintage amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to examine usage and knowledge of contraception methods in adolescents in Tuzla Canton. During the period from June to September 2003 a survey involving 2, 995 high school boys and girls, 14 to 19 years of age, was conducted using standardized questionnaire. The age, sex, place of residence (municipality), sexarcha age (first intercourse age), usage and knowledge about contraception methods were recorded. Our results have shown that 395 (13, 18 %) high school youth were sexually active. The age average of sexarcha for girls was 16, 50 and for boys 15, 7 years of age. In undeveloped municipalities sexual activity of adolescents of both genders was significantly higher then in the developed ones (p< 0, 05). High school boys aged 14 to 19 years were sexually more active and had an intercourse more frequently than girls {{of the same age}} (p< 0, 0001). Sexually active high school youth <b>mainly</b> <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> condoms (boys 63 %, girls 59, 8 %). Most sexually active adolescents who did not use any protection originated from undeveloped municipalities. A statistically significant difference between the girls and boys related to usage of contraception did not exist. Most high school youth showed insufficient knowledge about contraceptive methods (74, 50 % boys and 57, 50 % girls). Statistically girls showed significantly better knowledge about contraception than boys (p< 0, 0001). Results of this study have shown that sexual activity of high school youth in Tuzla Canton was not a massive appearance and knowledge and usage of contraceptive methods was very weak, so adequate actions should be taken especially in undeveloped municipalities where this problem is more significant...|$|R
