For example, the times an hour before and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It is also possible that no mean exists. Consider a color wheel -- there is no mean to the set <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>colors.</b> In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.|$|E
25|$|Ion Luca Caragiale was {{interested}} in the politics of the Romanian Kingdom, and oscillated between the liberal current and conservatism. Most of his satirical works target the liberal republicans and the National Liberals, evidencing both his respect for their rivals at Junimea and his connections with the literary critic Titu Maiorescu. He came to clash with National Liberal leaders such as Dimitrie Sturdza and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, and was a lifelong adversary of the Symbolist poet Alexandru Macedonski. As a result of these conflicts, the most prominent of Caragiale's critics barred his access to the cultural establishment for several decades. During the 1890s, Caragiale rallied with the radical movement of George Panu, before associating with the Conservative Party. After having decided to settle in Berlin, he came to voice strong criticism for Romanian politicians <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>colors</b> {{in the wake of the}} 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, and ultimately joined the Conservative-Democratic Party.|$|E

I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world.

40|$|Isaac Newton {{experimented with}} prisms {{breaking}} down the composite light of the sun into its monochromatic components circa 1666. In one experiment he placed a comb behind the prism so that regular spectral intervals were intercepted while others were transmitted. After recombining the colored beams {{by means of a}} lens, Newton could use a white sheet of paper to observe a small circle of light formed at the focal distance (Fig. 1 A). The color of the circle changed successively from red to violet as the comb was slid slowly along a parallel axis. When the comb was moving faster, colors were not seen individually, and the sensation of white arose instead. This observation demonstrated yet again the fact that the sensation of white results from the mixture <b>of</b> <b>all</b> primary <b>colors,</b> as Newton concluded: “ … the Impression therefore <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the successive <b>Colors</b> are at once in the Sensorium…the commix’d Impressions <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the <b>Colors</b> do stir up and beget a Sensation of white, that is, that Whiteness is compounded <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the <b>Colors</b> ” (from Newton’s text Opt icks publ ished i...|$|R

For the human eye, a piece of white paper looks white no matter whether the illumination is blueish or yellowish. This is the most basic and most important <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>color</b> appearance phenomena, and therefore a chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) that tries to emulate this behavior is a central component of any color appearance model.|$|R
