5|$|The Leader {{project was}} part of Bulleid's desire to modernise the steam {{locomotive}} based on experience gained with the Southern Railway's fleet of electric stock. Bulleid considered that attitudes towards the labour-intensity <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> operation had changed during the post-war period, favouring dieselisation and electrification. In an effort to demonstrate the continued potential <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> Bulleid pushed forward the boundaries of steam-power, allowing it to compete with diesel and electric locomotives in terms of labour-saving and ease of operation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1850s it {{was clear}} that France was unable to match British {{building}} <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required. The result was the first ocean-going ironclad, , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859.|$|E

A railfan website notes Class 24, Class 40, and Class 47 as having been used for the freight services, as well as the 1983 special passenger services. The 1992 specials used Class 101 DMU units, and the 1993 special used Class 20 and Class 37 engines.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1796, the Rumford Prize, {{awarded by}} the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, {{is one of}} the oldest {{scientific}} prizes in the United States.

5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas. As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> {{and water to}} the surface through the geyser's internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain.|$|E

40|$|Steaming {{has been}} {{reported}} to better retain the glucosinolate (GS) content in Brassica vegetables than boiling. However, there is little information on the GS content, colour, and texture attributes in Brassica vegetables in relation to the duration <b>of</b> <b>steaming.</b> This study investigated the effect of the duration <b>of</b> <b>steaming,</b> which was applied in certain commercial preparation processes, on the GS content, colour, and texture of white cabbage. Results showed that the total accessible content of GSs increases initially during steaming until 10 min followed by a consistent decline up to 180 min. This observed initial increase is mainly due to the content of aliphatic GSs rather than indole GSs, which tend to decrease from the start <b>of</b> <b>steaming.</b> A mathematic model for the observed behaviour of the GSs, taking into account several mechanisms, is proposed and fitted to the data. The intensity of the green colour of the cabbage slightly increased during the first 15 min <b>of</b> <b>steaming</b> followed by a decrease onwards. The hardness showed a continuous decline during the entire steaming duration. The study indicates that steaming up to 10 min could promote the health properties as well as the colour and texture attributes <b>of</b> <b>steamed</b> cabbage...|$|R

5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption {{driven by}} the expansion <b>of</b> <b>steam.</b> When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid rock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E
