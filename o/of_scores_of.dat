Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of those places. Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos.|$|E
5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation <b>of</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land. Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because everyone can break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks.|$|E

25|$|A limited form of self {{governance}} {{was introduced}} in British India after World War I. While the Justice Party saw {{this as an opportunity}} to displace Brahmin dominance, the British government considered it favourable, since the Indian National Congress spearheading the Indian independence movement was dominated by Brahmins. The Justice party emerged as a winner in the 1920 general elections and brought about the reforms it had campaigned for, including establishing communal reservation through affirmative action for the first time in the country, and brought temples under state control. Soon after their electoral success the animosity between Tamil and Telugu members deepened, thus weakening the party. Nevertheless, the Justice Party electorally dominated the presidency for 17 years until it was defeated by the Indian National Congress party in 1937. Although out of power, the Justice Party was involved in demonstrations across the Province against the introduction of Hindi as a compulsory subject of study in schools by a Congress-led government, which led to the detainment <b>of</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> Tamil scholars, academics and Justice Party leaders. This and other struggles for social justice helped create the social base of what emerged as the Dravidian Movement.|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{actions were}} {{described}} by Lieven {{as those that}} [...] "gained him a degree of respect from the local mining community which remained over the years; they probably also cost the lives <b>of</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> miners." [...] The Duckhams describe Shaw's inaction in fixing the ventilation fan before the explosion, {{as well as his}} delay in sending for assistance from rescue teams until he exited the mine {{an hour and a half}} after the explosion. The official report considered there had been a [...] "disquieting laxity in the management of the mine", although Shaw was described by the Duckhams as [...] "undoubtedly a highly capable manager". [...] The report led to Shaw being charged with 17 breaches of the Mines Act 1911, and four charges were made against the company. Shaw was found guilty of failing to keep adequate environmental records and failing to replace a broken lamp locker; he was fined £24. The company was convicted of failing to provide a ventilation system that could reverse the airflow and was fined £10 with £55shillings costs. One newspaper, Merthyr Pioneer, calculated [...] "Miners' Lives at 1/1 each" [...] (1 shilling 1d or 5p each).|$|E
500|$|In 2000, the German Stern {{magazine}} {{published the}} results of its investigation of the asylum case.

On a 2000 visit to Clearwater, Florida, Ursula Caberta of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an [...] "orchestrated effort" [...] by Scientology undertaken [...] "for political gain", and [...] "a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system". German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater, in turn, accused Caberta of stoking a [...] "hate campaign" [...] in Germany that had [...] "ruined the lives and fortunes <b>of</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> Scientologists" [...] and maintained that Scientologists had not [...] "exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States." [...] Mark Rathbun, a (former) top Church of Scientology official, said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case, [...] "there would have been nothing improper if it had." ...|$|E
