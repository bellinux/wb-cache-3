500|$|Ruth {{had asked}} Yankees general manager Ed Barrow for {{permission}} to barnstorm. Barrow had no objection but warned Ruth he must obtain Landis's consent. [...] Landis biographer Spink, {{who was at the}} time the editor of The Sporting News, stated, [...] "I can say that Ruth {{knew exactly what he was}} doing when he defied Landis in October, 1921. He was willing to back his own popularity and well-known drawing powers against the Judge." [...] Ruth, to the commissioner's irritation, did not contact Landis until October 15, one day before the first exhibition. When the two spoke by telephone, Landis ordered Ruth to attend a meeting with him; Ruth refused, stating that he had to leave for Buffalo for the first game. Landis angrily refused consent for Ruth to barnstorm, and after slamming down the receiver, is recorded as saying, [...] "Who the hell does that big ape think he is? [...] That blankety-blank! [...] If he goes <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>trip</b> it will be one of the sorriest things he has ever done."

Bishop White participated in the consecration of most American Episcopal bishops during the country's first two decades. He also consecrated two African-Americans as deacons and then priests, Absalom Jones of Philadelphia (in 1795 and 1804, respectively), and William Levington of New York (who became missionary to free and enslaved African Americans in the South and established St.James Episcopal Church in Baltimore circa 1824). Although Bishop White did not travel extensively through his diocese, he did support missionary priests, including Simon Wilmer (who traveled through Pennsylvania and New Jersey and ultimately settled down in what became the Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C.), William Meade (who traveled extensively throughout Virginia and ultimately became its bishop, bishop White participating in his consecration) and Jackson Kemper (first in Philadelphia for 2 decades, founded the Society for the Advancement of Christianity and became the Episcopal Church's first missionary bishop).
