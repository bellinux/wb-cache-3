40|$|We model a trader’s {{decision}} {{to supply liquidity}} by submitting limit orders or demand liquidity by submitting market orders in a limit order market. The best quotes and the execution probabilities and picking <b>off</b> <b>risks</b> of limit orders determine the price of immediacy. The price of immediacy and the trader’s willingness to pay for immediacy determine the trader’s optimal order submission, with the trader’s willingness to pay for immediacy depending on the trader’s valuation for the stock. We estimate the execution probabilities and the picking <b>off</b> <b>risks</b> using a sample from the Vancouver Stock Exchange to compute the price of immediacy. The price of immediacy changes with market conditions — a trader’s optimal order submission changes with market conditions. We combine the price of immediacy with the actual order submissions to estimate the unobserved arrival rates of traders {{and the distribution of}} the traders’ valuations. High realized stock volatility increases the arrival rate of traders and increases the number of value traders arriving — liquidity supply is more competitive after periods of high volatility. An increase in the spread decreases the arrival rate of traders and decreases the number of value traders arriving — liquidity supply is less competitive when the spread widens. discrete choice; high frequency data; limit orders; liquidity; market orders...|$|R

50|$|EMP SP is the {{stochastic}} {{extension of}} the EMP framework. A deterministic model with fixed parameters {{is transformed into a}} stochastic model where some of the parameters are not fixed but are represented by probability distributions. This is done with annotations and specific keywords. Single and joint discrete and parametric probability distributions are possible. In addition, there are keywords for the Expected Value, Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Variables that are risk measures can feature in the objective equation or in constraints. EMP SP facilitates the optimization of a single risk measure or a combination of risk measures (for example, the weighted sum of Expected Value and CVaR). In addition, the modeler can choose to trade <b>off</b> <b>risk</b> measures. It is also possible to model constraints that only hold with certain probabilities (chance constraints). Currently, the following GAMS solvers can be used with EMP SP: DE, DECIS, JAMS and LINDO. Any GAMS solver can be used to process the pre-sampled deterministic equivalent problem.|$|E

The main focus was to study physical, mechanical and chemical characteristics of building materials. Buildings are the environment that a human spend about 80 % of his life.

Radon is produced of the radioactive decay of Uranium and Thorium series. It is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas. It inters human body by breathing and produces harmful radioactive elements. It has become a goal to know the limits of safety for building materials and to establish green buildings.

This note shows that reverse share tenancy is impossible under the canonical Stiglitzian model of sharecropping but becomes possible if and only if (i) both the landlord and the tenant can be assumed risk-averse; or (ii) there exist significant transactions costs making sharecropping more desirable than either a wage or fixed rent contract. ...|$|E
40|$|Building Information Modelling (BIM) usage in the UK’s {{construction}} industry has recorded {{a significant increase}} {{over the last few}} years. However, available evidence suggests that BIM adoption amongst larger construction firms and innovators seems be dominant, while the uptake of BIM by Small and Medium Sized enterprises (SMEs) remains relatively poor. Consequently, SMEs are currently lagging behind and are losing out in winning publicly funded projects. SMEs have not fully recognised the benefits of using BIM in project delivery. Guidance and frameworks to assist SMEs to make an informed decision about BIM adoption are currently lacking. It appears that SMEs are yet to be convinced that BIM is beneficial to them, and remain concerned about the potential risks to their business. Guidance and frameworks to assist SMEs in making an informed decision about BIM adoption are currently lacking. This study seeks to bridge this gap and provide a decision-support system (DSS) to assist in the analysis of the risks and rewards of adopting BIM by SMEs, in project delivery. As a result, a conceptual framework was developed to give a theoretical foundation to the study of brokering risks and rewards in the adoption of BIM for project delivery. This framework is comprehensive and includes trading <b>off</b> <b>risks</b> and rewards associated with several criteria, such as stage of involvement, project value, funding, and the procurement route chosen. The approach was validated by a representative sample of BIM users. The results of the validation of the framework provided an informed basis {{for the development of the}} DSS. The latter was validated by a sample of SMEs, according to several criteria such as ease of use of the Graphical user interface (GUI), quality of information, level of information presented, trading <b>off</b> <b>risks</b> and rewards of adoption of BIM in project delivery. The findings of the framework validation revealed that early design stage, project size between £ 5 m and £ 50 m, private funding, and integrated project delivery procurement are the best opportunities that enable SMEs to maximise the benefits and minimise the risks, when adopting BIM.

40|$|Abstract — In {{navigation}} tasks, mobile robots {{often have}} to deal with substantial uncertainty due to imperfect actuators and noisy sensor measurements. In this paper, we consider the prob-lem of online trajectory generation for safe navigation in the presence of state uncertainty and the resulting deviations from the desired trajectory. Our approach combines probabilistic estimation of the a priori collision risk with efficient trajectory generation, exploiting the differential flatness of many robotic systems in an explicitly constrained polynomial trajectory representation. Through trajectory optimization, our approach allows to flexibly trade <b>off</b> <b>risk</b> against, for example, the duration of the trajectory. It is computationally efficient because each optimization step has polynomial complexity. In contrast to other approaches, our method can also optimize the trajectory duration and supports cost functions that facilitate higher-order smoothness of the trajectory. Our experiments demonstrate the performance of the approach and show that our trajectories result in substantially lower collisions probabilities compared to minimum-snap trajectories in a quadrotor landing task.
