Yet, the contribution of marsh oiling to landscape-scale degradation and subsequent land loss {{has been difficult to}} quantify. Here, we applied advanced remote sensing techniques to map changes in marsh land cover and open water before and after oiling. We segmented the marsh shorelines into non-oiled and oiled reaches and calculated the land loss rates for each 10 % increase <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> cover (e. g. 0 % to > 70 %), to determine if land loss rates for each reach oiling category were significantly different before and after oiling. Finally, we calculated background land-loss rates to separate natural and oil-related erosion and land loss. Oiling caused significant increases in land losses, particularly along reaches of heavy oiling (> 20 % oil cover). For reaches with ≥ 20 % oiling, land loss rates increased abruptly during the 2010 - 2013 period, and the loss rates during this period are significantly different from both the pre-oiling (p < 0. 0001) and 2013 - 2016 post-oiling periods (p < 0. 0001). The pre-oiling and 2013 - 2016 post-oiling periods exhibit no significant differences in land loss rates across oiled and non-oiled reaches (p = 0. 557).

The system under consideration can be defined as a multiproduct system of three stages in series, consisting of tanks, production units and mixing units (mixers). Such a system is subject to operational constraints and availability of resources, and operate continuously. In this context, in order to support the decision process, an optimization model is proposed capable of representing the operating environment of such a system, which is applied to the particular context of a refinery. Two approaches are proposed for the model solution, the first based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (PLIM) and the second based on Genetic Algorithms (GA). The model&# 039;s main objective is to meet the expected demand for manufactured products, in compliance with the operational constraints of the refinery and minimizing the number of operational changes during the horizon of programming.

Nevertheless, its performance is still not well understood. In this paper, progress on the research in static downhole gas separators are presented.

In stark contrast with its widespread use, the knowledge of its performance is quite limited, especially with viscous oils.

This paper describes the laboratory tests of both poor boy and helical separators that are currently installed <b>in</b> the Orinoco <b>Oil</b> Belt. The poor boy design {{is perhaps the most}} simple of the commonly used static separators. It relies on fluid density differential and changes in flow direction to induce gaseous phase separation.

Tests were carried out using an ISO 150 mineral <b>oil</b> and air <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> scale experimental facility composed by 7 inches casing and 3 1 ⁄ 2 inches production tubing.

The separation efficiency of the helical separator turned out to be in the range of 30 % to 50 %, depending on liquid flow rate. The poor boy separator exhibited a far better performance with efficiency values between 90 % and 99 %, with an almost linear dependency of liquid flow rate. Use of these results will allow a more precise pump sizing, especially for oil wells with high gas production and continuous flow downhole pumps such as progressing cavity pumps...|$|R

Thus many studies had been conducted to develop alternatives methods to treat POME which are more efficient in treating POME by reducing the, high BOD content and capture the emitted methane gases while consuming less land area than ponding process. <b>In</b> this study, <b>a</b> comparison of the current technologies of POME treatment system is conducted. A study is carried out at palm oil mill Lepar Hilir to study the methane gas emission and organic content of POME From the study, it found out that high-efficient methane free POME treatment plants are unable to separate oil and particular from POME using micro-bubbles technology which showing a high biochemical oxygen demand at the result. On the other hands, through Clean Development Mechanism, high biochemical oxygen demand could be reduced significantly and successfully in capture methane gas for the use of electricity...|$|R
40|$|Out of the {{two dozen}} {{countries}} that constitute what is generally called “Asia”, some are {{the largest in the}} world while others are islands with smaller populations. When looking at oilseeds and vegetable <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> the region, one is faced with the same huge diversity which makes it complex to analyze, all the more that statistics are not easily available for many countries. Aside from the large differences in size, the region covers a wide spectrum of diversified climate environments. Asia is also mainly characterized by its huge population which has become largely urban, a key factor leading to the impressive growth of vegetable <b>oil</b> demand <b>in</b> the past 30 years. At an verage of 23. 2 kg/year, Asian per capita consumption of oils and fats still remains slightly below the world average of 28. 3 kg/capita/year. Therefore, although 53 % of the world population is located in Asia, only 45 % of world oils and fats is consumed <b>in</b> the region. <b>As</b> detailed <b>in</b> the paper, the world of Asian oilseeds and vegetable oils is highly concentrated on soybeans and palm <b>oil.</b> <b>In</b> spite of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> domestic production <b>in</b> China (12. 3 MnT), soybeans are imported in huge quantities, mostly by China (78 MnT, 84 % of the region’s imports) where more than 28 % of world soybeans production is being crushed. Palm oil, the second large commodity consumed in the region, is mainly produced within the region, mostly in Indonesia and Malaysia. So where is the “world of diversity”? Hidden behind those two dominant commodities, practically all of the ten oilseeds constituting the core of the world production are grown in significant quantities in the region while, for vegetable oils, all those of significant importance are produced within the region with the exception of olive oil. The main question that should be kept in mind when reviewing this large regional demand is under what condition will future vegetable oil production be able to meet the expected rise of per capita oils and fats demand within the region, particularly from the three largest populated countries that are China, India and Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of gas origin in mud volcanoes and related petroleum systems must consider postgenetic processes which may alter the original molecular and isotopic composition of reservoir gas. Beyond eventual molecular and isotopic fractionation due to gas migration and microbial oxidation, investigated in previous studies, we now demonstrate that mud volcanoes can show signals of anaerobic biodegradation {{of natural gas}} and <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> the subsurface. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> set of gas geochemical data from more than 150 terrestrial mud volcanoes worldwide has been examined. Due to the very low amount of C 2 + in mud volcanoes, isotopic ratios of ethane, propane and butane (generally the best tracers of anaerobic biodegradation) are only available <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few cases. However, {{it is observed that}} 13 C-enriched propane is always associated with positive б 13 CCO 2 values, which are known indicators of secondary methanogenesis following anaerobic biodegradation of petroleum. Data from carbon isotopic ratio of CO 2 are available for 134 onshore mud volcanoes from 9 countries (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Russia, Turkmenistan, Trinidad, Italy, Japan and Taiwan). Exactly 50 % of mud volcanoes, all releasing thermogenic or mixed methane, show at least one sample with б 13 CCO 2 >+ 5 ‰ (PDB). Thermogenic CH 4 associated with positive carbon isotopic ratio of CO 2 generally maintains its б 13 C-enriched signature, which is therefore not perturbed by the lighter secondary microbial gas. There is, however, high variability in the б 13 CCO 2 values within the same mud volcanoes, so that positive б 13 CCO 2 values can be found in some vents and not in others, or not continuously in the same vent. This can be due to high sensitivity of б 13 CCO 2 to gas–water–rock interactions or to the presence of differently biodegraded seepage systems in the same mud volcano. However, finding a positive б 13 CCO 2 value should be considered highly indicative of anaerobic biodegradation and further analyses should be made, especially if mud volcanoes are to be used as pathfinders of the conditions indicative of subsurface hydrocarbon accumulations in unexplored areas...|$|R
