The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent to that of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes.

40|$|To {{propose a}} model of {{prediction}} of caring behaviour among nurses that includes spiritual intelligence, emotional intelligence, psychological ownership and burnout. Caring behaviour <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> contributes to the patients' satisfaction, well-being and subsequently {{to the performance of}} the healthcare organisations. This behaviour is influenced by physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental and spiritual factors. A cross-sectional survey was used, and data were analysed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling. Data were collected between July-August 2011. A sample <b>of</b> 550 <b>nurses</b> in practice from seven public hospitals in and around Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) completed the questionnaire that captured five constructs. Besides nurses, 348 patients from seven hospitals participated in the study and recorded their overall satisfaction with the hospital and the services provided by the nurses. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The key findings are: (1) spiritual intelligence influences emotional intelligence and psychological ownership, (2) emotional intelligence influences psychological ownership, burnout and caring behaviour <b>of</b> <b>nurses,</b> (3) psychological ownership influences burnout and caring behaviour <b>of</b> <b>nurses,</b> (4) burnout influences caring behaviour <b>of</b> <b>nurses,</b> (5) psychological ownership mediates the relationship between spiritual intelligence and caring behaviour and between emotional intelligence and caring behaviour <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> and (6) burnout mediates the relationship between spiritual intelligence and caring behaviour and between psychological ownership and caring behaviour <b>of</b> <b>nurses.</b> Identifying the factors that affect caring behaviour <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> is critical to improving the quality of patient care.

40|$|Aims, {{research}} questions and hypotheses: The {{subject of the}} research is to evaluate the possibilities of influencing job satisfaction <b>of</b> shift <b>nurses</b> by head nurses. Three aims were set based {{on the subject of}} this research. Aim 1 To assess the level of job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> with working conditions. Aim 2 To evaluate the requirements <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> to increase their job satisfaction. Aim 3 To identify the possibilities of influencing job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> from the view <b>of</b> head <b>nurses.</b> Methodology and research sample: In this diploma thesis the qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used. The quantitative research was carried out by using standardized HCI questionnaires. The questionnaires were given to nurses in selected organizations (Tábor Hospital, Jindřichův Hradec Hospital, Kutná Hora Hospital, Chýnov Retirement Home). The size of the research sample is 164 respondents. The qualitative method of the research was carried out by in-depth interviews with ward and head <b>nurses</b> <b>of</b> the selected organizations (Tábor Hospital, Jindřichův Hradec Hospital, Kutná Hora Hospital, Chýnov Retirement Home). We interviewed 10 head nurses. Conclusion and the results: The results suggest that the shift nurses are not satisfied with their job, 39 % <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> feel to be "not very satisfied" in their job. The overall job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> increases with the good working team. Job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> is also influenced by the length of practice. Job satisfaction gradually decreases with the length of practice. However, in the category " 10 and more years of practice" job satisfaction increases again. Education also affects job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses.</b> The university nurses are the most satisfied, on the other hand the college nurses are the least satisfied. Job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> decreases depending on physical demands of their jobs. The preferences of motivation factors <b>of</b> shift <b>nurses</b> differ in the category "Others" (meal vouchers, supplementary pension insurance). The preferences of benefits increase depending on age and the length of practice. The nurses' requirements do not change with the other benefits. The good financial evaluation would help to influence job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses.</b> Head nurses influence job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> by non-financial benefits, pleasant leadership style, positive assessment and the opportunity of changing shifts. The output of this diploma thesis is the proposal of motivation program to increase job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>nurses...</b>|$|R
