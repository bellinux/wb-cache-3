Sometime before 588, Æthelberht of Kent married Bercta, the Christian daughter of the Frankish ruler Charibert.

50|$|Young {{children}} have more difficulty with understanding and recalling the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> information than adults do. Although episodic memory improves throughout childhood, {{development in the}} area <b>of</b> <b>source</b> monitoring tends to occur {{between the ages of}} 3 and 8 years. At 3 years, children who are able to immediately recognize the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the information they obtain have difficulty recalling this information after a short delay. The development <b>of</b> <b>source</b> monitoring is gradual, and children achieve and display competency in certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>source</b> monitoring before others. The developmental trajectory <b>of</b> <b>source</b> monitoring provides insight into what cognitive factors are necessary prerequisites. While there is no generally accepted unified theory for the development <b>of</b> <b>source</b> monitoring, five major theories contribute ideas about how source monitoring develops in children: Source Monitoring Theory, Fuzzy-trace Theory, Schema Theory, Person-based Perspective, and the Mental-state Reasoning Model.|$|R
