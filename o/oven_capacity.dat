40|$|An engineering-economic {{model is}} used within a dynamic setting to {{determine}} the least cost mix of investment and import activities as the U. S. steel industry faces successively tighter controls on coke oven emissions over the next 10 years. In response to Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards proposed for 1995, U. S. steel producers would likely export their toxic pollution by importing 6 million tons of coke per year. About 4 million tons of coke <b>oven</b> <b>capacity</b> is retrofit and about 1 million tons of annual coke consumption is replaced by new iron technologies, such as Corex. The Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) standards proposed for 1998 roughly double the coke oven retirements estimated to occur under MACT. Coke imports also are substantial but are no higher than under MACT because the additional time allows the industry to invest in more coke-saving blast furnaces and in new less toxic coke-making technologies, such as the Jewell process. The LAER standards in conjunction with higher capital costs, however, force coke imports to more than 8 million tons per year and sharply increase imports of semi-finished steel. Such a situation could exacerbate existing disputes on international steel trade. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1993 Technological change, toxic pollution, residual risk,...|$|E
30|$|Without {{any further}} {{purification}} (purity[*]≥[*] 99.0 %), 0.1  M Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH 3 COO) 2.2 H 2 O), 0.02  M zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn (NO 3) 2.6 H 2 O) and 0.02  M Hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, (CH 2) 6 [*]N 4) from Sigma Aldrich Co. Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved in 60  ml deionized water. The resulting solution had a pH of 6.8. It was then {{placed in a}} commercial microwave oven at maximum power (800  W, 2, 450  MHz) for 2  min. The <b>oven</b> <b>capacity</b> was 25  l and {{the dimensions of the}} cavity were 281 [*]×[*] 483 [*]×[*] 390  mm 3. This resulted in the formation of a white suspension. The structure and morphology of the products were characterized using AFM (NanoWizard® II NanoScience, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany), field emission SEM (Hitachi S 4800, Hitachi High Technologies, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan), XRD (Bruker D 8 diffractometer, Billerica, MA, USA) using CuKα radiation and fitted with a LynxEYE detector and photoluminescence (PL) using a He-Cd laser with a wavelength of 325  nm and a Ocean Optics USB 2000 + spectrometer (Dunedin, FL, USA), blazed at 500  nm and calibrated using a standard 3, 100 K lamp. The excitation power density was approximately 3  mW/mm 2 for all samples, and the PL spectra were corrected for the detection response of the spectrometer. The PL was performed at room temperature and in air and the XRD diffractogram acquired in θ- 2 θ mode.|$|E

30|$|Fresh seaweed (E. linza L.) was {{purchased}} {{from a local}} market at Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea, washed thoroughly and put into a specially designed glass container. Five liters of water were then added to a glass container containing 500  g seaweed and subjected to hydro-distillation to extract essential oils using a micro-wave assisted extraction machine manufactured by KMD Engineering (Paju, Republic of Korea) for 4  h. The temperature of the chamber was maintained by a thermo controller (<b>oven</b> power <b>capacity</b> of 40  W and frequency of 15 gkH). Approximately 500  mL of the distillate was then collected from the collecting nozzle of the apparatus with a conical flask, mixed with an equal volume of dichloromethane in a separating funnel, vigorously shaken, and allowed to stand until the two layers separated. Next, the lower layer was taken and concentrated using a rotary evaporator (N- 1110, Eyela, Tokyo Rikakikai Co., Ltd., Japan) at 40  °C.

50|$|A {{by-product}} of coal mining was {{the production of}} coke. The production of coke was usually regarded as a somewhat unimportant side industry to the actual mining of coal. Unlike coal mining, it was not regulated by legislation and as such no systematic records were kept of the early coke production industry in Queensland. Coke is used as both a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore and is produced from baking bituminous coal in ovens at temperatures as high as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The coke ovens erected on the West Moreton Coalfield were exclusively of the beehive type, so called because of their domed appearance. Beehive coke ovens consisted of a brick dome with a small circular opening (an exit flue) at the apex, and a larger arched opening at one side to permit charging and drawing. They were usually constructed in double rows known as batteries. The space between ovens was usually filled with rubble and earth to provide insulation and the whole battery surrounded by a stone retaining wall to resist the outward thrust of the brick domes. The Klondyke <b>ovens</b> had a <b>capacity</b> of four to five tons.|$|R
