However, droughts with different intensities that occur during different growth stages of crops can have distinctly different impacts on crop yield (Çakir 2004). Therefore, {{it is critical to}} investigate the impacts <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> on winter wheat yield by studying the occurrence timing <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> relative to the growth stage of winter wheat.|$|R
30|$|The {{seasonal}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> {{indicates that}} droughts occurred mainly during spring and autumn in Anhui, Henan, and Hebei, while relatively even temporal distribution <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> {{can be observed}} in Shandong Province. Drought intensity in Jiangsu was clearly weaker than in other provinces, and the seasonal variability <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> was not significant. Spatially, higher frequency <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> can be observed mainly in northern Hebei, southern Henan, Anhui, central and northern Jiangsu, and eastern Shandong Provinces. These areas are also the key regions of winter wheat production. Frequent droughts will definitely have impacts on winter wheat production.|$|R

In this paper we deliver empirical support for the hypothesis {{of the existence of}} long-run growth effects <b>of</b> <b>droughts.</b> Based on a panel of 153 countries over the period of 1960 to 2002 and employing a truly exogenous drought indicator derived from rainfall data we find significantly negative long-term growth effects <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> in both highly and less developed countries.

Frequent droughts can be detected in southern Henan, the province’s region for winter wheat production, and frequent droughts pose serious challenges for stable production. Overall, droughts in Jiangsu Province are less severe than in the other provinces and occurred mainly in central Jiangsu. In spring and summer, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> in northern Anhui was higher and relatively low in southern Anhui.|$|R

5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} {{independent}} environmental consulting group FishBio {{showed that the}} artificial spring pulse flows from New Melones Dam do fairly little to support salmon and steelhead out-migration in the Stanislaus River. Rather, the fish take their cues from increased water flow due to rainfall, as they naturally would have before the many dams on the Stanislaus River were built. In the spring of 2016 about 12,500 juvenile salmon migrated downriver to the sea during April and May, but less than 1percent migrated during the pulse flow. In years <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> when the lake level is low, releasing water during the spring creates consequences {{later in the year}} – because there is not enough cold water left for the autumn spawning run.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant <b>of</b> <b>drought.</b> Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E

The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Increasing {{frequencies}} <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> pose {{a threat}} to pastoral livelihoods in drylands. Using a rangeland model, we analyze the effects <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> and mobility strategies on herd size dynamics. Since the herd provides the basic income for mobile pastoralists, we evaluate herd dynamics as income to estimate the risk of endangered livelihoods due to droughts. This methodology enables us to identify critical changes in natural resource use systems which are prone to shocks. Model results show that the socio-economic type of the household and therewith its adap-tive capacity to be mobile rather than the obvious ecological effects <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> determine the opportunity to secure pastoral livelihoods. Concluding, we present a tool to analyze socio-economic strategies in order to detect under which circumstances a climatic shock translates to an economic crisis in pastoral livelihoods...|$|R
