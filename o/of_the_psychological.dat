25|$|In The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God (1904), and Dionysus and Early Dionysianism (1921), {{the poet}} Vyacheslav Ivanov elaborates {{the theory of}} Dionysianism, tracing the origins of literature, and tragedy in particular, to ancient Dionysian mysteries. Károly Kerényi characterizes Dionysus as {{representative}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> life force (Greek Zoê). Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus' emotionality in the foreground, focusing on the joy, terror or hysteria associated with the god.

25|$|Collins later {{attributed}} his crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> {{threshold of}} actively supporting Physical force Irish republicanism to this incident. Another influence upon his radicalization {{at this time}} was a Law tutor at university who had persuaded him that the newly formed Provisional Irish Republican Army was, {{as well as a}} means opposing the British military presence in Ulster, a vehicle for Marxist revolutionary politics, in line with the radical ideological expression of a younger generation in the late 1960s - early 1970s that were now replacing an old guard of a movement that had engaged in little more than petty acts of Fenian paramilitary activity in the 1950s-1960s.|$|E
25|$|These new {{developments}} mark {{a milestone in}} expanding {{the role of the}} government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans. The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care. They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients. Another policy is to redefine the meaning of “family” and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family. As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not clearly indicate the choice of the veterans. The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will have a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> and social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E

25|$|Psycholinguistics or {{psychology}} of language {{is the study}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend and produce language. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms in which languages are processed and represented in the brain. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were largely philosophical or educational schools of thought, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study how the brain processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories and infant development, among others. There {{are a number of}} subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, neurolinguistics has become a field in its own right.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{began their}} second innings with the {{prospect}} of facing 65 overs, but without any real hope of victory, and seemed set to use the batting practice as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> battle. Marsh and Taylor began quite aggressively and quickly took the score past fifty, before Marsh was bowled by Jarvis for 42, the Australians on 81 for 1. Taylor and Boon went past the 100 mark, and Taylor brought up his fifty before, on 51, he mistimed and was caught by Botham off the part-time medium bowling off Graham Gooch. Wicket-Keeper Ian Healy was the surprise replacement, elevated up the order for batting practice, and he and Boon saw {{out the rest of the}} day, putting on 49 to leave Australia at 158 for 2 at stumps, and the match ending in a draw. Dean Jones' sparkling first innings 157 earned him the man-of-the-match award.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung also applied psychoanalytic {{theory to}} art. C.G. Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist, an {{influential}} thinker, {{and founder of}} analytical psychology. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the psyche through exploring the worlds of dreams, art, mythology, world religion and philosophy. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, sociology, as well as literature and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> archetype, the collective unconscious, and his theory of synchronicity. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as coincidence were not merely due to chance but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic. He argued that a collective unconscious and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American Abstract expressionists in the 1940s and 1950s. His work inspired the surrealist concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.|$|E
