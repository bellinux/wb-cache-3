5000|$|Rotation is {{the most}} common form of displacement, and, in this case, the tip of the coffin bone rotates downward. [...] The degree of {{rotation}} may be influenced by the severity of the initial attack and the time of initiation and aggressiveness of treatment. A combination of forces (e.g. the tension of the deep digital flexor tendon and the weight of the horse) result in the deep digital flexor tendon literally pulling the dorsal face of the coffin bone away from the inside of the hoof wall, which allows the coffin bone to rotate. Also, ligaments attaching the collateral cartilages to the digit, primarily in the palmar portion of the foot, possibly contribute to a difference in support from front to back. The body weight of the animal probably contributes to rotation of the coffin bone. Rotation results in an <b>obvious</b> <b>misalignment</b> between PII (the short pastern bone) and PIII (the coffin bone). If rotation of the third phalanx continues, its tip can eventually penetrate the sole of the foot.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} matching distinct but related objects across images, for applications such as view-based model capture, virtual presence, and morphing special effects. A new approach to match estimation is presented for estimating correspondances between distinct objects. This approach minimizes the effects of lighting variations and non-rigid deformations. A sparse set of features are used for alignment, followed by imageplane warping, or morphing, based on these constraints. 1. INTRODUCTION Inter-image interpolation is a common element of many diverse applications: in film-to-television rate conversions, in interpolated display of slow-motion sequences and time-lapse photography, in MPEG video decompression, in camera-viewpoint interpolation 1 and in morphing special effects. 2 In its simplest form, inter-image interpolation is completed by cross-fading two images. This approach results in <b>obvious</b> <b>misalignment</b> artifacts in many situations. Motion artifacts a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abaxial tail {{implantation}} is {{a defect}} {{occurring in the}} neck region of spermatozoa and is characterized by misalignment of the centriolar complex relative to the head base. This defect has been described {{in a number of}} mammalian species, but is rarely reported in birds. In this study, {{a detailed description of the}} defect in emu sperm is presented as well as morphological evidence of its origin in the testis. Despite their low incidence defective sperm could readily be identified using light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Affected sperm displayed <b>obvious</b> <b>misalignment</b> of the head and flagellum with many cells additionally showing unilateral swelling and caudal extension of the nuclear base. This material overlapped the anterior aspect of the centriolar complex. More subtle forms of the defect which were not resolved by LM were revealed by TEM. Abaxial sperm development could be identified in the testis during the early elongated spermatid stage of spermiogenesis. At this stage the centriolar complex was clearly misaligned with respect to the longitudinal axis of the condensing and elongating nucleus. The rare occurrence and low incidence of this defect in the emu would suggest that it has little effect on fertility.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that exchange rates {{are related to}} economic fundamentals over medium-term horizons, such as a month or longer. We find from a large panel of individual professionals' forecasts that good exchange rate forecasts benefit from the proper understanding of fundamentals, specifically good interest rate forecasts. This relation is robust to individual fixed effects and further controls. Reassuringly, this relation is stronger during <b>obvious</b> fundamental <b>misalignment.</b> This occurs when exchange rates substantially deviate from their PPP values, when interest rate differentials are high and when exchange rates are less influenced by strong momentum.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} analyse the {{legislative}} framework of concessions on maritime domain. The Maritime Domain and Seaports Act passed in 2003 prescribes concessions on maritime domain. In the meantime, two new general acts regarding concessions were passed in 2008, and in 2012 {{and the third}} general Concessions Act is in legislative procedure now. The authors will, by the methods of comparison and analysis, show that, unlike other laws governing concessions, the Maritime Domain and Seaports Act has never been aligned with the general law, which causes problems in practice and in its implementation. The frequent dilemmas regarding the question refer to the choice of norms to implement. The dilemma is whether the general act is applicable in procedures of granting concessions on maritime domain. The authors show in this paper that the Maritime Domain and Seaports Act is not aligned with the Concessions Act and point to the problems in practice due to <b>obvious</b> <b>misalignment</b> of these laws. The authors suggest solutions to the noticed problems. They also {{argue that it is}} necessary to align the Maritime Domain and Seaports Act with the general law and that the Concessions Act is applicable in the concessions granting procedures on maritime domain...|$|E
