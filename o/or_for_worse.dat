Cartoonist Lynn Johnston, author of the comic strip For Better <b>or</b> <b>For</b> <b>Worse,</b> {{was nominated for a}} Pulitzer Prize and inducted into the Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame. Margaret Laurence's The Stone Angel and A Jest of God were set in Manawaka, a fictional town representing Neepawa; the latter title won the Governor General's Award in 1966. Carol Shields won both the Governor General's Award and the Pulitzer Prize for The Stone Diaries. Gabrielle Roy, a Franco-Manitoban writer, won the Governor General's Award three times. A quote from her writings is featured on the Canadian $20 bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} comic strips saw {{a number of}} works pop up. Ben Wicks was doing The Outsiders and Wicks, Jim Unger's Herman debuted in 1975, and Ted Martin's Pavlov in 1979. In 1978, Lynn Johnston, living in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, began For Better <b>or</b> <b>For</b> <b>Worse,</b> which was noted for {{following}} {{the lives of the}} Patterson family as they grew older in real time, and dealt with real-life issues. The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, as well as social issues such as the midlife crisis, divorce, the coming out of a gay character, child abuse, and death. In 1985, she became the first female cartoonist to win a Reuben Award, and the Friends of Lulu added her to the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 2002. The strip was very popular, appearing in over 2000 newspapers in 25 countries.|$|E

25|$|A foreign {{intelligence}} service, {{similar to the}} Central Intelligence Agency of the United States and MI6 of the United Kingdom, has never been established in Canada. However, {{through a number of}} agencies and through its Foreign Affairs postings, it has provided considerable political and economic intelligence to Ottawa decision makers. Whether most Canadians recognize it or not, this has very much blurred the boundaries as to what is required before a {{foreign intelligence}} service (FIS) is said to exist. For better <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>worse,</b> the debate on this topic has not received as much attention in Canada as it has around the world. Thinking has been that, {{due to the lack of}} clear and present danger to Canada, the high cost and political risk involved, such an agency is not a necessity. However, supporters of a dedicated Canadian agency noted that Canada could not rely on its interests coinciding with those of the UK and USA which supplied its intelligence, in contrast to the Cold War period when they shared a common enemy. A dedicated agency might also boost Canada's international standing and increase its global influence.|$|E

500|$|When Lynn Johnston's For Better <b>or</b> <b>For</b> <b>Worse</b> {{explored}} the {{coming out of}} a teenaged character in 1993, it provoked a vigorous reaction from conservative groups. Readers opposed to homosexuality threatened to cancel newspaper subscriptions, and Johnston received hate mail and death threats towards herself and her family. Over 100 newspapers ran replacement strips or canceled the comic. One result of the storyline was that Johnston was made a jury-selected [...] "nominated finalist" [...] for the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1994. The Pulitzer board said the strip [...] "sensitively depicted a youth's disclosure of his homosexuality and its effect on his family and friends." [...] Subsequent appearances of the character have not focused on his sexuality, and the creator has said that this will continue.|$|E
500|$|Since 1983, Shearer {{has been}} {{the host of the}} public radio comedy/music program Le Show. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the [...] "mega morons of the mighty media". It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio {{stations}} throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on {{the news of the day}} after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is just running around talking. They are the ones who are actually doing something, changing people's lives for better <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>worse.</b> Other people the media calls 'satirists' don't work that way." ...|$|E

A study on the biogeophysical aspects of sustainability {{came up with a}} rule of prudent practice that a resource stock should last 700 years to achieve sustainability or become a perpetual resource, <b>or</b> <b>for</b> a <b>worse</b> case, 350 years.|$|R

Strictly speaking, it is a waste when matter is changed <b>for</b> the <b>worse.</b> It is very much like this, I think, with regard to the subject which you were just then discussing.

500|$|The {{design of}} Inaba {{is based on}} a town on the {{outskirts}} of Mount Fuji. Its rural design was a source of conflict between Persona 4s developers, as [...] "each staff member had their own image of a rural town", according to director Katsura Hashino. The entire staff went [...] "location hunting" [...] to determine Inaba's design. Inaba does not represent [...] "a country town that has tourist attractions", but rather a non-notable, [...] "'nowhere' place". Hashino described the town as being [...] "for better <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>worse...</b> a run-of-the-mill town". Unlike other role-playing games, which may have large worlds for the player to explore, Persona 4 mostly takes place in Inaba. This reduced development costs, and enabled Atlus [...] "to expand other portions of the game" [...] in return. A central setting also allows players to [...] "sympathize with the daily life that passes in the game". To prevent the setting from becoming stale, the development team established a set number of in-game events to be created to [...] "keep the game exciting". The choice of Japanese mythical figures for the characters' Personas as opposed to the Graeco-Roman deities used in earlier games was directly inspired by the new setting. The appearances of Personas were based on the characters' personalities. The design team had a good deal of creative freedom while creating Personas, because although Japanese deities have well-defined character traits, their appearances are traditionally unspecified. The Shadows were created by Hashino without much outside consultation, although he had help from female staff for female Shadow selves.|$|E

Many researchers now agree that [...] "across the political spectrum, {{the relation between the}} media and the government during Vietnam was in fact one of conflict: the media contradicted the more positive view of the war officials sought to project, and for better <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>worse</b> it was the journalists' view that prevailed with the public, whose disenchantment forced an end to American involvement." ...|$|E

2500|$|The moral {{progress}} of the soul, either for better <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>worse,</b> ends {{at the very moment}} of the separation of the body and soul; at that very moment the definite destiny of the soul in the everlasting life is decided. ...There is no way of repentance, no way of escape, no reincarnation and no help from the outside world. Its place is decided forever by its Creator and judge. The Orthodox Church does not believe in purgatory (a place of purging), that is, the inter-mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved (those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins) are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into Heaven, where every soul is perfect and fit to see God. Also, the Orthodox Church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment. Both purgatory and indulgences are inter-corelated theories, unwitnessed in the Bible or in the Ancient Church, and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices {{at the expense of the}} prevailing Truths of the Church. If Almighty God in His merciful loving-kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner, it is unknown to the Church of Christ. The Church lived for fifteen hundred years without such a theory.|$|E
