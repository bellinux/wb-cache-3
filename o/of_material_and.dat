5|$|Harajuku Lovers Live was {{released}} {{in conjunction with the}} promotion for The Sweet Escape, which was also released on December 5, 2006. The DVD received mixed reviews, with reviewers praising Stefani's musical performances and stage presence, but criticizing the lack <b>of</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> the long costume changes. The DVD was certified gold in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association and platinum in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.|$|E
5|$|Simple one-move or two-move {{tactical}} actions – threats, exchanges <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> <b>and</b> double attacks– can {{be combined}} into more complicated combinations, sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced {{from the point of}} view of one or both players. Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example, pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks (especially discovered checks), zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and interferences.|$|E
5|$|Stefani's {{performance}} in late November 2005 {{in her home}} town of Anaheim, California was recorded and released on DVD as a video album Harajuku Lovers Live. It was released on December 5, 2006, the same release date as Stefani's second album, The Sweet Escape. The DVD was directed by Sophie Muller. The concert features performances of all twelve songs from Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and two new songs from her second studio album, The Sweet Escape, as well as interviews with the musicians and dancers and a documentary of tour preparation. The DVD received similar mixed reviews to the concerts themselves. Reviewers praised Stefani's musical performances and stage presence, but criticizing the lack <b>of</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> the long costume changes. The DVD was certified gold in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association and platinum in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier II was a proposed conversion {{project for the}} incomplete French cruiser De Grasse. The ship was laid down in November 1938 and lay incomplete in the Arsenal de Lorient shipyard when Germany invaded France in May 1940. In 1942, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine decided to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary {{aircraft carrier}} with a capacity for twenty-three fighters and dive bombers. Work ceased in February 1943, however, due to concerns with the ship's design, a severe shortage <b>of</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> labor, {{and the threat of}} Allied bombing raids. The ship was eventually completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1956 by the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|About 8500 {{different}} marcoremains {{have been}} found in Lo Hueco. Sauropods make up the largest amount of the remains with many articulated individuals, caudal vertebrae and teeth. The caudal vertebrae have been identified as being from a titanosaur closely related to Lirainsaurus, but with some differences. The teeth, were assigned to Ampelosaurus atacis. Apart from sauropods, the Villalba de la Sierra Formation has a good representation of carbonized plants, mostly known from branches and leaves, and invertebrates, mostly bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteid, which have plenty <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> <b>and</b> unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, even more common than fishes. Of all this material, only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an uncommon undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are known from a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus. Ornithischias and theropod dinosaurs are not as common as sauropods but still consist of much material. Basal euornithopods and probable ankylosaurians are known from Lo Hueco. The ankylosaurian remains consist of a few vertebrae. Rhabdodon sp. is known from the formation, and is known from a fair amount of elements. Only two theropods have been identified, both Dromaeosauridae indet., one dromaeosaurine and one velociraptorine.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is often}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have used}} its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other {{members of a group}} or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen. He noted that the crests internal structures {{are similar to those of}} a swan, and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus. A large amount <b>of</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.|$|E
40|$|Interfaces, both {{external}} and internal, constitute {{an integral part}} of the structure <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>and</b> so they enter directly into the structure/property/performance linkage which forms the central theme <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> science <b>and</b> engineering. These “boundary aspects” <b>of</b> bulk <b>materials,</b> because <b>of</b> their relatively discontinuous character, are not only difficult to study and elucidate, but they can also exert a major influence on the behavior <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and,</b> hence dominate their utility in many applications...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, in the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> medicaments one must not only consider the strength or functional aspects, but also its biocompatibility. The biocompatibility <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> medicaments {{is one of the}} main requirements to be considered in treating a patient. The non-toxic effect <b>of</b> a <b>material</b> or medicament is a strict condition as being biocompatible. Almost all dental treatments involve the use <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> medicaments, <b>of</b> which the basic substances are composed from chemical compounds. The use of chemical substances in the human body can give benefits or cause harm. Toxicity is one of the adverse effects of chemical compounds on living organisms. It is then becoming a problem that there are <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> medicaments, which chemically are harmful but still used in dentistry, as there are no other alternatives.
