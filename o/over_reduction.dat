The increased competition for energy industry professionals has dramatically increased & would remain so {{in the years to}} come. Improvement in the quality human resource planning and control leading to job turn over reductions is vital to achieve prevention oriented and problem free administration of oil & gas industry in Libya. This paper presents a background, need, structure and content of a unique body of knowledge relating to the job turn <b>over</b> <b>reduction</b> planning and control using information and communication technology aspects of case study energy industry related organizations as key players in Libya. This paper briefly describes the design of a detailed comprehensive survey using an in-depth survey questionnaire and interviews for limited case study organizations to identify and further investigate the factors and factor interactions that contribute to the success of job turn <b>over</b> <b>reduction</b> in Libya. A benchmarking survey is also conducted by gathering information across several companies to define priorities for action and improvement targets. The objective is not only to highlight the importance of quality of job turn <b>over</b> <b>reduction</b> planning, organizing, directing and control but also focus on key issues by analyzing HR value chains to address strategic, operational and other challenges of industry. Analysis of data gathered through a comprehensive questionnaire surveys from professional respondents in case study energy industry related organizations in Libya demonstrates that there is need for paying adequate attention to attracting, nurturing and retaining right talent.

In the special case of congruences induced by ideals in commutative polynomial rings, the powerful tool of Grabner bases {{can be characterized}} by properties of reduction relations associated with ideal bases.

40|$|A time-domain {{computational}} {{procedure is}} presented for predicting the dynamic response of laminated anisotropic shells. The two {{key elements of}} the procedure are: (1) use of mixed finite element models having independent interpolation (shape) functions for stress resultants and generalized displacements for the spatial discretization of the shell, with the stress resultants allowed to be discontinuous at interelement boundaries; and (2) use of a dynamic reduction method, with the global approximation vectors consisting of the static solution and an orthogonal set of Lanczos vectors. The dynamic reduction is accomplished by means of successive application of the finite {{element method and the}} classical Rayleigh-Ritz technique. The finite element method is first used to generate the global approximation vectors. Then the Rayleigh-Ritz technique is used to generate a reduced system of ordinary differential equations in the amplitudes of these modes.

A total of fifteen male Spraque Dawley rats were used in this study.

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of temperature and solvent {{effects on the}} reduction and amination mechanisms of iodomethane by lithium N,N-diisopropylaminoborohydride (iPr-LAB) was examined in varying concentrations of THF and dioxane. The reactions of benzyl chloride and trimethylsilyl chloride with iPr-LAB in THF were also studied. The amination of iodomethane is favored <b>over</b> <b>reduction</b> at low and room temperatures in pure THF and with {{increasing the amount of}} dioxane in THF. At higher temperatures, the reduction reaction appears to compete with the amination. In dioxane solvent, however, iodomethane yields exclusively the amination product regardless of temperature. On the other hand, reduction by iPr-LAB to the aminoborane is the only product observed in THF when benzyl chloride and trimethylsilyl chloride are used. To understand the solvent effects on the product distribution, ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to examine the mechanisms of reduction and amination of chloromethane and bromomethane by lithium dimethylaminoborohydride (LAB) in THF and dioxane. The results of these calculations show that the relative reaction barrier heights are significantly affected {{by the nature of the}} coordinated solvent molecule, and thus lend support to the experimental observations...|$|E

Chapter 1 introduces the area of transition metal catalysed tandem reductive processes as a tool for carbon-carbon bond formation. An extensive discussion of this methodology is included and recent advances in the area are highlighted. Chapter 2 discusses the initial study into the asymmetric reductive Dieckmann condensation. 3, 3 ’-Disubstituted 4 -oxopyrrolidines were synthesised in up to 93 % ee using both molybdenum and copper catalysis. Chapter 3 describes the novel molybdenum-catalysed two-carbon homologation of aldehydes by the reduction of alkylidene Meldrum’s acid derivatives.

However, the flows of PFOA/PFO from manufacture and application to the environment are indistinct, especially flows from waste treatment sites to the environment. Here, a life cycle analysis of PFOA/PFO is conducted in which all major flows of PFOA/PFO have been characterized for 2012. Processes related to uses and possible releases of PFOA/PFO include manufacture and use, waste management, and environmental storage. During manufacture and use, emission from application {{was the most important}} (117. 0 t), regardless of whether it flowed first to waste treatment facilities or was directly released to the environment, followed by manufacture of PFOA/PFO (3. 9 t), while flows from the service life and end of life of consumer products were the lowest (1. 2 t). Among five waste treatment routes, flows through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were the highest (10. 6 t), which resulted in 12. 8 t of PFOA/PFO being emitted into the environment.

There is evidence supporting that blood pressure lowering obtained by intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has an additive renoprotective effect <b>over</b> <b>reduction</b> of blood pressure alone, both in diabetic and non-diabetic renal diseases.

Yet, still patients progress to end-stage renal disease. In this review, individual differences in therapy response and possibilities to overcome therapy resistance to RAAS blockade are discussed. Experimental data from studies in rats suggest a specific involvement of intrarenal factors, particularly of preexisting renal damage and renal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, in therapy resistance. Identification of such factors in individual renal patients provides mechanisms by which renoprotective strategies fail to overcome therapy resistance. This prompts for a dual approach to improve renoprotection, namely unravelling these specific intrarenal mechanisms on the one hand, and development of better strategies for early detection of renal risk on the other han...|$|E
