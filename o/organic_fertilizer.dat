2500|$|Marine {{nutrient}} bioextraction is {{the practice}} of farming and harvesting marine organisms such as shellfish and seaweed {{for the purpose of}} reducing nutrient pollution. Mussels and other bivalve shellfish consume phytoplankton containing nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). [...] On average, one live mussel is 1.0% N and 0.1% P. When the mussels are harvested and removed, these nutrients are also removed from the system and recycled in the form of seafood or mussel biomass, which can be used as an <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> or animal feed-additive. These ecosystem services provided by mussels are of particular interest to those hoping to mitigate excess anthropogenic marine nutrients, particularly in eutrophic marine systems. [...] While mussel aquaculture is actually promoted in some countries such as Sweden as a water management strategy to address coastal eutrophication, mussel farming as a nutrient mitigation tool {{is still in its infancy}} in most parts of the world. Ongoing efforts in the Baltic Sea (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Poland) and Long Island Sound and Puget Sound [...] in the U.S. are currently examining nutrient uptake, cost-effectiveness, and potential environmental impacts of mussel farming as a means to mitigate excess nutrients and complement traditional wastewater treatment programs.|$|E

[...] This trend would continue from the 1970s to the 1990s, mostly focused on the activities of the Tehuantepec diocese under bishop Arturo Lona Reyes, who led from 1971 to his retirement in 2000. [...] The Diocese of Tehuantepec was part of a movement to mobilize the poor and indigenous in the 1980s and 1990s, allied with other elements of the Catholic Church in Oaxaca, the CEDIPIO and others. This movement was based on the teachings of liberation theology. Bishop Arturo Lona was a strong supporter of the teachings of Vatican II calling {{for the creation of a}} “people’s church”. The Oaxaca church was allied with Diocese of Chiapas under Bishop Samuel Ruiz. The pastoral style of these Oaxacan and Chiapas churches came to be known as the “pastoral indígena” or indigenous pastoral and was focused explicitly on working with the most marginalized segments of society. He instituted a health clinic just outside the city of Tehuantepec basic hospital facilities and the promotion of natural medicine with the training of local healers called curanderos.

2500|$|The {{status of}} Burgundy wines {{continued}} {{in the court of}} the House of Valois, which ruled as Dukes of Burgundy for much of the 14th and 15th centuries. Their ban on the import and [...] export of non-Burgundian wines, effectively shutting out the then popular wines of the Rhone Valley from north European markets, gave a considerable boost to the Burgundy wine industry. It was during this era that the first reliable references to grape varieties in Burgundy were made. Pinot noir was first mentioned in 1370 under the name Noirien, but it was believed to have been cultivated earlier than that, since no other grape variety associated with Medieval Burgundy {{is believed to have been}} able to produce red wines of a quality able to impress the papal court. On 6 August 1395, Duke Philip the Bold issued a decree concerned with safeguarding the quality of Burgundy wines. The duke declared the [...] "vile and disloyal Gamay"—which was a higher-yielding grape than Pinot noir in the 14th century, as it is today—unfit for human consumption and banned the use of <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (manure), which probably increased yields even further to the detriment of quality. High-quality white Burgundy wines of this era were probably made from Fromenteau, which is known as a quality grape in northeastern France in this time. Fromenteau is probably the same variety as today's Pinot gris. Chardonnay is a much later addition to Burgundy's vineyards.|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{is presented}} {{here of the}} results obtained from several experiments carried out in cauliflower field crops in different regions and seasons. Fields were divided into plots. One of the <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> pig slurry, cow manure, city refuse or mushroom cultivation composts was incorporated into the soil of each plot. After cauliflower planting, one of the insecticides chlorpyriphos, chlorfenvinphos, or carbofuran was applied - for plant protection against the root fly - to each plot, by pouring its water emulsion on the soil around the plant stem. The soil persistences {{of each of the}} insecticides during crops were greater (it could be as much as 2. 4 times greater when measured by the insecticides soil half-lives) in the <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> treated plots, than in the <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> untreated control plots. This occurred during the first three quarters of the crop period; {{at the end of the}} crop, the insecticides soil concentrations became similar and very low in all the <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> treated and untreated plots. To the greater insecticides soil concentrations - due to the <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> soil treatments - should correspond better insecticide protection efficiencies; the first measurements indeed indicated protection efficiencies at least as good in the <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> treated plots as in the control plots. Soil organic matter analyses indicated that the increase of the insecticides soil persistences - due to the <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> soil treatments - corresponded to greater total organic matter, humic acids and humin soil concentrations; to greater weight ratios of humic to fulvic acids; to greater nitrogen contents in the humic acids; and to humic acids containing greater percentages (as shown by C- 13 NMR) of chemical functions (carboxylic, quinone [...] .) able to fix the insecticides in soil. These observations suggest that the increases of the insecticides soil persistences due to the <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> soil treatments correspond to greater absorptions of the insecticides into the soil organic matter, which protect the insecticides against the soil metabolizing microbial activity. These conclusions were also sustained by the observations made in commercial cauliflower and sugar beet crops...|$|R

40|$|Among {{many types}} of fertilizers, most widely used ones are {{chemical}} and <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Chemical fertilizers are specialized fertilizers that their nutrient level {{is controlled by the}} production process. On the other hand, nutrient levels (nitrogen-potassium-phosphorus) of <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are determined by their type such as vermicompost, poultry manure, farmyard manure, bat guano, and compost. These types differ from one another by nutrient levels. Although nutrient levels of those have literature values and researches about it, there is no data about application of <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> on a specified plant. The objective of this investigation is to find out how much a plant, in this case Zea mays (corn plant), can transfer the nutrients into its system via roots with respect to the fertilizer type. 5 types of <b>organic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are used to grow Zea mays and NPK calculations are made by using different measurements, resulting in finding out the percentages of nutrients {{in the body of the}} plants. 	It was revealed that poultry manure had the largest impact on plant growth, resulting in having a greater dry and fresh weight, higher potassium and phosphorus percentage.
