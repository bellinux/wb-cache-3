5|$|Baltische Öl {{consisted}} of five units (Kiviõli, Küttejõu, Kohtla-Järve, Sillamäe, and Kohtla), {{all of which}} were partially restored, previously existing industries.

5|$|The companions, {{including}} the elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards.

5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers.

On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
