Studies of ozone concentration, type and mass of catalysts and oxalic acid concentration have been done. With 1 mmol/l of oxalic acid solution and 43 mg/l of ozone, we obtained 50 % of maximal oxidation report after 20 min. the addition of 1 g of MnO 2 to the solution in the reactor changed the same report to 85 % after 5 min. a comparison between MnO 2, TiO 2 and CoO was done and results prove that the oxide of cobalt is more efficient than the two other catalyst. However, with the same mass added to the reactor 500 mg for each catalyst, the rate of conversion obtained with MnO 2 and CoO was nearly 95 % and 90 % with TiO 2 but the kinetic of CoO is faster than the two other catalysts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. -Ozone {{has been}} used in a range of {{aquaculture}} applications related to disinfection and improving water quality. Ozone has seen wide use because it is a powerful oxidizing agent that has a rapid reaction rate and few harmful reaction products.

The issues and mechanisms required to use ozone are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the pro-cesses of <b>ozone</b> gas <b>generation</b> and gas-to-liquid absorption, the contact time for reaction, and the removal of residual ozone. In addition, the toxicity of ozone to humans and to aquatic organisms is discussed, as well as techniques to monitor or control ozone in both the gaseous and aqueous phases. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent that can be put to numerous beneficial uses within aquaculture (Rosenthal 1981; Hochheimer and Wheaton 1995).

40|$|Disinfection is {{considered}} to be the primary mechanism for the inactivation/destruction of pathogenic organisms {{to prevent the spread of}} waterborne diseases to downstream users and the environment. It is important that wastewater be adequately treated prior to disinfection in order for any disinfectant to be effective. Table 1 lists some common microorganisms found in domestic wastewater and the diseases associated with them. Ozone is produced when oxygen (O 2) molecules are dissociated by an energy source into oxygen atoms and subsequently collide with an oxygen molecule to form an unstable gas, ozone (O 3), which is used to disinfect wastewater. Most wastewater treatment plants generate ozone by imposing a high voltage alternating current (6 to 20 kilovolts) across a dielectric discharge gap that contains an oxygen-bearing gas. Ozone is generated onsite because it is unstable and decomposes to elemental oxygen in a short amount of time after <b>generation.</b> <b>Ozone</b> is a very strong oxidant and virucide. The mechanisms of disinfection using ozone include: Direct oxidation/destruction of the cell wall with leakage of cellular constituents outside of the cell.

40|$|The {{ozone layer}} above Earth is our planet's fragile sunscreen, {{protecting}} people, vegetation, and wildlife. NASA has been measuring ozone {{for more than}} 20 years by looking down, but SOLSE- 2 will show that more information is available by looking at ozone from the side, at Earth's limb or atmospheric boundary. When the ozone layer is compromised, increased ultraviolet (UV) levels from the sun cause health problems ranging from severe sunburns to skin cancer and cataracts. A concerted global effort {{has been made to}} reduce or eliminate the production of chemicals that deplete ozone, but the ozone layer is not expected to recover for many decades because these chemicals can remain active in the atmosphere for up to 100 years. We know now that ozone monitoring needs to be focused in the lower stratosphere. The discovery of the ozone hole in 1985 demonstrated that very large changes in ozone were occurring in the lower stratosphere near 20 km, instead of the upper stratosphere as first expected, and where current ozone instruments are focused. Measuring ozone from a tangential perspective that is centered at the limb provides ozone profiles concentrated in the lower stratosphere. The first flight of SOLSE proved that this technique achieves the accuracy and coverage of traditional measurements, and surpasses the altitude resolution and depth of retrieval of conventional techniques. Results from the first flight convinced the science community to design the next <b>generation</b> <b>ozone</b> monitoring satellite based on SOLSE.

40|$|The recent thrust in {{utilizing}} g-C 3 N 4 as a metal-free photocatalyst {{has led to}} accelerated {{attention in}} environmental decontamination. Despite of enormous efforts paid on material modification, the overall efficiency is still limited, especially for decomposition of chemically stable contaminants and mineralization of organics. Here, we coupled bulk g-C 3 N 4 (GCN-T and GCN-D synthesized from thiourea and dicyandiamide, respectively) photocatalysis with ozonation for mineralization of oxalic acid (OA) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) under UV and visible-light irradiation. The compelling experiments confirmed that bulk g-C 3 N 4 could trigger a super synergy between photocatalysis and ozonation under visible light. The apparent rate constant of OA removal by Vis/O- 3 /GCN-D was 20. 6 times {{as great as the}} sum of that in Vis/GCN-D and ozonation. The TOC removal of PHBA by Vis/O- 3 /GCN-D was 98. 0 %, which was about 39. 3 % higher than the sum of that in Vis/GCN-D and ozonation. The high conduction band (CB) position of g-C 3 N 4 proved to be crucial for the synergy between photocatalysis and ozonation. GCN-D possessed a similar to 0. 10 V upshifted CB level compared to GCN-T, resulting in a 1. 30 times higher photocatalytic ozonation activity. More negative CB potential benefited photoinduced electron capture by ozone molecules, thus significantly enhanced charge separation as well as the decay of <b>ozone</b> eventually with <b>generation</b> of abundant hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Exceptionally, Vis/O- 3 /GCN-D exhibited stronger oxidizing ability than UV/O- 3 /GCN-D for OA degradation with the same light intensity. The reason was that the photolysis of ozone occurred under UV and partly inhibited ozone capturing photoinduced electrons. The amount of generated center dot OH thus decreased in UV/O- 3 /GCN-D instead with the formation of a few atomic oxygen species (O(D- 1)). This study puts forward new application of the easily obtained bulk g-C 3 N 4 and may drive the advance of sunlight/O- 3 /g-CsN 4 method for efficient and green water decontamination using sunlight as energy source.

40|$|Atmospheric {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) are involved in <b>ozone</b> and aerosol <b>generation,</b> thus having implications for air quality and climate. VOCs and their emissions by vegetation also have important ecological roles as they can protect plants from stresses and act as communication cues between plants and between plants and animals. In spite of these key environmental and biological roles, the reports on seasonal and daily VOC mixing ratios in the literature for Mediterranean natural environments are scarce. We conducted seasonal (winter and summer) measurements of VOC mixing ratios in an elevated (720 m a. s. l.) holm oak Mediterranean forest site near the metropolitan area of Barcelona (NE Iberian peninsula). Methanol was the most abundant compound among all the VOCs measured in both seasons. While aromatic VOCs showed almost no seasonal variability, short-chain oxygenated VOCs presented higher mixing ratios in summer, presumably due to greater emission by vegetation and increased photochemistry, both enhanced by the high temperatures and solar radiation in summer. Isoprenoid VOCs showed the biggest seasonal change in mixing ratios: they increased by one order of magnitude in summer, {{as a result of}} the vegetation's greater physiological activity and emission rates. The maximum diurnal concentrations of ozone increased in summer too, most likely due to more intense photochemical activity and the higher levels of VOCs in the air. The daily variation of VOC mixing ratios was mainly governed by the wind regime of the mountain, as the majority of the VOC species analyzed followed a very similar diel cycle. Mountain and sea breezes that develop after sunrise advect polluted air masses to the mountain. These polluted air masses had previously passed over the urban and industrial areas surrounding the Barcelona metropolitan area, where they were enriched in NOx and in VOCs of biotic and abiotic origin. Moreover, these polluted air masses receive additional biogenic VOCs emitted in the local valley by the vegetation, thus enhancing O 3 formation in this forested site. The only VOC species that showed a somewhat different daily pattern were monoterpenes because of their local biogenic emission. Isoprene also followed in part the daily pattern of monoterpenes, but only in summer when its biotic sources were stronger. The increase by one order of magnitude in the concentrations of these volatile isoprenoids highlights the importance of local biogenic summer emissions in these Mediterranean forested areas which also receive polluted air masses from nearby or distant anthropic sources...|$|R

Observing efficiently LT ozone from space is crucial to monitor and better understand pollution phenomena occurring from inter-continental to local scales, and that have a proven noxious effect on the {{human health and the}} biosphere. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) flies on MetOp-A spacecraft and is planned to be launched in the next future as part of the other MetOp modules, i. e. MetOp-B and C. IASI has demonstrated to have the capability to single out the LT ozone signal only at favourable conditions, i. e. in presence of high thermal contrast scenarios. New generation satellite instruments are being designed to address several pressing geophysical issues, including a better observation capability of LT <b>ozone.</b> IASI-NG (New <b>Generation),</b> now having reached the accomplishment of design phase-A for launch in the 2020 timeframe as part of the EPS-SG (EUMETSAT Polar System-Second Generation, formerly post-EPS) mission, may render feasible a better observation of AQ in terms of LT ozone. To evaluate the added-value brought by IASI-NG in this context, we developed a pseudo-observation simulator, including a direct simulator of thermal infrared spectra and a full inversion scheme to retrieve {{ozone concentration}} profiles. We produced one month (August 2009) of tropospheric ozone pseudo-observations based on both IASI and IASI-NG instrumental configurations. We compared the pseudo-observations and we found a clear improvement of LT ozone (up to 6 km altitude) pseudo-observations quality for IASI-NG. The estimated total error is expected to be more than 35 % smaller at 5 km, and 20 % smaller for the LT ozone column. The total error on the LT ozone column is, on average, lower than 10 % for IASI-NG. IASI-NG is expected to have a significantly better vertical sensitivity (monthly average degrees of freedom surface- 6 km of 0. 70) and to be sensitive at lower altitudes (more than 0. 5 km lower than IASI, reaching values of nearly 3. 0 km). Vertical ozone layers of 4 to 5 km thickness are expected to be resolved by IASI-NG, while IASI has a vertical resolution of 6 – 8 km. According to our analyses, IASI-NG is expected to have the possibility of effectively separate lower from upper tropospheric ozone information even for low sensitivity scenarios. In addition, IASI-NG is expected to be able to better monitor LT ozone patterns at local spatial scale and to monitor abrupt temporal evolutions occurring at time-scales of a few days, thus bringing an expected added-value with respect to IASI for the monitoring of AQ...|$|R

The NPP SDS Ozone Product Evaluation and Test Element (PEATE) will build on the heritage of the TOMS and OM 1 mission based processing systems. The overall measurement based system that will encompass these efforts is the Atmospheric Composition Processing System (ACPS). We have extended the system to include access to publically available data sets from other instruments where feasible, including non-NASA missions as appropriate. The heritage system was largely monolithic providing a very controlled processing flow from data. ingest of satellite data to the ultimate archive of specific operational data products. The ACPS allows more open access with standard protocols including HTTP, SOAPIXML, RSS and various REST incarnations. External entities can be granted access to various modules within the system, including an extended data archive, metadata searching, production planning and processing. Data access is provided with very fine grained access control. It is possible to easily designate certain datasets as being available to the public, or restricted to groups of researchers, or limited strictly to the originator. This can be used, for example, to release one's best validated data to the public, but restrict the "new version" of data processed with a new, unproven algorithm until it is ready. Similarly, the system can provide access to algorithms, both as modifiable source code (where possible) and fully integrated executable Algorithm Plugin Packages (APPs). This enables researchers to download publically released versions of the processing algorithms and easily reproduce the processing remotely, while interacting with the ACPS. The algorithms can be modified allowing better experimentation and rapid improvement. The modified algorithms can be easily integrated back into the production system for large scale bulk processing to evaluate improvements. The system includes complete provenance tracking of algorithms, data and the entire processing environment. The origin of any data or algorithms is recorded and the entire history of the processing chains are stored such that a researcher can understand the entire data flow. Provenance is captured in a form suitable for the system to guarantee scientific reproducability of any data product it distributes even in cases where the physical data products themselves have been deleted due to space constraints. We are currently working on Semantic Web ontologies for representing the various provenance information. A new web site focusing on consolidating informaon about the measurement, processing system, and data access has been established to encourage interaction with the overall scientific community. We will describe the system, its data processing capabilities, and the methods the community can use to interact with the standard interfaces of the system...|$|R
40|$|We {{proposed}} mesh-through type ozonizer as a {{new type}} ozone generator using silent discharge. In this ozonizer, material gas is provided from {{the same direction as}} the discharge axis. The efficiency of <b>ozone</b> <b>generation</b> at high ozone concentration may be improved with this ozonizer. In this study, we used air as the material gas and the basic property of this ozonizer was measured. In the experiments, the characteristics of the <b>ozone</b> <b>generation</b> for the discharge power were measured for different gas flow rate and gap length. From the results, the efficiency of <b>ozone</b> <b>generation</b> was discussed. As a result, it is found that the efficiency at low ozone concentration was almost the same as the other ozonizer using the silent discharge. The relationship between the efficiency and the gap length was slightly different from that of other ozonizer...|$|E
