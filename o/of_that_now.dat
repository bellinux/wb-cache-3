Even on a serious BBC Two drama, {{there will be some}} suit in some office going, [...] "Hmmm, isn't he a poof?" [...] I don't consider myself politically gay, but whenever I catch a whiff <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> I'm on it like a ton of bricks."

2500|$|The papal nuncio, the Most Rev. Giovanni Tonucci, said at Father Kaiser’s {{funeral in}} the Nairobi basilica, [...] "The church, through pitiless violence, has once more been {{deprived}} {{of one of her}} ministers. Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that moment, I thought {{it would have been better}} if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me. How much more I am convinced <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> that we look at him as a martyr of the faith?". Also present at the altar was Maurice Cardinal Otunga, Archbishop Emeritus of Nairobi.|$|E
