2500|$|In 1997, Imants Barušs, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments using the methods of EVP investigator Konstantin Raudive, and the work of [...] "instrumental transcommunication researcher" [...] Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP. Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: [...] "While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense." [...] The findings were published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 2001, and include a literature review.|$|E

5000|$|A 2010 study {{published}} in the journal Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems showed that biointensive methods resulted in significantly increased production and a reduction of energy use when compared with conventional agriculture (Moore, S.R., 2010, Energy efficiency in small‐scale biointensive organic onion production in Pennsylvania, USA, Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems, 25:3, pp. 181‐188). This study states that [...] "Current mechanized agriculture has an energy efficiency ratio of 0.9 ... energy efficiency for biointensive production of onions in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> over 50 times higher than this value (51.5), and 83% of the total energy required is renewable energy." ...|$|E

50|$|Cambodia has a {{population}} of about 14 million, with around 1.5 million children below 5 years. In 2007, when <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> conducted, it had an under-5 mortality of 91 and a high rate (37 per cent) of stunting. By 2010, the under-5 mortality rate had decreased to 58, but there still is a high rate of moderate to severe stunting (40 per cent in 2006-2010) in Cambodia. In 2005-2006, the enrollment rate in ECCE for 3-5 year olds in Cambodia was about 12 per cent overall, and for 5- to 6-year-olds, it was 27.27 per cent (state pre-schools 21.23 per cent; private pre-schools 1.43 per cent; community pre-schools 3.96 per cent and home-based programmes 0.84 per cent). More recent gures indicate that in 2009-2010, the enrolment rate of 3- to 5-year-olds was 20 per cent and that it was 38 per cent for 5-year-olds. The Cambodian government would like to give priority for ECCE to children from poor and remote backgrounds, but it does not have the funds to increase state pre-school provision or increase the national budget for ECCE.|$|E

30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> one of {{few studies}} {{assessing}} plasma MPO as a discriminative biomarker {{and the only}} study assessing plasma MPO as a prognostic biomarker in the ICU. A limitation of <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> that we used the SIRS criteria—as published in 2003 —as inclusion criteria. Those SIRS criteria have been criticized because they lack sensitivity [1]. For future studies, we recommend abandoning the SIRS criteria and instead including all ICU patients (with an estimated stay of more than 24  h). MPO assays are already widely available; therefore, it should be fairly easy to implement measurement of plasma MPO in ICU work-up. Since <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> performed in a fairly large cohort in a general ICU and had few missing values, our results should be generalizable to other ICUs.|$|R

For <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> the dataset of 94 Korean firms (out of all 700 KOSPI listed firms) that have Bloomberg Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Disclosure scores for the period of 2008 - 2014 was used.|$|R
30|$|The main {{limitations}} of <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>were,</b> the <b>study</b> lacks detailed clinical data and analysis to identify predictors of mortality. This {{calls for the}} improvement in documentation and keeping of medical records of patients properly. However, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the few}} that provides baseline information concerning Tetanus patients at FHRH, northwest Ethiopia, and this could be useful for planning appropriate Tetanus control strategies, especially in the present study areas and in settings where Tetanus is common.|$|R
