40|$|The need to {{overcome}} {{challenges faced by}} construction industry {{has been at the}} core of many government reports. Most of the reports suggest the adoption of innovations including <b>off-site</b> manufacture and emerging Building Information Modelling (BIM) {{to overcome}} the challenges facing the industry. Current research has largely focused on the impacts of <b>off-site</b> manufacture and BIM independently applied on traditional construction methods. Due to the factory-based nature of <b>off-site</b> manufacture, the benefits of BIM on <b>off-site</b> manufacture have been widely argued to be far greater than those of traditional construction. However, studies about impacts of BIM on <b>off-site</b> manufacture are scarce with far too many on traditional construction. This study investigates the implications of BIM systems on <b>off-site</b> manufacture and traditional construction methods, with emphasis on the technological potential of BIM for <b>off-site</b> manufacture. The specific objectives of the study are threefold. Firstly, it examines how BIM can support <b>off-site</b> manufacture. Secondly, the paper discusses the benefits of BIM and explains how BIM can overcome barriers hindering the uptake of <b>off-site</b> manufacturing. Thirdly, due to the importance to measure the benefits to support wider adoption, an examination of the published quantitative benefits of BIM on <b>off-site</b> manufacture and traditional construction is undertaken. A critical appraisal of the literature was undertaken to achieve the aim of this study. The main findings are the identification of qualitative and quantitative benefits of: BIM on <b>off-site</b> manufacture, <b>off-site</b> manufacture and BIM on traditional construction. The findings reinforce the argument that BIM adoption on <b>off-site</b> manufacturing projects is a rapid, efficient {{and one of the best}} ways to improve on the long standing challenges that have plagued the construction industry for generations...|$|R

40|$|Pollen {{data from}} three {{off-site}} records and twenty-six on-site (archaeological) sites are reviewed {{to investigate the}} development of cultural landscapes through {{the history of the}} olive, walnut and chestnut trees in the Italian Peninsula from the Late Glacial to late Holocene. The spread of these trees, which have been gathered or cultivated since ancient times, though not marked by high values in pollen diagrams, is an important indicator of increasing human activity and anthropization in the Mediterranean area. The sum of Olea, Juglans and Castanea percentages in pollen spectra constitutes the OJC curve. The off-site records discussed are core RF 93 - 30 from the Adriatic Sea (last 7000 years), and cores PALB 94 - 1 E of Lago Albano and PNEM 94 - 1 B of Lago di Nemi, two lakes in the Latium region (last 13, 000 years). The on-site records are located in several regions (Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, Basilicata, Calabria, and Sicily) and in the Republic of San Marino. Their chronology spans approximately from the Bronze to the Renaissance ages, from 4200 to 500 years BP. The simultaneous presence of OJC in the <b>off-sites</b> and in all the archaeological sites confirms that these trees were widespread in the Italian peninsula during the last four millennia. The OJC pollen sum shows low values but it is common in Bronze age sites from northern Italy, when their percentages increase in the off-site records. In Hellenistic and Roman times, there are sharp increments of their curves in the <b>off-sites,</b> and values of Olea are especially high in archaeological sites of southern Italy. The highest values of OJC, especially due to Castanea, are found in the different types of records in the Middle ages. Juglans is significant but less common in both the archaeological sites and the <b>off-sites.</b> The cultivation of walnut and chestnut trees in pre-Roman times may have included local stands. The nurturing for wood may have had negative effects on pollen fallout while the flowering of plants was favoured to obtain fruits. As humans exploited the natural resources they interfered with the distribution of useful plants. The development of human environments in a modern sense, however, is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has largely caused the expansion of complex agrarian landscapes, including fields, pastures and groves...|$|E

Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office (DOE/NV) has {{initiated}} the Off-Site Project {{to characterize the}} hazards posed to {{human health and the}} environment as a result of underground nuclear testing activities at facilities other than the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The Project Shoal Area (PSA) is one of the <b>Off-Sites</b> Project areas located off the NTS, but within the state of Nevada. The PSA is located approximately 48 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of Fallon, Nevada. Four wells were drilled at the PSA in 1996 as part of the site investigation administered through the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) (1996). The hydrogeologic data gathered from these wells was used to support the groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling of the PSA. However, the subsequent evaluation of the groundwater model concluded that further delineation of the subsurface was required to reduce uncertainties in the model. In accordance with the FFACO, an addendum to the Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) for the proposed PSA subsurface investigation, Corrective Action Unit 447, was developed.

40|$|Ks. Bogdan BielaContemporary {{threats to}} faith {{are closely related}} to {{contemporary}} atheism and post-modernism. For post-modernists there is no absolute truth, the truth is relative. Therefore what we are facing today is christianofobia. Although the Christian faith is tolerated as an identity and an outlook on life, criticism of a liberal approach to human rights and Christianity’s authority to define human rights and respect for the dignity of human nature is not accepted. Among other threats to faith the following may be listed: mass media that not only prefer horizontalism without any referral to transcendence, but also are full of violence and sex and skilfully manipulate audience, vanishing domestic environment of faith, split-up families, consumption which leads to egoistic approaches, comfort-loving nature, lack of time for spiritual life, lack of the sense of sin, religious syncretism, subcultures, cults and sects, religious ignorance, looking for acceptance among “non-believers” and anti-clericals, weekend <b>off-sites</b> in corporate companies, inability to celebrate Sunday and economical migrations. A Christian who really bothers about a contemporary atheism, experiences it as both accusation and a challenge. He accuses himself of being an accomplice of atheism because he does not experience his faith or treats it only superficially. The challenge is to bear witness to God and therefore to reject the way of life as if God did not exist. It is closely related to taking up the idea of a “new evangelization” and implementing the evangelization-and‑catechumenal model of pastoral work. Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicac...|$|E

40|$|In the {{background}} of the late-Holocene landscape of the Southern Valli Grandi Veronesi (VGVM) and nearby Bonifica Padana, an area that stretches between rivers Adige and Po and which is drained by the river Tartaro, was taken into consideration the position of a long embankment that ran through the territories of the two large moated sites of the middle and recent Bronze Age, Fondo Paviani (FP) to east, and Castello del Tartaro (CdT) to west. The location of this particular embankment called SAM (from italian southern embanked road), more than ten km long, and arranged parallel to the Tartaro old riparian belt, since long time attracted scholars as a witness of an old territorial organization, probably related to spatial distribution of cultivated or pasture by the communities who lived in the two large villages, bounded by massive ditch and bank systems. On the basis of recent acquisitions of new DEM and LIDAR sources and aimed field investigations, then merged into geo-chronological and chrono-typological analysis in the laboratory, was developed a research addressed the chrono-stratigraphic, cultural-evolutionary and functional scan of the SAM construct. For this purpose, the archaeological, stratigraphic and chronological record have been reviewed from a series of very significant <b>off-sites,</b> with stratigraphic columns documenting paleo-environmental and archaeological-functional reconstructions. They allowed to established the obvious links between the infrastructure of the ditches of the SAM embankment and the network of secondary rural ditches that seemed to drain and distribute waters in the parceled fields next to the large contemporary sites. In Ponte Moro off-site we captured the chrono-stratigraphic position of SAM embankment through the dating of two peat samples undertaken immediately before and after the stratigraphic position of the embankment. The datings have yielded an earliest date for the construction (MBA-RBA) and a later date of the abandonment of the earthen structure (RBA-FBA). In the Fosso Sarego off-site the stratigraphy documented the composition and the morphology of the embankment and its lateral ditches. These were connected with the neighboring ditches and drains, and especially with the droveway, a road of service for herding that crossed the cultivated area of the CdT near-site, to reach meadows and pastures of wetlands placed within the perifluvial r. Tartaro strechtes. On the sections and on open-area excavations at the Fosso Fazzion off-site were found the remains of anthropic surfaces, connected with the use of pits and silos well placed next to small sites (farms), corresponding to the first evidence of a stable-occupation of land, dating back to the transition between the EBA and MBA. In the Stanghelle off-site were detected morphologies of long pairs of rural ditches filled by manure from the nearby village and dated to a horizon of between EBA and MBA, similarly to Fazzion off-site. Finally at the near-site the so-called hydraulic- node of CdT, an open-area investigated at the intersection of drains protruding from the moat of the SE corral, ceramic fragments in situ dating to RBA were recovered, attesting the connections with irrigation ditches around small enclosed fields. The comparison of these datings, the relative chronology and stratigraphic relationships established between SAM, channels, ditches, and agrarian drains revealed the possibility of achieving a first definition of land organization in two agrarian-settlement phases for the two major CdT and FP sites. The archaeobotanist contribution from a first set of pollen analysis carried out from Ponte Moro samples, allowed to specify the important role of grass-grazing percent in relation of cultivated land and woodland, the latter testified by an higher percent of AP compared to the average of Emilian data. The chronological contribution from finds proposed here, concerned the analysis of a complete sample of ceramic material recovered from a intrasite excavation by F. Zorzi made around the mid of the last century and documented in a dissertation by Zanetti (1970 - 71). It allowed {{for the first time to}} present aspects of material culture (pottery facies), belonging to the first large RBA settlement of CdT, surrounded by the embanked. On these basis was initiated a revision of the stratigraphic position of the two samples for 14 C dating collected in the 90 ’s of the last century from the great embankment of CdT, both related to MBA/RBA. In the light of the analysis of the above mentioned ceramics, it was possible to discriminate a phase of MBA 3 nucleated site without bounding embankment, but probably with a moat, from the later phase of RBA with massive embankment and surrounded by multiple ditches. Finally, the juxtaposition of the two systems separated from the earthen bank of the SAM, first meadows and pastures, latter fields delimited by long ditches (maybe opened fields) and others small and closed, it has given rise to an important result directed to the definition of socio-political organisation which regulated this fundamental transect in the MBA-RBA for the economy and polity of VGVM near the sites of CDT and FP. The construction of the SAM embankment, erected to preserve the balanced distribution of lands allocated to support the two major sites, could therefore be reviewed as an expression of a huge collective work, continuously maintained, presumably demanded by the elite-polity of VGVM, to prevent the formation of peatlands. These, due to the rise of water table for paleoidrographic reasons, tended to invade the cultivated fields. This engineering earthwork had to play an important role for regulation and control for the drain and irrigation network made of main and secondary ditches extending to the nearby fields, before dissipating in the lower land of marginal pasture-wet meadows, next to fluvial woodland...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundCellulase enzymes {{have been}} {{reported}} to contribute with a significant share of the total costs and greenhouse gas emissions of lignocellulosic ethanol production today. A potential future alternative to purchasing enzymes from an <b>off-site</b> manufacturer is to integrate enzyme and ethanol production, using microorganisms and part of the lignocellulosic material as feedstock for enzymes. This study modelled two such integrated process designs for ethanol from logging residues from spruce production, and compared it to an <b>off-site</b> case based on existing data regarding purchased enzymes. Greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy balances were studied in a life-cycle assessment, and cost performance in a techno-economic analysis. ResultsThe base case scenario suggests that greenhouse gas emissions per MJ of ethanol could be significantly lower in the integrated cases than in the <b>off-site</b> case. However, the difference between the integrated and <b>off-site</b> cases is reduced with alternative assumptions regarding enzyme dosage and the environmental impact of the purchased enzymes. The comparison of primary energy balances did not show any significant difference between the cases. The minimum ethanol selling price, to reach break-even costs, was from 0. 568 to 0. 622 EUR L− 1 for the integrated cases, as compared to 0. 581 EUR L− 1 for the <b>off-site</b> case. ConclusionsAn integrated process design could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from lignocellulose-based ethanol production, and the cost of an integrated process could be comparable to purchasing enzymes produced <b>off-site.</b> This study focused on the environmental and economic assessment of an integrated process, and in order to strengthen the comparison to the <b>off-site</b> case, more detailed and updated data regarding industrial <b>off-site</b> enzyme production are especially important...|$|R

Findings - The results reveal a positive linear relationship in <b>off-site</b> construction between "employee empowerment factors" and, explicitly fabrication-yard "productivity-levels".

Practical implications - Most academic studies of <b>off-site</b> construction remain largely anecdotal and lack an empirical objective study; as a result, this (fabrication-yard) case-study research provides a useful approach to measure empirically the link between employee empowerment and productivity of <b>off-site</b> construction. Originality/value - Employee empowerment in the construction industry has long been a focus of analyses; however, there remains a lack of consensus and very few studies into the direct relationship between employee empowerment on the one-hand, and productivity in <b>off-site</b> construction on the other-hand. It is argued here that the on-going new research undertaken in the present study will go beyond subjective opinion towards objective measurement of actual performance in <b>off-site</b> construction...|$|R
