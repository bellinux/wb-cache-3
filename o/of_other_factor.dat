40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that they do not {{consider}} the temporal nature of data, classic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, are widely applied to time series data. In this paper, we introduce a factor decomposition specific for time series that builds upon the Bayesian multivariate autoregressive model and hence evades the assumption that data points are mutually independent. The key is to find a low-rank estimation of the autoregressive matrices. As in the probabilistic version <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> models, this induces a latent low-dimensional representation of the original data. We discuss some possible generalisations and alternatives, with the most relevant being a technique for simultaneous smoothing and dimensionality reduction. To illustrate the potential applications, we apply the model on a synthetic data set and different types of neuroimaging data (EEG and ECoG) ...|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the contribution of the total antioxidant activity of different types of coffees and some herbal infusions regularly used in the region of Macedonia and their contribution for general health conditions. As a method of work was prepared a questionnaire about the intake of different types of refreshing drinks that theoretically contains high amounts of antioxidants. This questionnaire was made on 100 examinees from student population and it related the average number of consumed drinks per day with the frequency of occurrence of common cold. The results showed that 73 of examinees consumed 1 - 2 coffees and teas/on day, rich in antioxidants didn’t get cold or have common cold only once. Fourteen didn’t consume this kind of drinks and they got cold 4 - 5 times on this period.

In this paper, our over-arching question is whether such big data are useful for modelling low frequency macroeconomic variables such as unemployment, inflation and GDP. In particular, we analyze the predictive benefits associated with the use dimension reducing independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse principal component analysis (SPCA), coupled with a variety <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> estimation as well as data shrinkage methods, including bagging, boosting, and the elastic net, among others. We do so by carrying out a forecasting horse-race, involving the estimation of 28 different baseline model types, each constructed using a variety of specification approaches, estimation approaches, and benchmark econometric models; and all used in the prediction of 11 key macroeconomic variables relevant for monetary policy assessment. In many instances, we find that various of our benchmark specifications, including autoregressive (AR) models, AR models with exogenous variables, and (Bayesian) model averaging, do not dominate more complicated nonlinear methods, and that using a combination of factor and other shrinkage methods often yields superior predictions. For example, simple averaging methods are mean square forecast error (MSFE) best in only 9 of 33 key cases considered. This is rather surprising new evidence that model averaging methods do not necessarily yield MSFE-best predictions. However, in order to beat model averaging methods, including arithmetic mean and Bayesian averaging approaches, we have introduced into our horse-race numerous complex new models involve combining complicated factor estimation methods with interesting new forms of shrinkage. For example, SPCA yields MSFE-best prediction models in many cases, particularly when coupled with shrinkage.

40|$|In Yogyakarta, nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) shows a poor {{response to}} radiotherapy treatment. Previous study showed a prolonged overall treatment time (OTT), due to interruptions during treatment. This study explores {{the association between}} clinical outcome and OTT. Secondary, the relation between clinical outcome and disease stage, waiting time to radiation (WT) and chemotherapy schedule was explored. In this retrospective cohort, 142 patients who started curative intent radiotherapy for NPC between March 2009 and May 2014, with or without chemotherapy, were included. The median follow up time was 1. 9 years. Data was collected on WT, OTT, disease stage, and chemotherapy schedule. Time factors were log-transformed. Clinical outcome was defined as therapy response, loco-regional control (LRC), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The median WT was 117 days (range 12 - 581) and OTT was 58 days (43 - 142). OTT and disease stage were not associated {{to any of the}} clinical outcome parameters. The log-WT was associated to poor therapy outcome (HR 1. 68; 95 % ci: 1. 09 - 2. 61), LRC (HR 1. 66; 95 % ci: 1. 15 - 2. 39), and DFS (HR 1. 4; 95 % ci: 1. 09 - 1. 81). In the multivariable analysis, significant hazard risk for poor therapy response, LRC, DFS and OS were seen for patients who didn't received concurrent chemotherapy. Not receiving concurrent chemotherapy showed the strongest risk for poor outcome. Since the choice of chemotherapy is related to a variety of factors, like the WT and patient's physical condition when radiation can start, careful interpretation is needed. Reason for not finding a relation between OTT and clinical outcome might be the low number of patients who finished radiotherapy within 7 weeks, or by a stronger detrimental effect <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E
40|$|Stimulation of {{the protein}} kinase A (PKA) {{signalling}} pathway exerts an inhibitory {{effect on the}} proliferation of numerous cells, including T lymphocytes. In CD 4 + T helper cells, stimulation of PKA leads to suppression of interleukin 2 (IL- 2) induction, while induction of the genes coding for the lymphokines IL- 4 and IL- 5 is enhanced. We show that the differential effect of PKA activity on induction of the IL- 2 and IL- 4 genes is mediated through their promoters. One major target of the suppressive effect of PKA is the kappa B site in the IL- 2 promoter. A kappa B site is missing in the IL- 4 promoter. Mutations preventing factor binding to the IL- 2 kappa B site result {{in a loss of}} PKA-mediated suppression of IL- 2 promoter activity. Furthermore, activation of the PKA signalling pathway impairs the inducible activity of multiple kappa B sites of the IL- 2 promoter, but not <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites. The reduction in activity of kappa B sites in activated and PKA-stimulated T cells is accompanied by changes in the concentration and DNA binding of Rel/NF-kappa B factors. Stimulation of the PKA pathway in Jurkat T cells with the PKA activator forskolin leads to an increase in synthesis of c-Rel and p 105 /p 50, while synthesis of p 65 /RelA remains unchanged. However, nuclear translocation and DNA binding of p 65 is distinctly impaired, probably due to a retarded degradation of I kappa B-alpha. In a similar way, stimulation of the PKA signalling pathway inhibits nuclear translocation of p 65 and generation of nuclear kappa B complexes in peripheral T lymphocytes from murine lymph nodes. These results indicate that PKA-mediated suppression of NF-kappa B activity {{plays an important role in}} the control of activation of peripheral T lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{comparing}} {{the access to}} health care of rural and urban populations have been contradictory and inconclusive. These studies are complicated by the influence <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> which {{have been shown to be}} related to access and utilization. This study assesses the equity of {{access to health care}} services across the rural-urban continuum in Canada before and after taking other determinants of access into account. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of the population of the 10 provinces of Canada using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS 2. 1). Five different measures of access and utilization are compared across the continuum of rural-urban. Known determinants of utilization are taken into account according to Andersen's Health Behaviour Model (HBM); location of residence at the levels of province, health region, and community is also controlled for. Results This study found that residents of small cities not adjacent to major centres, had the highest reported utilisation rates of influenza vaccines and family physician services, were most likely to have a regular medical doctor, and were most likely to report unmet need. Among the rural categories there was a gradient with the most rural being least likely to have had a flu shot, use specialist physicians services, or have a regular medical doctor. Residents of the most urban centres were more likely to report using specialist physician services. Many of these differences are diminished or eliminated once other factors are accounted for. After adjusting for other factors those living in the most urban areas were more likely to have seen a specialist physician. Those in rural communities had a lower odds of receiving a flu shot and having a regular medical doctor. People residing in the most urban and most rural communities were less likely to have a regular medical doctor. Those in any of the rural categories were less likely to report unmet need. Conclusion Inequities in access to care along the rural-urban continuum exist and can be masked when evaluation is done at a very large scale with gross indicators of rural-urban. Understanding the relationship between rural-urban and other determinants will help policy makers to target interventions appropriately: to specific demographic, provincial, community, or rural categories. </p...|$|E
