5|$|Miller {{warmed up}} for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF. In the Test, played at Bramall Lane, Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> and head respectively, {{provoking}} an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led to calls for him to start taking it seriously, instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball. Despite this, Australia lost the match.|$|E
5|$|Once a recruit was {{accepted}} he was 'marked' <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm,</b> presumably a tattoo or brand, to facilitate recognition if {{he attempted to}} desert. The recruit was then issued with an identification disk (which was worn around the neck) and a certificate of enlistment (probatoria). He was then assigned to a unit. A law of 375 required those with superior fitness to be assigned to the comitatenses. In the 4th century, the minimum length of service was 20 years (24 years in some limitanei units). This compares with 25 years in both legions and auxilia during the Principate.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> of a headless corpse.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall then struck Edrich on {{the hand}} with a short ball, {{provoking}} angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton {{found it difficult to}} position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm,</b> and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire’s call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.|$|E

5|$|McLeod {{started in}} the semi-final game against the United States on August 6, in what many have called a {{controversial}} match. In the 78th minute of the game, Canada was leading, 3–2, when the referee ruled that McLeod had held the ball {{for more than six}} seconds, going by a rule that is rarely enforced, and gave an indirect free kick inside the penalty area to the United States. McLeod faced no challenge with the free kick; however, the referee then called a penalty after the ball struck Canadian player Marie-Eve Nault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm.</b> American striker Abby Wambach took the penalty kick, and it went past McLeod. The match went into extra time, with Alex Morgan heading in the ball past McLeod's fingertips in the 123rd minute, resulting in a win for the United States.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} before her wedding, Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is bitten <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> by a male shape {{shifting}} alien. Her boss, Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) kills the alien, and Gwen attends her hen night though is troubled by her wound. She wakes {{up the next morning}} heavily pregnant. Jack arrives along with Torchwood's medic Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to examine Gwen and tries to persuade her to cancel her wedding. Gwen's fiancee Rhys (Kai Owen) also tries to postpone the wedding in Gwen's interest but Gwen insists that the wedding go ahead as she desires nothing more than to marry him. The sudden pregnancy is explained to Gwen and Rhys' families as their own child. Gwen's mother (Sharon Morgan) and father (William Thomas) are excited at the prospect of a grandchild, but Rhys' parents suspect Gwen of being pregnant by another man. Torchwood agent Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) is sent to the wedding venue {{to keep an eye on}} Gwen and to deliver a new wedding dress to accommodate her alien pregnancy.|$|E

The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.|$|E

5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows {{there had to be}} a considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–08 season saw Central Coast win {{its first}} premiership on goal {{difference}} ahead of Newcastle, following a final round {{that began with}} Central Coast and three other clubs level on 31 points. The final series began with a 2–0 loss to Newcastle in {{the first leg of}} its major semi-final, but the Mariners forced the tie to extra time by holding a 2–0 lead in the second leg after 90 minutes. A 94th-minute goal by Sasho Petrovski, who had scored earlier to level the tie, gave Central Coast a 3–2 win on aggregate, putting the Mariners through to the 2008 A-League Grand Final. In a rematch with Newcastle, the Jets defeated Central Coast 1–0 in the Grand Final, which ended in controversy due to an uncalled handball against Newcastle in Central Coast Mariners penalty box during the closing seconds of the match. If called, the foul would have given Central Coast a penalty kick and a chance to equalise. As Mariners players disputed referee Mark Shield's decision, goalkeeper Danny Vuković struck Shield <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm,</b> resulting in an immediate sending off and later suspension. Vuković was suspended from both domestic and international competition for nine months, with an additional six-months' suspended ban; the latter period was reduced to three months on appeal. Despite further appeals, the ban was eventually confirmed by FIFA in June, to include banning the young keeper from competing at the 2008 Olympic Games. The ban lasted into October; in response, Central Coast signed former Manchester United and Australian international keeper Mark Bosnich on a seven-week contract.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball, and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. With 22 runs on the board, Johnston bowled Washbrook with a yorker, and six runs later, Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves. Lindwall bowled a series of short balls. One hit Compton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> and the batsman attempted to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting, resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added. They reached lunch at 57/2. Upon the resumption, Crapp began to accelerate, hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson. Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37. Dollery took a single to get off the mark but then missed a yorker from Johnston and was bowled. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. After 170 minutes of slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught behind. At 119/5, Compton returned to the field, his wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. Yardley fell to Toshack for 22 with the score at 141/6, bringing Evans to the crease. Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans to leave England 216/7.|$|E

25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from {{the arm of}} the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull {{at the back of the}} ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> of the spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> of the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for conductive hearing losses or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|E
