40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how historic records <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> can inform service life estimations and preventive conservation planning for historic structures. After {{a discussion of}} service life and preventive conservation, this thesis extracted and analyzed historic mentions <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> in the record books of the Concord School House in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which span from 1775 to 1987. Repairs to the building’s masonry, carpentry, windows, finishes, and roof assemblies were chosen for investigation. Data collected included the length <b>of</b> time between <b>repairs</b> and the recorded prices <b>of</b> <b>repairs.</b> The prices <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> were converted into 2013 dollars and used {{as an indicator of}} the size <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> and a means <b>of</b> comparison between <b>repairs</b> in different time periods. Ultimately, this thesis found that data from historic records <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> was not specific enough to stand alone in estimating service lives of the building systems for use in preventive conservation planning. However, analysis of the historic records identified repair cycles which, when supplemented with conditions assessments, could be used to inform preventive conservation planning and the formation of building reinvestment plans. Investigation <b>of</b> historic <b>repair</b> records also revealed the importance of long-term, consistent care in preserving historic structures, and the need to conceptualize repair plans in terms of centuries rather than human lifespans...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> concrete structures {{continues to}} be a major global concern. Regardless <b>of</b> improvements in <b>repairing</b> materials and methods, several repaired concrete structures still fail prematurely, leading to costly and time consuming <b>repairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>repairs.</b> Studies in the field <b>of</b> concrete <b>repairs</b> showed that almost 50 % <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> concrete structures had failed in Europe and USA. Simultaneously, numerous existing concrete structures needs to be repaired as they do not meet today's safety standard. As a result, annually billions of EUR will continue to be spent in order to repair deteriorated concrete structures. The need to mitigate premature failure <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> concrete structures has to inspire many researchers to develop service life prediction model for repaired concrete structures. However, till today, service life <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> concrete structures is just an estimate which relies on individual's experience. Scientifically developed service life prediction model for repaired concrete structures is highly desired for optimizing selection <b>of</b> <b>repairing</b> materials and techniques in turn diminishing economic loss due to premature repaired concrete failure. The aims of this paper is generally to review the performance <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> concrete structures and the current status in the development of service life prediction models for repaired concrete structures specially exposed to exposure class XD (chlorides excluding seawater). Future research and development of service life prediction model for repaired concrete structures is discussed based on today's research and practice on the area...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} technical and economic implementation <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> <b>of</b> bituminous pavements using whitetopping technology at the example of classical jointed solutions and the continuous reinforcement. The problems <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> <b>of</b> asphalt roads {{in the context of}} steadily progressive degradation of flexible pavements in Poland are discussed. The types of pavement constructions were presented, with particular emphasis on characteristics of flexible pavements. There were identified and described significant factors contributing to damage, which consequently lead to surface degradation. Also there have been described the types of concrete pavements and their characteristics, taking into account modern technology of cement concrete overlays made in various technologies. The results of the analysis of technical and economic implementation <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> <b>of</b> flexible pavements using whitetopping technology are presented at the example of classical jointed solutions and the continuous reinforcement. The benefits and potential difficulties in the implementation <b>of</b> pavements <b>repairs</b> as cement concrete technology are indicated.

5|$|In 1593 {{there was}} a fresh crisis with Spain and the brass guns needed for the English navy were in short supply. Brass {{artillery}} pieces were therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including Camber.

In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} outline a novel three-layer model {{and a new}} birth–death element {{solution}} technique to evaluate static strength of notched metallic panel repaired with bonded composite patch and to optimize material parameters. The higher order 3 D, 8 -node isotropic solid element and 8 -node anisotropic layered solid element with three degrees of freedom per node are respectively implemented to model substrate panel, adhesive layer and composite patch to establish three-layer model <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> panel. The new solving technique based on birth–death element is developed to allow solution of the stress pattern <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> panel for identifying failure mode. The new model and its solution are used to model failure mode and residual strength <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> panel, and the obtained results have a good agreement with the experimental findings. Finally, the influences of material parameter of adhesive layer and composite patch on the residual strength <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> panel are investigated for optimizing material properties to meet operational and environmental constraints...|$|R
