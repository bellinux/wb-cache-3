40|$|Based on {{the general}} theory of errors, a {{detailed}} analysis of errors in determining the stress intensity factors by the method of reflected caustics was developed. A classification of errors with respect of their sources, as well as their influence on the experimentally determined value of stress intensity factors in cracked plates was undertaken. A practical guidance was given for minimising the individual or global errors of the optical set-up used by the method of caustics. Finally, the influence of the <b>optical</b> <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> {{on the size of the}} caustics was also analysed and an optimal choice of the optical set-up was indicated. © 1981...|$|E
40|$|The plane {{problem of}} a biphase plate {{containing}} an internal crack along the straight interface of the two phases was examined when the biphase plate is subjected to a biaxial load at infinity. The closed form expressions for the equations of the initial curves and the caustics formed around the crack tips were established by using the formulation for the complex stress function of this problem given by Rice and Sih. Similar equations were also established based on the two-term approximate solution as it was introduced by Liebowitz and co-workers and formulated by Piva and Viola. Comparisons of the discrepancies and errors between the two solutions were established and plotted in convenient diagrams. It was shown that the geometric characteristics of the optical set-up for forming the caustics {{played an important role}} in the accuracy of the results of the approximate solution and especially the <b>optical</b> <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> of the set-up. Furthermore, and more important is the influence of the radius of the initial curve normalized to the semi-length of the crack. For values of this ratio below some limit, the approximate results may be considered as sufficiently accurate. The solution was reduced to a monophase plate and this result made this study valid for the basic {{problem of a}}n internal crack in an infinite elastic and isotropic plate. Important results were derived concerning the appropriate use of the method of caustics to evaluate SIFs at singularities in the stress field. © 1987...|$|E

5000|$|The main {{benefit of}} a video {{magnifier}} over purely <b>optical</b> <b>magnification</b> is that the video magnifier allows greater magnification across a larger field of view.

Thus, while a [...] "full page magnifier" [...] based on a fresnel lens can span some 625 cm2 (A4), it typically achieves no more than 1.4x magnification (advertised as [...] "2x" [...] if measured by area instead of the scale factor); an aspheric segment hand magnifier can achieve a scale factor in excess of 2 (area factor in excess of 4) but typically measures no more than 10 cm x 3 cm, and higher <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> require conventional lenses that focus on a very small area.

40|$|BackgroundMicrosurgical {{techniques}} are considered standard procedures in reconstructive surgery. Although microsurgery {{by itself is}} defined as surgery aided by <b>optical</b> <b>magnification,</b> there are no guidelines for determining in which clinical situations a microscope or loupe should be used. Therefore, we conducted standardized experiments to objectively {{assess the impact of}} <b>optical</b> <b>magnification</b> in microsurgery. MethodsSixteen participants of microsurgical training courses had to complete 2 sets of experiments. Each set had to be performed with an unaided eye, surgical loupes, and a regular operating microscope. The first set of experiments included coaptation of a chicken femoral nerve, and the second set consisted of anastomosing porcine coronary arteries. Evaluation of the sutured nerves and vessels were performed by 2 experienced microsurgeons using an operating microscope. ResultsThe 16 participants of the study completed all of the experiments. The nerve coaptation and vascular anastomoses exercises showed a direct relationship of error frequency and lower <b>optical</b> <b>magnification,</b> meaning that the highest number of microsurgical errors occurred with the unaided eye. For nerve coaptation, there was a strong relationship (P< 0. 05) between the number of mistakes and magnification, and this relationship was very strong (P< 0. 01) for vascular anastomoses. ConclusionsWe were able to prove that microsurgical success is directly related to <b>optical</b> <b>magnification.</b> The human eye's ability to discriminate potentially important anatomical structures is limited, which might be detrimental for clinical results. Although not legally mandatory, surgeries such as reparative surgery after hand trauma should be conducted with magnifying devices for achieving optimal patient outcomes...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method for selecting the most luminous galaxies detected by IRAS based on their extreme values of R, the ratio of 60 micron and B-band luminosity. These objects have optical counterparts that are close to or below the limits of Schmidt surveys. We have tested our method on a 1079 deg^ 2 region of sky, where we have selected a sample of IRAS sources with 60 micron flux densities greater than 0. 2 Jy, corresponding to a redshift limit z~ 1 for objects with far-IR luminosities of 10 ^{ 13 } L_sun. Optical identifications for these {{were obtained from the}} UK Schmidt Telescope plates, using the likelihood ratio method. Optical spectroscopy has been carried out to reliably identify and measure the redshifts of six objects with very faint optical counterparts, which are the only objects with R> 100 in the sample. One object is a hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIG) at z= 0. 834. Of the remaining, fainter objects, five are ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) with a mean redshift of 0. 45, higher than the highest known redshift of any non-hyperluminous ULIG prior to this study. High excitation lines reveal the presence of an active nucleus in the HyLIG, just as in the other known infrared-selected HyLIGs. In contrast, no high excitation lines are found in the non-hyperluminous ULIGs. We discuss the implications of our results for the number density of HyLIGs at z< 1 and for the evolution of the infrared galaxy population out to this redshift, and show that substantial evolution is indicated. Our selection method is robust against the presence of gravitational lensing if the <b>optical</b> and infrared <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> are similar, and we suggest a way of using it to select candidate gravitationally lensed infrared galaxies.

40|$|Summary. The <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> (M) of {{the retina}} is the linear extent of visual striate cortex {{to which each}} degree of the retina projects. It has been {{suggested}} that <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> is directly proportional to visual acuity, but <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> measured in monkeys was compared with visual acuity in man. Here we first describe calculation of the <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> in man, and then compare it to human visual acuity. We calculated 3 / [for the first 30 degrees of the lower visual field by using infor mation provided by Brindley and Lewin (1968), who plotted the distribution of phosphenes evoked by stimulation of visual cortex in a human patient with electrodes implanted on the visual cortex. Since the inter-electrode distance was specified it was possible to calculate M for each of many pairs of electrodes by measuring the angular separation and mean eccentricity of the corresponding pairs of phosphenes. For the lower visual field, M was approximately 4 ram/degree at 2 degrees eccentricity and declined monotonically to 0. 5 ram/degree at 25 degrees eccentricity. The results indicated that the reciprocal of M is directly proportional to the minimum angle of resolution and, correspondingly, that the <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> is directly proportional to visual acuity in man. By extrapolating this function for the whole of the visual field it was possible to estimate the area of striate cortex. The total extent of striate cortex estimated in this way agreed closely with previous direct measurements, suggesting that the measurements of M are accurate.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} super-resolution {{reconstruction}} constraints.
