40|$|The {{existence}} of the phenomenon of “underpricing ” is a well-established fact for the common stock initial public offerings (IPOs). Research concerning the primary capital market {{is found to be}} unequivocal in its conclusion that initial public offerings are offered at a discount. It has been found that an average firm goes public with an offer price that is lower than the price that prevails in the immediate aftermarket. As a result, IPOs register significant excess returns {{on the first day of}} trading. Underpricing is a phenomenon that is largely restricted to the <b>opening</b> <b>transaction.</b> And hence, the underpricing is almost entirely “corrected ” by the market at the <b>opening</b> <b>transaction.</b> A worldwide survey of literature on the phenomenon of Underpricing of IPOs exhibit three fundamental characteristics: (a) the initial price reaction phenomenon or in other words ‘underpricing’: the immediate after market price, on average is significantly higher than price at which the initial offer was made; (b) the Hot Issue Phenomenon: there are distinct cycles outlined, both in the number of issues that come to the market and the level of initial price reactions; (c) the long-run “Underperformance ” phenomenon: initial offers are said to perform dismally in the long-run compared to the industry counterparts for the same period...|$|E

A checkpoint is an automatic, asynchronous {{snapshot of the}} state of an application and the position in a source stream. In the case of a failure, a Flink program with checkpointing enabled will, upon recovery, resume processing from the last completed checkpoint, ensuring that Flink maintains exactly-once state semantics within an application.
