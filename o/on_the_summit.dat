5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> The base of a stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period and {{it may have been a}} hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way down the hill and may have been the head of the cross that stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E

5|$|A {{central part}} of Klamath mythology, the {{mountain}} offers activities such as hiking and horseback riding. Historically, the area around it has been inhabited by Native American tribes and settlers. Until the 1970s, a fire lookout tower sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of the mountain, and its foundation remains to this day.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{conditions}} ended suddenly, 11,550 years BP, {{when the}} Gulf Stream current was re-established. Periglacial processes in seasonal freeze-thaw conditions, both present and past, have produced sorted stone stripes and solifluction lobes and sheets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> ridge of Helvellyn. These are {{one reason why}} the area was included in the Helvellyn & Fairfield SSSI.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 a small {{aeroplane}} landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> plateau of Helvellyn {{and took off}} again. The plane was an Avro 585 Gosport, a two-seater biplane flown by Bert Hinkler, a test pilot who worked for A V Roe, the plane's manufacturers, at Woodford Aerodrome near Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> plateau to assist walkers {{attempting}} the descent in foggy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on {{the ethics of}} such additions. Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create {{a false sense of}} security and could lessen mountaineers' sense of responsibility for their own safety. Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> and the potentially life-saving role they could play. A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, 1823, Joseph F. Goodrich, an American missionary, {{made the}} first {{recorded}} ascent in a single day; however, a small arrangement of stones he observed suggested {{he was not the}} first human <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> He recorded four ecosystems as he travelled from base to summit, and also visited Lake Waiau.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s a {{group of}} American astronomers became {{interested}} in the higher peaks of the Gammons as possible sites for an observatory, and several parties camped for some time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> of Mount McKinlay and Benbonyathe Hill (vehicle tracks were also graded to <b>the</b> <b>summits),</b> but nothing further was done (a large observatory is located at Arkaroola, about a hundred kilometres to the northeast). Relics from these camps remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> of <b>the</b> two hills, and there is reportedly still an overgrown vehicle track {{along the top of the}} Blue Range in places.|$|R

5|$|The first {{building}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Snowdon {{was erected}} in 1838 to sell refreshments, and a licence to sell intoxicating liquor was granted in 1845. Very basic accommodation was also provided for visitors. When the Snowdon Mountain Railway was opened in 1896, it added its own accommodation and sales outlet near the summit.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} was not climbed {{again until}} 1834, nearly 350 years later, {{when it was}} ascended barefoot by Jean Liotard, accompanied for one-quarter of the way by local explorers. Less than a month later, it was climbed by seven people at the same time, who reportedly danced and sang La Marseillaise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} routes up the stack, the most {{commonly}} used of which is the original landward facing E1 (Extremely Severe). A log book in a Tupperware container is buried in a cairn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> as an ascensionists' record. As many as fifty ascents of the stack are made each year.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} groups of awards: one for the activators, {{operating}} from <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> according to <b>the</b> SOTA rules, one for the chasers (who contact <b>the</b> activators <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits),</b> and one for non-amateur radio operators doing shortwave listening.|$|R
50|$|Melaleuca pyramidalis occurs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> of Walshs Pyramid, Mount Diamantina (on Hinchinbrook Island) and Mount Leach (near Ingham). It grows {{mostly in}} open forest on rocky hilltops.|$|R

5|$|A geology party, {{headed by}} Manasseh Cutler, named the {{mountain}} in 1784. The Crawford Path, the oldest mountain hiking trail in the United States, was laid out in 1819 as a bridle path from Crawford Notch to the summit {{and has been in}} use ever since. Ethan Allen Crawford built a house <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> in 1821, which lasted until a storm in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in the fields between West and East Worldham reveal that the area has been visited and inhabited {{since at least the}} Palaeolithic era. An Iron Age Hillfort, dated to around 100 BC, lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of King John's Hill, to the east of East Worldham. The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester which passed below the hill over what is now Green Street and Pookles Lane.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of the volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases {{of the presence of}} subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
50|$|The Hohe Kisten is a {{mountain}} with two distinct sides: a rocky northern side <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> section {{looks like a}} large box (German: Kiste = box), and a gentle southern side <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> barely stands out at all.|$|R
5000|$|A {{post office}} called Ash Hill was {{established}} in 1861, and remained in operation until 1894. The community was named for ash trees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> near <b>the</b> town site.|$|R

5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, glacier caves were {{discovered}} on the then-smooth glacier surface. Many of these glacier caves were {{big enough to}} explore, like the glacier caves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Mount Rainier. Most of the glacier caves were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot steam and volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground caves and passageways in the glacier were mapped and studied.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to music, Fiasco has pursued other business ventures, including fashion. He runs two clothing lines, Righteous Kung-Fu and Trilly & Truly; he has designed sneakers for Reebok. He {{has been involved}} with charitable activities, including the Summit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summit</b> expedition, and in 2010 he recorded a benefit single for victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Fiasco is also noted for his anti-establishment views, which he has expressed in both interviews and his music.|$|E
