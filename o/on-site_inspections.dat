5|$|In October 1977, the {{original}} {{parties to the}} PTBT renewed discussion of a comprehensive test ban in Geneva. Through {{the end of the}} 1970s, the US, UK, and Soviet Union reached agreement on draft provisions prohibiting all testing, temporarily banning PNEs, and establishing a verification system including <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections.</b> However, the sides remained at odds over the precise details of verification and talks would permanently disband with the departure of President Jimmy Carter in 1981.|$|E
5|$|By March 1962, the trilateral {{talks in}} Geneva had shifted to 18-party talks at the UN Disarmament Conference. On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections.</b> This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.|$|E
5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E

Inspectors will collect evidence on the ground at the suspected site. Such an inspection can only be requested and approved by Member States once the CTBT has entered into force. A large <b>on-site</b> <b>inspection</b> exercise was carried out in September 2008 in Kazakhstan. Another full-scale exercise (known as the Integrated Field Exercise 2014 or IFE14) was carried out in Jordan and Austria from 3 November to 9 December 2014. It was the largest <b>on-site</b> <b>inspection</b> exercise conducted to date and it involved four years of preparation, 150 tons of specialized equipment and over 200 international experts.|$|R
5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections.</b> The two sides disagreed over the number of black boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three. On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E

500|$|In September 1959, Khrushchev {{visited the}} US While the test ban {{was not a}} focus on conversations, a {{positive}} meeting with Eisenhower at Camp David eventually led Tsarapkin to propose a technical working group in November 1959 that would consider the issues of <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> and seismic decoupling in the [...] "spirit of Camp David." [...] Within the working group, Soviet delegates allowed for the timing of <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> to be grounded in seismic data, but insisted on conditions that were seen as excessively strict. The Soviets also recognized the theory behind decoupling, but dismissed its practical applications. The working group closed in December with no progress and significant hostility. Eisenhower issued a statement blaming [...] "the recent unwillingness of the politically guided Soviet experts to give serious scientific consideration {{to the effectiveness of}} seismic techniques for the detection of underground nuclear explosions." [...] Eisenhower simultaneously declared that the US would not be held to its testing moratorium when it expired on 31 December 1959, though pledged to not test if Geneva talks progressed. The Soviet Union followed by reiterating its decision to not test as long as Western states did not test.|$|E

500|$|In June 1959, {{a report}} of a panel headed by Lloyd Berkner, a physicist, was {{introduced}} into discussions by Wadsworth. The report specifically concerned whether the Geneva System could be improved without {{increasing the number of}} control posts. Berkner's proposed measures were seen as highly costly and the technical findings themselves were accompanied by a caveat about the panel's high degree of uncertainty given limited data. Around the same time, analysis conducted by the Livermore National Laboratory and RAND Corporation at Teller's instruction found that the seismic effect of an underground test could be artificially dampened (referred to as [...] "decoupling") to the point that a 300-kiloton detonation would appear in seismic readings as a one-kiloton detonation. These findings were largely affirmed by pro-ban scientists, including Bethe. The third blow to the verification negotiations was provided by a panel chaired by Robert Bacher, which found that even <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> would have serious difficulty determining whether an underground test had been conducted.|$|E
500|$|To {{break the}} {{deadlock}} over verification, Macmillan proposed a compromise in February 1959 whereby {{each of the}} original parties {{would be subject to}} a set number of <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> each year. In May 1959, Khrushchev and Eisenhower agreed to explore Macmillan's quota proposal, though Eisenhower made further test-ban negotiations conditional on the Soviet Union dropping its Control Commission veto demand and participating in technical discussions on identification of high-altitude nuclear explosions. Khrushchev agreed to the latter and was noncommittal on the former. A working group in Geneva would eventually devise a costly system of 5–6 satellites orbiting at least [...] above the earth, though it could not say with certainty that such a system would be able to determine the origin of a high-altitude test. US negotiators also questioned whether high-altitude tests could evade detection via radiation shielding. Concerning Macmillan's compromise, the Soviet Union privately suggested it would accept a quota of three inspections per year. The US argued that the quota should be set according to scientific necessity (i.e., be set according to the frequency of seismic events).|$|E

500|$|On 21 March 1961, test-ban {{negotiations}} resumed in Geneva and Arthur Dean, a lead US envoy, {{offered a}} new proposal {{in an attempt}} {{to bridge the gap between}} the two sides. The early Kennedy proposal largely grew out of later Eisenhower efforts, with a ban on all tests but low-yield underground ones (below magnitude 4.75), which would be subject to a three-year moratorium. The US and UK proposed 20 <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> per annum, while the Soviet Union proposed three. The verification procedures included in the Anglo-American plan were unacceptable to Tsarapkin, who responded with separate proposals rejected by the Western powers. Specifically, the Soviet Union proposed a [...] "troika" [...] mechanism: a monitoring board composed of representatives of the West, the Soviet Union, and nonaligned states that would require unanimity before acting (effectively giving the Soviet Union veto authority). In May 1961, Kennedy attempted via secret contact between Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and a Soviet intelligence officer to settle on 15 inspections per year. This was rejected by Khrushchev.|$|E
500|$|Progress {{was further}} {{complicated}} in early 1963, {{as a group}} in the US Congress called for the Soviet proposal to be discarded {{in favor of the}} Geneva System. On 27 May 1963, 34 US Senators, led by Humphrey and Thomas J. Dodd, introduced a resolution calling for Kennedy to propose another partial ban to the Soviet Union involving national monitoring and no <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections.</b> Absent Soviet agreement, the resolution called for Kennedy to continue to [...] "pursue it with vigor, seeking the widest possible international support" [...] while suspending all atmospheric and underwater tests. The effect of the resolution was to bolster the general push for a test ban, though Kennedy initially was concerned that it would damage attempts to secure a comprehensive ban, and had administration figures (including the Joint Chiefs of Staff) reiterate a call for a comprehensive ban. That same spring of 1963, however, Kennedy had sent antinuclear activist Norman Cousins to Moscow to meet with Khrushchev, where he explained that the political situation in the US made it very difficult for Kennedy agree to a comprehensive ban with Khrushchev's required terms. Cousins also assured Khrushchev that though Kennedy had rejected Khrushchev's offer of three yearly inspections, he still was set on achieving a test ban. In March 1963, Kennedy had also held a press conference in which he re-committed to negotiations with the Soviet Union as a means of preventing rapid nuclear proliferation, which he characterized as [...] "the greatest possible danger and hazard." ...|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower had {{supported}} nuclear testing after World War II. In 1947, he rejected arguments by Stafford L. Warren, the Manhattan Project's chief physician, concerning the detrimental {{health effects of}} atmospheric testing, agreeing instead with James Bryant Conant, a chemist and participant in the Manhattan Project, who was skeptical of Warren's then-theoretical claims. Warren's arguments were lent credence {{in the scientific community}} and public by the Castle Bravo test of 1954. Eisenhower, as president, first explicitly expressed interest in a comprehensive test ban that year, arguing before the National Security Council, [...] "We could put [...] on the spot if we accepted a moratorium... Everybody seems to think that we're skunks, saber-rattlers and warmongers. We ought not miss any chance to make clear our peaceful objectives." [...] Then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had responded skeptically to the limited arms-control suggestion of Nehru, whose proposal for a test ban was discarded by the National Security Council for being [...] "not practical." [...] Harold Stassen, Eisenhower's special assistant for disarmament, argued that the US should prioritize a test ban as a first step towards comprehensive arms control, conditional on the Soviet Union accepting <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections,</b> over full disarmament. Stassen's suggestion was dismissed by others in the administration over fears that the Soviet Union would be able to conduct secret tests. On the advice of Dulles, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Lewis Strauss, and Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, Eisenhower rejected the idea of considering a test ban outside general disarmament efforts. During the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections, Eisenhower fended off challenger Adlai Stevenson, who ran in large part on support for a test ban.|$|E
