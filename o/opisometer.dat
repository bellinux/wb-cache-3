5000|$|A simple <b>opisometer</b> {{consists}} of a toothed wheel of known circumference on a handle. The wheel is placed {{in contact with the}} curved line to be measured and run along its length. By counting the number of teeth passing a mark on the handle while this is done, the length of the line can be ascertained: ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{mathematical}} {{instrument is}} a tool or device {{used in the study}} or practice of mathematics. In geometry, construction of various proofs was done using only a compass and straight edge; arguments in these proofs relied only on idealized properties of these instruments and literal construction was regarded as only an approximation. In applied mathematics, mathematical instruments were used for measuring angles and distances, in astronomy, navigation, surveying and in the measurement of time. Instruments such as the astrolabe, the quadrant, and others were used to measure and accurately record the relative positions and movements of planets and other celestial objects. The sextant and other related instruments were essential for navigation at sea. Most instruments are used within the field of geometry, including the ruler, dividers, protractor, set square, compass, ellipsograph, T-square and <b>opisometer.</b> Others are used in arithmetic (for example the abacus, slide rule and calculator) or in algebra (the integraph). In astronomy, many have said the pyramids (along with Stonehenge) were actually instruments used for tracking the stars over long periods or for the annual planting seasons.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{test the}} {{accuracy}} of the distribution of reflective zones on the feet as proposed by William Fitzgerald using the spine and kidney receptors as reference points. MethodsSpine and feet lengths were measured first along straight lines and then again, taking into consideration the anatomical curves. The spinal column was further measured with regard to its individual regions (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacrum–coccyx). Straight-line measurements were taken {{with the help of an}} anthropometer. Measurements that took into account all of the curves were performed with the <b>opisometer</b> (also known as a “map measurer”). All the measurements were accurate to within 1 mm. The study subjects were a healthy, physically fit 16 -year-old female student and a 53 -year-old male office employee exposed to an average dose of physical exercise. ResultsThe kidney receptor in the foot did not reflect onto the predetermined lumbar section of the spinal column as measured along the straight line or with regard to curves. Instead, in both subjects the kidney receptor reflected onto the thoracic spine. CoclusionTe particular level of the spinal cord that innervates the given organ controls the distribution of receptors of individual organs in the foot...|$|E
