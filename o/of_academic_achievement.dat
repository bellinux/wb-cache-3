40|$|A {{control model}} is {{one or more}} {{functional}} relationships to tie student’s measureable parameters and test tasks to {{the assessment of the}} outcomes achieved. The control models are used to measure the level <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>achievements.</b> The article surveys the <b>academic</b> <b>achievement</b> control models used in e-learning systems. It discusses a G. Rasch technique, which allows tracking the academic progress within the scope of the Item Response Theory. In traditional interpretation the G. Rasch model links the level <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>achievements</b> and the level of the test task difficulties to the probability of their correct execution. This approach has been modified. A modified approach, firstly, takes into account the behavioral factors in measuring the level of achievements; secondly, it enables to include nonmonotonic variables in a mathematical G. Rasch model. Behavioral factors are thought of as acts committed by students when working in the e-learning system, for example, access to prompt messages (or tooltips), preview of browsing fragments of the learning content, skip of test tasks, etc. The article introduces quantitative metrics of these factors based on the fuzzy sets. Experiments are conducted to confirm a non-monotonic nature of the impact some behavioral factors have on the level <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>achievements.</b> The results presented in the article are of practical application to measuring the level <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>achievements</b> during e-learning process. Obtaining the objective quantitative assessments <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>achievements</b> allows proceeding to the adaptive learning organization.

25|$|The ELEMENT study {{dealt with}} {{determinants}} <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>achievement</b> in Berlin. It {{was carried out}} in Berlin, where some of the pupils started at a Gymnasium after the 4th grade, while others stayed in primary school until 6th grade and started at different schools after the 6th grade. Factors correlated with academic achievement tend to be intercorrelated (that means that they are also correlated with other factors that determine academic achievement). The number of books owned by a pupil's parents, for example, is correlated with the parents' education. Because of this Multiple Regression Analysis was used. Multiple Regression allows us to understand the influence of one variable when the other variables are held fixed.|$|E

500|$|Liszt's intent, {{according}} to musicologist Hugh MacDonald, was for these single-movement works [...] "to display the traditional logic of symphonic thought." [...] In other words, Liszt wanted these works {{to display a}} complexity in their interplay of themes similar to that usually reserved for the opening movement of the Classical symphony; this principal self-contained section was normally considered the most important in the larger whole of the symphony in terms <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>achievement</b> and musical architecture. At the same time, Liszt wanted to incorporate the abilities of program music to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods. To capture these dramatic and evocative qualities while achieving the scale of an opening movement, he combined elements of overture and symphony in a modified sonata design. The composition of the symphonic poems proved daunting. They underwent a continual process of creative experimentation that included many stages of composition, rehearsal and revision to reach a balance of musical form.|$|E
