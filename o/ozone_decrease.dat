Since the proton fluxes during these events are fairly well known from satellite observations, modelers {{have been able to}} compare model predictions with observations of ozone behavior during these events to test the validity of atmospheric photochemical models. Ozone decreases initially follow approximately their theoretically predicted behavior below about 45 km (where NOx is thought to cause the <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease),</b> but after about two weeks the observed decrease appears to be larger than the computed decrease. Above 45 km, where HOx is thought to cause the <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease,</b> the picture of model validity is not as clear.

40|$|Solar proton events (SPEs) {{are known}} to have caused changes in {{constituents}} in the Earth's neutral polar middle atmosphere in the most recent solar maximum period (solar cycle 23). The highly energetic protons produced ionizations, excitations, dissociations, and dissociative ionizations of the background constituents in the polar cap regions (greater than 60 degrees geomagnetic latitude), which led to the production of HOx (H, OH, HO 2) and NOy (N, NO, NO 2, NO 3, N 2 O 5, HNO 3, HO 2 NO 2, ClONO 2, BrONO 2). The HOx increases led to short-lived <b>ozone</b> <b>decreases</b> in the polar mesosphere and upper stratosphere due to the short lifetimes of the HOx constituents. Polar middle mesospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>decreases</b> greater than 50 % were observed and computed to last for hours to days due to the enhanced HOx. The NOy increases led to long-lived polar stratospheric ozone changes because of the long lifetime of the NOy family in this region. Upper stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>decreases</b> of greater than 10 % were computed to last for several months past the solar events in the winter polar regions because of the enhanced NOy. Solar cycle 23 was especially replete with SPEs and huge fluxes of high energy protons occurred in July and November 2000, September and November 2001, April 2002, October 2003, and January 2005. Smaller, but still substantial, proton fluxes impacted the Earth during other months in this cycle.

40|$|The {{impact of}} dynamic and {{chemical}} processes on the ozone {{distribution of the}} Northern Hemisphere is estimated using a multiannual simulation of the dynamic-chemical general circulation model ECHAM/CHEM. The simulation includes two contrasting winter situations, characterized by an instable and warm stratospheric polar vortex, the other by a stable and cold polar vortex. Ozone destruction induced by heterogeneous reactions on polar stratospheric clouds are found inside the polar vortex in both winter situations. Outside the polar vortex no heterogeneous reactions occur. Nevertheless a total <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> is evident, as parts of the polar vortex are cut off and transport ozone reduced airmasses out of the polar vortex. A blocking situation and an ozone minihole simulated by the model were also analyzed. In both cases large scale lifting yields large total <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> and stratospheric chlorine activation. Chemical ozone destruction results downstream of this local activation.

40|$|Substantial ozone {{decreases}} at the stratopause {{and in the}} mesosphere {{have now}} been observed by instruments on the NIMBUS 7 solar backscattered ultraviolet (SBUV) and Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) satellites during solar proton events (SPE's) of solar cycle 21. Since the ozone depletion was only observed uring the SPE's, we believe that increased production of short-lived HO,, species by protons {{is responsible for the}} depletion. We find that one-dimensional time-dependent model calculations are close to agreement with the two satellite instrument measurements in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere only when the observed <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> as a function of altitude is used in our model calculations. Most of the ozone depletion between 2 and 0. 5 mbar (• 45 and 55 km) was caused not by direct particle effects, but by the large ozone decreases at higher altitudes allowing increased penetration of ultraviolet to lower than normal altitudes. Our calculations are qualitatively in agreement with the SBUV measurements but tend to underestimate the ozone depletion for pressure levels between 1 and 0. 3 mbar (~ 50 and 60 km). The calculated ozone depletions at 0. 5 and 0. 3 mbar (~ 55 and 60 km) agree fairly well with the observations of SME. The strong solar zenith angle (SZA) dependent depletion that was observed is predicted by the model. Larger SZA's generally reflected larger ozone depletions.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} annual {{changes in}} total ozone during the polar night at Syowa Station (69 °S, 40 °E). Antarctica. The total ozone is almost constant from early June to early August each year. The springtime decrease in total ozone started in early September in 1982 - 1990 and in middle August in 1991 - 1992. The rate of total <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> in August {{is less than}} 1. 0 DU (Dobson Units) per day in 1982 - 1987 and increased to around 4. 0 DU per day in the 1990 s. The rate in September was around 1. 0 DU per day in the 1980 s and was around 2. 0 DU in the 1990 s. The very low total ozone in September and October in the early 1990 s {{is due to the}} rapid decrease of total ozone in August and the early start of decrease of total ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere. Final warming at Syowa Station has been delayed 1. 2 days per year annually.

40|$|Naturally {{produced}} very short-lived substances (VSLS) {{account for}} {{almost a quarter of}} the current stratospheric inorganic bromine, Br y. Following VSLS oxidation, bromine radicals (Br and BrO) can catalytically destroy ozone. The extent to which possible increases in surface emissions or transport of these VSLS bromocarbons to the stratosphere could counteract the effect of halogen reductions under the Montreal Protocol is an important policy question. Here, by using a chemistry–climate model, UM-UKCA, we investigate the impact of a hypothetical doubling (an increase of 5 ppt Br y) of VSLS bromocarbons on ozone and how the resulting ozone changes depend on the background concentrations of chlorine and bromine. Our model experiments indicate that for the 5 ppt increase in Br y from VSLS, the <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> in the lowermost stratosphere of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) may reach up to 10 % in the annual mean; the <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is smaller (4 – 6 %). The largest impact on the ozone column is found in the Antarctic spring. There is a significantly larger <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> following the doubling of the VSLS burden under a high stratospheric chlorine background than under a low chlorine background, indicating the importance of the inter-halogen reactions. For example, the decline in the high-latitude, lower-stratospheric ozone concentration as a function of Br y is higher by about 30 – 40 % when stratospheric Cl y is ~ 3 ppb (present day), compared with Cl y of ~ 0. 8 ppb (a pre-industrial or projected future situation). Bromine will {{play an important role in}} the future ozone layer. However, even if bromine levels from natural VSLS were to increase significantly later this century, changes in the concentration of ozone will likely be dominated by the decrease in anthropogenic chlorine. Our calculation suggests that for a 5 ppt increase in Br y from VSLS, the Antarctic ozone hole recovery date could be delayed by approximately 6 – 8 years, depending on Cl y levels...|$|E
40|$|The future {{evolution}} of tropical ozone {{in a changing}} climate is investigated by analysing time slice simulations made with the chemistry–climate model EMAC. Between {{the present and the}} end of the 21 st century a significant increase in ozone is found globally for the upper stratosphere and the extratropical lower stratosphere, while in the tropical lower stratosphere ozone decreases significantly by up to 30 %. Previous studies have shown that this decrease is connected to changes in tropical upwelling. Here the dominant role of transport for the future <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> is confirmed, but it is found that in addition changes in chemical ozone production and destruction do contribute to the ozone changes in the tropical lower stratosphere. Between 50 and 30 hPa the dynamically induced <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> of up to 22 % is amplified by 11 – 19 % due to a reduced ozone production. This is counteracted by a decrease in the ozone loss causing an ozone increase by 15 – 28 %. At 70 hPa the large <b>ozone</b> <b>decrease</b> due to transport (− 52 %) is reduced by an enhanced photochemical ozone production (+ 28 %) but slightly increased (− 5 %) due to an enhanced ozone loss. It is found that the increase in the ozone production in the lowermost stratosphere is mainly due to a transport induced decrease in the overlying ozone column while at higher altitudes the ozone production decreases as a consequence of a chemically induced increase in the overlying ozone column. The ozone increase that is attributed to changes in ozone loss between 50 and 30 hPa is mainly caused by a slowing of the ClO x and NO x loss cycles. The enhanced ozone destruction below 70 hPa can be attributed to an increased efficiency of the HO x loss cycle. The role of ozone transport in determining the ozone trend in this region is found to depend on the changes in the net production as a reduced net production also reduces the amount of ozone that can be transported within an air parcel...|$|E

But by using a chemically conserved tracer as a reference, significant ozone loss can be identified. This loss is found to be correlated with high levels of chlorine monoxide, suggesting that much of the decrease in ozone is caused by anthropogenic emissions of chlorofluorocarbons...|$|E

Complicated ion chemistry leads to HO(x) production and dissociation of N 2 leads to NO(y) production. Both the HO(x) and NO(y) increases can result in changes to ozone in the stratosphere and mesosphere. The HO(x) increases lead to short-lived <b>ozone</b> <b>decreases</b> in the mesosphere and upper stratosphere due to the short lifetimes of the HO(x) constituents.

All of these effects are in qualitative agreement with the observed ozone changes...|$|R
