5|$|As a senator, Nixon {{received}} an annual salary of $12,500 (about $150,000 in 2009 dollars). While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of 12 and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other <b>office</b> <b>expenses.</b> It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E
25|$|When I {{returned}} to IP in 1962 {{as president and}} editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that I drew upon immediately. I also arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. I also sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus able to meet the payroll and <b>office</b> <b>expenses,</b> and also to pay off enough of our debt to resume publishing.|$|E

25|$|For merchants, {{a credit}} card {{transaction}} is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as cheques, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, {{regardless of whether the}} consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back <b>office</b> <b>expense</b> of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.|$|R
25|$|Due to the region's {{relatively}} sparse population, {{federal and}} provincial electoral {{districts in the}} region are almost all extremely large geographically. The federal electoral district of Sudbury and the provincial electoral districts of Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie are the only ones that are comparable in size to an electoral district in Southern Ontario, while at the other extreme the districts of Kenora and Timmins—James Bay are both geographically larger than the entire United Kingdom. One consequence of this, for example, is that a politician who represents a Northern Ontario riding in the Canadian House of Commons or the Legislative Assembly of Ontario must typically maintain a much higher budget for travel and <b>office</b> <b>expenses</b> than one who represents a small urban district does.|$|E
500|$|Stelmach {{ran for the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Progressive Conservative in the 1993 provincial election, {{defeating}} incumbent New Democrat Derek Fox in {{the riding}} of Vegreville-Viking. Stelmach {{became a member of}} the Deep Six, a group of enthusiastically fiscally conservative rookie MLAs; in addition to supporting Premier Ralph Klein's aggressive deficit-cutting, Stelmach practiced fiscal restraint himself, incurring low <b>office</b> <b>expenses</b> and declining a government vehicle. [...] During his first term, Stelmach served as Deputy Whip and, later, Chief Government Whip for the P.C. caucus. [...] As a backbencher, he sponsored the Lloydminster Hospital Act Repeal Act. This was a government bill that dissolved the then-existing Lloydminster hospital board in preparation for an arrangement compliant with both the Alberta government's new system of regional health authorities and the Saskatchewan government's system. Lloydminster sits on the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the hospital, although built and operated by the Alberta government, sits on the Saskatchewan side. It passed the legislature with little debate. In 1996, shortly before an April by-election in Redwater, Stelmach was accused of [...] "pork barrel politics" [...] for presenting, along with colleague Peter Trynchy and P.C. candidate Ross Quinn, a large cheque to a local seniors centre. Stelmach said that he had only stepped in to help the riding after its MLA, Nicholas Taylor, had been appointed to the Senate.|$|E

[...] Total {{expenditures}} on maintenance, labor, materials, <b>office</b> <b>expenses</b> and so forth for fiscal year 1905 were $1,274.13. [...] Total lockages were 123, of which 30 were for towboats and all others were for wood barges, log rafts, fishing boats, and launches.

5000|$|Telecommuting individuals, or more {{specifically}} those in [...] "work from home" [...] arrangements, {{may find that}} it improves work-life balance, reduces their carbon footprint and fuel usage, frees up the equivalent of 15 to 25 workdays a year (time they would have otherwise spent commuting), and saves thousands of dollars per year in travel and work-related costs. Half-time telecommuting by those with compatible jobs (40%) {{and a desire to}} do so (79%) would save companies, communities, and employees over $650 billion a year; the result of increased productivity, reduced <b>office</b> <b>expense,</b> lower absenteeism and turnover, reduced travel, less road repairs, less gas consumption, and other savings.|$|R

The former covers the detailed expense accounts which go {{to make up the}} cost of distributing the goods, including salesmen's salaries and expenses, rent of the store {{in the case of a}} merchandising house, costs of advertising and of the delivery service; while the latter includes those accounts which show the cost of managing the financial and business affairs of the concern, including all administrative salaries and general <b>office</b> <b>expense,</b> such as, for example, office supplies.|$|R
2500|$|Constitutionally {{the monarch}} is {{entitled}} to compensation from the annual state budget {{for the maintenance of}} his family and household administration, and freely distributes these funds in accordance with the laws. According to the Royal Household, [...] "he purpose of these resources is to ensure that the Head of State may carry out his tasks with the independence which is inherent to his constitutional functions, as well as with due effectiveness and dignity". The annual budget pays the remunerations for senior management staff, management staff and career civil servants, other minor staffing positions, and for general <b>office</b> <b>expenses.</b> The Head of Household, Secretary General, and other management staff salaries must be comparable to other administration ministers within the government, though in no way do they form part of the government or administration. As such, the management staff experience increases, decreases, or freezes to their pay in accordance with the fluctuations of government minister salaries. Additionally, the annual budget pays for the maintenance and expenses of senior {{members of the royal family}} who undertake royal duties; which includes grocery, clothing, and toiletries allotments. [...] The budget approved by the Cortes for 2010 was just under 7.4 million euros, a budget only slightly larger than that spent on the Luxembourg monarchy. In 2011 the king addressed the perennial critique of the monarchy; that of how the annual budget awarded to the monarchy and royal household is spent. The report revealed that only 9.6% of the 8.4 million euros budgeted that year for the monarchy are paid to royal family members as 'salaries and representative duties', with the difference marked for royal household operational expenses such as household staff salaries, various insurance premiums and liabilities, services, [...] and 'supplementals' such as overhead. In 2012, the monarchy volunteered an additional 7% pay-cut in solidarity with government officials.|$|E

40|$|The {{employee}} home <b>office</b> <b>expense</b> {{deduction of}} today bears {{only a slight}} resemblance to its ancestor {{of a few years}} ago. Repeated litigation has modified and revised the nature of the deduction at such a rapid pace that even the Internal Revenue Service 2 ̆ 7 s attempted solidification of the home office deduction was destined to enjoy a relatively short life before suffering the erosive effects of litigation. In 1973, as a part of this ongoing process of refinement, the Tax Court in Stephen A. Bodzin and George W. Gino made dramatic changes in the standards used to allow the home office deduction. The changes have given birth to serious legislative concern which looms {{as a threat to the}} advances made by these cases. Barring any legislative action, however, the impact of these cases should be to herald an increased workload for the Internal Revenue Service in the name of taxpayer equity...|$|R
