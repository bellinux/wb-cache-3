500|$|Eric Slatt (David Bamber) is {{the deputy}} {{headmaster}} of Galfast High, {{who seems to}} [...] "deepen the many crises that face the school (most of Slatt’s own making)". Jeff Evans, writing in The Penguin TV Companion, observed that [...] "Slatt is certainly keen, but regrettably he is also unbalanced, tactless, clumsy, snobby, sarcastic, at times pointlessly aggressive and always prone to appalling errors of judgment (an academic version of Basil Fawlty, it was widely noted)". The Independent commented: [...] "Chalk is in the idiom of sadistic farce: disaster begets catastrophe begets apocalypse, and they all engulf Slatt. There are inevitable echoes of other sitcom characters - a dash of Basil Fawlty's unquenchable apoplexy, a slice of Gordon Brittas's purblind monomania - but Slatt's entanglements are caused by his own cocktail of failings." [...] Nicola Walker commented that viewers sympathise with Slatt because he is in charge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> lunatics.

500|$|A viral {{music video}} for [...] "Good Hit" [...] was {{directed}} by Alexandre Moors in October 2010. The video follows a series of collaborations between Nice Shoes, a New York-based visual effects company, and Moors, including the short film Cherry Bloom. Moors shot the footage for [...] "Good Hit" [...] on one location using two different sets. He wanted a [...] "consistent look throughout", allowing Nice Shoes to [...] "apply the look of one shot to the rest, adjusting contrast to match". They also readjusted the windows based on how Lopez moved through each shot. The music video [...] "makes use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> different hair styling tools". Oribe, who stylized the hair for the video, created a [...] "classic JLo look: lots of hair, volume and wind". A [...] "teaser" [...] for the video surfaced online in October 2010, but was removed quickly afterwards. The music video was released on January 15, 2011.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{declared}} that [...] "Cheek to Cheek {{is a record}} where the music and even the songs take a backseat to the personalities". Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave the album a rating of two out of five stars. Camp criticized Bennett and Gaga's vocals in the album, adding that [...] "If not for the session musicians' top-notch work... much of Cheek to Cheek, which drags at an economical 45 minutes, would sound like glorified karaoke." [...] San Francisco Chronicle writer Aidin Vaziri was disappointed with Bennett and Gaga not [...] "highlight each other's wildly distinguishing features", adding that [...] "the background music is far more exciting than the people singing over it". Mikael Wood from Los Angeles Times complimented Gaga's vocals in the album but panned her [...] "cheap exploitation: <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> important songs she brings nothing to; of an 88-year-old legend with whom she has zero chemistry; and, most disappointingly, of our eagerness to follow her down an unlikely creative path." [...] At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015, Cheek to Cheek won a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.|$|E
500|$|Emily Blunt plays Sergeant Rita Vrataski, {{a veteran}} who guides and trains Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. Blunt {{said of her}} role, [...] "In these male-fueled genres, it's usually the woman who's holding {{the hand of the}} guy and he's running through explosions leading her, and I wanted to be doing the leading." [...] Chris Nashawaty, {{reviewing}} the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it [...] "the most feminist summer action flick in years". Bustles Alicia Lutes described Rita as [...] "ruthless and exacting in her takedown ... <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> aliens" [...] and said: [...] "This is very much counter to the age-old ideals about ladies being the constant, delicate flowers of emotional heartstring-pulling." [...] Lutes noted how Cage's strength depended on Rita's guidance, as [...] "she trains him, aids him, and protects him (and in turn the fate of humanity) time and time again." [...] Tasha Robinson, writing a piece in The Dissolve about [...] "strong female characters" [...] that lack real purpose in films, said that Rita in Edge of Tomorrow was an exception. Robinson acknowledged that Rita existed to support Cage in his trials, but believed that [...] "the story doesn't degrade, devalue, weaken, or dismiss her".|$|E

500|$|Following a Japanese tour in April 1988, Echo & the Bunnymen's lead singer, Ian McCulloch, {{announced}} that the band were going to split up. Following the announcement, McCulloch returned to the United Kingdom to visit his father who had just suffered two heart attacks but was too late as he died shortly before arriving. After five months of speculation {{as to whether the}} split up was genuine, McCulloch met with {{the other members of the}} band in September 1988 and, despite the group's attempts to change his mind, told them he was leaving the band. McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview, [...] "The last days of The Bunnymen consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> people who were more interested in changing oil in their cars than rock 'n' roll. That pissed me off. I was doing every sodding interview, writing sodding every song." [...] Having been persuaded by Rob Dickins at WEA that the band could still be a success in the United States, Sergeant told McCulloch that he and the other two band members, bassist Les Pattinson and drummer Pete de Freitas, planned to continue. After a failed attempt to record with The B-52's singers Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson, the band advertised for a full-time replacement.|$|E
500|$|Another popular festival held in Chamba is the [...] "Minjar Mela", held on {{the second}} Sunday of the Shravana month, {{corresponding}} to the month of August in the Gregorian calendar. It marks {{the triumph of the}} Raja of Chamba over the ruler of Trigarta (now called as Kangra), in 935 AD and also celebrates the paddy and maize crops grown {{at this time of the}} year. The festival commences with offerings of 'minjar', consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> paddy plant and golden silk wrapped in red fabric. The offerings also include a rupee, a seasonal fruit, and a coconut. This occasion is also celebrated with a flag hoisting ceremony at the Chaugan that initiates a week of cultural and social programmes. The image of the deity, Lord Raghuvira, and more than 200 other deities, are taken in a procession, in a chariot pulled by ropes. Folk dances and music performances known as 'Kunjari Malhar' are part of the festivities. On the last day of the festival, a parade is held from the Akhand Chandi Palace to Ravi River, where offerings are made to the river. This commemorates an event in which Raja Sahil Verman changed the course of the river, to make the Hari Rai temple accessible to all devotees.|$|E
500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody {{and a little bit of}} me." [...] Buck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's voices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later revealed as [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings") back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it reportedly left everyone who was present with tears in their eyes. Subsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell to be in the same room when they were recording the important emotional scenes of the film.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that [...] "as Chuck began laying out {{his plan to}} be freelance spies, and as Morgan took out the Intersect sunglasses General Beckman had so thoughtfully hidden in Chuck's going-away box, all I could feel was gratitude: I'm so glad NBC ordered one more season, because that is a show I want to see!" [...] Sepinwall praised Timothy Dalton's ability to deliver both a comic and serious performance, writing that, while on other series Volkoff's back-story [...] "would be an incredibly dark, tragic storyline", Dalton acted well enough that his emotions were not overwhelming. Sepinwall continued that the storyline [...] "would have sucked every last bit of joy out of the episode" [...] if the character had been portrayed by another Chuck actor. In contrast, Sepinwall wrote that he felt no empathy for Volkoff's daughter, as [...] "Lauren Cohan has never managed to make a cohesive and interesting character out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> jarring personality shifts". Brody Gibson of Boom Tron wrote," [...] The writers of Chuck sure know how to pull together a great finale. I was floored." [...] Gibson agreed with Sepinwall on Timothy Dalton's range of acting skills, praising Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski as well. Gibson wrote that Levi deserved an Emmy nomination for {{a scene in which}} Chuck surrenders himself to Vivian to plead for the antidote to save Sarah's life. Gibson also praised Levi and Strahovski's performance in Chuck and Sarah's [...] "practice wedding": [...] "These two have always had such great chemistry, you could swear they're actually in love and not just actors pretending." ...|$|E

[...] Ratcliff was also critical that Sue was not more of a feminist: [...] "I was under the impression she'd become more assertive.

Orci also admitted he was dismissive of the Dinobots because he does not like dinosaurs, saying [...] "I recognize I am weird in that department."

There were few [...] "girl singers" [...] on the rock circuit at the time, and they were relegated to [...] "groupie level when in a crowd <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> rock and roll guys", a status Ronstadt avoided. Relating to men on a professional level as fellow musicians led to competition, insecurity, bad romances, {{and a series of}} boyfriend-managers. At the time, she admired singers like Maria Muldaur for not sacrificing their femininity, but says she felt enormous self-imposed pressure to compete with [...] "the boys" [...] at every level. She noted in a 1969 interview in Fusion Magazine that it was difficult being a single [...] "chick singer" [...] with an all-male backup band. According to her, it was difficult to get a band of backing musicians because of their ego problem of being labeled sidemen for a female singer.|$|E

Joe Smith, the president of Elektra, was terrified that the albums would turn off the rock audience. The three albums together sold over seven million copies and brought Riddle back to a young audience during the last three years of his life. Arrangements for Linda Ronstadt's What's New (1983) and Lush Life (1984) won Riddle his second and third Grammy Awards.|$|E
