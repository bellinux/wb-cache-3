40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the medical use of <b>ozone</b> <b>therapies</b> show a very diverse array of results, from ozone {{reducing}} the amount of HIV virus in the blood, to no effect, to causing the death of several patients due to pulmonary embolism and infections. However, <b>ozone</b> <b>therapies</b> are widely used in Europe and considered medically safe. In the U. S., doctors in 28 states use <b>ozone</b> <b>therapies.</b> The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of medical grade ozone at varying concentrations used in <b>ozone</b> <b>therapies.</b> These were achieved by evaluating the C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, total reduced and oxidized glutathione content of erythrocytes which were all markers used to determine ozone injury/inflammation. Despite the fact that ozone is a very strong oxidant, previous research indicates that depending on the dose and the health status of the biological system, sometimes ozone can act as an antioxidant. The medical exposure range for ozone is between 20 - 80 mg/ml with an average of 50 mg/ml. The concentrations used in this study were 20, 40, 80 and 160 mg/ml. Ozone was generated in the 2 ̆ 2 Breath Lab 2 ̆ 2 at USF from medical grade oxygen obtained through electrical corona arc discharge using an OL 80 C ozone generator. De-identified blood samples of 10 ml blood/sample containing EDTA as anticoagulant were obtained from the James A. Haley VA Hospital patients. Equal volumes of blood and ozone gas mixture were allowed to mix in ozone-resistant syringes prior to dividing each sample into three parts, one for each corresponding parameter to be studied. The C-reactive protein was analyzed through ELISA using the colorimetric method available from Helica Biosystems; erythrocyte sedimentation rate was measured in graduated sedimentation tubes; the total reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) content of erythrocytes was determined according to the colorimetric method developed by the Oxford Biomedical Research. Overall, the concentrations of ozone used did not have a statistically significant effect on the parameters investigated. However, {{a small percentage of the}} blood samples showed an improvement in the parameters studied, especially at the highest ozone concentration...|$|R

There is, however, some concern regarding O 3 -toxicity and uncertainty about the effectiveness of O 3 -therapy. In this study we investigated the possible protective effects of the plasma antioxidant defense system during O 3 -AHT. Venous blood from six apparently healthy human donors was collected. In one part of the study a precise volume of blood was mixed with an equal volume of O 2 /O 3 gas mixture containing 20 or 80 µg/ml O 3 for 20 min. In the other part, the plasma was washed out, the cells resuspended in a buffered phosphate solution and treated with same concentrations of O 3. Control samples was not treated or treated with O 2. Ozone-AHT caused increased plasma hydroperoxide levels and glutathione ratio. Antioxidant enzyme (catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase) activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) decreased, whereas superoxide dismutase levels increased slightly. Plasma antioxidant capacity decreased. These effects were more evident in the absence of plasma antioxidants. Therefore the damaging effects of O 3 were quenched by the antioxidants present in plasma. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{the most}} common {{degenerative}} joint disease and a growing health problem affecting {{more than half of the}} population over the age of 65. It is characterized by inflammation in the cartilage and synovium, resulting in the loss of joint structure and progressive damage to the cartilage. Many pro-inflammatory mediators are elevated in OA, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Damaged articular cartilage remains a challenge to treat due to the limited self-healing capacity of the tissue and unsuccessful biological interventions. This highlights the need for better therapeutic strategies to heal damaged articular cartilage. <b>Ozone</b> (O 3) <b>therapy</b> has been shown to have positive results in the treatment of OA; however the use of O 3 therapy as a therapeutic agent is controversial. There is a perception that O 3 is always toxic, whereas evidence indicates that when it is applied following a specified method, O 3 can be effective in the treatment of degenerative diseases. The mechanism of action of O 3 therapy in OA is not fully understood and this review summarizes the use of O 3 therapy in the treatment of damaged articular cartilage in OA...|$|R
