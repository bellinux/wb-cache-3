NY3 follows the southern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> to Deferiet, where NY3 turns south to follow the Black River while NY3A continues along the border of Fort Drum. NY3 follows the river to Carthage, where it overlaps NY126 briefly before heading northeast to rejoin NY3A at Fargo. NY3 forms the southern boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> from NY3A east to {{just west of the}} Jefferson-Lewis County line; however, near Natural Bridge, the Fort Drum boundary heads due north before becoming delimited by the Indian River. NY3, meanwhile, traverses the river and enters Lewis County.|$|E

Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise.
