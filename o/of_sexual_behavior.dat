40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to explore the child <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> that Italian {{teachers}} have observed in the school context. A representative sample of 227 children, from 5 to 10 years old, was rated by their teachers through the Child <b>Sexual</b> <b>Behavior</b> Inventory. Frequencies <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> among children aged 5 to 6, 7 to 8, and 9 to 10 are presented. Younger children showed a broader range <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> that decrease with the growing age, such as males in comparison to females. Moreover, findings showed that child <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> is not only related to age and gender but also to family characteristics. These results suggested that child <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> reported by teachers through the Child <b>Sexual</b> <b>Behavior</b> Inventory may provide useful information about the development of children’s sexuality.

40|$|On {{a sample}} of 203 males and 219 females the effects of HIV-transmission knowledge, five-factor {{personality}} traits and three components of psychopathy (antisocial behavior, interpersonal manipulation and impulsive thrill seeking) on overall risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> as well as risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> during previous month were explored by using a series of hierarchical regression analyses. The main hypothesis tested in this research is that psychopathy is an important predictor <b>of</b> risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> beyond and above the knowledge about the consequences <b>of</b> risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and personality traits. The results show that HIV-transmission knowledge predicts only overall risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> on the sample of men. Five-factor personality traits do not predict either measure <b>of</b> risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> in men and on the sample of women extraversion is a positive predictor of both measures <b>of</b> risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Antisocial behavior significantly and positively predicts both criterion variables on the sample of men and on the sample of women impulsive thrill seeking positively predicts only overall risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Also, HIV-transmission knowledge predicts both measures <b>of</b> risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> in interaction with interpersonal manipulation only on the sample of women. Women with less HIV-transmission knowledge and high in interpersonal manipulation show a higher increase on both measures <b>of</b> risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> in comparison with women who know more about HIV-transmission. The results obtained were explained mainly by proximal physiological processes and possible distal evolutionary mechanisms which determine reproductive success and <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> men and women...|$|R
40|$|Research into {{definitions}} of ‘‘having sex’’ {{has tended to}} employ a dichotomous response design (following Sanders & Reinisch, 1999). However, conceptions <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> activity may be far less clear-cut (c. f. Faulkner, 2003; Peterson & Muehlenhard, 2007). More refinement is also needed regarding the impact <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation {{on the construction of}} what counts as sex. This research employed a continuous response design, asking 124 emerging adults (40 male heterosexuals, 42 female heterosexuals, & 42 lesbians) to judge 13 sexual acts using a graded, six-point scale. Overall, there was substantial agreement that intercourse (vaginal and anal) was ‘‘definitely,’’ and kissing ‘‘definitely not,’’ sex. However, across the various acts, participants also consistently made use of options between these extremes, such that a clear hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> emerged. The lesbian group considered a range of forms of genital stimulation to be significantly more constitutive of sex than either heterosexual group, while judgments by male and female heterosexuals did not significantly differ for any listed act.

25|$|Given the {{potential}} consequences, engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky, particularly for adolescents. Having unprotected sex, using poor birth control methods (e.g. withdrawal), having multiple sexual partners, and poor communication are some aspects <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> that increase individual and/or social risk. Some qualities of adolescents' lives {{that are often}} correlated with risky sexual behavior include higher rates of experienced abuse, lower rates of parental support and monitoring.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{findings}} of a phylogenetic comparative analysis examining patterns and frequency of occurrence of same-sex courtship and mounting behavior in birds. Our analysis has shown associations between same-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and both mating system and degree of precociousness at hatching. The patterns of expression and frequency of occurrence <b>of</b> same-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> differed markedly for males and females. Patterns <b>of</b> same-sex <b>sexual</b> expression reflected the competitive sexes that actively solicit sexual interactions in heterosexual encounters. Male [...] male (MM) <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> occurred across all mating systems, but MM mounting was significantly more prevalent in those species with facultative polygamy. The frequency <b>of</b> MM <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> increased with degree of polygamy. Female [...] female (FF) <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> (especially courtship) occurred most frequently in socially monogamous species and rarely occurred in species that display obligate polygamy (predominantly polygynous species). Both expression and frequency <b>of</b> FF <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> was strongly related to the precocial state of development at hatching. FF <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> is more likely to occur in species in which monogamy occurs together with the production of precocial offspring; that is, in monogamous species that are exceptions to the more common altricial mode of development. We suggest that requirement of biparental care in monogamous species may influence the greater expression <b>of</b> FF <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and longer term associations. Both spatial and behavioral dispersion of females and engagement in uniparental care may be important in explaining the lower incidence <b>of</b> FF <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in polygynous species.

25|$|The {{clinical}} study Human Sexual Response {{was published by}} Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted {{not just from the}} publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.|$|E
25|$|Expressions {{of affection}} are {{displayed}} in the animal kingdom as well.

Male lions are known for head rubbing, bats engage in licking, and mountain sheep rub horns and faces with each other. Animals have also engaged in kissing, touching of noses, mouths and muzzles have been witnessed in African elephants, walruses, and mountain zebras. Primates also engage in kissing that is incredibly similar to human display of kissing. Chimpanzees have full mouth-to-mouth contact, and bonobos kiss with their mouth open and mutual tongue stimulation. There are a variety of acts to show affection such as African elephants intertwining their trunks, giraffes engaging in “necking”, and Hanuman langurs cuddling with each other in a front to back sitting position.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pharmacological}} manipulations of dopaminergic transmission on appetitive and consummatory aspects <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> were investigated in castrated male Japanese quail treated with exogenous testosterone. Appetitive male <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> {{was assessed by}} measuring a learned social proximity response and consummatory behavior was assessed by measuring copulatory behavior per se. The nonselective dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner both components <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Two indirect dopamine agonists were also tested. Nomifensine, a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, decreased appetitive <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> but increased the frequency of mount attempts, a measure <b>of</b> consummatory <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Amfonelic acid, a compound that enhances dopaminergic tone by a complex mechanism, increased aspects of both appetitive and consummatory behaviors. These data suggest that, in quail, as in rodents, increases in dopaminergic tone facilitate both appetitive and consummatory aspects <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Apomorphine may be inhibitory in quail because it acts primarily on D 2 -like receptors, unlike in rats, where it stimulates <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and acts primarily on D 1 -like receptors at low doses but interacts with D 2 -like receptors at higher doses. This {{is supported by the}} observation that stereotyped pecking, a behavior stimulated selectively in quail by D 2 agonists, was increased by apomorphine but not by the two indirect agonists. The observed partial dissociation between the effects of these dopaminergic agonists on appetitive and consummatory <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> suggests that these two components <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> may be controlled by the action of dopamine through different neuronal systems.
