40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that shear force during mashing, transferring and lautering should be avoided, {{especially in the}} case of thin bed filtration, using a fine milled grist. Therefore pump rotation speed is limited up to 1000 rpm during thin bed filter operations. However, in order to achieve the targets of flow, filtration pressure and low rotation speed, the transfer pump is mostly too large and operates far from the ideal performance potential. Transferring tomatoes and milk products, where shear force directly leads to damage of the product, learned that the efficiency is much more important instead of the rotation speed. This phenomenon is tested for mash transfer during thin bed filtration on pilot and industrial scale. Mashes of 3. 5 hl were transferred with an oversized channel impellor pump (MWP 2 / 40 - 160 / 116 (3 K- 160) and maximum rotation speed of 1200 rpm. A smaller <b>open</b> <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> (FP/ 63 - 25 / 114 (O- 132) D 09 S 18 KEB Y 55 S 5019 [...] M 2) is used to test the hypothesis of higher rotation speed (1500 rpm). Industrial mashes (120 hl) were filtered using 4 pump types: P 1 = MCP 2 / 65 - 250 / 1104 (O- 260) ("open / semi-open impeller"-reference), P 2 = ICP 3 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (C- 220) ("closed impeller"), P 3 = IFF 2 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (VO- 220) ("vortex impeller"), P 4 = ICP 3 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (4 K- 200) ("channel impeller"). Following parameters were measured during lautering: flow, pressure, rotation speed, filtered volume, extract, β-glucan, and arabinoxylan content of first wort. At pilot scale, an increased rotation speed of 1500 rpm with the smaller new pump resulted in a somewhat improved lauter performance compared to the reference pump with a max rotation speed of 1200 rpm. However, the efficiency of this new pump is 17, 6 % vs 4 % with the reference pump. At industrial scale, no important differences in lauter performance were noticed with varying rotation speed. However higher pump efficiency resulted in a somewhat decreased extraction of β-glucans and pentosans meaning that pump efficiency is indeed more important compared to rotation speed. Higher pump efficiencies resulted in an improved lauter performance, even when rotation speed of the pump is higher. The β-glucan level in the first wort decreases with increased pump efficiency. It was generally accepted that rotation speed of transfer pumps for lautering should be below 1000 rpm to avoid shear forces. The determined factor was only the speed of rotation of the pump, efficiency was never a ‘key’ selection criterium. With these experiments, firstly proven by transferring tomatoes and milk products, pump efficiency is much more important compared to rotation speed. Decreased electricity consumption and lower investment cost is a direct result of these new findings. status: publishe...|$|E

In order to realize a performance durability, {{the author has}} concentrated in past years on solving the bearing problems of the <b>impeller</b> <b>pump.</b> Recent progress has been obtained in developing durable and permanent <b>impeller</b> blood <b>pumps.</b> At first, a durable <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with rolling bearing and purge system has been developed, in which the wear-less rollers made of super-high-molecular weight polythene make the pump to work for years without mechanical wear; and the purge system enables the bearing to work in saline and heparin, and no thrombus therefore could be formed. Secondly, a durable centrifugal pump with rolling bearing and axially reciprocating impeller has been developed, the axial reciprocation of rotating impeller makes the fresh blood {{in and out of}} the bearing and to wash the rollers once a circle; in such way, no thrombus could be formed and no fluid infusion is necessary, which may bring inconvenience and discomfort to the receptors. Finally, a permanent maglev <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> has been developed, its rotor is suspended and floating in the blood under the action of permanent magnetic force and nonmagnetic forces, without need for position measurement and feed-back control.

40|$|ObjectiveIn a univentricular Fontan circulation, modest {{augmentation}} {{of existing}} cavopulmonary pressure head (2 – 5 mm Hg) would reduce systemic venous pressure, increase ventricular filling, and thus substantially improve circulatory status. An ideal means of providing mechanical cavopulmonary support does not exist. We hypothesized that a viscous <b>impeller</b> <b>pump,</b> {{based on the}} von Kármán viscous pump principle, is optimal for this role. MethodsA 3 -dimensional computational model of the total cavopulmonary connection was created. The impeller was represented as a smooth 2 -sided conical actuator disk with rotation in the vena caval axis. Flow was modeled under 3 conditions: (1) passive flow with no disc; (2) passive flow with a nonrotating disk, and (3) induced flow with disc rotation (0 – 5 K rpm). Flow patterns and hydraulic performance were examined for each case. Hydraulic performance for a vaned impeller was assessed by measuring pressure increase and induced flow over 0 to 7 K rpm in a laboratory mock loop. ResultsA nonrotating actuator disc stabilized cavopulmonary flow, reducing power loss by 88 %. Disk rotation (from baseline dynamic flow of 4. 4 L/min) resulted in a pressure increase of 0. 03 mm Hg. A further increase in pressure of 5 to 20 mm Hg and 0 to 5 L/min flow was obtained with a vaned impeller at 0 to 7 K rpm in a laboratory mock loop. ConclusionsA single viscous <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> stabilizes and augments cavopulmonary flow in 4 directions, in the desired pressure range, without venous pathway obstruction.

This paper recalls some important achievements in R&D of artificial heart in past 25 years and shares author’s experiences with the readers. PULSATILE OR NONPULSATILE FLOW In the early 1980 s, people did not know whether a nonpulsatile pump could support the circulation partly or totally. Most medical doctors preferred to use pulsatile flow pumps, but the serious problems resulted in the application of diaphragm pumps forced the researchers to change the pumping principle. It followed thereafter two tendencies that some one tried to maintain the animal circulation with nonpulsatile flow as long as possible and others made efforts to develop a pulsatile rotary pump. The conflict of nonpulsatile or pulsatile perfusion lasted to the end of 1990 s. As the author published a pulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with low hemolysis (Artificial Organs, 1989 / 13 / 02 P 162 - 169), the nonpulsatile pump could make the animal experimental survival only few weeks. Then the author received over 20 international invitations for giving lectures, sending reprints or writing new papers. In the following 10 years, however, nonpulsatile pump achieved long-term survival in animal experiments worldwide [1], and now a patient has lived by a nonpulsatile pump for about 7 years [2]. Thereby, nobody concerns pulsatile rotary pump any more. Fig. (1).

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of pitched blade impellers in a cylindrical pilot plant vessel with four standard radial baffles at the wall under a turbulent regime of flow. The pumping capacity was calculated from the radial profile of the axial flow, under the assumption of axial symmetry of the discharge flow. The mean velocity was measured using laser Doppler anemometry in a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm, provided with a standard dished bottom. Three and six blade pitched blade impellers (the pitch angle varied within the interval a Îá 24 °; 45 °ń) of impeller/vessel diameter ratio D/T = 0. 36, as well as a three blade pitched blade impeller with folded blades of the same diameter, were tested. The calculated results were compared with the results of experiments mentioned in the literature, above all in cylindrical vessels with a flat bottom.

40|$|Background—The latest {{generation}} of left ventricular assist devices consists of nonpulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pumps.</b> In these small pumps, thrombus formation inside the device {{does not lead}} to thromboembolic end-organ dysfunction but may dramatically impair pump flow. We report on our experience with thrombus-related pump dysfunctions of the MicroMed DeBakey left ventricular assist device and its treatment. Methods—Eight of 22 patients with a MicroMed DeBakey VAD presented with a critically reduced pump flow. In 7 cases, an increased power demand indicative of progressive thrombus formation associated with the device was evident, whereas 1 case presented with thrombus formation within the inflow conduit associated with a very low power demand. Brief spontaneously resolving pump stops had been noted in 6 patients. All 8 patients were treated with 100 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), administered via an IV line. Results—Rt-PA lysis led to an increase of pump flow along with a reduction of power demand within a short time in all patients. No severe bleeding complications occurred. However, 4 patients experienced transient epistaxis. All patients could be discharged from intensive care immediately after discontinuation of thrombolytic therapy.

40|$|Abstract: It {{is evident}} that a pulsatile flow is {{important}} for blood circulation because the flow pulsatility can reduce the resistance of peripheral vessels. It is difficult, however, to produce a pulsatile flow with an <b>impeller</b> <b>pump,</b> since blood damage will occur when a pulsatile flow is produced. Further investigation has revealed that the main factor for blood damage is turbulence shear, which tears the membranes of red blood cells, resulting in free release of haemoglobin into the plasma, and consequently lead to haemolysis. Therefore, the question for producing a pulsatile flow with low haemolysis becomes how to develop a pulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with less turbulence? The authors have successively developed a pulsatile axial pump and a pulsatile centrifugal pump. In the pulsatile axial <b>pump,</b> the <b>impeller</b> reciprocates axially and rotates simultaneously. The reciprocation is driven by a pneumatic device and the rotation by a DC motor. For a pressure of 40 mm Hg pulsatility, about 50 mm axially reciprocation amplitude of the impeller is desirable. In {{order to reduce the}} axial amplitude, the pump inlet and the impeller both have cone-shaped heads, thus the gap between the impeller and the inlet pipe changes by only 2 mm, that is, the impeller reciprocates up to 2 mm, a pressure pulsatility of 40 mmHg can be produced. As the impeller rotates with a constant speed, low turbulence in the pump can be expected. In the centrifugal pulsatile pump, the impelle...|$|R

40|$|LectureGreat {{interest}} {{is being paid}} by Oil & Gas industry {{to the design of}} high speed and high pressure ratio centrifugal compressors. Static and dynamic stresses are becoming higher and, under critical conditions, aerodynamic forcing may lead to impeller high cycle fatigue failures. Thorough aeromechanics knowledge is hence necessary for the advanced design of centrifugal compressors, to ensure reliability and life-time. <b>Open</b> <b>impellers,</b> which are commonly used for high speed applications, may be prone to relatively high vibration levels, due to aerodynamic excitations present in the flow field. Indeed, resonant crossings with forcing functions are in some cases unavoidable in variable speed machines since a wide speed range results in a wide frequency range of rotor-stator interactions, as well as flow-field circumferential distortions, occurring at multiples of the impeller excitations. Impeller forcing amplitudes and aeromechanical damping both contribute to vibratory response levels and must be properly predicted. This paper is focused on the aerodynamic damping prediction. A comprehensive study was undertaken to develop and validate aerodynamic damping prediction capability for <b>open</b> <b>impellers</b> for the operating conditions and mode shapes of interest. An extensive experimental campaign was conducted on a full scale multistage compressor equipped with transonic unshrouded impellers instrumented with strain gauges connected to a telemetry system. The strain gauge data are compared to the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) predicted damping for blade and disk modes and show good agreement. The present paper describes the challenges related to aerodynamic damping prediction in a real machine environment taking into account complex flow features, for example flow distortions, off-design conditions and different pressure levels. The level of agreement between test data and CFD predictions achieved in this work represents a significant step forward towards building and validating a fully physics based predictive capability for <b>open</b> <b>impeller</b> forced response.
