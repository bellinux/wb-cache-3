50|$|The first {{powered flight}} in South Australia {{was of a}} Blériot Aéronautique {{monoplane}} in 1910, south-west of Salisbury. In the 1920s investigations began into construction of an airport in Adelaide. Land was initially purchased in Albert Park with the aerodrome site becoming the new suburb of Hendon; but {{within a few years}} the cost of acquiring sufficient land, neighbouring residential development and the erection of power transmission lines all interfered with airport plans and the Hendon site was effectively abandoned. In 1927, the Commonwealth government purchased 318 acre of land at Parafield from a family owned farming company for &pound;17,000. The area had been used for fattening sheep on lucerne and <b>other</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>plants.</b> The new airport was expanded in 1942, with the boundary extending west to the Gawler railway line.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper will}} discuss the first steps in {{a case study of}} present-day use, {{processing}} and storage of cereals and pulses, as well as several other plants used for animals in NW Tunisia. Data has been recorded using images and video filming, interviews and plant collection. Cereals, pulses, and <b>other</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> are part of domestic production that was processed with the animal-drawn threshing sledge. This case study was primarily undertaken to better understand how present-day human food and fodder use is related to this particular technology, and to examine the variability in plants and processing techniques today. We found that non-mechanised threshing, but also harvesting of wild and domestic kinds of green fodder, are still geared to producing specific products for feeding draft animals and cows kept by farmers, who attribute particular importance to the superior qualities of various plants as fodder, for taste and quality of milk. In addition to use as human foods, specific products of cereals are used for temper for plaster and mud-brick...|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a varied assortment of <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> which allows the obtaining of sustainable harvests {{in the context of}} the last year’s weather and climatic evolutions has to be an important objective both for specialists and for farmers. The irregular distribution of rainfalls and the high temperatures during vegetative period determine a deficit of fodder production. In these conditions sorghum x Sudan grass hybrid was studied as complementary fresh matter (FM) source to the <b>other</b> <b>fodder</b> crops considered as traditional in Transylvania. The FM yield obtained with unfertilized sorghum x Sudan grass hybrid in the two cuttings was lower than yields obtained with grass and legume mixtures (oat and pea mixture, triticale and pea mixture) but the yield differences were not significant...|$|R

40|$|Butterfly {{population}} in Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Park is significantly decreasing. One {{way to keep}} the sustainability of this endemic and distinctive species is to carry out <b>planting</b> of <b>fodder</b> <b>plants.</b> Lada-lada (Micromelum minutum) is one species of <b>fodder</b> <b>plants.</b> The most important thing in <b>planting</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>plant</b> is to provide seedling stock.

The {{study was conducted}} with the help of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tool to document the diversity of <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> of Betalghat Block of Nainital District (Western Himalaya). Total 210 <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> species belonging to 70 families, 164 genera of different habits such as trees (35 %), shrubs (31 %), herbs (25 %), and climbers (9 %), were recorded. Out of 70 families, 12 dominant families were Poaceae (18 species), followed by Fabaceae (16 species), Moraceae (10 species), Rosaceae (10 species), Asteraceae (8 species), Euphorbiaceae (7 species), Mimosaceae (6 species), Caesalpinaceae (5 species), Ranunculaceae (5 species), Rhamnaceae (5 species), Urticaceae (5 species) and Rubiaceae (5 species). Of the total recorded species, 41 % of the species were used during winter days, 38 % during summer and 21 % throughout the year. For each species, scientific and vernacular names, multipurpose uses (Fuel, medicinal, timber, agricultural tools, religious and fiber) were used.
