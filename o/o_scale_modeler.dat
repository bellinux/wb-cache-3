50|$|In {{the early}} days of railway modeling, some <b>O</b> <b>scale</b> <b>modelers</b> (the {{dominant}} <b>scale</b> at the time), made use of an outside third rail and a shoe pickup system for power. This system had the benefit of being more realistic by removing the central third rail common to <b>O</b> <b>scale</b> track, while retaining an effective power source. As technology progressed, later developments in locomotive and track design would allow for two rail operation, and ultimately obsoleted the practice.|$|R
50|$|Scale {{modeling}} also {{occurs in}} <b>O</b> and S <b>scales,</b> {{just like in}} HO or N <b>scales,</b> where the <b>modeler</b> tries to create a miniature world that is as realistic as possible. <b>Scale</b> <b>modelers</b> in <b>O</b> and S <b>scales</b> will often avoid, or at least make limited use of, traditional American Flyer and Lionel locomotives and rolling stock since it sometimes was not very true to scale, was lacking in detail, and used oversized knuckle couplers. <b>Scale</b> <b>modelers</b> use <b>O</b> gauge track, but with two rails rather than the three rails used by Lionel, and the trains run on direct current. Numerous standards for track that is more true to scale exist for both <b>O</b> and S <b>scales.</b>|$|R
