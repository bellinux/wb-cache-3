5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, sometimes the data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, impulse noise, <b>oversaturation,</b> scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E

The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and <b>oversaturation</b> of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings.

5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce that number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as it once was. Activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier <b>oversaturation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Silicon is an {{indirect}} band gap material and therefore its luminescent properties are poor. For very small dimensions however, as in a nanocrystal {{of a few}} nano meter diameter, luminescence becomes strong and blue shifted due quantum confinement. The topic of this thesis is Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and the spatial and size distribution of silicon nanocrystals. A main object was to correlate size with their light emitting properties which {{would be subject to}} quantum confinement. The nanocrystals were produced by ion implantation of 28 Si+ ions in thermally grown silicon dioxide which was followed by annealing at 1100 ◦C in nitrogen atmosphere. As a first approach three different <b>oversaturations</b> of silicon atoms in SiO 2 were investigated. The size of the nanocrystals and there distance to each other were characterised with an atomic force microscope (AFM). The effects of the different <b>oversaturations</b> were studied with AFM as well as with PL. Additionally, the samples were etched with hydro fluoric acid in order to remove the oxide matrix such that individua...|$|R

Harmonix would continue to support Rock Band 3 through 2013 with additional content patches and over 280 consecutive weeks of new songs provided as downloadable content (DLC), as well as producing Rock Band Blitz, an arcade-like rhythm game that did not require instrument controllers, but used existing music libraries. In April 2013, Harmonix released its last regular DLC, stating that they were focusing on other projects. The company noted that they would look to reintroduce Rock Band in the future, when they felt the time was right to bring back the game.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{investigation}} of in situ high-pressure and high-temperature bubble growth in silicic melts. In a hydrothermal diamond-anvil cell, a haplogranite melt (79 wt% SiO 2) is hydrated then subjected to cooling and decompression. With decreasing pressure, water exsolves from the melt and bubbles grow. The whole experiment is observed through an optical microscope and video-recorded, so that bubble nucleation, bubble growth, {{and the glass}} transition are directly monitored. Bubbles nucleate and expand in melt globules having radii from 15 to 70 μm. Bubbles reached 3. 6 – 9. 1 μm in radius within 6. 1 – 11. 7 s (until the glass transition is attained) while temperature decreases from 709 – 879 °C to 482 – 524 °C, corresponding to decompressions from 7. 0 – 21. 9 to 3. 4 – 15. 2 kbar. Bubbles nucleated either in a single event occurring within the first second or in successive pulses {{over a period of}} up to 7 s when the melt globules are in contact with a diamond culet of the cell. In these experiments, bubble growth can be fitted to the cube root or a logarithm of time, mainly ascribable to the combination of large water <b>oversaturations</b> due to rapid cooling and decompression. At pressures of 3. 4 – 15. 2 kbar, we measure glass transition temperatures that are 20 – 80 °C higher than those calculated at atmospheric pressure...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} particulate and dissolved {{organic carbon}} (POC and DOC), chlorophyll, oxygen, partial pressure of CO 2, pH, total alkalinity (TAlk) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) during a late summer cruise in the eutrophic Loire estuary. These parameters reveal an intense mineralisation of organic matter in the estuarine maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) that results in oxygen deficits (down to 20 % of the saturation level) and high CO 2 <b>oversaturations</b> (pCO 2 up to 2900 µatm). Several facts revealed the occurrence of carbonate dissolution in the Loire MTZ: large amounts of alkalinity were produced in the upper estuary, increasing its transfer to the ocean by 30 %; the calculated saturation index showed a net undersaturation for aragonite and a slight undersaturation for calcite in the MTZ; and PIC decreased from 2. 1 % (% dry weight) in riverine suspension to 0. 4 % in the MTZ. A stoichiometric approach is {{used to assess the}} coupling between aerobic respiration and carbonate dissolution, where apparent oxygen utilisation, excess CO 2, TAlk and dissolved inorganic carbon are compared quantitatively. About 20 % of the CO 2 generated by respiration was involved in carbonate dissolution. The loss of PIC at the river-estuary transition quantitatively corresponds to the amount of authigenic calcite precipitated upstream in the highly eutrophic river. This suggests that CO 2 exchange with the atmosphere along the eutrophic river-estuary continuum is buffered by carbonate precipitation in the autotrophic river and its dissolution in the heterotrophic estuary...|$|R
