30|$|In our approach, the key {{elements}} of the transport and energy systems, presented in Fig.  2, guide {{the identification of the}} key actors in the transport and energy contexts. Basically, the state of the transport system {{is a result of the}} measures and actions carried out by the producers, operators and users of the system, the three key actor groups. Producers and <b>operators</b> are <b>organisations</b> or companies, which can be categorised according to their main duties, such as: policy formulation, infrastructure construction and maintenance, production and operation of services for the transport system, and production of transport-related services (e.g., vehicle manufacturing and fuels). Individual people, actually the whole population, are the users of the passenger transport system. In freight transport, users are companies and organisations in the fields of industry, transport and commerce [22]. Producers gather information on the state of the transport system and also receive feedback from customers, that is, the users of the transport system. They make plans on the grounds of expert knowledge (design principles), and decisions based on generic or special decision-making principles. Within the process, information about the system gathered by the producers will be transformed into policy measures, aiming to lead the transport system into a desired (in our case low carbon, based on renewable biofuels) future (e.g., [22 – 24]).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{investigate}} the preparedness of regional destinations for new and developing markets (NDMs) focusing on service provision and cultural considerations. Design/methodology/approach: In-depth interviews using semi-structured questions and {{quantitative and qualitative analyses}} were undertaken with regional tourism-related stakeholders {{to investigate}} NDMs, levels of preparedness for these markets, perceptions on service quality and host and visitor culture. Findings: Regional tourism <b>operators</b> and <b>organisations</b> within the case study were not well prepared for NDMs such as China and India. There was a strong desire to present a local experience with services that reflect the Australian culture, rather than replicate the visitors’ culture. Levels of awareness for the services preferred by NDMs and the intention to cater specifically to these preferences was found to be inconsistent. Key challenges include market diversity, staff training, limited resources and inadequate infrastructure. Resource allocation to address these challenges may not be a high priority, impacting NDMs’ preparedness and regional tourism growth. Originality/value: Globally, tourism organisations are directing marketing efforts towards NDMs. However, ill-preparedness for these markets can lead to low levels of tourist satisfaction, reduced re-visitation and fewer positive word-of-mouth recommendations, all of which negatively impact tourism growth and development. Limited research has been undertaken in this area; thus, this study aids in identifying areas of focus for regional preparedness, service provision and resource allocation for existing markets and NDMs...|$|R

40|$|The {{inherent}} reliability of scientific spacecraft coupled with creative solutions to failures, degradation and other contingencies {{means that the}} vast majority of missions continue well beyond the date scheduled for the end of nominal operations. This long operations tail brings great benefit in terms of additional science data but, the average mission duration extension of over 300 % for recent ESA missions, can make financial planning difficult for <b>operators</b> and funding <b>organisations</b> alike. Furthermore, the resulting extra costs of the operations phase for flying missions are increasingly seen as a cause for delaying new programmes. Examination of historical data on mission extensions suggests that early consideration of mission extensions would allow long-term operations costs to be minimised via alternative operations concepts and modification of the system design to support these. We propose an approach to ensure that new missions analyse, plan for and factor-in possible extensions from the start meaning that operations concepts, tools and extension plans are in place to minimise the costs of all aspects of extended mission operations (including costs of spacecraft & science operations and telecommunications).

40|$|This study {{examines}} Norwegian oil companies offshoring EPC-contracts on the Norwegian Continental Shelf to South Korean yards. Delays and cost overruns have stirred a public debate about this offshoring practice, yet researchers have {{paid little attention}} to what determines project success in this specific context. Through a multiple-case study design and interviews with senior project members, this thesis contributes to the understanding of factors that influence project implementation in South Korea. Three EPC-contracts are compared with one Fabrication Contract, thereby also allowing for comparative analysis of contract formats. First, this thesis identifies 15 Critical Success Factors for the implementation of Norwegian offshore projects in South Korea. These factors are divided into categories corresponding to five essential implementation goals: mature engineering, yard priority, inter-firm co- ordination, tailored resource allocations and a strategic schedule. Second, this study also reveals the underlying factors that cause project challenges. An exaggerated cost focus among both yards and <b>operators,</b> and <b>organisations</b> that were unfamiliar with each other lead to resource constraints and major coordination issues. Industry cycles also greatly influenced individual projects by determining yard capacity and cost trends. Contract format is seen to modify project execution, with Fabrication Contracts performing better than EPC- contracts. Lastly, an improvement in project execution over time is detected and this is attributed to organisational learning. Implications of this study are that offshoring projects to South Korea require attention to specific factors during both project planning and execution. During planning, industry cycles should be taken into account as it greatly effects implementation and therefore decisions concerning contractor, contract format and contract timing. During execution, project organisations need to acknowledged and consider the characteristics of implementing projects in South Korea in order to achieve project success. For operators with South Korea experience, project implementation improves with each iteration, potentially developing into a competitive advantage...|$|R
40|$|An {{emerging}} {{problem of}} molecular typing {{methods such as}} PCR amplification using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) is that they frequently require updating as new alleles are constantly being described which potentially affect the specificity of every PCR-SSP reaction. PCR-SSP uses pairs of primers to detect cis-linked polymorphisms and thus each new allele described must be compared to each individual primer pair. Furthermore, sequence homology between the various loci for class I and class Il means that, for example, new HLA-A sequences have to be compared with HLA-B and HLA-C primer mixes to rule out cross-locus amplification. We have developed a computer program known as SSP Manager which is capable of aligning HLA class I and class TI sequences obtained from Internet-accessible databases such as GenBank. The program then updates all individual primer specificities held in its database before updating the specificities of all primer mixes. Sets of primer mixes can then be combined from the primer mix directory to create PCR-SSP typing trays which are subsequently analysed by the program. A report is generated which stipulates whether all known sequences are amplified {{and the reason for}} apparent failure to test for individual alleles, e. g. a lack of relevant sequence information. SSP Manager has the flexibility to cope with unusual sequences (deletions and insertions), primers with internal mismatches and primers with a deliberate mismatch. The program also has many tools for developing new primer mixes, such as the facility to search for novel reactions using Boolean <b>operators.</b> The <b>organisation</b> and operational use of the SSP Manager program is described and its uses are illustrated with an updated allele list for our previously described Phototyping PCR-SSP class I and class TI typing set.
