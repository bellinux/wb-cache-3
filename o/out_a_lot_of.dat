His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for Sánchez; he has walked 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all qualifying MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E
5|$|The sequel, Xenosaga Episode II, was {{developed}} by a new team with Takahashi overseeing the project so the series could be taken {{in a new direction}} by younger staff members within Monolith Soft. The scenario, written by Norihiko Yonesaka based on the initial draft by Takahashi and Saga, ended up leaving <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the originally planned content. Episode II was released in Japan in June 2004, while it was released in North America in February 2005. The sequel was also published in Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in October of that year. Both Episode I and Episode II were re-imagined for the Nintendo DS as Xenosaga I & II, released in March 2006. Co-developed by Monolith Soft and Tom Create, the scenario was supervised by Takahashi and included material which needed to be cut from the original releases of the first two Xenosaga games. Xenosaga I & II remains exclusive to Japan.|$|E

25|$|Recording Unrest {{was another}} intense experience, and the strongest period of {{collective}} learning since The Bacchae. They only had enough material to fill {{one side of}} the LP, and so were forced to spend {{a good deal of time}} developing the studio composition process that produced side two.

25|$|In early 1992, prices skyrocketed {{throughout}} Russia, {{and a deep}} {{credit crunch}} shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards {{of much of the}} population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and welfare entitlement programs. Through the 1990s, Russia's GDP fell by 50 percent, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, while incomes fell. Hyperinflation, caused by the Central Bank of Russia's loose monetary policy, wiped <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> personal savings, and tens of millions of Russians were plunged into poverty.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{planting of}} the garden {{is one of the}} Taj Mahal's remaining mysteries. The contemporary accounts mostly deal just with the architecture and only mention 'various kinds of fruit-bearing trees and rare aromatic herbs' in relation to the garden. Cypress trees are almost certainly to have been planted being popular similes in Persian poetry for the slender elegant stature of the beloved. By the end of the 18th century, Thomas Twining noted orange trees and a large plan of the complex suggests beds of various other fruits such as pineapples, pomegranates, bananas, limes and apples. The British, {{at the end of the}} 19th century thinned <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the increasingly forested trees, replanted the cypresses and laid the gardens to lawns in their own taste.|$|E
25|$|The January 1986 {{overthrow}} of President Tito Okello, an ethnic Acholi, by the National Resistance Army (NRA) of south-west Uganda born Yoweri Museveni marked {{a period of}} intense turmoil. The NRA {{in their efforts to}} liberate the entire country meted <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> atrocities on the people of Acholi. This act spurred some Acholis to resist the medieval acts. The Acholi are sometimes said to have feared the loss of their traditional dominance of the national military; they were also deeply concerned that the NRA would seek retribution for the brutal counterinsurgency, particularly the actions of the army in the Luwero triangle. By August of that year, a full-blown popular insurgency had developed in northern regions that were occupied by the new government forces.|$|E
25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E

500|$|After {{developing}} a loose plot together, Joshua wrote the full scripts and suggested layouts. Ultra {{was the first}} comic book Joshua wrote. From there, Jonathan did the pencils by hand with a mechanical pencil and inks with a Micron pen. After scanning the inked artwork and editing it where needed on a Wacom tablet, he would add the colors and letters. He worked at an average rate of one page per day. They {{were able to make}} one full issue every four weeks. The Lunas described the creation of Ultra as [...] "organic", admitting they had a plan but saying they [...] "figured <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things as [...] were doing them". A plot synopsis and a five-page sample of the comic was submitted blindly to and accepted by Image Comics publisher Erik Larsen.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} Astral Weeks, Morrison {{moved with}} his wife to a home on a mountain top in the Catskills near Woodstock, a hamlet in upstate New York with an artistic community. Because of the album's poor sales figures, the singer wanted to produce a third record {{that would be more}} accessible and appealing to listeners: [...] "I make albums primarily to sell them and if I get too far <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people can't relate to it. I had to forget about the artistic thing because it didn't make sense on a practical level. One has to live." [...] He began writing songs for Moondance in July 1969. The musicians who went on to record the album with Morrison were recruited from Woodstock and would continue working with him for several years, including guitarist John Platania, saxophonist Jack Schroer, and keyboardist Jef Labes. The singer left after the Woodstock music festival in August attracted an influx of people to the area.|$|E

500|$|During filming, Gillian Anderson {{was unsure}} how exactly to perform her lines. She noted, [...] "the way the script was {{originally}} read to me, initially {{seemed to me}} as if Scully kind of {{stepped up to the plate}} and played along with the sheriff's humor". She reportedly performed her lines in a [...] "tongue in cheek"-esque way before receiving a call from Carter. He informed her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to [...] "edit <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stuff" [...] in order to make up for this. Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at the places they stood in for. The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen. The scenes required the store to be closed before Christmas and be installed with up-right freezers.|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producers}} Rick Berman and Brannon Braga {{had worked}} together to write a series of episodes for , with [...] "A Night in Sickbay" [...] amongst them.

He {{said it was a}} [...] "very humorous episode that has our good captain going and spending some time in sickbay, because his dog gets sick. He moves into sickbay the same way a mother will move into the hospital when her child gets sick, and it ends up being an 'Odd Couple' kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It's a lot of fun." [...] Bakula also explained {{in an interview with the}} website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will [...] "find <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stuff about [...] that we may not have wanted to know; like what he does when he's in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!" [...] Billingsley said later that he enjoyed working with Bakula on this episode and called [...] "A Night in Sickbay" [...] one of his favourites.|$|E

500|$|Thau explained, [...] "I {{worked on}} Ladyhawke and that's how I really met Dick [...] and Tom Mankiewicz. I {{used to hear}} those {{wonderful}} stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'". Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color {{back to where it}} should be." [...] Thau wanted to make the film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around. I also wanted to take <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> that car chase where it was just generic action… It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [...] out [...] the poem." [...] It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing [...] "bare bones" [...] editions of Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray.

500|$|The initial {{prototype}} of the game had styling similar to a text-based role-playing game, with a large open world and many sub-quests. After moving towards [...] "multiple-choice text answers" [...] and a complicated gameplay system, the team decided to simplify the game and set the 2007 Independent Games Festival as a deadline to complete everything. With this time pressure, they forced themselves to cut <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> what they felt was unneeded complexity, bringing the game to its core. After removing many of what they decided were extraneous elements they then added back in the cooking system, which they felt fit well {{with the rest of}} the game, as well as a map system. They then developed the game world and story in a roughly linear manner, creating basic designs of each region and then coming back to fill in details. They felt that this allowed them to create interesting ideas at the beginning of the game and then fill them out and resolve them at the end. One of these ideas was that of the [...] "verse"; Holowka realized partway through development that he had been using the same twelve-note sequence transposed into different keys throughout the music, and realized that the idea of a pervasive musical theme to the world fit with the story. The game also includes a level and animation editor; several mods have been made for the game.|$|E
500|$|Later in the year, Gardner invited Valiente {{to visit}} him at his flat in Shepherd's Bush, West London, {{and it was there}} that she met the eight to ten members of his Bricket Wood coven, which met near St. Albans, north of London. She soon rose to become the coven's High Priestess. The {{historian}} Ronald Hutton later commented that in doing so, she formed [...] "the second great creative partnership of [...] life" [...] after that with Woodford-Grimes. Valiente recognised how much of the material in Gardner's Book of Shadows was taken not from ancient sources as Gardner had initially claimed, but from the works of Crowley. She confronted Gardner with this, who claimed that the text he had received from the New Forest coven had been fragmentary and he had had to fill much of it using various sources. She took the Book of Shadows, and with Gardner's permission, rewrote much of it, cutting <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sections that had come from Crowley, fearing that his infamous reputation would sully Wicca. In 1953 she wrote [...] "Queen of the Moon, Queen of the Stars", an invocation for use in a Yule ritual which was inspired by a Hebridean song found in the Carmina Gadelica. With Gardner she also wrote [...] "The Witches Rune", a chant for use while dancing in a circle. She rewrote much of the Charge of the Goddess, with Hutton characterising this act as [...] "her greatest single contribution to Wicca", for her version of the Charge became [...] "the principle expression of Wiccan spirituality" [...] in coming years.|$|E
