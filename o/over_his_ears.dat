2500|$|After the May 2014 {{military}} coup, Pravit and {{a fellow}} journalist, Thanapol Eawsakul, were summoned by the military on 23 May 2014. Before answering the summons, Pravit told the Thai media, [...] "I hope people will not give up the spirit and that General Prayuth {{will be the last}} dictator of Thailand". He was said to have added: [...] "They can detain me, but can never detain my conscience". He thereupon taped his mouth shut and put his hands <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> On the following day he went with a lawyer and representatives of the UN to the headquarters of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). He was questioned for five hours without his lawyer being present and was then taken to an unidentified detention center.|$|E
60|$|Baloo {{clasped his}} paws <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and rolled {{to and fro}} moaning.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he made a}} fretful {{movement}} and put his hands <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I guess not," [...] stammered Lieutenant Radbury. Then {{he passed}} <b>his</b> hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> and withdrew it covered with blood. [...] "But I reckon he nipped me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Announcer Gary Owens {{regularly}} {{stands in}} an old-time radio studio with <b>his</b> hand cupped <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> making announcements, often with little {{relation to the}} rest of the show, such as (in an overly-dramatic voice), [...] "Earlier that evening..." ...|$|R
60|$|Her warm breath playing, flying rhythmically <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> {{seemed to}} relax the tension. She {{could feel his}} body {{gradually}} relaxing a little, losing its terrifying, unnatural rigidity. Her hands clutched his limbs, <b>his</b> muscles, going <b>over</b> him spasmodically.|$|R
60|$|His fez {{had fallen}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> {{and his face}} was all smudged with tears.|$|E
60|$|These {{were a few}} {{questions}} hurled at Gif after {{he had made his}} important announcement. He placed his hands <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> in despair.|$|E
60|$|He {{thrust his}} hat upon his head, pulling it down <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> {{because of the}} rough wind, and walked forward quite jauntily for a few yards.|$|E
60|$|Besides {{his bright}} red robe, the young prince wore {{nothing but the}} symbol of Valapeean royalty; a string of small, close-fitting, concave shells, coiled and ambushed in his profuse, curly hair; one end falling <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> {{revealing}} a serpent's head, curiously carved from a nutmeg.|$|R
60|$|Maurie {{removed his}} cap and {{scratched}} the hair <b>over</b> <b>his</b> left <b>ear</b> reflectively.|$|R
6000|$|That {{incident}} put Ken out of {{the practice}} for three days. He had a bruise <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> {{as large as a}} small apple. Ken did not mind the pain nor the players' remarks that he had a swelled head anyway, but he remembered with slow-gathering wrath Graves's words: [...] "I said I'd get you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Claus now seated {{himself in}} the sledge, drew a warm robe over his knees and his fur cap <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> and cracked his long whip as a signal to start.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't be beat," [...] he said--incorrectly--replaced his glasses, {{brought his}} elbows down {{on either side}} of his box with {{resonant}} violence, and clutched the hair <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> with both hands....|$|E
6000|$|The Professor put {{his hands}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> {{with a look of}} dismay. [...] "If you once let him begin a Poem," [...] he said to Sylvie, [...] "he'll never leave off again! He never does!" ...|$|E
50|$|Ralph has his {{assistant}} Newman Noggs (adorned with a feather quill <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> to denote <b>his</b> quirky {{nature in the}} novel) deliver an ultimatum: that he will provide for Mrs. Nickelby and Kate if Nicholas leaves London. Noggs delivers {{the message to the}} Nicklebys, and Nicholas and Smike then depart London to seek their fortune.|$|R
6000|$|From the curl {{of silver}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> to the pose of {{his foot in}} its elastic-sided patent boot, there was nothing clumsy or weak about old Jolyon. He was as upright--very nearly--as in those old times when he came every night; his sight was as good--almost as good. But what a feeling of weariness and disillusion! ...|$|R
60|$|The King {{looked around}} for {{something}} to throw at General Blug, but as nothing was handy he began to consider that perhaps the man was right {{and he had been}} talking foolishly. So he merely threw himself into his glittering throne and tipped <b>his</b> crown <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> and curled <b>his</b> feet up under him and glared wickedly at Blug.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Stubbs's brother {{stood as}} erect as possible, {{and was so}} excited by the cheers of the boys that he seized the flowers he had tucked <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> and flung them at the party in great glee.|$|E
60|$|A steed {{was soon}} saddled, and off Dick rode, wrapped in his {{overcoat}} {{and with an}} old fur cap pulled well down <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> It had now stopped snowing, so the weather was not quite as unpleasant as it had been.|$|E
60|$|He was {{buttoning}} on a heavy grey overcoat of Noachian cut, with {{cape and}} high collar, {{the latter being}} erect and rigid, like a girdling wall, and nearly reaching to {{the verge of a}} travelling cap which was pulled down <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
60|$|The King {{grabbed a}} big ruby {{and threw it}} at Kaliko's head. The Steward ducked to escape the heavy jewel, which crashed against the door just <b>over</b> <b>his</b> left <b>ear.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{then came}} Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman, with his funnel-shaped cap tipped {{carelessly}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> left <b>ear,</b> <b>his</b> gleaming axe <b>over</b> <b>his</b> right shoulder, and {{his whole body}} sparkling as brightly as it had ever done {{in the old days}} when first she knew him.|$|R
500|$|The four visit a {{landfill}} to meet Kwai's cousin Tony, who supplies illegal arms. Tony tells {{them that he}} [...] "sawed off" [...] a matching weapon for a Hong Kong hitman who works on Seafood Street. As the four men reach the street, they see {{a man with a}} bandage <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> However, they see only two men. Kwai's syndicate decide to wait until the men lead them to the third attacker. The two suspects head towards the countryside as Kwai's syndicate follows.|$|R
60|$|The {{top of the}} man's {{head was}} gone. Not a vestige of hair or of white skin remained, but in place {{of it was a}} dreadful crinkled {{discoloured}} surface with a sharp red line running across his brow and round <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
60|$|This was true. Sawney {{had picked}} up a {{traveller}} who was glad to find a conveyance going across the moor to his destination. This man was a quick-moving person in a heavy waterproof coat with its collar turned up <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Draw it mild, Stevie, my man; ye play unco weel, but ye mak a most infernal din," [...] cried Uncle Jem, {{with his}} hands <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> for this {{accomplishment}} was new to him, and [...] "took him all aback," [...] as he expressed it.|$|E
60|$|By and by Straw-top {{comes down}} again, and I {{crossed the street}} to meet him, for I had my ideas. Yes, sir, when I got close I could see where he {{overdone}} it. He was Reub all right {{as far as his}} blue jeans and cowhide boots went, but he had a matinee actor's hands, and the rye straw stuck <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> looked like it belonged to the property man of the Old Homestead Co. Curiosity to know what his graft was got the best of me.|$|R
50|$|Ears: Charles' dog who {{constantly}} trips <b>over</b> <b>his</b> long floppy <b>ears.</b> He is {{voiced by}} Jay Johnson.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be afraid, little one. The beast can't {{hurt you}} while I'm around!" [...] And then he tipped <b>his</b> cap <b>over</b> <b>his</b> left <b>ear</b> and shook <b>his</b> club at the Prince, {{as if he}} did not know what fear meant.|$|R
6000|$|... [The lady-in-waiting {{unlocks the}} door. NAPOLEON enters, {{scarcely}} [...] recognizable, in a fur cloak and hood <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> He throws [...] off the cloak and discloses {{himself to be}} in the shabbiest and [...] muddiest attire. Marie Louise is agitated almost to fainting.] ...|$|E
60|$|He was in {{the depth}} of the woods when, at a turn in the path, he saw a figure ahead of him. The {{individual}} wore a heavy overcoat and had a cap pulled well down <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and the back of his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Damn you--come down!" [...] he shouted, infuriated at the mustang, {{and with}} both hands he gave a {{powerful}} lunge. Spottie came down, and stood there, trembling all <b>over,</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> laid back, his eyes showing fright and pain. Blood dripped from his mouth where the bit had cut him.|$|E
60|$|The {{watchman}} {{was indeed}} in bad shape. He {{had been found}} thrown under a workbench, and just returning to consciousness. He had a cut <b>over</b> <b>his</b> left <b>ear</b> and another on his forehead, from which the blood had flowed freely.|$|R
60|$|Maxwell {{stood by}} his desk {{with his hands}} full of telegrams and memoranda, with a {{fountain}} pen <b>over</b> <b>his</b> right <b>ear</b> and <b>his</b> hair hanging in disorderly strings <b>over</b> <b>his</b> forehead. His window was open, for the beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the waking registers of the earth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite. And {{there is}} plenty more where it came from"Â—tapping his head with his finger, and taking {{occasion}} {{at the same time}} to cant <b>his</b> morion <b>over</b> <b>his</b> right <b>ear,</b> which gave him a very self-satisfied airÂ—"I do not need to borrow my ideas, like Noel Rainguesson." ...|$|R
