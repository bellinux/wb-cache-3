5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> day the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{concluded}} as {{the worst}} day for the United States Air Force in Vietnam since 2 December 1966, when they had lost five aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam in a single day. Consequently, the actions of 23 August became known as ‘Black Wednesday’ amongst U.S. pilots who participated in air operations over Hanoi <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> day. The USAF officially confirmed the loss of three F-4D fighters during the raid against the Yen Vien rail yard, {{which resulted in the}} deaths of Weapon Systems Officers Captain Ronald N. Sittner (66-0238, 8th TFW) and First Lieutenant Charles Lane (66-00247, 8th TFW). Major Charles R. Tyler, Captain Larry E. Carrigan, Major Robert R. Sawhill and First Lieutenant Gerald L. Gerndt ejected safely from their aircraft, but they were captured alive and became prisoners of war. Major C.B. Demarque and his Weapons System Officer, First Lieutenant J.M. Piet were rescued shortly after they ejected from their malfunctioned aircraft over Thai airspace.|$|E

Interestingly European comics constitute {{a substantial portion}} of the comics published for the alternative market: 36.2% of the comics <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> market were of European origin in 2009. This is due to a large number of small print numbered, collector's editions of Mosaik books.|$|E
25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it.

Instead of {{trying to find out}} why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting to have taken place would have been to fake his death.|$|E

With Red Barber announcing, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds played a doubleheader at Ebbets Field. The Reds won the first game 5–2 while the Dodgers won the second, 6–1. Barber called the game {{without the benefit of}} a monitor and with only two cameras capturing the game. One camera was on Barber and the other was behind the plate.

25|$|The unit {{received}} a Distinguished Unit Citation for a mission on 24 March 1945 {{when the group}} escorted B-17s during a raid on the Daimler-Benz tank factory at Berlin, fought the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet interceptors that attacked the formation, and strafed transportation facilities while flying back to the base in Italy. During the action, its pilots were credited with destroying three Me 262s of the Luftwaffes all-jet Jagdgeschwader 7 in aerial combat that day, despite the American unit initially claiming 11 Me 262s <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> mission. Upon examination of German records, JG 7 records, just four Me 262s were lost {{and all of the}} pilots survived. In return, the 463rd Bomb Group, one of the many B-17 groups the 332d were escorting, lost two bombers, and the 332d lost three P-51s during the mission. Fifteenth Air Force dispatched about 660 bombers, 250 of these headed for Berlin. Altogether, Fifteenth Air Force lost nine B-17s and one B-24, out of the fighter escort, five P-51 Mustangs were destroyed during this sortie. Three of the four Me 262 jets that were lost by the Luftwaffe were reportedly shot down, all their pilots bailed out wounded.|$|E

25|$|Registration 1 {{sold for}} £7.25million {{and is the}} highest price paid for a plate – in the United Arab Emirates. It was {{purchased}} by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008. As of 2014, the registration 25O broke a new record of being the highest priced plate sold at a DVLA auction. Registration 25O was purchased for £518,000 by Ferrari dealer John Collins in 2014; the plate now sits pride of place on a Ferrari 250 SWB once owned by rock star Eric Clapton. Registration F1 and RAC3R have been considered as the most desirable plates amongst supercar and Formula One fanatics. The registration RAC3R is a suffix style plate that was issued {{in the same year}} British racing driver James Hunt won the Formula One World Championship in 1976. The plate covers an endless list of all the different forms of racing, making it extremely desirable. Since there has been a big fuss over race related plates the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency has made a racer game for motorists to celebrate the huge profits made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010. Unlike horse racing, Formula One racing has become more popular in the last few years, hence why the F1 plate was always going to sell well. On 25 January 2008 the registration F1 sold for £440,000 to Bradford Car design entrepreneur Afzal Kahn. The plate was previously owned and sold by Essex County Council and was sold to raise money for training young drivers. Today the F1 plate has a valuation less than the winning bid with the price tag stagnating <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> plate. Originally the plate was affixed in 1904 to the Panhard et Levassor of the then County Surveyor. Previously, a few months before the F1 plate was purchased, the S1 plate sold for £397,500 at an auction in September 2007 by an anonymous buyer making it the second most expensive number plate ever sold in the UK. The S1 plate was originally owned by Sir John H A MacDonald, the Lord Kingsburgh and was Edinburgh's first ever number plate. Within the space of two years the S1 plate sold for £65,500 more than the M1 plate that sold at auction in Goodwood on 7 July 2006. Registrations 1D VIP1 51NGH K1NGS and 1O are also marked as considerably expensive plates that have sold publicly in excess of six figures.|$|E

As a result of analyzing an 28 interviews with psychotherapists, it was suggested that the following three aspects are involved in understanding the nature of relationships in clinical psychotherapy: 1) the stance of interviewing using relationships as a topic, 2) the stance of interviewing using relationships as a medium of communication, and 3) the stance of interviewing using relationships as a foundation. Regarding actual psychotherapy, it was suggested that each stance is not be fixed and be allowed to alternate fluidly, thus advancing the interview process...|$|R
