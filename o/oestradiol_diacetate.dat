40|$|The {{well-known}} {{response of}} the breast feathers of the Brown Leghorn capon to oestrogens can readily {{be used to determine}} the rate of absorption of different esters[Parkes, 1937]. In the male the breast feathers are black; injection of oestrogen while feathers are growing causes deposition of the fawn pigment characteristic of the female. Only that part of the feather is changed which is growing when oestrogen is present; existing plumage is not affected. Since the rate of feather growth is known, the width of the fawn bar in the black feather indicates the time during which effective amounts of oestrogen were circulating. Thus, if a single injection is given, the duration of effect of a compound can easily be ascertained. In the work previously recorded the duration of action of the following substances was examined: oestrone, oestrone acetate, oestrone benzoate, oestrone methyl ether, oestradiol, <b>oestradiol</b> <b>diacetate,</b> oestradiol monobenzoate, oestradiol dibenzoate, oestradiol 3 -benzoate 17 -acetate, 17 -methyl oestradiol, oestriol, oestriol triacetate. The results were clear cut, and showed, in concordance with mammahan experiments, that certain of the esters, notably oestradiol benzoate acetate, have a very prolonged action. It was later demonstrated [Deanesly & Parkes, 1937] that the prolonge...|$|E
