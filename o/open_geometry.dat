50|$|Electric {{stirring}} explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry. This property {{can be used}} {{to induce}} spin polarization in conventional semiconductors by purely electric means. Strictly speaking stirring is a non-linear effect, because in linear response theory (LRT) an AC driving induces an AC current with the same frequency. Still an adaptation of the LRT Kubo formalism allows the analysis of stirring. The quantum pumping problem (where we have an <b>open</b> <b>geometry)</b> can be regarded as a special limit of the quantum stirring problem (where we have a closed geometry). Optionally the latter can be analyzed within the framework of scattering theory. Pumping and Stirring devices are close relatives of ratchet systems. The latter are defined in this context as AC driven spatially periodic arrays, where DC current is induced.|$|E
40|$|The Levy walk {{model is}} {{studied in the}} context of the {{anomalous}} heat conduction of one dimensional systems. In this model the heat carriers execute Levy-walks instead of normal diffusion as expected in systems where Fourier's law holds. Here we calculate exactly the average heat current, the large deviation function of its fluctuations and the temperature profile of the Levy-walk model maintained in a steady state by contact with two heat baths (the <b>open</b> <b>geometry).</b> We find that the current is non-locally connected to the temperature gradient. As observed in recent simulations of mechanical models, all the cumulants of the current fluctuations have the same system-size dependence in the <b>open</b> <b>geometry.</b> For the ring geometry, we argue that a size dependent cut-off time is necessary for the Levy walk model to behave as mechanical models. This modification does not affect the results on transport in the <b>open</b> <b>geometry</b> for large enough system sizes. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|We present first worldline {{analytical}} and numerical {{results for the}} nontrivial interplay between geometry and temperature dependencies of the Casimir effect. We show that the temperature dependence of the Casimir force can be significantly larger for <b>open</b> <b>geometries</b> (e. g., perpendicular plates) than for closed geometries (e. g., parallel plates). For surface separations in the experimentally relevant range, the thermal correction for the perpendicular-plates configuration exhibits a stronger parameter dependence and exceeds that for parallel plates by {{an order of magnitude}} at room temperature.
