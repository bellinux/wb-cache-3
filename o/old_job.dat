40|$|In the {{demographic}} change, a prolongation of individual employment and thus of beginning a new employment in later {{stages of the}} work life is of growing importance. On the base of microeconomic data (establishment panel of the IAB), this paper analyses firms' characteristics correlating with their recruitment behaviour towards the elderly (age 50 and more). Special consideration {{is given to the}} labour supply, which is here observed as the existence of an application from job seekers of age 50 and more, and which is a condition for recruiting of older employees. The results show that about 75 % of the firms did not have an application of <b>older</b> <b>job</b> seekers. Of the remaining firms, which reported to have applications from <b>older</b> <b>job</b> seekers, about half of the firms recruited <b>older</b> <b>job</b> seekers, and the other half did not so. However, there are remarkable differences between firms which received applications from <b>older</b> <b>job</b> seekers and firms which are willing to recruit <b>older</b> <b>job</b> candidates. Possible explanations point to the search behaviour of job seekers {{as well as to the}} signalling of firms on the labour market towards the elderly...|$|R
40|$|This study explores how wage {{flexibility}} and job search intensity evolve with search duration among young, middle-aged and <b>older</b> <b>job</b> seekers. It moreover investigates whether financial hardship and reemployment efficacy mediate the relationships. Multi-group {{structural equation modeling}} on a sample of 1205 Belgian unemployed job seekers showed that search duration affected both {{wage flexibility}} and job search intensity, and that effect sizes differed across age groups. Wage flexibility did not evolve with search duration among young and middle-aged job seekers. Yet, our analyses revealed a direct, negative relationship between search duration and wage flexibility among <b>older</b> <b>job</b> seekers. While financial hardship and reemployment efficacy fully mediate the positive relationship between search duration and search intensity for middle-aged seekers, they only partially mediate the relationship for <b>older</b> <b>job</b> seekers. We discuss implications for theory, practice and future research. job search intensity; wage flexibility; age;...|$|R
40|$|We use {{an unusually}} rich Canadian survey {{to examine how}} post-job-loss {{behaviour}} and outcomes vary with age of the job loser. We find that <b>older</b> <b>job</b> losers experience greater postdisplacement joblessness, and {{are less likely to}} return quickly to satisfactory employment. We show that this apparent age effect is not a job tenure effect or wealth effect. We also find that <b>older</b> <b>job</b> losers, compared to mid-career job losers, are as likely to report searching for work, but that they search less intensely (reporting fewer hours of search, and lower out of pocket expenditures on search). They are also less likely to retrain, less likely to undertake a geographic move, and less likely to switch occupations. Thus, the data suggest <b>older</b> <b>job</b> losers are less likely to make career investments after job loss. This may be a rational response to a shorter time horizon, or to more limited labour market opportunities. job loss, <b>job</b> search, <b>older</b> workers...|$|R

With Goldman's encouragement, Berkman began to write an account of his prison years, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist, and she invited him to become the editor of her journal, Mother Earth. He served as editor from 1907 to 1915, and took the journal in a more provocative and practical direction, {{in contrast to the}} more theoretical approach which had been favored by the previous editor, Max Baginski. Under Berkman's stewardship, circulation of Mother Earth rose as high as 10,000 and it became the leading anarchist publication in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|One {{potential}} way {{to manage}} the rapidly growing costs of supporting older Americans is to increase labor supply at older ages. However, questions persist {{about the quality of}} available jobs. This study examines older Americans’ employment opportunities by studying <b>job</b> changes at <b>older</b> ages. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, it compares wages, benefits, and other job attributes on new and former jobs for adults ages 45 to 75 who changed employers between 1986 and 2004. Because older people who choose to work after retiring voluntarily from long-term jobs may face different employment prospects than displaced older workers, the analysis considers how employment changes vary by the reasons workers give for job separations. Most people who switched employers at older ages moved to jobs that differed substantially from their previous jobs. The vast majority of <b>older</b> <b>job</b> changers moved into different occupations and industries. They {{were more likely to be}} self-employed, work part-time, and keep flexible hours at their new <b>jobs</b> than their <b>old</b> <b>jobs.</b> The new jobs generally involved less stress, less physical effort, and fewer managerial responsibilities. More <b>older</b> <b>job</b> changers enjoyed their new <b>jobs</b> than their <b>old</b> <b>jobs.</b> However, most <b>older</b> workers experienced sharp hourly wage reductions when they switched employers. They were also less likely to receive pension coverage or health benefits after they moved to new jobs. Although the findings do not raise concerns about the quality of post-retirement jobs, they suggest that older displaced workers face special challenges in the labor market. labor supply, older ages, increase, employment, opportunities, wages, benefits, employer change, job changers...|$|R

5|$|Monique Jeffries is a {{tough and}} street-wise detective with the Special Victims Unit of the New York City Police Department. After briefly partnering with Ken Briscoe (Chris Orbach), she becomes the {{permanent}} partner of John Munch (Richard Belzer) after his previous partner, Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), leaves the unit. The two occasionally clash personalities and have a sarcastic rapport with each other. While chasing a rape suspect during one case, Jeffries is nearly killed when the suspect gets into a car that explodes. She initially appears traumatized by the incident, but later feels exhilarated over having survived and starts behaving recklessly. She begins having several one-night stands and takes greater and greater risks at work, becoming something of a loose cannon at the Special Victims Unit. One night at a bar, she meets {{a man who had}} been a suspect in a previous rape case and has sex with him. When she reveals the incident during a session with a police therapist, she is taken out of active duty per One Police Plaza and works a desk job. She objects to the transfer and threatens to sue the department. Instead, she is transferred to the Vice department, and her <b>old</b> <b>job</b> in the Special Victims Unit is taken by Fin Tutuola (Ice-T).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a due date setting {{problem in a}} flowshop layout. The problem {{consists}} of scheduling a set of jobs arriving to the system together with jobs already present (denoted as <b>old</b> <b>jobs),</b> in order to set a common due date for the new <b>jobs.</b> Since the <b>old</b> <b>jobs</b> have a common due date that must not be violated, our problem is a rescheduling problem {{with the objective of}} minimising the makespan of the new jobs (thus obtaining the tightest possible due date for the new jobs) and a constraint since the maximum tardiness of the <b>old</b> <b>jobs</b> must be equal to zero. This approach leads to an interesting scheduling problem in which two different objectives are considered, each one for a subset of the jobs that must be scheduled. To the best of our knowledge, this type of problems have been scarcely considered in the literature, and only for very specific purposes. Since our problem is clearly NP-hard, a new heuristic based on variable neighbourhood search (VNS) has been designed. The computational results show that our proposed heuristic outperforms two existing heuristic methods for similar problems in the literature. CICYT Project DPI 2007 - 6134...|$|R

5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his <b>old</b> <b>job.</b> By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Navy {{examined}} {{the ship in}} great detail after she arrived in Libau. The cruiser was then renamed Admiral Makarov and assigned to the 8th Fleet, based in Tallinn.

In the early 1950s, three new s entered service, which prompted the Soviet Navy to withdraw Admiral Makarov from front line duties. She returned to her <b>old</b> <b>job</b> as a training cruiser, this time based in Kronstadt in mid-1954. During this period, most of her light anti-aircraft armament was removed, and new radars were installed. Her ultimate fate is unclear; she appears to have been placed out of service by May 1959, and was scrapped some time thereafter, reportedly by mid-1960. Nevertheless, she was the longest-surviving major warship of the Kriegsmarine, and the only one to see active service {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

Any doubts about his ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to the Western Desert Campaign. During the Battle of Bardia in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. In the Battle of Greece, he became the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle. He suffered a series of reverses in Greece, but impressed the troops under his command with his courage under fire. He was recalled to Australia in 1941 to serve as General Officer Commanding Home Forces. On 6 April 1942, he assumed command of the Second Army.
