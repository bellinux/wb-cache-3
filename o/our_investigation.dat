The only UNRWA summer activities actually depicted are those shot in Gaza. However, <b>our</b> <b>investigation</b> of the film has revealed that absolutely nothing anti-Semitic or inflammatory was done or said in the scenes filmed in Gaza.|$|E
500|$|US Attorney Washington states he {{does not}} believe the noose {{incident}} and the beatings were related. [...] Walters likewise said that he believes there is no linkage between the noose incident and the beating. [...] "When this case was brought to me and during <b>our</b> <b>investigation</b> and during the trial, there was no such linkage ever suggested. This compact story line has only been suggested after the fact." [...] Although Washington believes that both the noose hangings and the Barker battery were symptoms of racial tension, he has also said that there was no apparent lingering anger among students at the school after the nooses were found.|$|E

2500|$|On January 9, 2006, David G. Dye, acting {{assistant}} Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, announced that [...] "MSHA joins Governor Manchin and the State of West Virginia in announcing {{that we will}} conduct a joint investigation into the Sago Mine disaster, which will include a joint public hearing.

2500|$|Comey {{informed}} Congress of {{this additional}} investigation despite having been advised by Justice Department officials {{that such an}} announcement would violate department policies and procedures, including a policy not to comment on investigations close to an election. Comey later explained, {{in a letter to}} FBI employees, [...] "We don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that <b>our</b> <b>investigation</b> was completed." [...] Law enforcement sources added that he feared he would be accused of concealing relevant information if he did not disclose it.|$|E
2500|$|... 2. Israel profoundly regrets {{the loss}} of human life at Kana and has {{thoroughly}} investigated this tragic incident which was caused, first and foremost, by the firing of Katyusha rockets and mortars by Hizbullah from a location {{in close proximity to}} the UN position; We reiterate that the IDF had no intention whatsoever of firing on the UN position at Kana. <b>Our</b> <b>investigation</b> has shown that the UN position was hit by artillery fire due to incorrect targeting based on erroneous data.

2500|$|On December 16, 2015, Comey said, [...] "We can {{see from}} <b>our</b> <b>investigation</b> that in late 2013, before there is a {{physical}} meeting of these two people [...] resulting in their engagement and then journey to the United States, they are communicating online, showing signs in that communication of their joint commitment to jihadism and to martyrdom. Those communications are direct, private messages." [...] Comey said that the FBI's investigation had revealed that the perpetrators were [...] "consuming poison on the Internet" [...] and both had become radicalized [...] "before they started courting or dating each other online" [...] and [...] "before the emergence of ISIL." [...] As a result, Comey said that [...] "untangling the motivations of which particular terrorist propaganda motivated in what way remains a challenge in these investigations, and our work is ongoing there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 12, 2011, The Game {{decided to}} tweet {{his search for}} a {{supposed}} internship opening. In the message sent to his over 580,000 followers, he posted the number to call as the emergency line for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. The Game's fans jammed the line for hours. Initially, The Game denied any wrongdoing saying the tweet was [...] "a mistake". The Game then posted a message saying the sheriff's department can [...] "track a tweet down but you can't solve murders!" [...] A criminal investigation was launched stating that The Game could be charged for obstruction of justice. Despite all of this, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department issued this statement: [...] "Based upon <b>our</b> <b>investigation,</b> as well as consultation with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, the LASD considers the criminal investigation into this matter closed. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will not be seeking criminal charges." [...] The Game issued an apology on CNN saying, [...] "My sincerest apologies to the Sheriff's Department, {{it was a joke}} gone wrong." ...|$|E
