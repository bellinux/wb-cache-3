A large number of synthetic methods such as solvothermal, hydrothermal [5, 6] and sonochemical process [7], microwave heating [8] and solution-based chemical methods [9] provide effective routes to prepare semiconductor nanoparticles. For nanoparticles prepared by solution-based chemical methods, a capping agent, which adsorbs on to the nanoparticle surface, is generally added both to control the size of the nanoparticles and to prevent agglomeration of the synthesized particles. These adsorbents have been shown to alter the electronic structure of the nanoparticles [10, 11].|$|R
40|$|A glass optical {{waveguide}} {{process has been}} developed for fabrication of electro-optical circuit boards (EOCB). Very thin glass panels with planar integrated single-mode waveguides can be embedded as a core layer in printed circuit boards for high-speed board-level chip-to-chip and board-to-board optical interconnects over an optical backplane. Such singlemode EOCBs will be needed in upcoming high performance computers and data storage network environments in case single-mode operating silicon photonic ICs generate high-bandwidth signals [1]. The paper will describe some project results of the ongoing PhoxTroT project, in which a development of glass based single-mode on-board and board-to-board interconnection platform is successfully in progress. The optical design comprises a 500 μm thin glass panel (Schott D 263 Teco) with purely optical layers for single-mode glass waveguides. The board size is accommodated to the mask size limitations of the fabrication (200 mm wafer level process, being later transferred also to larger panel size).

50|$|The {{image on}} the right shows the optical {{transfer}} functions for two different <b>optical</b> systems in <b>panels</b> (a) and (d). The former corresponds to the ideal, diffraction-limited, imaging system with a circular pupil. Its transfer function decreases approximately gradually with spatial frequency until it reaches the diffraction-limit, in this case at 500 cycles per millimeter or a period of 2 μm. Since periodic features as small as this period are captured by this imaging system, {{it could be said}} that its resolution is 2 μm. Panel (b) shows an optical system that is out of focus. This leads to a sharp reduction in contrast compared to the diffraction-limited imaging system. It can be seen that the contrast is zero around 250 cycles/mm, or periods of 4 μm. This explains why the images for the out-of-focus system (e,f) are more blurry than those of the diffraction-limited system (b,c). Note that although the out-of-focus system has very low contrast at spatial frequencies around 250 cycles/mm, the contrast at spatial frequencies near the diffraction limit of 500 cycles/mm is nearly diffraction-limited. Close observation of the image in panel (f) shows that the spoke structure is relatively sharp for the large spoke densities {{near the center of the}} spoke target.|$|R

WO 3 nanowires are mainly used for sensing various nitrogen oxides, while nanoporous WO 3 is used for sensing alcohol [16, 17]. The most important feature of sensor based on WO 3 nanowires is that their response is not affected by the extent of humidity. Diverse forms of WO 3 nanowires such as monoclinic [18], hexagonal [19], and cubic [20] have recently been synthesized by adopting different methodologies. Various methods such as electrochemical deposition, electroless deposition, electrophoretic deposition, template filling, sol–gel method, and pressure injection techniques have been employed for the fabrication of tungsten trioxide on template. Among different techniques, electroless deposition is a straightforward and room temperature method for growing nanostructures. It is actually a deposition process that involves the coating of a material on template surface using a chemical agent without applying electric current. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly ordered hexagonal porous anodized alumina structure using two-step anodization, the two-step anodization is a favorable method for generating template nanostructures of improved morphology and for fabricating cubic tungsten trioxide nanowires by simple electroless deposition method.|$|R
