40|$|This video {{demonstrates}} {{the concept of}} two UAVs in which one UAV is ‘blind’, i. e. has no sensing methods other than its onboard IMU, whereas the <b>other</b> <b>UAV</b> has a proper knowledge of its position and orientation in space. By observing a marker attached to the blind <b>UAV,</b> the <b>other</b> <b>UAV</b> helps the blind UAV in controlling its absolute position in space. It does so by estimating the relative pose between the two and adding this to the absolute position estimate of the ‘non-blind’ UAV. The video shows a proof-of-concept for this approach, which could be utilized in cases where an aerial manipulator needs to interact closely with feature-poor environments...|$|R

50|$|In 2012, the USAF trained more UAV pilots than {{ordinary}} jet fighter pilots {{for the first}} time. Unlike <b>other</b> <b>UAVs,</b> the Predator was armed with Hellfire missiles {{so that it can}} terminate the target that it locates. This was done after Predators sighted Osama Bin Laden multiple times but could not do anything about it other than send back images. In addition, the Predator is capable of orchestrating attacks by pointing lasers at the targets. This is important, as it puts a robot in a position to set off an attack. Their overall success is apparent because from June 2005 to June 2006 alone, Predators carried out 2,073 missions and participated in 242 separate raids.|$|E
