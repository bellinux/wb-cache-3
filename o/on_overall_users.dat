40|$|While Spoken Dialogue Systems {{have gained}} in {{importance}} in recent years, most systems {{applied in the}} real world are still static and error-prone. To overcome this, the user is put into the focus of dialogue management. Hence, an approach for adapting the course of the dialogue to Interaction Quality, an objective variant of user satisfaction, is presented in this work. In general, rendering the dialogue adaptive to user satisfaction enables the dialogue system to improve the course of the dialogue and to handle problematic situations better. In this contribution, we present a pilot study of quality-adaptive dialogue. By selecting the confirmation strategy based on the current IQ value, the course of the dialogue is adapted in order to improve the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience. In a user experiment comparing three different confirmation strategies in a train booking domain, the adaptive strategy performs successful and is among the two best rated strategies based <b>on</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience...|$|R

The results of this survey show that in the world of financial institutions, the level of assets and public exposure is highly correlated with the level of sophistication in DNS (Record) management. Specifically, we show that a number of (often smaller-scale) banks choose inappropriately long DNS TTL values, creating a vulnerability that could be easily exploited by an adversary...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the joint upstreaming of live and on-demand user-generated video content over LTE using a Quality-of-Experience driven approach. We {{contribute to the}} state-of-the-art work on multimedia scheduling in three aspects: 1) we jointly optimize the transmission of live and time-shifted video under scarce uplink resources by transmitting a basic quality in real-time and uploading a refined quality for on-demand consumption. 2) We propose a producer-consumer deadline-aware scheduling algorithm that incorporates both the physical state of the mobile producer (e. g., cache fullness) and the scheduled playout time at the end-user. 3) We show that the scheduling decisions in 1) and 2) can be determined locally for each mobile producer. We additionally present an analytical framework for de-centralized scalable video transmission and prove that there exists an optimal solution to our problem. Simulation results for LTE uplink further demonstrate the significance of our proposed optimization <b>on</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience. I...|$|R
40|$|User Experience {{has become}} a key success factor for today's {{software}} applications. As {{the only part of}} a software application a user has direct contact with, the user interface contributes to a large degree to the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience. This applies especially to ambient intelligence (AmI) systems that are more user centered than traditional systems. Although a system's software architecture is considered {{as one of the most}} significant technical factors in ensuring project success, its influence on user experience is usually neglected in today's software development. Thereby, the connection between the user interface part of a system and the system's core functionality is of particular importance. A system's distribution architecture and in particular the used client type has a significant influence <b>on</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience. The central contribution of this thesis is the introduction of an application's client type as an explicit adaptation factor in software development in general and in user interface generation in particular to improve user experience. As AmI systems are characterized by openness, heterogeneity and run-time dynamics, their user interfaces have to be generated to provide always an adequate user experience for the frequently changing usage situation. Thus, the appropriate client type needs to be determined automatically during user interface generation. To support developers in the client type selection, we provide a comprehensive characterization of nowadays commonly used client types: fat clients, thin clients, smart clients, rich internet clients and ultra-thin clients. Furthermore, we propose a method that allows the selection of an adequate client type for the current usage situation. Based on a detailed quality model that allows the assessment of the influence of several client type characteristics <b>on</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience and a usage situation model that describes context factors affecting the client type selection, the method determines the recommended client type automatically using a weighting function. With a concrete implementation of our client type selection method, supporting a fully automatic user interface generation approach that we applied within the ambient assisted living (AAL) domain, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Finally, we describe further tool-support for user interface developers using a semi-automatic UI generation approach as well as for developers using a traditional software development process. Ultimately, the client type selection should be considered explicitly for every application during development...|$|R

Electronic learning {{is one of the most}} important breakthroughs in education in which the website is the first access point that users receive educational services provided. Therefore, website quality should be considered as an important factor resulted in the success of virtual learning and studied in a more detailed manner from the e-learners’ perspective. This paper aims to classify the quality aspects of the Tehran virtual university website (webqual 4. 0) according to the Kano model of customer satisfaction and determine the asymmetric impact of the webqual 4. 0 dimensions’ performance <b>on</b> <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> satisfaction in order to prioritize those dimensions in resource allocation, as well as sensitize the managers of the mentioned website. This is a descriptive-survey and applied study, and also a cross-sectional one. The study population included Tehran University students studying in virtual courses and the data collection tool was the questionnaire of webqual 4. 0, as well as, a researcher-made questionnaire to measure end-user satisfaction. Multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of performance asymmetry. The result showed that usability dimension was the high-performance excitement factor, information quality dimension was a high-performing basic factor, and service interaction dimension had low performance scores and was a basic factor. And finally, a short-term plan to improve service interaction dimension to reduce user discontent and a long-term plan to better both information quality and usability dimensions to increase user satisfaction was proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactivity}} in multimedia services {{concerns the}} input/output {{process of the}} user with the system, {{as well as its}} cooperativity. It is an important element that affects the overall Quality of Experience (QoE), which may even mask the impact of the quality level of the (audio and visual) signal itself <b>on</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> perception. This work is a preliminary study aimed at evaluating the weight of the interactivity, which relies on subjective assessments that have been conducted varying the artefacts, genre and interactivity features on video streaming services evaluated by the subjects. Subjective evaluations have been collected from 25 subjects in compliance with ITU-T Recommendation P. 910 through single-stimulus Absolute Category Rating (ACR). It resulted that the impact of the interactivity is influenced by the presence of other components, such as presence of buffer starvations and type of content displayed. An objective quality metric able to measure the influence of the interactivity on the QoE has also been defined, which has proved to be highly correlated with subjective results. We concluded that the interactivity feature can be successfully represented by either an additive or a multiplicative component to be added in existing quality metrics...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{exploration}} that surveys {{the strengths and}} weaknesses of various 3 D spatial interaction techniques, in the context of directly manipulating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Particularly, a study of touch- and device- free interfaces in this domain is provided. 3 D spatial interaction can be achieved using hand-held motion control devices such as the Nintendo Wiimote, but computer vision systems offer a different and perhaps more natural method. In general, 3 D user interfaces (3 DUI) enable a user to interact with a system on a more robust and potentially more meaningful scale. We discuss the design and development of various 3 D interaction techniques using commercially available computer vision systems, and provide an exploration of the effects that these techniques have <b>on</b> an <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience in the UAV domain. Specific qualities of the user experience are targeted, including the perceived intuition, ease of use, comfort, and others.

The results provide evidence that supports the use of 3 DUI in this domain, as well as the use of certain styles of techniques over others. iii Dedicated to my family, for their neverending support the entire way. iv ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many thanks to my thesis advisory committee – Dr. Joseph LaViola, Dr. Gita Sukthankar, and Dr...|$|R

40|$|This article reports three {{case studies}} on the {{usability}} and acceptance of an industrial robotic prototype {{in the context of}} human-robot cooperation. The three case studies were conducted in the framework of a two-year project named AssistMe, which aims at developing different means of interaction for programming and using collaborative robots in a user-centered manner. Together with two industrial partners and a technological partner, two different application scenarios were implemented and studied with an off-the-shelf robotic system. The operators worked with the robotic prototype in laboratory conditions (two days), in a factory context (one day) and in an automotive assembly line (three weeks). In the article, the project and procedures are described in detail, including the quantitative and qualitative methodology. Our results show that close human-robot cooperation in the industrial context needs adaptive pacing mechanisms in order to avoid a change of working routines for the operators and that an off-the-shelf robotic system is still limited in terms of usability and acceptance. The touch panel, which is needed for controlling the robot, had a negative impact <b>on</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience.

The results indicate some differences between the two algorithms, with consistently better performance from random forests in comparison to support vector machines over all of the performance metrics, as well as significantly better results for two out of three metrics. Although a slight difference has been indicated by the results one should also note that both algorithms show great similarities in terms of their prediction performance, making it hard to draw any general conclusions on which algorithm yield the most accurate movie predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|In mobile videos, small viewing {{size and}} bitrate {{limitation}} often cause unpleasant viewing experiences, which {{is particularly important}} for fast-moving sports videos. For optimizing the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience of viewing sports videos on mobile phones, this paper explores the benefits of emphasizing Region of Interest (ROI) by 1) zooming in and 2) enhancing the quality. The main goal is to measure {{the effectiveness of these}} two approaches and determine which one is more effective. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience, the study considers user’s interest in video content and user’s acceptance of the perceived video quality, and compares the user experience in sports videos with other content types such as talk shows. The results from a user study with 40 subjects demonstrate that zooming and ROI-enhancement are both effective in improving the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience with talk show and mid-shot soccer videos. However, for the full-shot scenes in soccer videos, only zooming is effective while ROI-enhancement has a negative effect. Moreover, user’s interest in video content directly affects not only the user experience and the acceptance of video quality, but also the effect of content type on the user experience. Finally, the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience is closely related to the degree of the acceptance of video quality and the degree of the interest in video content. This study is valuable in exploiting effective approaches to improve user experience, especially in mobile sports video streaming contexts, whereby the available bandwidth is usually low or limited.
