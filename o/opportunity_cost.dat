5|$|The {{marginal}} rate {{of transformation}} {{can be expressed}} in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of butter in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of guns in terms of butter is 4.|$|E
5|$|With {{economies of}} scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of one good falling {{as more of}} it is produced. Specialization in {{producing}} successive units of a good determines its <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> (say from mass production methods or specialization of labor).|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> is {{directly}} related to the shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E
40|$|Normatively, {{consumers}} should incorporate <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> into every decision they make, yet behavioral {{research suggests that}} consumers consider them rarely, if at all. This research addresses when consumers consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> who considers <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> which <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> spontaneously spring to mind, and what the consequences of considering <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are. Perceived constraints cue consumers to consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> and consumers high in propensity to plan consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> even when not cued by immediate constraints. The specific alternatives retrieved {{and the likelihood of}} retrieval are functions of category structures in memory. For a given resource, some uses are more typical of the category of possible uses and so {{are more likely to be}} considered as <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> Consumers who consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are less likely to buy focal options than those who do not when <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are appealing, but no less likely when <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are unappealing. ...|$|R
40|$|Designing {{conservation}} areas entails costs that, if considered explicitly, can {{be minimized}} while still achieving conservation targets. Here {{we focus on}} <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> which measure forgone benefits from alternative land uses. Conservation planning studies often use partial estimates of costs, but {{the extent to which}} these result in actual efficiencies has not been demonstrated. Our study partitions land costs into three distinct <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> to smallholder agriculture, soybean agriculture and ranching. We demonstrate that <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> to single stakeholder groups can be inaccurate measures of true <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> and can inadvertently shift conservation costs to affect groups of stakeholders disproportionately. Additionally, we examine how spatial correlations between costs as well as target size affect the performance of <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> to single stakeholder groups as surrogate measures of true <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> We conclude that planning with <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> to single stakeholder groups can result in cost burdens to other groups that could undermine the long-term success of conservation. Thus, an understanding of the spatial distributions of <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> that are disaggregated to groups of stakeholders is necessary to make informed decisions about priority conservation areas...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown the merits of {{targeting}} the costs of conservation besides environmental benefits and aligning payments for ecosystem services with incurred costs. However, cost-effective and precise estimation of site specific <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> is a major challenge. In this paper we test two approaches to estimate <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of conservation: One approach derives <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> from annual land rents, and the other models regresses <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> on easily obtainable and difficult to manipulate spatial and socio-economic independent variables such as soil quality. None of these approaches appeared to estimate <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> sufficiently well. But since this judgment is based on how well the estimates compare to the reference <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> which were computed from farm budgets, we also considered potential flaws in the reference data and tested their plausibility. The tests confirmed the plausibility of data. Based on the results {{presented in this paper}} none of the two cost estimation approaches can be recommended for practical application in conservation programs. Yet, further research is necessary to confirm these findings giving special attention to the techniques that are applied to deliver reference point data on <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). <b>Opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E
5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile.

5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel account of why intertemporal {{decisions}} tend to display impatience: People {{pay more attention}} to the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of choosing larger, later rewards than to the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of choosing smaller, sooner ones. Eight studies show that when the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of choosing smaller, sooner rewards are subtly highlighted, people become more patient, whereas highlighting the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of choosing larger, later rewards has no effect. This pattern is robust to variations in the choice task, to the participant population, and is observed for both incentivized and hypothetical choices. We argue that people are naturally aware of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> associated with delayed rewards, but pay less attention to those associated with taking smaller, sooner ones.

5|$|Changing clocks and DST rules has {{a direct}} {{economic}} cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500million to $1billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> at around $1.7 billion USD. Although {{it has been argued}} that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

40|$|Traditional cost {{calculations}} do {{not accurately}} estimate the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of using conveyances in intermodal operations, thus, results in many short-term pricing problems. The {{objective of this}} research is to develop a framework for estimating the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of using conveyances in trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) operations to assist carriers in improving their pricing strategies under highly competitive market conditions. The framework is based on a network model that simulates current operations in order to find the reduced <b>costs</b> and the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of serving the loads. The network model is formulated as a linear network flow problem with side constraints. To find the reduced costs, a technique using Lagrangian Relaxation, a minimum cost algorithm, and a shortest path algorithm were developed in the research. We illustrate this model with a case study of a major north American railroad. The results show that <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> do affect the accuracy of calculated system contributions for services. Moreover, the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> and system incremental costs (SICs) are unstable over time. To handle the instability we make use of a new risk-pricing approach. ...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{shift of}} {{emphasis}} to on-farm conservation {{is driven by}} its diverse attractive features - participatory nature, dynamic nature, capacity to maintain not only crop diversity but the knowledge that evolves with it, the chance it offers and the challenge it brings to link conservation with farmers' livelihood. To make it operational, placing incentives and removal of perverse incentives are of critical importance. However, before placing sound incentives compatible to farmers' circumstances, the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> farmers face when using local varieties of public interest should be understood. This paper empirically examines farmers' <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of maintaining local varieties of sorghum using a household survey data collected from 198 sorghum growers in Eastern Ethiopia. <b>Opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are generated using different homogeneous treatment statistical models and factors affecting them are further examined using switching regression model. The average <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> suggest not only the size of policy incentive required for farmers to maintain local varieties of sorghum on-farm but also are useful to estimate the national costs of conserving crop genetic resources. The regression analysis shows that <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> increase with access to output markets and extension, output price, access to input supply, experience in growing improved varieties, and relative importance of the crop. On the contrary, plot quality, input price and oxen ownership are reducing <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> The paper then concludes outlining the policy implications of the empirical findings to incentive design for on-farm conservation of crop genetic resources. <b>Opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> incentive design, on-farm conservation, crop genetic resources, Ethiopia, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of health care systems internationally use formal {{economic}} evaluation methods to support health care funding decisions.
