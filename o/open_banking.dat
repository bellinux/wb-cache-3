500|$|Back in 1919, the Palace {{minute book}} {{contained}} an entry instructing the Secretary {{to investigate the}} possibility of obtaining a lease on the 'ground at Selhurst'. Calling it a 'ground' was a little misleading since {{at the time it}} was a piece of wasteland valuable only to the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company. At one time it had been a brickfield, and two chimney stacks still remained. On 3 January 1922 the club purchased the ground at a cost of £2,750, and renowned football ground architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design Selhurst Park. Leitch had designed stands at Craven Cottage, Stamford Bridge, White Hart Lane and Leeds Road, but the design for Palace was unusual in that it had no roof gable. The other three sides of the ground remained <b>open</b> <b>banking</b> with just the lower parts being terraced. Construction work was delayed by industrial disputes, and when the ground was opened by the Lord Mayor of London on the first day of the 1924–25 season, 30 August, the stand was not finished. It did however boast many luxuries, including [...] "offices, tea rooms, training quarters, plunge, slipper shower and needle baths". The opening fixture was against The Wednesday, and in front of a crowd of 25,000, Palace lost 0–1, with the first goal at Selhurst Park being scored by Billy Marsden. That defeat set the tone for the season, and the club finished in twenty-first place – relegated along with Coventry City. A win in the last game at home to Oldham Athletic would have secured survival, but Palace went down 0–1 and it would be almost 40 years before Palace would again grace the second level of English football. One small consolation was the decision by the FA to stage the England versus Wales international at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1925. It remains the only full international staged at the ground, and Wales won the game 3–1.|$|E

Canada (Attorney General) in 1929). Women lost the rights to the property they brought into the marriage, even following divorce; a husband had complete legal control over any income earned by his wife; women were not allowed to <b>open</b> <b>banking</b> accounts; and married women were not able to conclude a contract without her husband's legal approval. These property restrictions made it difficult or impossible for a woman to leave a failed marriage, or to exert any control over her finances if her husband was incapable or unwilling to do so on her behalf.|$|E

5000|$|Brazil and the Southern Cone (Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina) {{neglected}} {{their respective}} drug trafficking issues {{and due to}} the concentration on the Andean region, these were neglected by the United States as well. These nations ignored the problem primarily due to its slow introduction and penetration into their society, the insistence from the U.S. that {{the sources of the}} drugs was the only problem and because the governments at the time were more concerned with foreign debt, inflation, economic growth, civil-military relations and political survival. The United States continued to increase their anti-drug operations in the Andean region resulting in displacement. [...] This means that the U.S. tactics forced the drug traffickers to search for safer areas with less government pressure to eliminate the flow of narcotics. The drug traffickers took advantage of the neglected Southern Cone and began shifting their routes, locations for cocaine laboratories and money laundering centres. These shifts have also created growing drug consumption issues among the Southern Cone countries. While the role of the Southern Cone had been that of a transhipment point for cocaine produced in the Andean region, further evidence appeared to indicate that in fact since 1984 the region had been used extensively by Colombian and Bolivian drug traffickers. [...] Cocaine labs were found in Northern and Western Brazil and in Argentina. It was also found that Uruguay and Chile had become major financial centres for money laundering after the invasion of Panama. [...] Uruguay was particularly attractive as it {{has one of the most}} <b>open</b> <b>banking</b> systems in the Western hemisphere and the government has always put great emphasis on having tight bank secrecy laws.|$|E

We find a significant Core Periphery structure and discuss model selection. The overall analysis opens up new opportunities for systemic risk assessments of the interbank market, especially as more granular data is becoming available for the eurozone...|$|E

40|$|The revised payment {{services}} directive (PSD 2) is a disruptive {{piece of legislation}} set to remove incumbent banks monopoly on customer account information and {{payment services}}. Along with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, PSD 2 compels banks to make much of their valuable data shareable with designated third parties, allowing new players to enter the market. The main objective of this papers is {{to shed light on}} how the directive affects Nordea Bank from a strategic perspective. The specific research questions the study addresses are what the implications of PSD 2 are for Nordea, and what strategy Nordea should pursue to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. In our largely qualitative research, we gathered primary source information from legislative drafts, an interview with a Nordea-spokesperson, and from official statements by Nordea. Secondary sources like industry white-papers and strategic management literature were also extensively used. To tackle the research questions the study considers the implications of PSD 2 for Nordea, conducts an external and internal analysis of the company regarding PSD 2, and explores strategic options Nordea can pursue to respond to the new directive. The analysis results in three strategic options; Defensive, Opportunistic and Transformative. The key differentiating point between these is the degree of commitment to <b>Open</b> <b>Banking,</b> Defensive being full rejection and Transformative being full commitment, Opportunistic falling somewhere in the middle. These strategic options are in turn evaluated based on certain criteria. We dismiss the Defensive approach, as we believe a full rejection of <b>Open</b> <b>Banking</b> would cause Nordea to quickly fall behind its present and incoming competitors. Taking into consideration long-term sustainability, a changing competitive landscape, and the companies capabilities and resourc...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{tries to}} grasp the {{phenomenon}} of procyclical behavior of oligopolistic banking sector using game theory models. The simulation {{is based on a}} Bayesian game that models the environment of a conflict situation with imperfect information. The result implies that the dominant bank strategy, regardless of the actions of other players, is very aggressive strategy with low risk aversion and therefore the choice of riskier and potentially more profitable portfolio in times of economic prosperity. In addition to the known causes of procyclicality comes into play also the oligopolist rivalry. Conclusion the paper provides is a starting point in the form of <b>open</b> <b>banking</b> cartels (co-operating oligopoly) to coordinate strategy. The goal may be appropriate choice of credit expansion of the banking system (credit restrictions vice versa) with an acceptable profit and risk for banks and manageable terms for borrowers suitable for the economic cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{merger of}} the Pediatric Oncology Group, Children's Cancer Group, the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group, and the National Wilms Tumor Study Group in 2000 offered {{the newly formed}} Children's Oncology Group (COG), an {{opportunity}} to study rare cancers {{that had not been}} the subject of organized evaluation {{within the context of a}} cooperative group. In 2002, the COG formed the rare tumor committee which is comprised of four subcommittees. This article details the experience of the infrequent tumor subcommittee for the period of 2002 to 2007. During the initial implementation of this strategy, we have observed low rates of registration within the COG registry and low levels of participation in <b>open</b> <b>banking,</b> biology, and first-line therapeutic studies. This initial experience has allowed us to develop alternative strategies to increase registration rates and clinical trial enrollments. It is hoped that these new plans will allow us to increase our ability to better understand the biology and improve the treatment outcome of young patients with infrequent cancers. Furthermore, our initial experience has demonstrated to us the potential power of expanded cooperation and collaboration at a global level...|$|E

40|$|In general, banks play a growth-enhancing {{role for}} the real economy. However, {{distorted}} incentives for banks, depositors, and regulators in connection with bank insolvency may corrupt banks' credit allocation and monitoring decisions, leading to suboptimal real economic outcomes. A rules-based prompt resolution regime for insolvent banks may reestablish the incentive system and provide for economically superior credit allocation and monitoring. We test the hypothesis that regulatory insolvency has a cathartic effect using a large firm-level dataset and proposing a new indicator to measure the strength of catharsis. Employing an instrumental variable setup and an interaction approach, we try to overcome concerns about causality and potential endogeneity which are usually inherent to research into the real economic implications of bank regulation. We find a comparably stronger implementation of a hypothetical positive capital closure rule {{to have a positive}} and statistically as well as economically significant effect on individual firm growth - particularly for firms that are structurally more dependent on bank financing. Our findings are robust to various specifications. Investigating the transmission channels of the 'catharsis effect', we find that it essentially works through benefiting better quality firms and reallocating credit towards firms that need it most. Additional analyses suggest that the 'catharsis effect' works best in <b>open</b> <b>banking</b> systems that provide high access to international finance and, hence, mitigate potentially negative credit supply effects of insolvent bank liquidation. Taken together, our findings advocate stronger attention being given to incentive-compatible bank resolution regimes...|$|E
