5|$|According to Serge Klarsfeld, {{since the}} now {{complete}} and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, {{the majority of}} the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> to the normal French civil rule of prescription acquisitive of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
40|$|It is a {{commonly}} held view that returns to innovation are highly skewed, that is, not all firms innovate, and <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> received from innovation for the firms that are successful innovators are highly concentrated in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few. Using data from two community innovation surveys for the Netherlands, this article investigates <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> to innovation for {{different types of}} innovation. It finds that <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> to innovation are indeed highly skewed, but <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> is shaped by <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> novelty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innovation - the more novel the innovation, the greater <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>returns.</b> <b>The</b> article also explores <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> across different sectoral contexts, finding that low-technology sectors are characterised by higher performance diversity among innovators than high-technology sectors.

5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel the idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> {{of the dead}} to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project {{the idea that the}} recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{learned from}} {{questioning}} the prisoners that a French and Indian war party {{had just arrived}} at Carillon, and that the two forts were garrisoned by a thousand regulars. Concerned that the escaped sleds would raise the alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> by the same route (a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines), but he overruled them, citing the need for speed and the deep snow. By early afternoon they had returned to their camp, rested, and {{were on their way}} south.|$|E

Through the introduction of the two ex-members of Vaakevandring, the style became more melodic and atmospheric.|$|E

5|$|During one leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> trip, the {{men were}} stopped by the Hukbalahap, Filipino Communist guerrillas who hated both the Americans and the Japanese. They were also rivals to Pajota's men. One of Pajota's lieutenants conferred with the Hukbalahap and {{returned}} to tell Mucci {{that they were not}} allowed to pass through the village. Angered by the message, Mucci sent the lieutenant back to insist that pursuing Japanese forces would be coming. The lieutenant came back and told Mucci that only Americans could pass, and Pajota's men had to stay. Both the Rangers and guerrillas were finally allowed through after an agitated Mucci told the lieutenant that he would call in an artillery barrage and level the whole village. In fact, Mucci's radio was not working at that point.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
5|$|In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} {{adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, which corresponds to The Fellowship of the Ring {{and part of}} The Two Towers, Saruman is voiced by Fraser Kerr. He has only one major scene—his attempt to persuade Gandalf to join him. He appears again briefly before the battle of Helm's Deep, speaking to his army. The character is dressed in red and is called 'Saruman' and 'Aruman' at different points. Smith and Matthews suggest {{that the use of}} 'Aruman' was intended to avoid confusion with 'Sauron'. The 1980 Rankin/Bass TV animated version <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> of the King begins roughly where Bakshi's film ends but does not include Saruman's character.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> title <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soldier embodies {{a common}} trope in Great War literature: {{soldiers}} return from war {{and interact with}} everyday life, confronting trauma sustained through <b>the</b> brutality <b>of</b> war. <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soldier is the first deliberate evocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>returned</b> soldier in literature. West's treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>returning</b> soldier in <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soldier is deliberately distanced from the war. The trauma Chris suffers in <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soldier becomes an isolated piece <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war's effect on a society {{that appears to be}} otherwise functioning normally. This distance is very similar to the distance from war and its trauma in Virginia Woolf's Jacob's Room.|$|R

5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> flows do not issue {{directly}} {{back into}} the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 2014, Valbuena {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Dynamo Moscow in a reported £6 million transfer. In his second game for Dynamo and first as a starter on 13 August 2014 against FC Ufa, he assisted on both of his team's goals in a 2-0 victory. In his next game against FC Arsenal Tula on 17 August 2014, he again assisted on both goals in Dynamo's 2-1 victory. On 28 August 2014, Dynamo defeated AC Omonia in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League play-off round, through a decisive goal by Christopher Samba in the 93rd minute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> leg following a free kick performed by Valbuena, and qualified {{for the first time}} for the group stage of a European competition (since the group stage was introduced). On 31 August 2014, he scored his first goal for Dynamo in a 2-0 victory over FC Krasnodar. On 16 September 2014, he had to undergo an emergency appendectomy. He returned to playing on 2 October 2014 in a Europa League group game against PSV Eindhoven, in which Yuri Zhirkov scored a winning goal deep into injury time after a corner delivered by Valbuena.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 1789, Allen {{traveled}} to South Hero, Vermont {{with one of}} his workers to visit his cousin, Ebenezer Allen, and to collect a load of hay. After an evening spent with friends and acquaintances, he spent the night there, and set out the next morning for home. While accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> journey are not entirely consistent, Allen apparently suffered an apoplectic fit en route, and was unconscious by the time they returned home. Allen died at home several hours later, without ever regaining consciousness. He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery in Burlington. The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government, and by large numbers of common folk who turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion.|$|E

5|$|Porto {{won three}} {{consecutive}} Primeira Liga titles with Ferreira, ensuring {{their presence in}} the three subsequent Champions League seasons. In 2007–08, Porto fell again in the round of 16, losing to Schalke 04 in a penalty shootout. In the following season's round of 16, they eliminated Atlético Madrid on away goals and progressed to a quarter-final tie with Manchester United. A two-all draw in Manchester gave Porto the upper hand in the round, but a Cristiano Ronaldo goal in the opening minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> leg ended their European run. The 2009–10 UEFA Champions League season was Ferreira's last in charge of Porto, and like in previous years, he successfully guided the team past the group stage. In the round of 16, a 2–1 home win over Arsenal was obliterated by a 5–0 defeat in London, which included a hat-trick from Nicklas Bendtner. Domestically, Porto failed to win a fifth consecutive league title and their third-place finish excluded them from competing in the 2010–11 Champions League. However, victory in the Portuguese Cup final confirmed the club's entry in the play-off round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.|$|E
5|$|Raël said he {{was given}} the mission of informing the world of humanity's origins in {{anticipation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> of these extraterrestrials by building a residential embassy in neutral territory. He stated that certain mysteries were explained to him based on new interpretations of sacred texts such as the Bible. He said that, on 7 October 1975, he was contacted by one of the Elohim, who took him to another planet to meet Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. He stated that his second book, Les extra-terrestres m'ont emmené sur leur planète ("Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet"), relates the teaching he received from these people. In this book, Raël describes harmonious and peaceable beings, who were free of money, sickness, and war.|$|E
5|$|Security, {{services}} and logistics {{at the reception}} centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, {{and a number of}} secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|E
