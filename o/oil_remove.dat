40|$|In 2002, {{the source}} of a mystery oil spill that killed large numbers of seabirds, {{especially}} Common Murres Uria aalge, in the Gulf of the Farallones, central California, was tracked to the vessel S. S. Jacob Luckenbach which sank after a collision in 1954. Matches of many oil samples have established that oil leaking from this vessel is responsible for the 2001 - 2002 and many earlier mystery oiling events in the 1990 s, especially the 1997 - 1998 Point Reyes Tarball Incidents. This vessel has been a major source of chronic oil pollution in central California, although illegal offshore dumping of tank washing and bilge dumping also is implicated as a significant source of chronic oiling by non-matches of several oil samples. Recent efforts to investigate {{the source of}} <b>oil,</b> <b>remove</b> oil from the sunken vessel, and examine impacts to seabirds are summarized. A natural resource damage claim is being filed and seabird restoration efforts are envisioned...|$|E
40|$|Formal {{training}} has the disadvantage that trainees may simply accept {{what they are}} taught without questioning it, unlike the autodidact who can only learn by asking questions all the time. Sometimes, he will not get an answer and that need not be because the question is stupid, but may be because his peers are used to there being no satisfactory answer and have simply accepted the conventional mythology without further question. So it is about time to ask some assorted questions and where possible, suggest how to find an answer: 1) Why does {{the composition of the}} solvent used to extract oil from oilseeds affect the amount of oil being extracted and its phosphatide content? 2) Why does a heat treatment (Alcon, Exergy, expander) increase the phosphatide content of the crude oil and decrease its non-hydratable phosphatide (NHP) content? 3) Why does water degumming of crude <b>oil</b> <b>remove</b> relatively more magnesium than calcium? 4) What is the mechanism of phosphatide removal by silica hydrogel and why is it enhanced by simultaneous soap removal? 5) What is the mechanism of NHP-removal during alkali neutralisation? 6) Could it be that the Long Mix neutralisation process as used in the US leads to insufficient removal of the pro-oxidants copper and iron and that this explains why oil tends to less stable in the US than in Europe, especially when it contains linolenic acid? 7) Could different deodorisation conditions explain this geographically determined anomaly? 8) What happens during flavour reversion? 9) Why is walnut oil more stable in the nut than in the bottle? 10) How much oil is lost by saponification or hydrolysis during refining? 11) What is the mechanism of colour fixation? 12) Does the activity of interesterification catalysts depend on their counter cation? 13) What is the chemical nature of the colour formed on interesterification catalyst activation? 14) What is crystal memory? Does it exist? However, we should not forget the Dutch proverb that: “One fool can ask more questions than ten wise men can answer. ” On the other hand, exposing myths is half the fun and asking the right question often provides half the answer...|$|E

50|$|Peanut flour can {{be mixed}} with {{sugar and salt}} to create a {{powdered}} version of peanut butter. Since peanut flour has had most of its <b>oil</b> <b>removed,</b> peanut butter reconstituted from this powder can be up to 88% less fattening than traditional peanut butter.|$|R

50|$|Removal of {{oil from}} the large Kettleman Hills fields, mainly the North Dome, has been {{suggested}} {{as a cause of}} the 1985 M6.1 earthquake, since the total deformation caused by the quake was exactly that necessary to compensate for the <b>oil</b> <b>removed</b> historically, i.e. by filling the vacated space. The same mechanism has been suggested for the 1983 Coalinga earthquake and the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, both of which occurred near the centers of mature oil fields.|$|R
5000|$|To make Kuli-kuli, peanuts are roasted {{and then}} ground into a paste called [...] "Labu". The paste is then mixed with spices, salt, and {{sometimes}} ground pepper. The paste is stripped of excess oil with water, and made into the desired shape (round balls, cylinders, etc.). The <b>oil</b> <b>removed</b> {{in this process}} is then heated and used to fry the shaped peanut paste until it solidifies. It is then <b>removed</b> from the <b>oil</b> and allowed to cool down until ready to be eaten.|$|R
30|$|In this study, oil {{conversion}} during hydrolysis and acidification {{was also}} investigated. The PREAS oil content in R 0, R 1 and R 2 was 53.7, 54.9 and 55.1  mg/g-TS, respectively. After the hydrolysis and acidification {{were allowed to}} proceed, the oil content in the fermented sludge decreased to 12.1, 18.3 and 17.7  mg/g-TS, respectively. The <b>oil</b> <b>removed</b> from R 1 and R 2 was 66.7 % and 67.9 %, respectively, less than that removed from R 0 (77.4 %). The reduced efficiency suggests that the incomplete degradation of heneicosane and 1 -phenylnaphthalene during hydrolysis and acidification inhibited downstream activity.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} of high voltage transformers is electrical insulating system is electrical insulating oil. The transformer oil is also a carrier of information {{of the state of}} the transformer because the degradation influences (temperature, solid contaminants, etc.) are during operation causing aging of the oil. The aging of oil leads to deterioration of the quality of oil that the oil must be replaced with new or regenerated oil. This article deals with the refining of rapeseed oil through the adsorbent.

50|$|The SACS {{system uses}} high volumes of engine oil aimed at {{strategic}} {{points of the}} engine, like {{the top of the}} combustion chamber, which are not typically well served by air cooling alone. In order to provide enough oil for both cooling and lubrication, the system uses a double-chamber oil pump, using the high-pressure side for lubrication of the parts (crankshaft, connecting rods, valvetrain), while the low-pressure, high-volume side provides oil to the cooling and filtering circuit. The <b>oil</b> <b>removes</b> heat from hot engine parts through direct contact, is pumped away and subsequently routed through the oil filter, followed by routing through an oil cooler before being returned to the main sump.|$|R
