5|$|I think everybody's enjoyed {{doing their}} <b>own</b> <b>thing.</b> Sharon and Caroline are young mothers, they have young children. Our {{mother and father}} were really were great parents and they hope to be as good a mother as mine, but Sharon's making her own record and will {{hopefully}} release it at some point. But we (the band) never finished, we'll keep it open.|$|E
5|$|It wasn't like Janet , {{where we}} all grew up together. Mariah had done her <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> and had been very {{involved}} with the arranging and production of her records, so we respected that and said, 'What can we do for you?' She would fly into town {{for five or six}} hours. She'd get on a plane and fly to whatever was the next thing she was doing.|$|E
25|$|So I think {{individual}} {{women will}} react differently; some will not cook that day, some will engage {{in dialog with}} their husband, some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will be taking place all over the country. Others will be writing things {{that will help them}} to define where they want to go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect women. I don't think {{you can come up with}} any one point, women will be doing their <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> in their own way.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, the director/producer John Goldschmidt made a {{documentary}} film, Doing Her <b>Own</b> <b>Thing,</b> about Mirren during her {{time with the}} Royal Shakespeare Company. The film was made for ATV and shown on the ITV Network in the UK. In 1972 and 1973, Mirren worked with Peter Brook's International Centre for Theatre Research, and joined the group's tour in North Africa and the US, during which they created The Conference of the Birds. She then rejoined the RSC, playing Lady Macbeth at Stratford in 1974 and at the Aldwych Theatre in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} {{that live in}} colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, {{has always been a}} source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence.|$|E
500|$|During a track-by-track {{analysis}} bassist Guy Berryman {{admitted that}} the song takes [...] "a bit of inspiration" [...] from Jimmy Cliff's 1969 song [...] "Many Rivers to Cross". Berryman also added, [...] "It becomes its <b>own</b> <b>thing,</b> kind of like points of inspiration that kind of lead you down certain paths. Whenever {{you want to write}} a song like someone else, it ultimately ends up sounding like something different anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|On 2 July 2014, it was {{announced}} {{there would be a}} special episode broadcast between the third and fourth series. Filming began on 5 January 2015 and wrapped on 10 February 2015. Moffat confirmed the episode is set in Victorian London, saying, [...] "The special is its <b>own</b> <b>thing.</b> We wouldn't have done the story we're doing, and the way we're doing it, if we didn't have this special. It's not part of the run of three episodes. So we had this to do it … It's kind of in its own little bubble." ...|$|E
500|$|In November, Marvel {{announced}} that Khan will join a new {{incarnation of the}} Secret Warriors in a series by writer Matthew Rosenberg and artist Javier Garron that debuted in May 2017. The team, formed {{in the wake of}} the [...] "Inhumans vs X-Men" [...] storyline, also includes Quake, Karnak, Moon Girl, and Devil Dinosaur. Rosenberg stated that there is some conflict and friction amongst the team members explaining, [...] "Ms. Marvel and Quake are really fighting for the soul of the team in a lot of ways, while Moon Girl will continue to really do her <b>own</b> <b>thing.</b> They will all be tested and challenged, they are superheroes after all, but they are going to do things their way." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam Levine has stated: [...] "verything that's {{written and}} {{performed}} {{and put together}} pretty much comes from us. I just think people would be surprised to know that we’re a self-contained unit. We’re a band that does their <b>own</b> <b>thing.</b> There’s no puppet master." [...] However, in {{an article about the}} songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed {{that at least some of}} the band's songs, such as [...] "Moves like Jagger," [...] are the product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article, Levine says, [...] "It's almost as if [...] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about the collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best." ...|$|E

500|$|The Portland Mercury Andrea Damewood wrote: [...] Dime Store is its <b>own</b> <b>thing,</b> a {{great place}} to grab lemony eggs benedict and a Water Avenue coffee on a Sunday without a massive line. Sure, there's vintage milk bottles as water pitchers, [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{blasting}} from the speakers, and a big-old 1950s vibe going on—but you're not going to feel like some asshat in a retro-themed chain here ... There's no life-changing or avant-garde cooking happening at Dime Store. You won't see coffee mayo and duck bologna like Vitaly Paley's crew puts out at Penny Diner. You won't find the greasy hash browns available at the actual old-school diners. But that's kind of the point. Dime Store is a sweet slice of nostalgia with just the right nod to current dining realities.|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{said the}} band members relied [...] "on each other instead of forcing each other to play something". Guitarist Eddie Reyes insisted on playing his own part, {{as opposed to a}} chord progression, on several occasions. Cooper said [...] "So instead of trying to force him to play one thing, he’ll go and do his <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> that’s way more cool and unique that any of us could imagine." [...] Lazzara {{mentioned}} there was [...] "an urgency and an energy and an excitement" [...] embedded into the material, which [...] "you can't create or fake". Nolan stated that Straylight Run helped Cooper and himself as musicians: [...] "We learned, we grew and were much more mature coming back to TBS." [...] Cooper mentioned that {{towards the end of the}} writing process the group's [...] "creative juices ... were just so depleted".|$|E
500|$|Dixon {{has often}} cited Madonna as an influence, saying [...] "Madonna {{is a big}} idol. I loved her when I {{was a young girl}} and I feel like I've been on a musical journey with her". Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol. Growing up, the first record Dixon ever bought was [...] "Push It" [...] by the hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa; she remarked [...] "I didn't understand {{what they were talking about}} at the time... They were raw and did their <b>own</b> <b>thing,</b> and I loved that. I love artists who don't conform to what people expect of them".|$|E

500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{identified}} the songs [...] "Only in 3's", [...] "Fortunately Gone", and [...] "Doe" [...] {{as being more}} benign and friendly-sounding than the Pixies' work; Matt LeMay of Pitchfork described [...] "Doe", [...] "Iris", and [...] "Oh!" [...] as possessing a beautiful, surprisingly gripping quality. [...] "Oh!" [...] has a slow tempo, restrained drumming, a sad violin performance by Carrie Bradley, and raw singing by Deal, while [...] "Opened", [...] "Limehouse", and [...] "Hellbound" [...] each contain a buoyant rhythm. About [...] "Hellbound", musician Sasha Alcott wrote in The Boston Herald that the song [...] "rides the edge between sweet and delicate frivolity and a fierce head-banging head-banging sing-a-long ... The guitar, drums and bass are all doing their <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> to build up and then slam into the refrain." [...] "Metal Man", co-written by Wiggs and featuring her on Spanish guitar, contains a melody suggesting the Pixies' [...] "Cactus".|$|E
500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; {{no one wants to be}} their <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeffrey Mace, saying, [...] "Coulson has been doing what he wants, doing his <b>own</b> <b>thing,</b> taking the quinjet out for a spin wherever he needs to go. He’s shooting from the hip {{with a lot of}} these moves he’s making, and I’m sure that’s going to rub the director the wrong way. [...] in who is reportedly a serial killer, so how the director is going to respond to that, we can only wait and see." [...] Bell talked about this, acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his cake and eat it too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience time to get to know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E

500|$|In June 2013, Clark Gregg {{explained}} how the series would tie into the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: [...] "...the exciting part {{is going to}} be seeing the way that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in , and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show." [...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." [...] He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, explaining [...] "It's new characters. It needs to be its <b>own</b> <b>thing.</b> It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, to me, is that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [...] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{similarities}} {{were discussed}} {{in an article}} by Mat Paget (GameSpot), such {{as the fact that}} both Far Harbor and Autumn Leaves feature the ability to use the character's voice to determine whether they are a robot. Veer noted that he was not upset with the similarities, saying that he takes inspiration from other games too: [...] "I seriously think this is perfectly okay. After all, Autumn Leaves' inspirations are countless ... and being influenced is a natural part of the writing process." [...] Veer said that having the names of modders in the game's credits for acknowledgement would be beneficial. He also said that he was comfortable even if Bethesda did deliberately use content from Autumn Leaves, and wrote that [...] "I honestly thought Bethesda’s staff played Autumn Leaves, had a blast with it, took some things out of it and made their <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> for Far Harbor. ... And I seriously think this is perfectly okay." ...|$|E
500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think {{he might have been}} a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
