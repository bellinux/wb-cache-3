40|$|ABSTRACT: The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the influence of physiological seed quality on the spatial distribution of plants in the field, {{as well as the}} effect on variability among soybean plants. Six lots of soybean cultivar CD 202, with three vigor levels (high, medium and low) and two lots on each level were used. Lots of high physiological quality showed germination of 96 % and lots considered of medium vigor showed 82 % of germination and vigor between 60 % and 67 %, whereas lots of low vigor showed 70 % germination and vigor between 55 % and 58 %. The test was conducted in plots formed by seven 5 m long rows with spacing of 0. 45 m. The sowing was performed by <b>opening</b> <b>furrows</b> by hand with the equidistant distribution of seeds using marked rulers, corrected by the germination of each seed lot. Lots of seeds of higher vigor provide greater uniformity in the distribution of plants in the field. The reduction in seed physiological quality provides increased variability among plants within populations, throughout the entire developmental period of soybean, also affecting the seed yield per plant...|$|E

Portanto, objetivou-se, neste trabalho, avaliar os esforços de cinco diferentes mecanismos de abertura de sulco de semeadoras de plantio direto, variando a carga vertical. O experimento foi instalado num solo classificado como Nitossolo Vermelho Distroférrico. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de blocos ao acaso, em esquema fatorial 5 x 4, constituídos dos seguintes fatores: cinco mecanismos de abertura de sulco (disco liso - DL, disco corrugado -DC, disco ondulado - DO, disco duplo - DD e haste sulcadora - F) e quatro cargas verticais (750, 1500, 2250 e 3000 N). Para mensurar as forças nos tratamentos estudados foi utilizado um dinamômetro com sensibilidade nas direções horizontal, lateral, vertical. A avaliação mostrou que a interação entre mecanismos de abertura de sulco e carga vertical não foi significativa, entretanto os fatores foram significativos quando analisados individualmente. A haste promoveu a maior mobilização do solo com menor requerimento de esforço horizontal, atingindo as maiores profundidades de trabalho. O trabalho mostrou que a carga vertical influenciou a profundidade de trabalho dos mecanismos de abertura de sulco. Os mecanismos de abertura de sulco do tipo disco necessitam de maior força vertical para penetrar no solo. The {{individual evaluation}} of mechanisms for <b>opening</b> <b>furrows</b> {{to drop the}} seeds in a no-tillage seeders cultivation assists the companies in the sizing of opening tools of the ground, that search for minor energy petition and for diminishing the ground area mobilized. Therefore this work had the aim of evaluate the efforts of five different mechanisms of opening of ridge of seeding of direct plantation varyng the vertical load. The experiment was installed in one ground classified as Dystroferric Red Nitosol. The used experimental delineation was of the one randomized blocks in a factorial project 5 x 4, constituted a the following factors: five mechanisms of furrow opening (even disk - DL, corrugated disk - DC, ondulated disk - DO, double disk DD and furrow rod - F) and four vertical loads (750, 1500, 2250 and 3000 N). To measure the forces in the studied treatments a dynamometer with sensitivity in the directions was used horizontal, lateral and vertical direction. The evaluation showed that the interaction between mechanisms of opening of ridge and vertical load was not significant, however the factors were significant when analyzed individually. The connecting rod promoted mobilization of the ground with smaller draft of horizontal effort reaching depths of work. The work showed that the vertical load influenced the depth of work of the mechanisms of ridge opening. The mechanisms of ridge opening of record type need vertical force to penetrate into the ground...|$|E
40|$|Some crops {{have shown}} not {{to adapt to}} the no-tillage system (NTS) as a {{consequence}} of the compaction of the superficial soil layer. In a certain way, the mechanism used in seeders to open furrows for the deposition of fertilizers can have great importance in facilitating root penetration. This study was carried out to evaluate the influence of two fertilizer distribution mechanisms and N fertilization in upland rice (Oryza sativa) under NTS. The experiment was carried out in the growing seasons 2001 / 2002 and 2002 / 2003, in Botucatu, state of São Paulo, Brazil. A completely randomized block design was applied, with subdivided plots and four replications. Main plots consisted of two <b>furrow</b> <b>opening</b> mechanisms (<b>furrow</b> opener and double disk). Subplots consisted of four side dressing N levels (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha- 1). The following parameters were evaluated: furrow and seed deposition depth, plant population, plant height, number of stems and panicles m- 2, number of spikelets per panicle, spikelet fertility, weight of 1, 000 grains, shoot dry matter, grain yield and N levels in the flag leaf. The success for upland rice establishment under the NTS in dry winter regions of Brazil is directly associated to the <b>furrow</b> <b>opening</b> mechanism of the seed-drill. The furrow opener mechanism resulted in deeper seed deposition, consequently decreasing seedling population, number of panicles per area and grain yield. Side dressing N fertilization in upland rice under NTS increases grain yield whenever the double disk mechanism is used to sow...|$|R

The results revealed that <b>opening</b> of <b>furrow</b> in alternate row recorded significantly highest seed cotton yield (2758, 2214 and 1452 kg/ha) as compared to cotton+straw mulching (2421, 2003 and 1233 kg/ha) and intercropping of cotton with soybean (2036, 1626 and 1106 kg/ha) treatments during the three year of experimentation respectively.

40|$|There is no {{consensus}} regarding seasonal changes in soil physical properties within and between rows in long-term no-till (NT) crop production systems. We hypothesized that soil physical properties in a Rhodic Ferralsol under long-term NT differed within and between rows and that these changes are influenced by wetting and drying cycles (WDC). Undisturbed samples were taken within and between crop rows from layers of 0 to 0. 10 and 0. 10 to 0. 20 m depth in September 2010, 2011 and 2012 and March 2012 and 2013. At the first sampling, 40 soil samples were collected within the maize (Zea mays L.) row (R), at interrow (IR) sampling positions, and at an intermediate position (IP) between R and IR. Coordinates for each sampling point were identified so that subsequent samples could be collected from the same location. Soil bulk density (Db), soil water retention curve (WRC), S index, air-entry pressure and pore size distribution were determined. The results confirmed that <b>furrow</b> <b>opening</b> causes significant positive changes in soil physical properties within the crop row and plant growth can {{be affected by the}} “confinement” of roots within the R position within long-term NT sites. With each successive sampling, Db decreased and was significantly influenced by recent WDC. The pore size distribution showed larger pores with each successive sampling, providing a higher S index, air-entry pressure, and improved soil physical quality over time. The steady state of soil structural conditions achieved at long term NT can be affected by short term influences related to the crops and weather conditions. However, soil physical properties indicated that a new equilibrium was achieved and that soil under long-term NT may remain physically functional. Our results confirm that soil physical properties under NT are highly dynamic and strongly influenced by (i) soil disturbance caused by <b>furrow</b> <b>opening,</b> (ii) wetting and drying cycles, and (iii) sampling depth. Therefore, we recommend that for quantifying soil physical quality within no-till fields, measurements should be taken within and between crop rows...|$|R
40|$|Brazilian {{family farming}} has at its {{disposal}} planters whose furrowing mechanisms, whether disc or shank, require a large vertical force. In smaller planters, this is reflected in low efficiency when <b>opening</b> the <b>furrow</b> or in a high demand for mass (weight). Rotary furrowers require less vertical force for the same operation. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and performance of rotary furrowers mounted on the powertrain of a walking tractor working under direct seeding, and compare them with shank-type furrowers using bibliographic data. The parameters used in the comparison were the depth and width of the furrow, the area of disturbed soil and the cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil after the operation. The experiment was carried out on wheat stubble that had lain fallow for six months. Twelve treatments were employed in a factorial design: three models of rotary furrowers, two values for revolutions per unit of linear displacement, and two forward speeds. The variable, cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil, was statistically affected only by the factor, furrower. However there was significant interaction between the factors, furrower, revolutions per metre and speed, for the variables of depth, furrow width and area of disturbed soil. The values obtained for the variables of width, depth and disturbed area in the cross-section of the furrows, with {{the three types of}} rotary furrowers driven by the powertrain of a walking tractor, were similar to those generated by shank-type furrowers...|$|R
