5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E
500|$|In one of Adorján's books, GM Lajos Portisch {{opined that}} [...] "at least {{two-thirds of all}} 'tested' {{openings}} give White an apparent advantage." [...] According to Portisch, for Black, [...] "The root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> very few people know which are the openings where Black is really OK. Those who find these lines have nothing to fear, as Black is indeed OK, but only in those variations!" [...] Rowson considers this an important point, noting that [...] "1.d4players struggle to get anywhere against main-line Slavs and 1.e4players find the Najdorf and [...] particularly tough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} Cessna 206H is {{certified}} as a six-seat aircraft in its country of origin, the Canadian aviation regulator, Transport Canada has certified it to carry only five people in Canada. [...] This {{is due to}} concerns about passenger egress through the rear clamshell door with the flaps extended. [...] Cessna addressed one part of this problem early on, after a flight-test aircraft was damaged when the pilot extended the flaps while taxiing, and his passenger had the clamshell door open (for ventilation; {{it was a hot}} summer day). [...] A switch was added to the flap actuation circuit which disabled the flaps when the doors were open. [...] The other part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the flaps are already down, the passenger must perform the complicated procedure of opening the front part as far as possible (about [...] ) then open the rear door and restow the rear door handle. This then gives enough clearance to open the rear part of the door.|$|E

2500|$|Upon release, Sheila Prophet of Record Mirror {{felt the}} album was [...] "worth giving a spin" [...] and said: [...] "This is their {{comeback}} album - the one that'll make 'em or break 'em. It features [...] "Gypsy Roadhog" [...] {{and most of the}} other tracks are in the same vein - solid, rocking numbers, but just not quite distinctive enough {{to make it in the}} same way as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] did. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they seem to be trying too hard - laying everything on, instead of sticking with simplicity. The result is that it sounds, heavy, cluttered, even, a bit old-fashioned. Noddy's voice still sounds great, and Dave turns in some pretty nifty guitar, but there's just too much of everything. In the old days, lyrics weren't too important to Slade, but now they're writing songs with meaning." [...] Pete Makowski of New Musical Express wrote: [...] "The band were always on form when they worked within the most basic of formats. Rock and Roll! This album is high energy on a primeval scale. It's got all the ball bustin' riffs you'll find nestling comfortably alongside yer ZZ Tops and Nugents. It's got the same suicidal pace of the Aerosmith Rocks album. It's packed with strong tunes, lotsa potential singles and the lyrical content is more interesting." [...] Tony Ciarochi of Fairbanks Daily News-Miner said: [...] "...their latest album definitely packs the kind of punch that would get that kind of reaction from a crowd of concert goers. Although it is fairly basic rock 'n' roll, the British humor and sarcasm with which it is presented make it a refreshing chance from some of the more bland sledgehammer rock grounds dominant in America." ...|$|E
