5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387L is a {{red dwarf}} in the Sagittarius {{constellation}} that is host to the planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb. The star {{is estimated to be}} nearly 20,000 light years away and approximately one fifth the mass of the Sun, although large confidence intervals exist, reflecting the uncertainties in both the mass and distance. The star drew the attention of astronomers when it became the lens of gravitational microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-387L, in which it eclipsed a background star and created distorted caustics, an envelope of reflected or refracted light rays. Analysis of the caustic events and <b>of</b> <b>follow-up</b> observational data led to the planet's discovery, which was reported in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, a {{match with}} {{abbreviated}} rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing at the Black Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images {{or even more}} were shot {{at the rate of}} 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date. In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series <b>of</b> <b>follow-up</b> fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J. Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2010, {{long after}} the microlensing event had subsided, the science teams {{studying}} the star used the NACO adaptive optics facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent magnitude of the star that microlensed its background star, hoping {{to compare it to}} the magnitude of the star measured during the microlensing event. A discrepancy was found, a discrepancy that may have been a result of either error or of a planetary body. Interpretation <b>of</b> <b>follow-up</b> observations led to the planet's confirmation. The ratio between the planet's mass and its host star's mass is well-constrained, but a large interval of uncertainty exists because the host star's mass is known within a large confidence interval that spans the mass of all red dwarf stars.|$|E

S 431308024 The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the effect of the leadership of the head of the institution and the competence of the employees which is the object of audit process, partially or simultaneously, against the level of the settlement <b>of</b> the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> audit report. Population of this study is the institution totaled 113 with the settlement <b>of</b> the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> audit report in year 2014, and the samples consist of 38 institution. To collect data, questionnaires using likert scale from 1 to 5 are used. The result of this study describes that leadership and employee competency has a significant effect against the level of the settlement <b>of</b> the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> audit report. Moreover, leadership and employee competency can influence about 63, 8 % of the level of the settlement <b>of</b> the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> audit report.

5|$|Spurred on by this success, the Red Army {{planned a}} series <b>of</b> <b>follow-up</b> offensives in January and February 1943 {{intended}} to decisively beat the German forces in southern Russia. After {{the destruction of}} the remaining Hungarian and Italian forces during the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, Operation Star and Operation Gallop were launched to recapture Kharkov and Kursk and to cut off all German forces east of Donetsk. Those operations succeeded in breaking through the German lines and threatened the whole southern part of the German front. To deal with this threat, Army Group Don, Army Group B, and parts of Army Group A were united as Army Group South (Heeresgruppe Süd) under Manstein's command in early February.|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens <b>of</b> <b>follow-up</b> studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the rate <b>of</b> routine <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> children attending our Healthy Child Clinic and the factors that can inşuence the follow-ups. Material and Methods: The files of 540 babies registered in our Healthy Child Clinic between January 2003 and May 2005 have been investigated retrospectively. Results: 46 % of children were regularly brought to <b>follow-up.</b> The rate <b>of</b> regular <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> children who were born with caesarean section and who had a history of preterm birth were significantly higher. There were no significant relationships between regular follow-up and parent’s education levels, mother’s work status, presence of social security, neighborhood, birth weight, gender, number of siblings, parent’s age. Conclusion: It has been determined that the rate <b>of</b> regular <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> children born with caesarean section or prematurity is significantly higher. We believe that with an effective communication between doctor and the family, and explanation of the importance of routine examinations of healthy children to all parents, the <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> healthy children can be carried on more successfully...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Despite {{pharmacotherapy}} follow-up {{has demonstrated}} being a valid technology {{to detect and}} resolve negative clinical outcomes, its implementation in community pharmacies was not so quick as expected. Objective: 1) to determine knowledge <b>of</b> pharmacotherapy <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> Granada pharmacists. 2) To determine the order of importance of implementation barriers for pharmacists in Granada Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Through a self-administered questionnaire, opinions about the barriers to implementation of the practice <b>of</b> pharmacotherapy <b>follow-up</b> were collected from community pharmacists in Granada city. Results: From the 238 questionnaires delivered, 99 were returned, 41. 6 % reply rate. The majority of surveyed pharmacists (87. 9 %) are unfamiliar with the concept <b>of</b> pharmacotherapy <b>follow-up,</b> confusing it with dispensing. Lack of time appears to be considered the most important barrier by Granada pharmacists, followed by lack <b>of</b> training in <b>follow-up</b> and ignorance <b>of</b> the importance of drug-related problems. Conclusions: 1).

25|$|ARPA {{released}} its Hardpoint study in 1965. It presented {{a way for}} the Army to offer an effective ABM system at a reasonable cost. At the same time, it would ensure that the Air Force's missiles would survive any sort of small-scale attack envisioned by the military planners. This led to a series of Army-Air Force studies under the name Hardsite. Hardsite initially considered the idea of using the existing Nike-X hardware being proposed around large cities to deliberately offer additional protection to Air Force and other military bases in the area. A second series of studies considered cut-down deployments to protect remote bases, like the missile fields. This later concept quickly captured the majority <b>of</b> <b>follow-up</b> work.|$|E

During President Vladimir Putin's visit to India in December 2004, two space-related bilateral agreements were signed viz. Inter-Governmental umbrella Agreement on co-operation in the outer space for peaceful purposes and the Inter Space Agency Agreement on co-operation in the Russian satellite navigation system GLONASS.

25|$|From human {{clinical}} trials, it {{has become}} increasingly evident that a more effective focus of treatment is slowing, stopping and even partially reversing the atheroma growth process. There are several prospective epidemiologic studies including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), which have supported a direct correlation of Carotid Intima-media thickness (CIMT) with myocardial infarction and stroke risk in patients without cardiovascular disease history. The ARIC Study was conducted in 15,792 individuals between 5 and 65 years of age in four different regions of the US between 1987 and 1989. The baseline CIMT was measured and measurements were repeated at 4- to 7-year intervals by carotid B mode ultrasonography in this study. An increase in CIMT was correlated with an increased risk for CAD. The CHS was initiated in 1988, and the relationship of CIMT with risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was investigated in 4,476 subjects ≤65 years of age. At the end of approximately six years <b>of</b> <b>follow-up,</b> CIMT measurements were correlated with cardiovascular events.|$|E
