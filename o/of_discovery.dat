40|$|The {{main idea}} of catch up {{hypothesis}} is how rapidly follower economies tend {{to catch the}} leader since imitation and implantation <b>of</b> <b>discoveries</b> are cheaper than innovation. Therefore limitation and implementation <b>of</b> <b>discoveries</b> tends to generate convergence even though diminishing returns to capital or to R&D do not apply. If the diffusion of technology occurs gradually, then we get another reason to predict a pattern of convergence across economics, which we estimate in this study.
