Chiang Kai-shek was also elected as the 1st President of the Republic of China under the constitution by the National Assembly in 1948, with Li Zongren being elected as Vice-President. The Nationalist Government was abolished on 20 May 1948, after the Government of the Republic of China was established with the presidential inauguration of Chiang. The Communists, though invited to the convention that drafted it, boycotted and declared after the ratification that not only would it not recognize the ROC constitution, but all bills passed by the Nationalist administration would be disregarded as well.

500|$|Ways That Are Dark {{continues}} to be noted for its Sinophobic viewpoint. In 1985 the historian Frank P. Mintz called it [...] "a classic {{in the literature of}} Sinophobia." [...] In 2000 the scholar Yong Chen referred to Townsend's attitude towards the ethnic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people</b> as being derivative of [...] "the anti-Chinese prejudice that nineteenth-century writers had propagated." [...] In 2004 the writer Gregory Clark described it as [...] "a viciously anti-China book" [...] that [...] "contrasts an allegedly dirty, devious Chinese nation with the trustworthy, hardworking Japanese".|$|E
500|$|A harsh {{critique}} of Chinese society and culture, Ways That Are Dark was written {{at a time}} when China was in the grip of considerable civil strife. Townsend claimed that the source of China's problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethnic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people.</b> Although the book was a bestseller in the United States, it met with highly polarized reactions from its supporters and detractors. Though praised by some periodicals, it was denounced by missionaries and sinologists, including Owen Lattimore who condemned it as [...] "a general indictment of a whole race". It was banned by the government of China.|$|E

500|$|The {{flag of the}} People's Republic of China, {{also known}} as the Five-star Red Flag, is a red field charged in the canton (upper corner nearest the flagpole) with five golden stars. The design {{features}} one large star, with four smaller stars in a semicircle set off towards the fly (the side farthest from the flag pole). The red represents the communist revolution; the five stars and their relationship represent the unity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people</b> under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). [...] The first flag was hoisted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on a pole overlooking Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 1 October 1949, at a ceremony announcing the founding of the People's Republic.|$|E
500|$|Townsend had {{asserted}} {{in chapter}} {{one that the}} cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people</b> and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only {{people in the world who}} are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of critical thinking skills, insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people</b> [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Townsend's {{experiences}} in China {{formed the basis}} of his first book Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China, the release of which on 10 November 1933 put Townsend in the spotlight both nationally and internationally. Billed as doing [...] "for China what Katherine Mayo did for Mother India", Townsend's book included a controversial critique of Chinese society and culture. At a time when China was in the grip civil strife, Townsend believed that the source of its problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethics of its people, including above all their propensity for dishonesty, lack of fixed loyalties outside of their family group, and inability to cooperate effectively with one another, as well as their greed, physical cowardice, and lack of critical thinking skills. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people</b> [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves" [...] and predicts no end to chaotic conditions within the country. He also favorably contrasts what he considers Japan's sensible policies toward China with the naively [...] "sentimentalist" [...] ones adopted by the United States.|$|E

500|$|Zeng Liansong, {{a citizen}} from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, {{was working in}} Shanghai {{at the time the}} {{announcement}} came out; he wanted to create a flag design to express his patriotic enthusiasm for the new country. In the middle of July, he sat down in his attic for multiple nights to come up with designs. His inspiration for the current design comes from the stars shining in the night sky. He thought of a Chinese proverb [...] "longing for the stars, longing for the moon", ( [...] , pàn xīngxīng pàn yuèliàng) which shows yearning. He viewed the CPC as the great saviour ( [...] , dà jiùxīng [...] "great saving star") <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people,</b> being represented by a larger star. The idea for four small stars came from On the People's Democratic Dictatorship a speech by Mao Zedong, which defined the Chinese people as consisting of four social classes, also referred to in Asian cultures as the four occupations (...) shi, nong, gong, shang ("the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie"). [...] Yellow also implies that China belongs to the Chinese people, a [...] "yellow race". After working out the details of the placement of the stars and their sizes (he had tried to put all of the stars in the center, but believed it would be too heavy and dull), he sent his [...] "Five Stars on a Field of Red" [...] ( [...] , hóng dì wǔxīng qí) design to the committee in the middle of August.|$|E
500|$|Peng {{participated in}} group {{meetings}} in the early portion of the conference, gaining consensus among his peers for criticizing the widespread practice of inaccurately reporting agricultural statistics, and emphasizing that [...] "everybody had a share of responsibility, including Comrade Mao Zedong". Peng bluntly criticized the hesitation of senior Party members to disagree with the Party leadership, implying that many Party leaders were cowardly for following orders that they knew {{were not in the}} best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people.</b> After gaining the consensus of several of his peers, Peng developed his opinions more systematically, but was hesitant to bring up the full range of his criticisms in public. Peng discussed his thoughts with several other senior Party leaders (notably the CCP Secretary of Hunan, Zhou Xiaozhou(周小舟)), and Peng's colleagues encouraged Peng to visit Mao privately in order to win Mao's support for a reversal of the policies of the Great Leap Forward. Peng visited Mao's quarters on the night of July 13, but found Mao asleep, and wrote Mao a [...] "letter of opinion" [...] articulating Peng's ideas instead. Peng delivered the letter to Mao on the morning of July 14, but Mao did not read the letter until July 17. Later on July 17 Mao had Peng's letter widely circulated among the other delegates at the conference. Peng did not intend his letter to be widely read and attempted to prevent its circulation, but was not successful. Most other senior leaders, including Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, supported Peng's position before Mao began to attack it, indicating that they shared Peng's views and that they did not see Peng's letter as an attack on the Chairman.|$|E
500|$|The Sino-Japanese {{conflict}} (193145) {{gave the}} Great Wall {{a new lease}} {{of life in the}} eyes of the Chinese. During the 1933 defence of the Great Wall, inadequately-equipped Chinese soldiers held off double their number of Japanese troops for several months. Using the cover of the Great Wall, the Chinese – who were at times only armed with broadswords – were able to beat off a Japanese advance that had the support of aerial bombardment. With the Chinese forces eventually overrun, the subsequent Tanggu Truce stipulated that the Great Wall was to become a demilitarized zone separating China and the newly created Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Even so, the determined defence of the Great Wall made it a symbol of Chinese patriotism and the resoluteness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people.</b> The Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong picked up this symbol in his poetry during his [...] "Long March" [...] escaping from Kuomintang prosecution. Near the end of the trek in 1935, Mao wrote the poem [...] "Mount Liupan" [...] that contains the well-known line that would be carved in stone along the Great Wall in the present day: [...] "Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men" [...] (...) [...] Another noteworthy reference to the Great Wall is in the song [...] "The March of the Volunteers", whose words came from a stanza in Tian Han's 1934 poem entitled [...] "The Great Wall". The song, originally from the anti-Japanese movie Children of Troubled Times, enjoyed continued popularity in China and was selected as the provisional national anthem of the People's Republic of China (PRC) at its establishment in 1949.|$|E
