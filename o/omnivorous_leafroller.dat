40|$|Methomyl is a {{systemic}} carbamate pesticide used on grapes to control several insects including leafhoppers, the <b>omnivorous</b> <b>leafroller,</b> the grape berry moth, and thrips. As {{part of the}} carbamate cumulative risk assessment, BEAD identified potential alternatives for the control of these pests. There appear to be alternatives {{for each of the}} target pests, although few provide control for the entire pest complex. BEAD has not quantified the impacts on growers of switching to alternatives. Production costs would likely rise, possibly substantially, but yield and quality are unlikely to be affected. In the Northeast, one of the most likely alternatives is carbaryl, another carbamate with broad-spectrum control and similar cost...|$|E
40|$|Ethyl (E,Z) - 2, 4 -decadienoate (pear ester) is a kairomonal {{attractant}} {{for both}} male and female codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), in apple, pear and walnut. Studies were conducted in the western Untied States to evaluate the potential attractiveness of this kairomone for eight lepidopteran pests of these three crops, as well as, in cherry, peach/ nectarine, apricot, plum, almond, pistachio, grape, kiwi, and citrus. The pear ester was loaded (10. 0 mg) into gray halobutyl septa and insects were monitored with diamond- or delta-shaped sticky traps. Lures were not attractive to peach twig borer, Anarsia lineatella (Zeller); oriental fruit moth, Cydia molesta (Busck); <b>omnivorous</b> <b>leafroller,</b> Platynota stultana Walshingham; navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker); apple fruitworm, Lacanobia subjuncta (Grote & Robinson); pandemis leafroller, Pan-demis pyrusana (Kearfott); obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris); and western tentiform leafminer, Phyllonorycter mespiella (Hüebner). Additional stud-ies with C. molesta populations attacking apple and pear would be useful...|$|E
