50|$|The squadron's {{primary mission}} is to employ the {{versatility}} of the MH-60R helicopter to support the battle group commander's objectives, with emphasis on Surface Warfare (SUW) and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). Secondary missions include Search and Rescue (SAR), Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP), Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), and Communications Relay (COMREL). The Saberhawks of HSM-77 fly the newest aircraft in the U.S. Navy fleet, the MH-60R Seahawk helicopter, which elevates tactical maritime mission capability to a new level, far surpassing previous fleet capability. With its state-of-the-art avionics, mission systems, and cockpit, the MH-60R is the world’s most capable Naval helicopter. The aircraft features a glass cockpit and significant mission system improvements over the SH-60B, which give the MH-60R unmatched capability as an airborne multi-mission Naval platform. The MH-60R is tasked with performing Anti-Submarine Warfare, Surface Warfare, Over-the-Horizon Targeting (<b>OTH-T)</b> on board aircraft carriers and Navy surface combatant ships.|$|E
5000|$|On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and {{was poised}} to strike Saudi Arabia. Within 48 hours of the initial invasion, U.S. Navy P-3C {{aircraft}} {{were among the first}} American forces to arrive in the area. One was a modified platform with a prototype system known as [...] "Outlaw Hunter". Undergoing trials in the Pacific after being developed by the Navy's Space & Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), [...] "Outlaw Hunter" [...] was testing a specialized over-the-horizon targeting (<b>OTH-T)</b> system package when it responded. Within hours of the start of the coalition air campaign, [...] "Outlaw Hunter" [...] detected a large number of Iraqi patrol boats and naval vessels attempting to move from Basra and Umm Qasr to Iranian waters. [...] "Outlaw Hunter" [...] vectored in strike elements which attacked the flotilla near Bubiyan Island destroying 11 vessels and damaging scores more. During Desert Shield, a P-3 using infrared imaging detected a ship with Iraqi markings beneath freshly-painted bogus Egyptian markings trying to avoid detection. Several days before the 7 January 1991 commencement of Operation Desert Storm, a P-3C equipped with an APS-137 Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) conducted coastal surveillance along Iraq and Kuwait to provide pre-strike reconnaissance on enemy military installations. A total of 55 of the 108 Iraqi vessels destroyed during the conflict were targeted by P-3C aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Obtaining sets of {{timeliness}} characteristic {{curves and}} critical values for various missions would provide critical knowledge to support decision-makers {{in predicting the}} potential success of an intended or planned action. Empirically deduced knowledge will indicate a mission success rate for given information and scenario conditions. In previous studies we reported on model-based-measures (MBMs) designed to assess the capabilities of afloat-command information systems to support over-the-horizon targeting (<b>OTH-T).</b> Results showed {{that the impact of}} system and information quality on mission success rate is not linear but exhibits similar characteristic curves independently of the data selected. Hypothesizing invariance to data for similar <b>OTH-T</b> parameters indicates the usefulness of such empirical curves in supporting a deci ion-maker. We expect that applying this approach to large sets of data collected during live exercises or man-in-the-loop simulations would allow better understanding of invariant and variant aspects of <b>OTH-T</b> success rates. Then critical values would be established as thresholds in deciding or not to engage a target at a given time and warship location. Other results focus on the dependence of MBM metrics on model parameters such as weapon and contact uncertainty areas. These results should be useful in assessing the validity of MBM metrics for various engagements. 1...|$|E
40|$|To resolve an {{outstanding}} issue {{in assessing the}} value to mission effectiveness of the insertion of information technology in command and control, the Defence Research Establishment Valcartier (DREV) has explored means and methods for linking information quality and system measures of performance (MOPs) to decision and mission measures of effectiveness (MOEs). The resulting model-based measures (MBMs) assess the capabilities of afloat-command information systems to support over-the-horizon targeting (<b>OTH-T).</b> Results obtained showed {{that the impact of}} system and information quality on mission success rate is non-linear but displays similar characteristic curves independent of the data set selected. Hypothesizing invariance to data for similar <b>OTH-T</b> parameters indicates the usefulness of such empirical curves in supporting a decision-maker. Applying this approach to large ensembles of data collected during live or man-in-the-loop simulation should allow a better understanding of invariant and variant aspects of <b>OTH-T</b> success rates and the choice of critical values for thresholds used {{to decide whether or not}} to engage a target at a given time and shooter location.

40|$|Data {{collected}} during {{a series of}} experiments planned by an AUS-CAN-NZ-UK-US working group that was mandated to develop “Guidelines for Maritime Information Management ” provide important insights into the development of future systems and the improvement of current ones. In previous studies we reported on model-based-measures (MBMs) d igned to link systems performance changes to mission effectiveness, focusing on the capabilities of afloat-command in-formation systems to support over-the-horizon targeting (<b>OTH-T).</b> Using knowledge of the ar-chitectures, the planned information flow changes, the tactical information required for <b>OTH-T,</b> the data collection plans used during the experiments and the ground truth for a posteriori as-sessments, we investigate here the potential gain in <b>OTH-T</b> effectiveness that results from im-provements in sensor-to-shooter information flow and timeliness. This gain may be independent of the particular implementation of system changes but should depend strongly {{on the ability of}} a specific change to deliver timely, precise and appropriate information to the shooter. Changes could depend on independent dedicated asset and systems, as will be investigated in one of the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations (JWID) planned for 1999. Alternatively they could result from the integration of the sensor-to-shooter concept within the current archi ecture using a modified standard operating procedure (SOP) and appropriate middleware. The current archi-tecture combines the Force Over-the-horizon Track Coordinator (FOTC), the Allied Command Information Exchange System (ACIXS) and the Global Command and Control System (GCCS). Both possible implementation strategies could offer information with similar quality to the end user; consequently they may improve mission effectiveness to the same degree. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the authors ’ {{efforts to develop}} a pedigree ontology for levelone sensor fusion. This work was performed {{in the context of}} naval operations but the concepts employed are applicable to any domain involving sensor fusion. The ontology that has been developed is formally represented using OWL, the Web Ontology Language used in defining ontologies for the Semantic Web; one advantage of using OWL is that it has a formal semantics and there is a growing number of formal systems for processing and reasoning about OWL-based documents. The paper will describe the pedigree ontology in detail along with the motivation for various design decisions. An example will be given of the ontology’s use in conjunction with <b>OTH-T</b> GOLD track data; in a simulated scenario pedigree information permits the informed selection of preferred vessel tracks. The paper concludes with a discussion of open issues and future directions. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Synthetic environments {{provide a}} {{controllable}} and composable environment where Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C 3 I) capabilities can be demonstrated, trialed, and assessed in a computational experiment. They {{can be used}} to support the Defence Force through an improved understanding of Command and Control (C 2) processes, C 2 organisational structure, information systems, mission rehearsal, training, and course of action analysis. They can also provide richer planning environments through tools and techniques for course of action formulation, assessment, selection and war gaming. The Distributed Interactive C 3 I Effectiveness (DICE) simulation software enables development of a synthetic environment that is C 3 I-led. DICE has a general-purpose capability for the modelling of C 3 I systems where artificial agents, optional human players, and interfaces to tactical battlefield simulations make up the synthetic environment. This paper describes how synthetic data obtained from the DICE simulation can be provided on EXC 3 ITE – the integrator for DSTO’s C 3 I R&D. This data is stored in a database on a server in EXC 3 ITE and provides run-time or post-simulation intelligence or track services. Example track services include Jindalee Over-the-horizon Radar Network, Ground Based Radar and Visual Observation Post. Also, simulated messages may be injected into EXC 3 ITE during runtime, for example ADFORMS or <b>OTH-T</b> Gold messages. These simulation-derived services have the same format as any corresponding real (live-operational) services and {{can be used in a}} complementary and transparent manner. Applications of these services include support to information fusion R&D and within training and analytical environments where staff, systems, and procedures can be exercised through a combination of real and simulated data. The paper will also discuss plans for the development of EXC 3 ITE-based HLA-compliant simulation capabilities. 1...|$|E
