5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 2, 1987 and ended that following October. Interior footage {{took place at}} Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England, while location shooting took place in Wales and New Zealand. Lucas initially visualized shooting the film similar to Return of the Jedi, with studio scenes at Elstree and locations in Northern California, but the idea eventually faded. However, some exteriors were done around Skywalker Ranch and on location at Burney Falls, near Mount Shasta. The Chinese government refused Lucas the chance for a brief location shoot. He then sent a group <b>of</b> <b>photographers</b> to South China to photograph specific scenery, which was then used for background blue screen footage. Tongariro National Park in New Zealand was chosen to house Bavmorda's castle.|$|E

25|$|Abbott {{was part}} of the {{straight}} photography movement, which stressed the importance of photographs being unmanipulated in both subject matter and developing processes. She also disliked the work of pictorialists who had gained much popularity during a substantial span of her own career and, therefore, left her work without support from this particular school <b>of</b> <b>photographers.</b>|$|E

25|$|In his Daybooks he {{provided}} an unusually detailed {{record of his}} evolution as an artist. Although he initially denied that his images reflect his own interpretations of the subject matter, by 1932 his writings revealed {{that he had come}} to accept the importance of artistic impression in his work. When combined with his photographs, his writings provide an extraordinarily vivid series of insights into his development as an artist and his impact of future generations <b>of</b> <b>photographers.</b>|$|E

500|$|Clair took {{a similar}} {{approach}} to creating the title sequence for True Detective second season. Production used material from a number <b>of</b> <b>photographers,</b> including aerial shots captured by David Maisel. However, unlike season one, season two's title sequence incorporates deep, vivid gold and red color, thereby presenting [...] "that more complicated view of California". Leonard Cohen's [...] "Nevermind" [...] is the season two opening theme, which is a song off Cohen's 2014 album Popular Problems. The theme song's lyrics change with every episode, incorporating different verses from Cohen's song.|$|E

Coming after the first generation <b>of</b> <b>photographers,</b> the firm made significant contributions to the development of commercial photography in Japan by emphasising the excellence of materials, refining the practice of presenting photographs in albums (which became art objects in themselves), and making effective use of Farsari's own tourist-oriented publications to promote his photographic studio's work [...] an early, minor example of vertical integration.|$|E
