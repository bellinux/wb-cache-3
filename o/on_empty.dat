5|$|Market Forces is {{a science}} fiction thriller novel by Richard Morgan. Set in 2049, the story follows Chris Faulkner as he starts his new job as a junior {{executive}} at Shorn Associates, working in their Conflict Investment division where the company supports foreign governments {{in exchange for a}} percentage of the country's gross domestic product. Contracts are awarded, and promotions are given to employees, through driving duels in which combatants race vehicles <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> roads and often kill their opponents. With the Shorn-supported Colombian dictator Echevarria expected to transfer power to his son, who is supported by a competing firm, Chris allies Shorn with a rebel group to overthrow the government, though other executives attempt to sabotage his plans.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, Carlton Hill's notoriety as a slum increased. Poverty, drunkenness, disease and low living {{standards}} were rife. Brighton's reputation was damaged by a disparaging article in The Lancet in 1882: making reference to Carlton Hill, it criticised the town's poor standards of health. Assisted by government funding, Brighton Corporation undertook extensive slum clearance from 1928 until {{the start of}} World War II, transforming the area's appearance. Two large blocks of flats—Brighton Corporation's first council flats—were built to rehouse many of the displaced residents. The Milner Flats, a long four-storey block, stand {{on the site of}} Woburn Place, and were completed in 1934. Alderman Hugh Milner Black, a Corporation member who campaigned for housing improvements in Brighton, was commemorated in the naming. Kingswood Flats, on the site of Nelson Place and a Primitive Methodist chapel, were built in 1938. The name refers to Minister for Health Kingsley Wood. Some displaced residents were moved out of the area: the new council estates of Whitehawk and Moulsecoomb, built in the 1920s and early 1930s on the fringe of Brighton, accommodated many former Carlton Hill residents. An earlier low-rise development took place in 1931, when the small Tarnerland council estate was built <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> land near Tilbury Place.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, factory-made radios {{were very}} expensive. Since less-affluent {{families}} {{could not afford}} to own one, newspapers and magazines carried articles on how to build a crystal radio with common household items. To minimize the cost, many of the plans suggested winding the tuning coil <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> pasteboard containers such as oatmeal boxes, which became a common foundation for homemade radios.|$|E
25|$|Martha Campbell Plimpton (born November 16, 1970) is an American stage, film, and {{television}} actress, singer, and former model.

25|$|Taipei Station and {{the area}} {{surrounding}} it have been undergoing renovation since 2005. Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki was chosen to design two skyscrapers that will surround the railroad station. Maki will also oversee the renovation of Taipei Station.

The two skyscrapers will be constructed <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> parcels found adjacent to Taipei Station, above the Taoyuan Airport MRT station.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins with}} an empty board. The players {{determine}} who plays first, then take turns placing their men one per play <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> points. If a player is able to place three of his pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, he has formed a mill and may remove one of his opponent's pieces from the board and the game, with the caveat that a piece in an opponent's mill can only be removed if no other pieces are available. After all men have been placed, phase two begins.|$|E
25|$|This began Plimpton being cast in {{the role}} of a rebellious tomboy, {{beginning}} with her performance as the Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory)'s daughter in the 1986 film The Mosquito Coast, starring Harrison Ford. The critically praised but commercially unsuccessful 1987 film Shy People (co-starred with Barbara Hershey and Jill Clayburgh) was followed by a performance in the 1988 ensemble comedy Stars and Bars. This was released shortly before Running <b>on</b> <b>Empty,</b> an Academy Award-nominated film starring River Phoenix, for which she was nominated for a Young Artist Award.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{intestinal}} hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) delays gastric emptying and inhibits {{food intake}} by actions on vagal afferent neurons. Recent studies suggest plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) - 1 suppresses {{the effect of}} CCK on food intake. In this study we asked whether PAI- 1 also modulated CCK effects <b>on</b> gastric <b>emptying.</b> Five minute gastric emptying of liquid test meals was studied in conscious wild type mice (C 57 BL/ 6) and in transgenic mice over-expressing PAI- 1 in gastric parietal cells (PAI- 1 H/Kβ mice), or null for PAI- 1. The effects of exogenous PAI- 1 and CCK 8 s <b>on</b> gastric <b>emptying</b> were studied after ip administration. Intragastric peptone delayed gastric emptying in C 57 BL/ 6 mice by a mechanism sensitive to the CCK- 1 receptor antagonist lorglumide. Peptone did not delay gastric emptying in PAI- 1 -H/Kβ mice. Exogenous CCK delayed gastric emptying of a control test meal in C 57 BL/ 6 mice and this was attenuated by administration of PAI- 1; exogenous CCK had no effect <b>on</b> <b>emptying</b> in PAI- 1 -H/Kβ mice. Prior administration of gastrin to increase gastric PAI- 1 inhibited CCK-dependent effects <b>on</b> gastric <b>emptying</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 mice but not in PAI- 1 null mice. Thus, both endogenous and exogenous PAI- 1 inhibit the effects of CCK (whether exogenous or endogenous) <b>on</b> gastric <b>emptying.</b> The data are compatible with emerging evidence that gastric PAI- 1 modulates vagal effects of CCK...|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the convoys {{bringing}} {{food and}} water from Beersheba to the 53rd (Welsh) Division lost their way. The camel convoy carrying the water arrived at 04:30, by which time some of the mules from one battalion had been 53 hours without a drink. Although a motor lorry column brought some water forward, the infantrymen and their animals were on short supplies. While the artillery bombardment began at 05:00, the 160th Brigade was forced to begin their attack 15 minutes later <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> stomachs. Some progress was made on the lower slopes of Hill 1706. However, not long afterwards, supplies of artillery ammunition almost ran out, and the attack was terminated. Another attack planned for {{later in the day}} was postponed by Chetwode's direct order until 6 November, when a general attack was planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground on}} the Gheluvelt Plateau had been churned by {{artillery}}-fire {{and turned into a}} sea of mud, flooded shell craters, fallen trees and barbed wire. Troops were quickly tired by rain, mud, massed artillery bombardments and lack of food and water; rapid relief of units spread the exhaustion through all the infantry despite the lines being held by fresh divisions. British artillery fired a preparatory bombardment from Polygon Wood to Langemarck but the German guns concentrated on the Gheluvelt Plateau. The British artillery was hampered by low cloud and rain, which made air observation extremely difficult and shells were wasted <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> gun emplacements. The British 25th Division, 18th Division and the German 54th Division took over by 4 August but the German 52nd Reserve Division was not relieved; both sides was exhausted by 10 August. The 18th Division attacked on the right and some troops quickly reached their objectives but German artillery isolated the infantry around Inverness Copse and Glencorse Wood.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November, the Bologna Division repulsed {{an attack}} from Tobruk towards Sidi Rezegh and next day, Rommel sent the Afrika Korps towards the Egyptian border (the Dash to the Wire) {{to exploit the}} victory and destroy XXX Corps. The blow mostly fell <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> desert and gave the Eighth Army time to regroup and re-arm. The Afrika Korps was ordered back to Tobruk, where the 70th Infantry Division and the New Zealand Division had gained the initiative. At noon on 27 November, the 15th Panzer Division reached Bir el Chleta and met the 22nd Armoured Brigade (reduced to a {{composite}} regiment of fewer than fifty tanks), which was joined later by the 4th Armoured Brigade. As night fell the British tanks disengaged and the New Zealand Division, fighting at the south-east {{end of the corridor}} into Tobruk, was endangered by the Afrika Korps. On 4 December, Rommel attacked Ed Duda and was repulsed by the 14th Infantry Brigade of the 70th Infantry Division. Rommel ordered a retirement from the eastern perimeter of Tobruk, to concentrate against XXX Corps to the south. On 7 December, the 4th Armoured Brigade engaged 15th Panzer Division and knocked out eleven tanks. Rommel was told on 5 December, by Comando Supremo that supply could not improve {{until the end of the}} month, when airborne deliveries from Sicily began. Rommel decided to abandon Tobruk and withdraw to Gazala, which led to the relief of Tobruk and the occupation of Cyrenaica.|$|E

[...] It is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5. Critics have observed the influence of 1980s music on the song, while Talia Kraines of BBC Music compared it to pop rock songs released by singers Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan.

500|$|Much of a temple's {{economic}} support came {{from its own}} resources. These included large tracts of land beyond the temple enclosure, sometimes {{in a completely different}} region than the temple itself. The most important type of property was farmland, producing grain, fruit, or wine, or supporting herds of livestock. The temple either managed these lands directly, rented them out to farmers for a share of the produce, or managed them jointly with the royal administration. Temples also launched expeditions into the desert to collect resources such as salt, honey, or wild game, or to mine precious minerals. Some owned fleets of ships with which to conduct their own trade across the country or even beyond Egypt's borders. Thus, as Richard H. Wilkinson says, the temple estate [...] "often represented no less than a slice of Egypt itself". As a major economic center and the employer of {{a large part of the}} local population, the temple enclosure was a key part of the town in which it stood. Conversely, when a temple was founded <b>on</b> <b>empty</b> land, a new town was built to support it.|$|E
