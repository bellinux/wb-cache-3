Beatles biographer Jonathon Gould writes that [...] "of the many ambitious pop singles released during the fall of 1966, none had a stronger influence on the Beatles than the Beach Boys' 'Good Vibrations'". In a 1968 editorial for Jazz & Pop, writer Gene Sculatti called the single the [...] "ultimate in-studio production trip", adding that its influence was apparent in songs such as [...] "A Day in the Life".|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, then England captain Michael Vaughan reacted testily on-air to {{questions}} by Agnew about his batting form. When Vaughan resigned shortly thereafter, Mike Atherton, writing in The Times, commented {{that it had been}} an out-of-character outburst that was a portent of the resignation. When Atherton had himself been England captain, Agnew had led the calls for Atherton to resign over a controversy known as the [...] "dirt in the pocket" [...] affair. Fellow BBC commentator Jack Bannister felt that Agnew's comments were inappropriate, but <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> he had referred to his friendship with Atherton: Bannister advised Agnew that he should continue to be honest and forthright as a reporter.|$|E
500|$|According to Richard Dawkins, a {{distinction}} between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, [...] "I am agnostic <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> I am agnostic about fairies {{at the bottom of}} the garden." [...] Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; [...] "Temporary Agnostics in Practice" [...] (TAPs), and [...] "Permanent Agnostics in Principle" [...] (PAPs). He states that [...] "agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability.", and considers PAP a [...] "deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting".|$|E
500|$|The {{principle}} of [...] "methodological individualism", {{which holds that}} social scientists should seek to understand collectivities (such as nations, cultures, governments, churches, corporations, etc.) solely as the result and {{the context of the}} actions of individual persons, can be traced to Weber, particularly to the first chapter of Economy and Society, in which he argues that only individuals [...] "can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action". In other words, Weber argued that social phenomena can be understood scientifically <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals, models that Weber called [...] "ideal types", from which actual historical events will necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors. The analytical constructs of an ideal type never exist in reality, but provide objective benchmarks against which real-life constructs can be measured.|$|E

500|$|Crow Dog had a {{tremendous}} impact on tribal sovereignty. [...] The decision recognized two distinct concepts in addition to those related to criminal law. First, Justice Matthews had noted that under Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, (1831) the Brulé tribe had a right to its own law in Indian country. Part of this ruling was based on American constitutional tradition – at that time, Indians were not U.S. citizens and according to Matthews did not have a [...] "voice in the selection of representatives and the framing of the laws." [...] The case held that Indian tribes retain sovereignty, and is still valid law. For example, United States v. Lara, (2004) cited Crow Dog when holding that both a tribe and the federal government could prosecute Lara, as they were separate sovereigns. Subsequent cases have supported the concept [...] "that tribal Indians living in Indian country are citizens of the United States first (under the plenary power doctrine), the tribes second, and the states third, and then <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> Congress chooses." ...|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{pharmacological}} {{treatments for}} ADHD are methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamine. Both methylphenidate and amphetamines block re-uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine into the pre-synaptic neuron, acting to increase post-synaptic levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Of these two monoamines, increased availability of dopamine {{is considered the}} primary cause for the ameliorative effects of ADHD medications, whereas increased levels of norepinephrine may be efficacious <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> it has downstream, indirect effects on dopamine.|$|E
2500|$|According to Socrates, {{physical}} {{objects and}} physical events are [...] "shadows" [...] of their ideal or perfect forms, and exist <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> they instantiate the perfect versions of themselves. Just as shadows are temporary, inconsequential epiphenomena produced by physical objects, physical objects are themselves fleeting phenomena caused by more substantial causes, {{the ideals of}} which they are mere instances. For example, Socrates thinks that perfect justice exists (although it is not clear where) and his own trial would be a cheap copy of it.|$|E
