Proposition 2 provides a geometrical test for whether the net force acting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> mass (a particle) is a central force. Newton showed that a force is central {{if and only if}} the particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from the center.|$|E

5|$|The busway follows {{roughly the}} Torrens River valley, but with {{smoother}} curves. This {{means that it}} crosses the river quite often, with either a park or a few houses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> surrounded by the river and busway. This occurs a total of eight times before the busway reaches Klemzig Interchange {{on the north side}} of the river. The busway crosses the river again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part of the suburbs of Campbelltown and Paradise to its north between the busway and the river before reaching Paradise Interchange.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop running through St. Ignace. The loop starts at exit344 on I-75 as the continuation of US Highway2 (US2) into downtown. The highway carries the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT). It runs along a four-lane roadway {{on the north side}} of Straits State Park and curves northward into downtown St. Ignace along State Street. BL I-75 and three lanes and runs along the lakefront past the marina and docks for Mackinac Island ferry services. It widens back to four lanes to follow the curve of East Moran Bay and then turns inland past several hotels situated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> jutting into the bay. North of the point, BL I-75 follows the Lake Huron shoreline past the Mackinac County Airport. North of the airport, the adjacent properties are primarily residential with a few tourist-oriented businesses. The business loop intersects County Road H-63 (Mackinac Trail) and comes to an end near Castle Rock at exit348 on I-75 in St. Ignace Township. On average each day in 2013, 4,327vehicles use the business loop near the northern I-75 interchange, and 8,819vehicles do so near the southern I-75 interchange, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), {{can be determined}} by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E

5|$|In their off-duty hours, SPARS contributed {{time and}} effort to many {{community}} and wartime causes. Some became active nurse's aides, some rolled bandages for the Red Cross, others donated blood to blood banks, some visited service men in convalescent hospitals, and others collected gifts for the men overseas. Many of them were also involved in the March of Dimes campaigns, and war chest and war bond drives. Both officers and enlisted were awarded ribbons and medals based on their service, and some were acknowledged for their outstanding contributions to the SPARS and the country. In general, SPARS looked upon their service favorably, and many of them found a form of kinship in having {{been a part of the}} nation's military forces during wartime. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the USCG demobilization effort began, and the SPARS were gradually discharged. They were separated from the service <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> system, and on the basis of their jobs. However, many SPARS were reassigned to the personnel separation centers to help with demobilization (women and men reservists) and they were not separated until it was completed. The Women's Reserve of the USCG (SPARS) was inactivated on 25 July 1947.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E
