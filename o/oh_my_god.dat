She would often return home to find that her mother had disposed of her fashion accessories, which led to further quarrels.

25|$|The {{educational}} {{perspective of}} internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on formal language use, specifically on Standard English, {{which in turn}} affects language education. The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and stylistics and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations. Such acronyms exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include lol (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), omg (<b>oh</b> <b>my</b> <b>god)</b> and gtg (got to go).|$|E

A song was added against the director's wishes. Built on a small budget and based on a Gujarati stage-play titled Kanji Virudh Kanji, it was a remake of the 2001 Australian film The Man Who Sued God. The story depicted the struggles of an atheist Hindu man who sued God after his shop is destroyed by an earthquake. Kumar appeared as Lord Krishna in the film. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com appreciated the film for bringing [...] "attention to the misuse and commercialisation of religion". Anupama Chopra praised Rawal's acting but felt that the rest character's were flimsy and film's [...] "intentions [...] good, but the preaching [...] boring". The film received poor initial collection {{at the box office}} but because of word of mouth it picked up and proved to be a commercial success. The film was banned in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates and faced protests in Punjab where several shows had to be cancelled. A police case was lodged against film's writer, director, Kumar and Rawal for hurting religious sentiments.

500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! <b>Oh</b> <b>my</b> <b>God!</b> I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{a growing}} fanbase, the xx made {{commitments}} to more concerts and extended their tour for the album. They intermittently toured for 18 months, including most of 2010.

In April and May, they toured the southern US and Japan, which Croft said was most demanding part of the tour because [...] "none of us had been away from home continuously for so long."

5000|$|<b>Oh</b> <b>My</b> <b>Gods!</b> has a {{characteristic}} [...] "preschool" [...] like drawing style, with characters only having eyes, one perspective, and no fingers.

The street theatre sequence featuring Kamal's character, Nallasivam, and his friends performing to make people aware of the atrocities committed by Nassar's character, Kanadasamy Padayatchi, was re-created at Tiruchirappalli in 2008 by Pralayan and his troupe from [...] "Chennai Kalai Kuzhu" [...] under the title Nammal Mudiyum. In contrast, Pralayan's play explored gender inequality and domestic violence instead of unemployment. Kannada actor Vishnuvardhan noted in 2010 that fellow actor Sudeep's film Just Maath Maathalli (2010) bears resemblance to Anbe Sivam. Hari Narayan, writing for The Hindu in 2014, mentions in his article on the Indian rationalist and author Narendra Dabholkar that Umesh Shukla's OMG– <b>Oh</b> <b>My</b> <b>God!</b> (2012) was [...] "a toned down version of Anbe Sivam where rationality propels humans to find God in themselves, with flaws, which extols the virtue of becoming as much as that of being". In 2015 Uthiran of The Hindu in Tamil, mentions in his review of Orange Mittai (2015) that the film's plot [...] "might remind viewers of Anbe Sivam". In 2017, Ashok, who directed the comedy film Peechankai, mentions he was inspired by Anbe Sivam to become a director.|$|E
500|$|When Anders and Tyrol {{detonate}} {{the bomb}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode, one of the Number Three (D'anna) models was to film a propaganda film in front of Laura Roslin's (Mary McDonnell) school at the time, but that was cut. Also, Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna) was originally considered the suicide bomber at the end, but was changed to Duck because he had less to live for after his wife's death. In the original drafts, the resistance was not planning suicide bombings, but [...] "freaking the Cylons out" [...] by imprisoning many of them in a secret underground prison, torture them for information, and leave them alive instead of killing them, as they would resurrect otherwise. This would make the Cylons worry about their missing comrades. However, Moore later realized that suicide bombings would be [...] "really potent and really powerful." [...] When writing the scenes involving Duck leading to the suicide bombing, Moore got [...] "emotionally caught up in it," [...] adding [...] "as I was writing these scenes of him standing in the police ranks, we know he's got the belt on. What's he gonna do? And then, <b>oh</b> <b>my</b> <b>God,</b> he actually does it. I mean, it's really horrifying stuff. But it's true. That's why I want to do it. It really happens. People do this."
