5000|$|The <b>orange</b> <b>weaver</b> (Ploceus aurantius) is {{a species}} of bird in the Ploceidae family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Orange</b> <b>Weaver</b> live in mangroves, {{thickets}} and swamps {{in coastal}} lagoons and along major West African rivers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>orange</b> <b>weaver</b> is {{commonly}} kept in aviculture. They are quite hardy for small birds. Like all finches, {{they should be}} kept in groups. Because of their active nature, these finches should be housed in large aviaries. They may be housed with other, larger finches, and will generally do well in this situation. However, individual orange weavers can become quite aggressive during breeding season. Because of this, the aggressive finches must sometimes be separated from the group. Orange weavers should be fed a diet that is a balanced mixture of small cereal seeds, fresh greens and some live foods, such as meal worms.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wild}} <b>orange</b> <b>weavers</b> are polygamous, {{two or three}} females should {{generally}} be provided for each male and they make their homes in reed beds {{close to the surface}} of water. Like most other finches, these birds are colonial, with hundreds of complexly woven nests at some sites, which include palms, reeds and other trees.|$|R
