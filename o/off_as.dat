5|$|Ebert {{occasionally}} accused some {{films of}} having an unwholesome political agenda, such as claiming that the 1971 film Dirty Harry had a fascist moral position.

5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed herself <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a British warship {{long enough}} to steam past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 to debark the mountain troops. After the ground troops seized control of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with Glowworm than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed {{in the span of}} two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and <b>off</b> <b>as</b> the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a distribution method due to {{worries about the}} quality of the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November was the North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur. After 20 minutes, Tottenham were 2–0 {{up after}} goals from Steffen Iversen and Tim Sherwood.

In the second half Ljungberg was sent <b>off,</b> <b>as</b> was Keown in {{stoppage}} time, to reduce Arsenal to nine men. The team responded with a 5–1 win against Middlesbrough, in which Overmars scored three goals. Arsenal then came from behind to beat Derby County on 28 November 1999; they ended the month in third, three points behind Leeds United in first.|$|E

At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed <b>off</b> <b>as</b> American alligators during trafficking.|$|E
