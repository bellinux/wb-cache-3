Across the country 40% of the {{sugarcane}} crop, 80–100% of the banana crop, 75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> trees under three years old, and 20% {{of the top}} layer of the cocoa crop were lost to the storm. Insured damage in Jamaica was initially estimated at around US$1.5billion, but post-storm analysis showed that it was closer to US$310million.|$|E
5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> is impaired. They {{built the first}} station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{experienced}} some tax trouble with federal authorities, concerning the financial relationship {{between himself and}} his company. In November 1918, he contracted with the company {{for the use of}} his trade secrets in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee,</b> and a month later gave a four-fifths stake in this to his immediate family. The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision. A petition to the Supreme Court was not accepted.|$|E
40|$|<b>Coffee</b> is <b>the</b> {{second most}} {{important}} agricultural exportation product in Brazil, constituting one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main income sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian economy. <b>The</b> state <b>of</b> Minas Gerais is <b>the</b> countrys biggest <b>coffee</b> producer. Recently, <b>coffee</b> produced in <b>the</b> state won national specialty contests, which has increased their commercial value and established them in the market.

25|$|<b>The</b> {{glory days}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippine <b>coffee</b> {{industry}} lasted until 1889 when <b>coffee</b> rust hit <b>the</b> Philippine shores. That, {{coupled with an}} insect infestation, destroyed virtually all <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> trees in Batangas. Since Batangas was a major producer of coffee, this greatly affected national coffee production. In two years, coffee production was reduced to 1/6th its original amount. By then, Brazil had regained its position as the world's leading producer of <b>coffee.</b> A few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surviving <b>coffee</b> seedlings were transferred from Batangas to Cavite, where they flourished. This was not <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippines' <b>coffee</b> growing days, but there was less area allotted to coffee because many farmers had shifted to other crops.|$|R

5|$|Washington's at-that-time unique product saw major use as combat rations in World War I. Coffee {{consumption}} on {{the battlefield}} was seen as valuable since it gave soldiers a caffeine boost. E.F. Holbrook, the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> section of the U.S. War Department at the time, also considered it an important aid in recovery from mustard gas. It was employed by the Canadian Expeditionary Force from 1914 until the American Expeditionary Force entered the war in 1917, and all production was shifted toward American military use. New, smaller producers also sprung up to meet the incredible level of demand from the Army, which in the final period {{of the war was}} six times the national supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> flavour. The beans are first {{thrown into a}} deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{passed to}} the south of most of the Greater Antilles, though its outer rain bands crossed many of the islands, and {{delivered}} hurricane force winds to Jamaica. Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands were mostly spared, though Hurricane Dean passed 50 to 60mi (80 to 95km) south of Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane. In Jamaica the rain caused flooding on {{the eastern side of the}} island and landslides on the northeast end. At least two direct deaths were confirmed. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane force winds, and 1,582 of the 3,127 damaged homes were uninhabitable. Landslides and fallen trees blocked hundreds of roads, particularly in the rural northeast region. As in the Lesser Antilles, Jamaica suffered severe damage to its agricultural sector. Forty percent of the sugarcane crop, 80 to 100% of the banana crop, 75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> trees under three years old, and 20% of the top layer of the cocoa crop were lost. Hurricane Dean affected 248 roads, including 186 that were blocked: 10 were blocked in the Kingston metropolitan region, 14 sections were blocked in St. Andrew, 43 roads were blocked in St. Catherine, eight roads were blocked in the Western Region (Saint James, Hanover, Westmoreland, and Trelawny), and 110 roads were blocked in the Northeast region.|$|E
