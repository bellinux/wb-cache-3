The Legacy of Kain development team {{began work on}} a new title (Tomb Raider: Legend), and Toby Gard returned {{to work as a}} consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president <b>of</b> <b>brand</b> management, commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos's. With that in mind, the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game that made them unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with Angel of Darkness was abandoned and a new plot was created for Legend.|$|E

Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type <b>of</b> <b>brand</b> management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E

The film's rights in Japan were sold for US$50,000, which was the highest an Indian film fetched for commercial release in 1999. Co-producer Thenappan registered the film posters as a Class 34 trademark in 1998, to be used for trademarking such items as beedis, cigarettes, cheroots and tobacco, making it the first instance <b>of</b> <b>brand</b> extension in the Tamil film industry.

5|$|The head of {{the project}} was Yoshihisa Hashimoto, Square Enix's Chief Technology Officer, who had moved over to the company from Sonic Team in 2009 and became {{involved}} with development in 2011. Other key Square Enix staff members working on Luminous Studio include Takeshi Nozue, Akira Iwata and Hiroshi Iwasaki. While ground work was being laid for Luminous, members of the team traveled to look at engine technology being developed by IO Interactive, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, western video game developers who became subsidiaries after the company bought out Eidos Interactive. Square Enix's western subsidiaries shared information about game engine development from their experience developing the CDC and Glacier 2 game engines and shared their source code with the Luminous Studio team. During 2012, one third of the final development team was from western subsidiaries of the company. Luminous was developed based on high-end DirectX 11 technology. While designed for eighth-generation video games, it was said to also be compatible with any console and hardware that could handle shaders, such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Its compatibility with Nintendo's seventh-gen hardware such as the Wii and Nintendo 3DS was doubted, as those consoles did not support shaders. During this early stage, they were looking into the possibility of adjusting the engine for use on Wii U. The company were hoping to promote Luminous as a kind <b>of</b> <b>brand,</b> showing off the logo and tech demo when they were ready.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} {{elucidate}} the geographies <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> and branding through interpreting their geographical entanglements. Focusing upon goods and services, it argues, fi rst, {{that the object}} <b>of</b> the <b>brand</b> and the process <b>of</b> <b>branding</b> are geographical because they are entangled in inescapable spatial associations. Second, these spatial associations matter because they are geographically differentiated and uneven. Third, geographically entangled brands and branding {{are closely related to}} spatially uneven development through the articulation and reinforcement of economic and social inequalities and unequal and competitive sociospatial relations and divisions of labour. Despite their apparent pervasiveness and signifi cance for geographical inquiry, the geographical entanglements <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> and branding have been under-investigated in Geography and hardly recognized and poorly specifi ed in other social science research. A critical account is provided that demonstrates the entangled geographies <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> and branding in their: (1) geographical origins, provenance and sociospatial histories; (2) spatial circuits of value and meaning and uneven development; and (3) territorial and relational spaces and places. Reading the changing forms, extent and nature of the geographical entanglements <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> and branding provides a novel but relatively overlooked window to consider and illustrate the vital spaces at the intersections of economic, social, cultural and political geographies, the tensions between relational and territorial notions of space and place and the politics and limits <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> and branding.

40|$|Against a {{background}} of research suggesting that brand symbolism understanding does not develop until 7 to 11 years of age, two studies investigate various aspects <b>of</b> preschool children's <b>brand</b> knowledge. While children's recognition <b>of</b> child-oriented <b>brands</b> {{is found to be}} significantly greater than their recognition <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> that are marketed primarily to teens and adults, these young children do recognize brands. In a second study, children's ability to form mental representations <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> is assessed, along with their understanding <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> as social symbols. Cognitive ability, theory of mind, and executive functioning are assessed as predictors of these brand-related outcomes. Theory of mind and executive functioning are both significant predictors of the ability to form mental representations <b>of</b> <b>brands.</b> Children's brand symbolism understanding shows a significant link with theory of mind. It is concluded that 3 - to 5 -year-olds have emerging knowledge <b>of</b> <b>brands</b> that are relevant in their lives. The impact of individual differences in theory of mind and executive functioning on children's brand knowledge aligns with current theories of child development.
