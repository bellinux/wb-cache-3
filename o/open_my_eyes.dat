25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{religious}} or spiritual views, Seeger replied: [...] "I feel most spiritual when I’m out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or {{looking up at the}} stars. [...] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something I'm listening to God.". He {{was a member of a}} Unitarian Universalist Church in New York.|$|E

60|$|Comforted not {{a little}} by this assurance, I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and looked up.|$|R
60|$|Thus, then, I too {{became a}} dreamer {{with only one}} longing, the longing for wisdom, for that spirit touch which should <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and enable me to see.|$|E
60|$|As I delayed to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> half awake, but {{unwilling to}} shock too soon the last {{lingering}} desire to doze, I seemed {{to hear a}} familiar rebuke from the great pepper tree beyond my window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I don't {{want to wake}} up," [...] he chortled, as he hefted {{the various}} sacks. [...] "Toted up, it's a seventy thousan' dream. It'd be too blamed {{expensive}} to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> roll out of the blankets, an' start breakfast." ...|$|E

6000|$|When {{the torture}} of revival made me <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I found myself on the grass. Gentle hands raised my head, {{at the moment when}} I {{recovered}} my senses. Who had brought me to life again? Who was taking care of me? ...|$|E
6000|$|The Red Marine turned slightly, {{speaking}} with the awful precision of the half-drunk. [...] "'As 'e got any-thin' in about my 'orrible death an' execution? Excuse me, but if I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I shan't be well. That's where I'm different from all other men. Ahem!" ...|$|E
60|$|When I regained {{consciousness}} {{it was to}} feel a cool, firm hand pressed upon my forehead. For an instant I did not <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> I was endeavouring to gather the loose ends of many thoughts and memories which flitted elusively through my tired and overwrought brain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I pulled back, made fast {{again to}} the jetty, {{and then went to}} sleep at last. I had faced the silence of the East. I had heard some of its languages. But when I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again the silence was as {{complete}} as though it had never been broken. I was lying in a flood of light, and the sky had never looked so far, so high, before. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and lay without moving.|$|R
60|$|Toward morning, I {{must have}} dozed, though {{it seemed to}} me at the time that I had lain awake for days, instead of hours. When I finally <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> it was daylight, and the girl's hair was in my face, and she was {{breathing}} normally. I thanked God for that. She had turned her head during the night so that as I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I saw her face not an inch from mine, my lips almost touching hers.|$|R
60|$|I sat up, <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and carried}} the tankard to my lips with both my hands. And as I drank I looked at Pons.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there was}} a long silence. It was better for me to ride lying down, in which {{position}} I was at this time. After a mile Sally took my hand and held it without speaking. My heart leaped, but I did not <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> or break that spell even with a whisper. [...] "Russ, I must say--tell you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But a {{very good}} one," [...] {{returned}} the Clown. [...] "It is really a big music-box under the bench, which starts playing every morning at seven o'clock. So, instead of being awakened by a rattling and clanging of bells, such as most alarm clocks make, I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> with a sensation of pleasure, and get up feeling jolly and content.|$|E
60|$|And as I {{felt myself}} borne {{up and up}} in that {{effortless}} ascension, my senses awake and my reason still half-dormant, an exquisite sense of languor pervaded my whole being. Presently meseemed that the surface was gained at last, and an instinct impelled me to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> upon the light, of which, through closed lids, I had become conscious.|$|E
60|$|As I {{sit here}} tonight {{in my little}} study {{overlooking}} the Hudson, just twenty years have elapsed since I first <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> upon Mars.|$|R
60|$|When I {{recovered}} my senses, my {{face was}} fairly scorched, and no sooner had I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> than they were blinded by smoke and flame.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Trot, my dear,' she said, when I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> 'I couldn't {{make up my}} mind {{to disturb}} you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come up?' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{one night}} I sleep, and, when I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{he is no}} longer near me. I run swiftly up the narrow stairs and along the silent corridor. The {{tapestry}} is drawn aside, and the hidden door stands open, and in the room beyond the friend that I loved is kneeling before an open chest, and the glint of the gold is in my eyes.|$|E
60|$|I {{could hardly}} believe the {{evidence}} of my senses when I found Mr. Stillwell's hand where it was. Was my uncle trying to rob me? I did not <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> but moved slightly to one side, uttering a deep sigh as I did so. Instantly the hand was withdrawn, and when, a moment later, I sat up, I {{saw that he was}} lying back as if in the soundest sleep.|$|E
60|$|Nearer and nearer {{came the}} doomed man. Now I heard him halt before me. There was a muttered exclamation, {{and then a}} step as he came to my side. I felt him kneel beside me. My grip {{tightened}} upon the chain. He leaned close to me. I must <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to find his throat, grasp it, and strike one mighty final blow {{all at the same}} instant.|$|E
60|$|Even as I spoke, {{somebody}} else raised {{my head and}} poured something down my throat. I swallowed it with a gulp. Then I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Gradually I {{was aware}} of {{somebody}} moistening my temples. A soft palm held my hand. Elsie was leaning over me. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> with a start.|$|R
60|$|As I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> Woola, too, moved and, {{coming up}} to his haunches, stared through the {{intervening}} brush toward the road, each hair upon his neck stiffly erect.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't {{possible}} {{you will}} have such comfort as that {{for some time to}} come; but {{we may be able to}} make your teeth chatter in a few days," [...] Neal replied laughingly, and then as the breeze caused by the movement of the yacht over the water fanned his face, he added sleepily, [...] "Good night; I don't believe I shall <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> until after sunrise to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|At length {{came the}} cruel {{recollection}} of the thing that I had done in my last conscious act, and then I dared not to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> for fear of what I should see lying beside me. I wondered who it could be who ministered to me. Carthoris {{must have had a}} companion whom I had not seen. Well, I must face the inevitable some time, so why not now, and with a sigh I opened my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Then some brandy was {{poured down}} my throat; it put vigour into me, and I {{was able to}} <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> fully and look around. Lights and shadows were moving among the trees, and I heard men call to one another. They drew together, uttering frightened exclamations; and the lights flashed as the others came pouring out of the {{cemetery}} pell-mell, like men possessed. When the further ones came close to us, those who were around me asked them eagerly: ...|$|E
60|$|These {{were the}} words that greeted my ears on {{recovering}} <b>my</b> senses. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and saw that I {{was surrounded by a}} number of boys and men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's dreadful! But I {{never felt}} it so keenly before. You have <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to it. Of course, I've {{been on a}} farm but not to live there." ...|$|R
60|$|When I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again I {{found myself}} lying upon {{a bed in}} a strange room. By my side was my father, leaning back in a low, easy chair.|$|R
