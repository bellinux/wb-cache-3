It was released on July 20, 2012, by Epic Records, {{to coincide with the}} launch of her first world tour, the Dance Again World Tour. Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, Love?, which was released by Island Records in May 2011 after her departure from Epic Records in 2010. As Lopez owed the label one last album to fulfill her contract, she began work on a new greatest hits album in November 2011. She later became unsure whether she wanted to go along with plans to release a greatest hits album <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> studio album, eventually deciding on the former.|$|E

The predicted demand was that of 75,000 vehicles per day by 1990 and a need for a dual 3-lane motorway. Two corridors were identified for a possible new motorway route, and a third option to possibly upgrade existing roads. The route could have followed the A5 Corridor to the M6 South of Gailey, at junction 12, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> corridor could have been established to the M6, north-east of Featherstone, at junction 11.

5|$|In 1996, a {{study on}} {{improving}} the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel by either building another tube or by constructing a bypass was carried out. Based on the study, the turnpike commission planned to replace the deteriorating tunnel with a cut through the mountain. The plans were put on hold in 2001 because it would cost $93.7 million. It resurrected the project in 2009. The nearby Mountain Field and Stream Club prefers that the tunnels are improved <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> tube is built rather than building the bypass.

Participants in the NZ ETS must surrender one emission unit (either an international 'Kyoto' unit <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Zealand-issued unit) for every two tonnes {{of carbon dioxide}} equivalent emissions reported or they may choose to buy NZ units from the government at a fixed price of NZ$25.The one-for-two transional measure will be phased out evenly across relevant sectors over three years from 1 January 2017. The old 50 percent surrender obligation increased to 67 percent from 1 January 2017, and will increase to 83 percent from 1 January 2018, and a full surrender obligation from 1 January 2019 for all sectors in the NZ ETS. This phased approach gives businesses time to plan and adjust, and supports a more stable market.|$|E
5|$|William Heaven was {{succeeded by}} his son the Reverend Hudson Grosset Heaven who, thanks to a legacy from Sarah Langworthy (née Heaven), was able to fulfill his life's {{ambition}} of building a stone church on the island. St Helen's was completed in 1896, and stands today as a lasting memorial to the Heaven period. It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building. He {{is said to have}} been able to afford either a church <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> harbour. His choice of the church was not however in the best financial interests of the island. The unavailability of the money for re-establishing the family's financial soundness, coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century, caused severe financial hardship.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Soviet {{paleontologist}} Evgeny Maleev named a new species, Tyrannosaurus bataar, from Mongolia. By 1965, {{this species}} had been renamed Tarbosaurus bataar. Despite the renaming, many phylogenetic analyses have found Tarbosaurus bataar {{to be the}} sister taxon of Tyrannosaurus rex, and {{it has often been}} considered an Asian species of Tyrannosaurus. A recent redescription of the skull of Tarbosaurus bataar has shown that it was much narrower than that of Tyrannosaurus rex and that during a bite, the distribution of stress in the skull would have been very different, closer to that of Alioramus, another Asian tyrannosaur. A related cladistic analysis found that Alioramus, not Tyrannosaurus, was the sister taxon of Tarbosaurus, which, if true, would suggest that Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus should remain separate. The discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus would later disprove this and revealed that Alioramus belonged to the clade Alioramini. The discovery of the tyrannosaurid Lythronax further indicates that Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus are closely related, forming a clade with fellow Asian tyrannosaurid Zhuchengtyrannus, with Lythronax being their sister taxon. A further study from 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al., also indicates Tyrannosaurus may have been an immigrant from Asia, as well as a possible descendent of Tarbosaurus. The study further indicates the possibility that Tyrannosaurus may have driven other tyrannosaurids that were native to North America extinct through competition. Other finds in 2006 indicate giant tyrannosaurs may have been present in North America as early as 75 million years ago. Whether or not this specimen belongs to Tyrannosaurus rex, a new species of Tyrannosaurus, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> genus entirely is still unknown.|$|E

5|$|The aging Greer Stadium was {{not meant}} to last longer than 30years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds {{proposed}} a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and private funds at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's thermal transfer energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006. After two years of the Sounds lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, {{due in part to the}} Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks and avoiding taxpayer expense. It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, the Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.|$|E
5|$|The game is turn-based. Each turn {{represents}} one week, and travelling between cities takes {{a number of}} turns depending on {{the proximity of the}} destination city. Many cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Some specialty cacao beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards {{take the form of a}} high price for the chocolates <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin {{proposed}} {{an addition to}} the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s to connect Green Bay, the state's third-largest city, to the system. Variations on this proposal included using either the US41 or US141 corridors, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> corridor in between. This request was rejected in the 1950s, but it was approved in the 1960s. After approval, the state started the process to convert US141 between Milwaukee and Abrams into a freeway. The first segments of freeway were opened in the Milwaukee area, starting in 1963 between Locust Street and Good Hope Road. The following year, {{an extension of the}} freeway opened southward from Locust to North Avenue. By 1965, the bypass of Sheboygan was opened; the Milwaukee area freeway was extended northward to Brown Deer Road the following year. Another freeway segment in the Milwaukee area opened in 1967, extending northward to Grafton in Ozaukee County. The last section of US141 in the city of Milwaukee to open as a freeway was completed in 1968 when I-94 was finished through downtown; at the same time, US141 was extended southward from North Avenue to meet I-94.|$|E
