5|$|In {{contrast}} to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44 tries, 12 {{more than in}} 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> {{they have a new}} head coach, but also 13 new players in their squad, and a new captain after Anton Oliver took over the reins from Tane Randell. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth, after winning four, and losing six of their eleven matches.|$|E

While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he retorted by saying {{that it would not}} affect him at all. He added that not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> his storytelling technique improve, but past mistakes had helped him improve his filmmaking abilities.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx {{to reach a}} sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses {{of the working class}} of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the Tribune have wide readership with the United States and not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolina {{coaching}} staff and administration {{was criticized for}} allowing the accused players {{to participate in the}} game, with at least one critic saying the school <b>only</b> <b>did</b> so in order to better its chances to win the game. Following the game, three of the players—Varian Ballard, Greg Harris and Ricco McCain—were found guilty of simple assault. Two others were found not guilty and charges were dismissed against another. The seventh player, Kivuusama Mays, pleaded no contest to the charge.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the Spruce Production Division {{continued}} long after the unit was demobilized. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the division dramatically increase the production of forest products for the war effort, but the transportation network that it built helped open up Pacific Northwest forests to greater use in the decades that followed. In addition, the division's work rules became the standard for logging and sawmill operations throughout the Pacific Northwest well into the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} 1522 brought no {{clarification}} on the issues. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the unrest between Zurich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Zurich's Confederation {{partners in the}} Swiss Diet. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Zurich. The city council felt obliged {{to take the initiative}} and find its own solution.|$|E

Indeed, both are organized on a north–south axis and both have their entrances located at the south-end of the eastern side.|$|E

Haiti was an important destination of the tour and not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> Fleming connect it with the religion, there were many practitioners available to witness. Despite viewing actual demonstrations, due to political unrest {{in the country at}} the time, it was decided not to film in Haiti.|$|E
5|$|After the Iberian king Pharasmanes I had his son Rhadamistus (r.51–55AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, Vologeses I of Parthia (r. c.51–77AD) {{planned to}} invade and place his brother, the later Tiridates I of Armenia, on the throne. Rhadamistus was {{eventually}} driven from power, and, {{beginning with the}} reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia—with brief interruptions—through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. Even {{after the fall of}} the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived on through the Armenian kings. However, not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, it as well continued through the Georgian kings with the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and for many centuries afterwards in Caucasian Albania through the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but <b>only</b> <b>did</b> two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was confident {{in his ability to}} perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E

5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E
5|$|Domitian also {{revived the}} {{practice}} of the imperial cult, which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and Cassius Dio allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of Dominus et Deus. However, not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> he reject the title of Dominus during his reign, but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.|$|E
5|$|During Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had no general appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The Court could review criminal convictions {{from the state}} courts, but not the lower federal courts, via writs of error. It <b>only</b> <b>did</b> so twice. The Court could hear original habeas petitions, but disclaimed the authority to grant the writ post-conviction unless the sentence had already been completed. Thus, {{the majority of the}} Marshall Court's opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of the circuit courts by a certificate of division.|$|E
