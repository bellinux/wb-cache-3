5|$|A {{mobile phone}} {{adaptation}} of the game was developed by Universomo and published by THQ. It was released on 19 December 2006. Several gameplay features — such as two-dimensional graphics, limited character selection, and coverage <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film Star Wars — distinguish {{this version of the}} game from the versions for other platforms. Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II were later compiled in , developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts. The Complete Saga incorporated improvements from the sequel into the original game, and expanded the Mos Eisley Cantina to allow access to both games' levels. It was created for Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS. It was released on 6 November 2007.|$|E
5|$|Being one of {{the tallest}} {{buildings}} in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building {{was that of the}} Modern Movement. The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey-coloured façade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was {{one of the}} first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall.|$|E

5|$|Haavind was {{replaced}} by Bjørn Sund in 1991. The post-use funds were distributed such that LOA received NOK76 million. It also acquired a thirty-percent stake in Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, which operates Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar, and Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg, which operates Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall in Gjøvik. Lillehammer was the <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five host municipalities to not use municipal grants to build their venues. By late 1991, LOOC desired a closer cooperation, resulting in a merger between LOA and Lillehammer '94 which took the latter's name. By 1 January 1993 also LOV and LOOC had also been merged to a single entity. Planning of post-Olympic use and demobilization started in early 1993.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, von Zittel divided stegocephalians {{among three}} taxa: Lepospondyli, Temnospondyli, and Stereospondyli. He placed microsaurs in Lepospondyli, a group which he {{characterized}} as having simple, spool-shaped vertebral centra. Temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra. All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intercentra. Cope objected to von Zittel's classification, considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because {{each had a}} simple spool shape. He continued to use Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta (which he alternatively referred to as Rhachitomi) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles.|$|E
5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{distance of the}} point from S. The aim of this proposition is {{to determine how the}} force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E

5|$|In France, however, Innocent II found {{a strong}} {{ally in the}} person of Bernard of Clairvaux. Under Bernard’s influence, almost all European monarchs and episcopates {{recognized}} the exiled Innocent II. Anacletus II, although he controlled Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter, received the support <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Normans of southern Italy, Scotland, Aquitaine, some cities in northern Italy (incl. Milan), and perhaps Outremer and probably also Poland.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation {{created a}} ranking {{system so that}} the nations {{involved}} in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish {{at the end of}} tournaments. The system takes into account results not <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are {{based on the number of}} teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways without a posted route number {{were given a}} signed designation for the first time. The Altona–Chazy Landing state highway was designated as NY191. At its east end, the route connected to Vermont RouteF-2 on Isle La Motte {{by way of a}} ferry across part of Lake Champlain. The ferry was discontinued in 1937; however, the endpoints of NY191 remained unchanged. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of all of NY191 was transferred from the state of New York to Clinton County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The entirety of the highway was designated as CR23 by Clinton County and NY191 was truncated to consist <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> portion of the route between Sciota and Chazy. The route was decommissioned on March 18, 2015.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the route was {{truncated}} to consist <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> portion {{east of the}} Hudson River. NY43's former routing west to Schoharie was redesignated NY443 as a result. NY43 was realigned slightly in the late 1990s to serve the new exit8 on I-90. Its former routing into Rensselaer on 3rd Avenue is now partly NY151 and unsigned NY915E.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the ground}} {{consisted}} <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch, around which an estimated 12,000spectators could congregate. The addition of stands in 1891 increased {{the capacity to}} about 15,000. The football club signed its first professional players in 1886 and began to break from its sponsoring railway company, but without the company's financial support it was unable to afford the rent {{on the ground and}} was evicted.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} Canada's role in the Afghanistan War, {{concerns}} were raised about the stringency of the criteria {{that needed to be}} met to receive the Victoria Cross. Other countries with a Victoria Cross had awarded it numerous times {{since the end of the}} Second World War, some members of the Australian, New Zealand, and British armed forces receiving the decoration for their actions during the Afghan and Iraq wars of the 2000s. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces questioned why some actions by Canadians were deemed worthy <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Star of Military Valour; citations for individuals who'd received the imperial Victoria Cross during the First World War were very similar to those for Canadians who were presented with the Star of Military Valour during the war in Afghanistan. This led then Chief of the Defence Staff, Walter Natynczyk, to create a special committee to review the matter. The Department of National Defence's Directorate of Honours and Recognition explained concepts of war had changed since the mid-20th century and Canada had also developed a more elaborate honours system.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{off-season}} storms that struck land, {{portions of the}} Caribbean were affected most. Hurricane Alice was the <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclones to strike land as a hurricane, doing so to islands in the northern Lesser Antilles; it caused locally heavy rainfall and moderate damage. No hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States during December, although at one point a storm in 1925 was believed to have done this. One century earlier, a hurricane formed in the western Caribbean and struck Florida on or before June 3, which was the earliest date for a United States hurricane landfall. However, there is an unofficial hurricane in 1863 that struck the Florida panhandle, killing 110 people. The deadliest official off-season storm was a tropical storm in May 1948, which killed 80 people in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|On April1, 1980, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} former NY188 (by this point redesignated as CR22) was transferred from Franklin County {{to the state of}} New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state transferred all of then-NY122 to Franklin County. The new Westville–Burke state highway became part of NY122, which was extended north along CR19 to Westville Center and east along former NY188 to Burke. NY122 was truncated between 1985 and 1993 to consist <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state-maintained part of the route between Westville and Burke.|$|E
5|$|Such was the {{disappointment}} at losing the Ashes, Collins was stripped not <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New South Wales captaincy {{but also that}} of his local club, Waverley. Former players, including his former Waverley captain, the influential Monty Noble, publicly criticised Collins' captaincy. Hunter Hendry, viewing the match from the stands, suspected Collins threw the match. Despite {{his reputation as a}} gambler, there is no material evidence that Collins ever fixed the result of any cricket match.|$|E

5|$|The Histoire Naturelle was {{translated}} into languages including English, German, Swedish, Russian and Italian. Many translations, often partial (single volumes, or all volumes to a certain date), abridged, reprinted in the same translation by different printers, or with additional text (for example on insects) and new illustrations, were made {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century and the start of the nineteenth century, presenting a complicated publication history. Early translations were necessarily <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier volumes. Given the complexity, all catalogue dates other than of single volumes should be taken as approximate.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia General Assembly {{voted in}} February 1846 {{to accept the}} return of Alexandria and on July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the {{territory}} that had been ceded by Virginia.

Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself.|$|E
