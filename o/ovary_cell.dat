40|$|Previous work {{suggests}} that cell surface heparan sulfate {{acts as a}} receptor for the Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Using Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> mutants defective in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, we show that heparan sulfate is necessary and sufficient for infectivity. Further, we demonstrate that the parasite requires N sulfation of heparan sulfate initiated by N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase- 1, but 2 -O sulfation and 6 -O sulfation appear to be dispensable. In order to study the role of heparan sulfate in other cell types, we created a conditional allele for N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase- 1 by using Cre-loxP technology. Mammary tumor cells lacking N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase- 1 exhibited reduced toxoplasma infectivity like Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> mutants. Surprisingly, heparin, chemically modified heparinoids, and monoclonal antibodies to heparan sulfate {{had no effect on}} toxoplasma infection. T. gondii attachment and invasion were unchanged in N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase- 1 -inactivated cells as well, but replication was reduced. Thus, heparan sulfate does not appear to function as a receptor for T. gondii but instead facilitates parasite replication postinvasion...|$|E
40|$|The 27 -amino-acid gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP 1 - 27) is a neuropeptide {{and growth}} factor that is {{synthesized}} by various neural and neuroendocrine cells. The major pro-GRP hormone (isoform I) contains both GRP 1 - 27 and a novel C-terminal extension peptide termed pro-GRP 31 - 125. In order to define potentially active neuropeptides {{that could be}} generated from this novel protein domain, we analyzed the posttranslational processing of endogenous human pro-GRP 1 - 125 in a small-cell lung cancer cell line. Because such studies are much easier in an overexpression system, we investigated {{at the same time}} the posttranslational processing of baculovirus-expressed human pro-GRP 1 - 125 in an insect <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> line. In the small-cell lung cancer cell line, GRP 1 - 27 was cleaved as expected from the endogenous prohormone at a pair of basic amino acids (29 and 30) and alpha-amidated at its C-terminal methionine; however, a number of novel peptides were generated by additional cleavages in the pro-GRP 31 - 125 domain. In the insect <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> line, GRP 1 - 27 was cleaved from the expressed prohormone by a different mechanism, as were a number of other peptides that appeared to be similar in size to those produced by the human neuroendocrine tumor cell line. These data show for the first time that an insect <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> line that is widely used to overexpress proteins can process a human neuropeptide precursor. They also reveal the existence of novel pro-GRP-derived peptides that are candidates for biologically active ligands...|$|E

40|$|Mammalian {{polyamine}} carriers {{have not}} yet been molecularly identified. The fluoroprobe Spd-C 2 -BODIPY faithfully reports polyamine transport and accumulates almost exclusively in polyamine-sequestering vesicles (PSVs). Polyamines might thus be imported first by a plasma membrane carrier and then sequestered into pre-existing PSVs (model A), or be directly captured by polyamine receptors undergoing endocytosis (model B). Spd-C 2 -BODIPY uptake was unaffected in receptor-mediated endocytosis-deficient Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> mutants. PSVs strongly colocalized with acidic vesicles of the late endocytic compartment and the trans Golgi. Virtually perfect colocalization between PSVs and acidic vesicles was found in Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> mutants that are blocked either in the late endosome/lysosome fusion process or in the maturation of multivesicular bodies. Prior inhibition of the V-ATPase dramatically decreased total Spd-C 2 -BODIPY accumulation while increasing cytosolic fluorescence. Conversely, cells pre-loaded with the probe slowly released it from PSVs upon V-ATPase inhibition. The present data thus support model A, and indicate that polyamine accumulation is primarily driven by the activity of a vesicular H+:polyamine carrier...|$|E
40|$|Several {{isolates}} of Salmonella {{were examined}} for {{the capacity to}} synthesize and release a cholera toxin-like toxin that exerted a biological effect on Chinese hamster ovary cells. Measurements of this Salmonella toxin, which was contained in cell sonic extracts and culture filtrates, were expressed in cholera toxin equivalents (nanograms), since the Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> responses of the cholera toxin and the Salmonella toxin were indistinguishable. Comparative titrations of Salmonella preparations were also performed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for cholera toxin antigen. The amount of Salmonella toxin synthesized was low (nanogram levels), but the toxin was detectable in cell sonic extracts as early as 6 h after culture inoculation and reached maximal levels by 12 h. Salmonella toxin antigen was not detectable in control culture filtrates until 48 h, but the addition of mitomycin C at 8. 5 h resulted in the sudden appearance of toxin antigen at 10 to 12 h, and the toxin antigen level reached a maximum at 14 h. A large peak of Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> activity was observed at 48 h in the control culture, but significant Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> activity was detected as early as 14 h. A larger amount of Chinese hamster ovary cell-reactive material was observed as early as 10 h in cultures grown with mitomycin C. The mechanism of the mitomycin-mediated phenomenon that yielded more toxin in culture filtrates was associated with bacteriophage induction. A bacteriophage plaque assay with a susceptible Salmonella strain revealed that there were free bacteriophage in mitomycin-treated culture filtrates (but not control culture filtrates) at 12 h. Toxin production was greatest when cultures were grown at 30 to 37 °C and lowest when cultures were grown at 25 °C. The inoculum size and degree of culture aeration (agitation) {{had little effect on}} synthesis of the toxin, and toxin production occurred during anaerobic growth...|$|E

MethodsVessel ultrasound sonography was performed in a sRAGE-treated rat carotid artery balloon injury model at different time points after the surgery, and therapeutic efficacy of different doses of sRAGE produced in Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cells</b> and with different N-glycoform modifications were assessed. ResultsVessel ultrasound sonography found that sRAGE produced in Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cells</b> with complex N-glycoform modifications is highly effective, and is consistent with our recent findings in the same model assessed with histology. We also found that sonography is less sensitive than histology when a higher dose of sRAGE is administered.

40|$|International audienceUltrasonic {{backscatter}} coefficient (BSC) {{measurements were}} performed on K 562 cell pellet biophantoms with cell concentrations ranging from 0. 006 to 0. 30 in the 10 - 42 MHz frequency bandwidth. Three scattering models, namely the Fluid-Filled Sphere Model (FFSM), the Particle Model (PM) and the Structure Factor Model (SFM), were compared for modeling the scattering from an ensemble of concentrated cells. A parameter estimation procedure was developed in order to estimate the scatterer size and relative impedance contrast that could explain the measured BSCs from all the studied cell concentrations.

40|$|Cell {{therapy has}} been linked to an unexplained return of ovarian {{function}} and fertility in some cancer survivors. Studies modeling this in mice have shown that cells transplantation generates donor-derived oocytes in chemotherapy-treated recipients. This study was conducted to further clarify the impact of cell transplantation from different sources on female reproductive function after chemotherapy using a preclinical mouse model. Methods. Female mice were administered 7. 5 [*]mg/kg cisplatin followed by cell transplantation (one week later) using GFP+ female cell donors. For cell tracking, adipose derived stem cell GFP+ (ADSC), female germline stem cell GFP+/MVH+ (FGSC), or <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> suspension GFP+ mice were transplanted into cisplatin-treated wild-type recipients. After 7 or 14 days animals were killed and histological analysis, IHQ for GFP cells, and ELISA for estradiol were performed. Results. Histological examinations showed that ADSC, <b>ovary</b> <b>cell</b> suspension, and FGSC transplant increase the number of follicles with apparent normal structure in the cells recipient group euthanized on day 7. Cell tracking showed GFP+ samples 7 days after transplant. Conclusion.

40|$|Cowpox virus, in {{contrast}} to vaccinia virus, can multiply in Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cells.</b> To study the genetic basis for this difference in host range, recombinants between vaccinia and cowpox viruses were isolated and their DNA restriction patterns were examined. The ability to multiply in Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cells</b> could be correlated with the conservation of cowpox virus sequences mapping at the left end of the genome. This was further demonstrated by marker rescue of the host range phenotype with restricted cowpox virus DNA. Marker rescue with cloned restriction fragments of decreasing size enabled the fine localization of the host range function to a 2. 3 -kilobase-pair fragment. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the fragment encoded a single major polypeptide of approximately 77, 000 daltons. It is suggested {{that the role of}} the host range gene from cowpox virus is to prevent the early and extensive shutoff of protein synthesis that normally occurs in Chinese hamster <b>ovary</b> <b>cells</b> infected by vaccinia virus...|$|R
