40|$|The Directive 2007 / 2 /EC of the EU {{adopted in}} 2007 aims at {{establishing}} an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies and policies or activities {{which may have}} an impact on the environment [...] It cover spatial data sets related to one or more of the 34 themes listed in the INSPIRE annexes. Hydrography theme (HY) provides four application schemas that deliver a water spatial framework for mapping, reporting, modelling and spatial analysis purposes. An <b>Oceanographic</b> <b>Geographical</b> <b>Features</b> theme (OF) describes the physical and chemical characteristics of the sea and Sea Regions theme (SR) define marine areas of common features. Pool of the HY, OF and SR spatial data, makes an information system that integrates interoperable data on inland and coastal waters and provides core spatial data models that can support resolving water thematic issues. It can be applied on the national level, but as well as on the regional or European level. The data specifications for these themes are part of the Regulation on interoperability implementing INSPIRE Directive and further described in the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. JRC.

40|$|Abstract__ Shipping {{activity}} has increased worldwide and maritime administrations {{are trying to}} enhance risk mitigation strategies by using proactive approaches. We present and discuss a conceptual framework to minimize potential harm based on a multi-layered approach which can be implemented in either real time for operational purposes or in prediction mode for medium or longer term strategic planning purposes. We introduce the concept of total risk exposure which integrates risk at the individual ship level with vessel traffic densities and location specific parameters such as weather and <b>oceanographic</b> conditions, <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> or environmental sensitivities. A comprehensive and robust method to estimate and predict risk exposure can be beneficial to maritime administrations to enhance mitigation strategies and understand uncertainties. We further provide a proof of concept based on 53 million observations of vessel positions and individual risk profiles of 8, 900 individual ships. We present examples on how endpoints can be visualized for two integrated risk layers – ship specific risk and vessel traffic densities. We further identify and discuss uncertainties and present our ideas on how other risk layers could be integrated in the future...|$|R

40|$|Suruga bay is a {{structural}} bay with {{a considerable number}} of <b>geographical</b> <b>features.</b> The Suruga Trough runs from north to south,and the Fujikawa Fan Delta is {{in the northern part of}} Suruga Bay. From seismic data on the continental shelf in the northern part of Suruga Bay,we clarified the formation processes of the <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> from detailed sea-beam data and determined the displacement of the basement in the Wu?rm ice age due to the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate. As a result, unique <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> were found to exist on the continental shelf in the northern part of Suruga Bay. We distinguished some of the <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> and assumed a wavy surface and two gradual slopes. Moreover,we found that the base sank gradually from the region off Ueda to that off Fuji River from seismic data. However,large displacement of the base was confirmed to the west of Fuji River. This large displacement of base might show <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> change from Wu?rm...|$|R

40|$|Electronic maps (E-maps) provide {{people with}} {{convenience}} in real-world space. Although web map services can display maps on screens, {{a more important}} function is their ability to access <b>geographical</b> <b>features.</b> An E-map {{that is based on}} raster tiles is inferior to vector tiles in terms of interactive ability because vector maps provide a convenient and effective method to access and manipulate web map features. However, the critical issue regarding rendering tiled vector maps is that <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> that are rendered in the form of map symbols via vector tiles may cause visual discontinuities, such as graphic conflicts and losses of data around the borders of tiles, which likely represent the main obstacles to exploring vector map tiles on the web. This paper proposes a tiled vector data model for <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> in symbolized maps that considers the relationships among <b>geographical</b> <b>features,</b> symbol representations and map renderings. This model presents a method to tailor <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> in terms of map symbols and 'addition' (join) operations on the following two levels: <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> and map features. Thus, these maps can resolve the visual discontinuity problem based on the proposed model without weakening the interactivity of vector maps. The proposed model is validated by two map data sets, and the results demonstrate that the rendered (symbolized) web maps present smooth visual continuity...|$|R
