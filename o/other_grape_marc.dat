As the determination of particle and bulk density was complicated and tedious, two simplifications of the method 1 were tested to obtain an easier approach to establish the optimum MC. The first one (method 2) assumed that bulk density was a constant value (calculated for dry samples), independent of the {{moisture content}} of the sample. The second approach (method 3) {{was based on the}} measurement of the porosity of the materials. Independently of the method used for the estimation of FAS, values of MC and FAS were linearly correlated with high determination coefficients. Regression lines of methods 1 and 2 were comparable only for a fibrous material (cotton gin trash) because bulk density increased slightly when MC increased. For the <b>other</b> materials (<b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> and olive press cake) the simplification assumed by method 2 was not valid due to great increases of bulk density when MC increased. However, the comparison of the regression lines showed that methods 1 and 3 were not statistically different for the three materials tested. Thus, the optimum MC (FAS= 30 - 36 %) of compostable materials can be estimated by a simple method that requires only easy measurements of porosity at several moisture contents. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Through a 50 mL experimental apparatus, hydrothermal carbonization tests were performed at several temperatures (namely: 180, 220 and 250 degrees C) and residence times (1, 3, 8 h). Analyses on both the solid and the gaseous phases obtained downstream of the process were performed. In particular, solid and gas yields versus the process operational conditions were studied and the obtained hydrochar was evaluated in terms of calorific value, elemental analysis, and thermal stability. Data testify that hydrochar form <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> presents interesting values of HHV (in the range 19. 8 - 24. 1 MJ/kg) and physical-chemical characteristics which make hydrochar exploitable as a solid biofuel. In the meanwhile, the amount of gases produced is very small, if compared to other thermochemical processes. This represents an interesting result when considering environmental issues. Statistical analysis of data allows to affirm that, in the chosen range of operational conditions, the process is influenced more by temperature than residence time.

This experiment {{examined the effects of}} dietary supplementation with either dried, pelleted <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> or ensiled <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> on yield and composition of milk, enteric CH 4 emissions, and ruminal microbiota in dairy cows. Thirty-two Holstein dairy cows in late lactation were offered 1 of 3 diets: a control (CON) diet; a diet containing dried, pelleted <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> (DGM); and a diet containing ensiled <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> (EGM). The diet offered to cows in the CON group contained 14. 0 kg of alfalfa hay dry matter (DM) /d and 4. 3 kg of concentrate mix DM/d. Diets offered to cows in the DGM and EGM groups contained 9. 0 kg of alfalfa hay DM/d, 4. 3 kg of concentrate mix DM/d, and 5. 0 kg of dried or ensiled <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> DM/d, respectively. These diets were offered individually to cows for 18 d. Individual cow feed intake and milk yield were measured daily and milk composition measured on 4 d/wk. Individual cow CH 4 emissions were measured by the SF 6 tracer technique on 2 d {{at the end of the}} experiment. Ruminal bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and protozoan communities were quantified on the last day of the experiment. Cows offered the CON, DGM, and EGM diets, ate 95, 98, and 96 %, respectively, of the DM offered. The mean milk yield of cows fed the EGM diet was 12. 8 kg/cow per day and was less than that of cows fed either the CON diet (14. 6 kg/cow per day) or the DGM diet (15. 4 kg/cow per day). Feeding DGM and EGM diets was associated with decreased milk fat yields, lower concentrations of saturated fatty acids, and enhanced concentrations of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular cis- 9,trans- 11 linoleic acid. The mean CH 4 emissions were 470, 375, and 389 g of CH 4 /cow per day for cows fed the CON, DGM, and EGM diets, respectively.

To date, only results from mesophilic tests have been extensively reported. In this study, potential methane production and kinetic constants were determined by batch trials under thermophilic conditions and compared with mesophilic values already reported in literature. <b>Grape</b> <b>marcs</b> and wine lees {{appeared to be the}} most promising substrates with an estimated potential of 0. 34 and 0. 37 Nm 3 CH 4 /kgVSfed, respectively, while grape stalks generated only 0. 13 Nm 3 CH 4 /kgVSfed. In order to assess the feasibility of a continuous anaerobic digestion process, a lab-scale semi-continuous reactor was constructed. Because of the consumption of buffer capacity, the biological process was difﬁcult to control. On the other hand, biogas was produced when working with a hydraulic retention time of 40 d and with previously fermented grape marcs; a speciﬁc biogas production of 0. 29 Nm 3 /kgVSfed was observed. The results of the continuous tests were used to calculate the potential energy recovery from <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> produced in Italy (808 thousands of tons per year) in terms of heat and electricity; about 245 GWh of heat and 201 GWh of electricity per annum could be generated in Italian scenario...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWater {{extracted}} winery by-products exhibited significant plant defence inducer properties. Experiments {{were conducted}} on three marc extracts containing various amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins. Infiltration of red, white and seed <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> extracts into tobacco leaves induced hypersensitive reaction-like lesions with cell death evidenced by Evans Blue staining. The infiltration zones and the surrounding areas revealed accumulation of autofluorescent compounds under UV light. Leaf infiltration of the three winery by-products induced defence gene expression. The PR 1, PR 2, and PR 3 target genes were upregulated locally in tobacco plants following <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> extract treatments. PR 5 transcripts accumulated as well in red marc extract treated-tobacco leaves. Overall, the winery by-products extracts elicited an array of plant defence responses making the grape residues a potential use of high value compounds...|$|R
40|$|Industrial cork residue, <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> {{and olive}} oil husk + cotton gin trash (2 / 3, v/v) were {{composted}} in 40 m 3 windrows and turned each week. Composting took a variable time depending on the materials (4. 5 to 8. 5 months). During composting <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> pile and cork pile were fertilized with ammonium nitrate, superphosphate, iron sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The evolution of temperature, pH, mineral nitro-gen (N NH 4 + and N NO 3), total nitrogen, organic matter, C/N ratio, electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity were measured each week. In order to estimate compost maturity, phytotoxicity test, employing index germination, and nitrogen drawdown index (NDI) were used. With curing time, organic matter and C/N ratio decreased, whereas CEC increased and pH was constant. Microbial biomass, micro-bial activity were measured in mature compost. Cork compost showed the highest beta glucosidase acti-vity followed by <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> compost. Olive oil husk + cotton gin trash compost showed the lowest acti-vity. The composts were used as growing media for geranium and petunia during 15 weeks. The worst results were obtained when olive oil husk + cotton gin trash {{were used in the}} composted mixtures. In these cases plants showed a lower development and leaf chlorosis. This can be explained as a consequence of nutritional disorders and/or the possible presence of phytotoxic organic substances...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the composition of secondary aroma compounds of fresh <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> distillates {{as a result of}} variety and production technology, 30 samples (6 varieties× 5 samples) were analysed. White <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> samples from Malvazija istarska, Chardonnay and Muscat Blanc were obtained as by-products in standard white wine production, while red <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> samples from Teran and Cabernet Sauvignon were obtained after standard red wine production procedures. <b>Marc</b> from red <b>grape</b> variety Muškat ruža porečki was obtained during the production of rosé wines. All fermented marc samples were distilled using a traditional copper alembic. The obtained distillates were subjected to GC/MS and GC/FID analyses. Malvazija istarska distillates exhibited exceptionally high methanol content. Distillates from white grape varieties were found to be characterized by higher C 6 alcohol and 1 -propanol concentrations, while red grape distillates contained higher amounts of the majority of alcohols, acids, and esters. In Muškat ruža distillates intermediate concentrations of many important aroma compounds were found. It was concluded that differences in the production technology parameters, depending on the variety, resulted in differences in secondary aroma profiles, most evident between distillates from white and red varieties. These findings were confirmed applying stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA), which resulted in 100 % correct classification of distillates according to the variety and corresponding production technology...|$|R
40|$|Two composts were {{obtained}} by cocomposting a concentrated depotassified beet vinasse and <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> using an aerated static pile and a windrow system. The composting mixtures comprised <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> (83 %) and vinasse (17 %) for the aerated static pile system and <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> (77 %), vinasse (20 %) and phosphate rock (3 %) for the windrow. Changes in temperature followed a similar path for both mixtures, however the thermophilic phase was longer in the aerated static pile (25 days) than in the windrow (10 days). This fact caused differences in both organic matter degradation, weight losses (21 % for static pile and 10 % for windrow) and gas losses during the process. Nevertheless, the composts obtained by the two systems had a high fertilizer nutrient value (18. 2 g kg- 1 N; 3. 1 g kg- 1 P; 13. 6 g kg- 1 K, C/N 16. 1 for compost obtained in static pile and 20. 6 g kg- 1 N; 13. 7 g kg- 1 P; 13. 1 g kg- 1 K; C/N 18 for compost obtained in windrow). A high degree of stability was reached in both composting systems (124 cmolc kg- 1 CEC for static pile and 153 cmolc kg- 1 CEC for windrow at 80 days of composting). The chemical and physical properties of both vinasse composts suggest their possible use as soil conditionerPeer Reviewe...|$|R
