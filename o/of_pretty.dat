The first 3,000 pressings of the LP featured blue vinyl, while the following pressings were in standard black.

5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid <b>of</b> <b>pretty</b> much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E

25|$|The waitresses were a major {{attraction}} for the saloons and were nicknamed the pretty waiter girls, {{though they were}} not always attractive or young. They were scantily clothed in gaudy outfits while they sold drinks and danced with customers for money. The saloons hired women to exploit the men, instructed to pick customers' pockets and then give half that money back to the management. The pretty waiter girls earned about $20 per week plus a commission on any drinks and dances that they sold. Small grog houses and deadfalls hired only handful <b>of</b> <b>pretty</b> waiter girls, but the larger dance halls and concert saloons employed up to fifty women. However some of the concert saloons, like the Eureka and Bella Union, {{made an effort to}} have notable Barbary Coast performers appear in their shows and actually had attractive women for their pretty waiter girls.|$|E
500|$|Poco Pine was a 1954 bay stallion, sired by Poco Bueno, and out <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> Rosalie, a {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> Boy. As a foal, he was bought at E. Paul Waggoner's 1954 Waggoner Ranch sale by Paul Curtner. Curtner had {{originally intended to}} purchase {{a daughter}} of Blackburn and a filly by Poco Bueno, but instead ended up purchasing two different horses– a mare by Pretty Boy (Pretty Rosalie) and a colt by Poco Bueno (Poco Pine). [...] While still at the sale, Curtner was approached by two employees of Waggoner's, both informing Curtner that in their opinion, he'd bought the best mare in the sale. One of the employees, Pine Johnson, Waggoner's trainer, also felt that the colt was the best Poco Bueno colt he'd ever seen. Because of Johnson's praise for the colt, Curtner decided to register the foal as Poco Pine.|$|E
500|$|Jack Powell and David Armstrong are {{rivals in}} the same small American town, both vying for the attentions <b>of</b> <b>pretty</b> Sylvia Lewis. Jack fails to realize that [...] "the girl next door", Mary Preston, is desperately in love with him. The two young men both enlist to become combat pilots in the Air Service. When they leave for {{training}} camp, Jack mistakenly believes Sylvia prefers him. She actually prefers David and lets him know about her feelings, but is too kindhearted to turn down Jack's affection.|$|E

500|$|Sputnikmusic's Sobhi Youssef {{stated that}} Hodgy had matured as a performer, {{improving}} both his flow and beat selection, though {{noted that the}} EP offered very little replay value, and that no track [...] "really stuck out". Drew Malmuth <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> Much Amazing wrote that [...] "considering all the dreck out there it’s hard to gripe too much about a hip-hop release with good production and lyricism that has bursts of real quality", though mused that the project sounded [...] "distinctly underdeveloped in comparison to top-tier hip-hop".|$|E
500|$|Few {{details are}} known about Smart's time at St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics. He was {{admitted}} to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a [...] "Curable Patient". It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in A Collection <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High. Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness. To have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of Ricky Martin as David Martinez was welcomed by most reviewers. Futterman wrote that [...] "Ricky Martin {{carried on the}} Gwyneth Paltrow tradition <b>of</b> <b>pretty</b> great guest teacher cameos", and TVLine Michael Slezak said that the episode was good [...] "at least whenever Ricky Martin appeared on screen". VanDerWerff called him [...] "fun and infectious", and Kate Stanhope of TV Guide said he [...] "showed {{himself to be a}} guest star with mucho potential". Kubicek, though he said Martin was [...] "great at singing", found him [...] "kind of dull as an actor", and Canning said Martin [...] "felt out of place" [...] in the episode.|$|E

500|$|The music <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> on the Inside is {{most often}} noted for its {{abrasive}} instrumentation and for its sophisticated use of melody buried under arrangements. The album's sonic elements are heavily influenced by Los Angeles hardcore punk as well as New York's no wave scene; many of the tracks are accompanied by overt use of feedback, experimental playing, wah pedals, and use of sampling and interpolation. Rapid sliding techniques and string muting are also heavily present on the album, {{as well as what}} Love and Erlandson describe as [...] "Sonic Youth tunings." [...] Love's vocals range from whispers to violent screaming, often in succession with the extreme shifts in speed and volume.|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review of [...] "Asking 4 It", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the track [...] "dated" [...] and [...] "no more worthy of Stefani's emotional exorcism than 2014's stale 'Spark the Fire'". Emily Blake of Mashable thought that [...] "Asking 4 It" [...] was [...] "an out-of-place hip-hop track", while Jordan Miller of BreatheHeavy {{felt that the}} song was [...] "vulnerable" [...] and unfavorably predicted that it will [...] "probably become a single" [...] in the future. Daniel Bromfield <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> Much Amazing panned [...] "Asking 4 It" [...] but enjoyed Fetty Wap's contribution to the track; Bromfield thought [...] "it's tragic how completely [...] upstages Stefani" [...] and how Fetty Wap showed emotion during his verse while Stefani did not.|$|E
500|$|At {{the behest}} of Prudential Securities {{bankruptcy}} proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor's recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including Pretty Hate Machine and a percentage of royalties from Reznor's song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. Rykodisc, which did not win the auction but was able to license the rights from Prudential, reissued the out-of-print Pretty Hate Machine CD on November 22, 2005. Ryko also reissued the [...] "Head Like a Hole" [...] CD and a vinyl edition <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> Hate Machine in 2006. The label considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for The Downward Spiral. They were influenced by Reznor and liked the idea, but {{did not want to}} pay him for the album and the idea was scrapped.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "Commission of Lunacy" [...] {{was taken}} out against Smart, and he was {{admitted}} to St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics on 6 May 1757 as a [...] "Curable Patient". It is possible that Smart was confined by Newbery over old debts and a poor relationship between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart and his immorality in his A Collection <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High. Regardless of the exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on [...] "madness". However, {{there is also evidence}} that an incident of some kind took place in St. James's Park in which Smart started to pray loudly in public until he had [...] "routed all the company" [...] (Jubilate Agno B89).|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> on the Inside, Love began dating Kurt Cobain and became pregnant. During Love's pregnancy, Hole {{recorded}} {{a cover of}} [...] "Over the Edge" [...] for a Wipers tribute album, and recorded their fourth single, [...] "Beautiful Son", which was released in April 1993. Love and Cobain married in February 1992 and, {{after the birth of}} their daughter Frances Bean Cobain, relocated to Carnation, Washington and then to Seattle. On September 8, 1993, Love and Cobain made their only public performance together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Hollywood, performing two acoustic duets of [...] "Pennyroyal Tea" [...] and [...] "Where Did You Sleep Last Night". Love also performed electric versions of two new Hole songs, [...] "Doll Parts" [...] and [...] "Miss World", both written for the band's upcoming second album.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{composition}} of [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] follows {{the status quo}} <b>of</b> <b>Pretty</b> on the Inside, which is most often noted for its extreme abrasiveness, though it is also noted for its sophisticated use of melodic structure which is buried under arrangements. Spin addressed this, saying: [...] "at first [...] comes across like a ranting noisy rage, but underneath is a surprisingly lush melody." [...] The song's main verse riff follows an E-G-F chord progression, with the bridge composed of a layering of diminished fifths and muted strings, evoking a [...] "sonic uncleanliness." [...] As {{with the majority of}} the band's songs, the lyrics to [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] were written by Love, and deal with a negative self image and real or imagined perception of oneself as a [...] "whore", which is reinforced by the narrator's mother.|$|E
