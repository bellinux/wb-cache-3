Still, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, {{but they were all}} good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing.

500|$|Guitar {{was viewed}} by Sharrock as the {{culmination}} of a period in his career spent developing his sense of composition. After releasing his first record—Black Woman—in 1969, he experimented with different influences during the 1970s. When he recorded [...] "Dance with Me Montana" [...] in 1982, the song's chord progression changed his perspective on composing and inspired him to pursue more melodic ideas. [...] "You listen to , and it's like a blind man struggling {{to get out of a}} room", Sharrock recalled. [...] "Guitar was a crystallization of all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had discovered in that song." [...] In the early 1980s, he had also worked on projects with Material, an experimental band fronted by Bill Laswell, who helped Sharrock produce the album.|$|E

In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would like to take back. It was really fucked up.

500|$|On the surface, it {{may seem}} that the Smoking Man merely tries to hide {{information}} from Mulder and Scully, but {{there is much more}} to him. He is involved in the Syndicate, a shadow organization which includes members of the United States government that exists to hide from the public the fact that aliens are planning to colonize Earth. The Smoking Man often ruthlessly protects the secrets of the conspiracy, and serves as the main antagonist to Mulder, who has an equally consuming devotion to reveal the truth in the first seven seasons. His stated justification is a desire to prevent the alien colonization for as long as possible; in the episode [...] "One Breath", he tells Mulder that he is in the conspiracy (which he calls [...] "the game") because he believes that the secrets he keeps could, if publicly revealed, threaten the social order that preserves society: [...] "If people were to know <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know... it would all fall apart". He is at times shown working towards that goal, particularly in connection with developing a vaccine to protect people from the [...] "black oil", a parasitic agent which the alien Colonists use to propagate themselves.|$|E

In order for all the stuff that they do to work, their world needs to be grounded in reality." [...] The designers sought to keep their characters visually simple, so that kids [...] "would easily be able to draw [...] themselves." [...] Characters were also crafted to be recognizable from a distance, a technique the creators say is based on Matt Groening's goal of making characters recognizable by silhouette.|$|E

2500|$|Brothers in Arms was {{recorded}} from November 1984 to March 1985 at AIR Studios {{on the island}} of Montserrat, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean. The album was produced by Mark Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman. Knopfler became aware of Dorfsman through his 1981 recording of the Wanderlust album by jazz vibraphonist Mike Mainieri. In 1982, Knopfler asked Dorfsman to work with him on the 1982 Dire Straits album, Love over Gold, and his 1983 soundtrack album Local Hero. Brothers in Arms {{was one of the first}} albums recorded on a Sony 24-track digital tape machine. The decision to move to digital recording came from Knopfler's constant striving for better sound quality. [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> totally respected about him," [...] Dorfsman observed, [...] "was his interest in technology as a means of improving his music. He was always willing to spend on high-quality equipment." ...|$|E

[...] On Pet Sounds and other work, author Jim Fussili observed a repeated nuance of Wilson's to [...] "wander far from the logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work". Tony Asher remembers: [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really enjoyed, was that first time I'd hear him hunting for a chord change and I'd think 'Man, he's just gone right off the edge because he's not ever gonna get close. He's way out there in some area that's just—he'll never get back. And if he's successful, gets out of there, people are going to say, I've lost my tone center, don't know where the hell I am and stuff. And then, eventually, he'd figure out what it was he wanted to do. A lot of it was just hunting and pecking, the way some of us type." ...|$|E

[...] During a back stage interview at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, Rowland revealed that working with so many producers inspired her to rename the album Talk a Good Game. The album was originally due for release from June 3, 2013 however, during an interview with The Madd Hatta Morning Show on 97.9 Box FM, Rowland revealed that the album had been pushed back to June 18, 2013 The album was made available to pre-order on May 21, 2013, ahead of its June 18, 2013 US release. In August 2013, vocal producer Lonny Bereal said that Rowland was working on new music, including songs produced by Bereal, for a re-release of Talk a Good Game. In March 2014, Rowland confirmed that she had left Republic Records in search of a [...] "fresh start" [...] and that she had already begun work on her next studio album, signalling the end of the Talk a Good Game era.|$|E
