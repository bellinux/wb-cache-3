5|$|The new CSG International grew quickly. The {{convergence}} of phone, internet, on-demand movies, {{and other services}} created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.

However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} international {{experience with the}} assignments <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> sources to different levels of government, the public finance literature still lacks a general theory <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments. Two sets of arguments have been separately developed in the literature to explain and guide the practice <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments. The first is based on Musgrave and Oates’ tradition, and emphasizes the benefit principle and other means for increasing accountability and efficiency in the allocation of public expenditures. The second is based on optimal taxation principles, which emphasizes the marginal cost of public funds and the correct mix <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> instruments. The two approaches provide important insights to the problem, but they remain practically unconnected. This paper develops a theory <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments that integrates the two approaches. We discuss the validity and scope <b>of</b> currently applied <b>revenue</b> assignment rules, and provide practical recommendations to implement an optimal assignment <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> sources...|$|R

5|$|In medieval England {{there was}} no clear {{separation}} between the king's household and the treasury. The main sources of royal income were the royal estates, feudal rights (such as feudal aids or feudal reliefs, which derived from the king's position as a feudal overlord), taxation, and fees and other profits from the judicial courts. In 1130, the records <b>of</b> <b>revenues</b> paid into the treasury show that about 40% came from royal estates, 16% from feudal rights, 14% from taxes, and 12% from the judicial courts.

5|$|The {{government}} of the diocese affecting both clergy and laity was vested entirely in the bishop, who appointed officers to the ecclesiastical, criminal and civil courts. The bishop, assisted by his chapter, produced the church laws and regulations for the bishopric and these were enforced at occasional diocesan synods by the bishop or, in his absence, by the dean. Appointed officials adjudicated at consistory courts looking at matters affecting tithes, marriages, divorces, widows, orphans, wills and other related legal matters. In Moray, these courts were held in Elgin and Inverness. By 1452 the Bishop of Moray held all his lands in one regality and had Courts of Regality presided over by Bailiffs and Deputies to ensure the payment <b>of</b> <b>revenues</b> from his estates.|$|E

5|$|When Missouri {{became a}} state in 1821, St. Louis County was created from the {{boundaries}} of the former St. Louis subdistrict of the Missouri Territory; St. Louis city existed within the county but was not coterminous with it. Starting in the 1850s, rural county voters began to exert political influence over questions of taxation in the St. Louis County court. In 1867, the county court was given power to assess and collect property tax revenue from St. Louis city property, providing a financial boon to the county government while depriving city government <b>of</b> <b>revenues.</b> After this power transfer, St. Louisans in the city began to favor one of three options: greater representation on the county court via charter changes, citycounty consolidation, or urban secession to form an independent city.|$|E
