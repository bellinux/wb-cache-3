50|$|The carbon {{source for}} the CVD of VANTAs is most {{commonly}} a carbon gas such as methane, ethylene, acetylene, benzene, xylene, or carbon monoxide. Other examples of carbon precursors include cyclohexane, fullerene, methanol, and ethanol. The pyrolysis of these gases into carbon atoms varies based on the decomposition rate at growth temperatures, the carbon content of the gas molecules, and the growth catalyst. Linear hydrocarbons such as methane, ethylene, acetylene, thermally decompose into atomic carbons or linear dimers/trimers of carbon, and generally produce straight and hollow CNTs. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as benzene, xylene, cyclohexane, fullerene, produce relatively curved/hunched CNTs with the tube walls often bridged inside. Aligned arrays of MWNTs have been synthesized through the catalytic decomposition of ferrocene-xylene precursor mixture onto quartz substrates at atmospheric pressure and relatively low temperature (~675 °C).|$|R

The primary {{site of the}} toxic action is {{probably}} the cytoplasmic membrane, but the mechanism of the toxicity is still poorly understood. The effects of <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were studied in liposomes prepared from Escherichia coli phospholipids. The membrane-buffer partition coefficients of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> revealed that these lipophilic compounds preferentially reside in the membrane. The partition coefficients closely correlated with the partition coefficients of these compounds in a standard octanol-water system. The accumulation of hydro carbon molecules resulted in swelling of the membrane bilayer, as assessed by the release of fluorescence self-quenching of fluorescent fatty acid and phospholipid analogs. Parallel {{to the expansion of}} the membrane, an increase in membrane fluidity was observed. These effects on the integrity of the membrane caused an increased passive flux of protons and carboxyfluorescein. In cytochrome c oxidase containing proteoliposomes, both components of the proton motive force, the pH gradient and the electrical potential, were dissipated with increasing concentrations of <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The dissipating effect was primarily the result of an increased permeability of the membrane for protons (ions). At higher concentrations, cytochrome c oxidase was also inactivated. The effective concentrations of the different <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> correlated with their partition coefficients between the membrane and aqueous phase. The impairment of microbial activity by the <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> most likely results from hydrophobic interaction with the membrane, which affects the functioning of the membrane and membrane-embedded proteins...|$|R

40|$|The {{interactions}} of various acyclic and <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in both saturated and unsaturated forms with the carbon nanostructures (CNSs) have been explored by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Model systems representing armchair and zigzag carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene {{have been considered}} to investigate the effect of chirality and curvature of the CNSs towards these interactions. Results of this study reveal contrasting binding nature of the acyclic and <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> towards CNSs. While the saturated molecules show stronger binding affinity in acyclic hydrocarbons; the unsaturated molecules exhibit higher binding affinity in <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> In addition, acyclic hydrocarbons exhibit stronger binding affinity towards the CNSs when compared to their corresponding cyclic counterparts.

40|$|Bio-oil is {{composed}} of 200 types of different organic compounds. It contains substantial amount of water. Bio-oil is difficult to use as transportation fuel. Thus bio oil can be separated into different high value and low volume compounds and low value and high volume compounds. The high value fraction {{can be used as}} chemicals and high volume fraction {{can be used as a}} fuel and the mode of this application can make bio-oil more competitive to the conventional fuel. Fractional distillation has been used in this work to separate the different groups of chemicals depending on the boiling point range. The groups of chemicals have been collected by using fractionation column with 10 plates. The rest of the liquid can be considered as tar and utilized for bio-plastic production. Each of the fractions was analyzed to determine the constituent compound by using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. Compounds were considered in eleven main groups: acids, esters, linear aldehydes and ketones, cyclic ketones, furans, alcohols, sugar, phenols, <b>other</b> oxygenated <b>cyclic</b> compounds, <b>hydrocarbons,</b> ethers and nitrogen containing compounds. The effect of distillation temperature on physical and chemical characterization of each bio-oil fraction was investigated.

40|$|Great deal of {{research}} has shown that catalytic and non-catalytic thermal decomposition (pyrolysis and oxidation) of chlorinated alkanes and alkenes results in the formation of heavier cyclic chlorinated pollutants. Central to these processes is the Diels-Alder addition/cyclisation of small chlorinated carbon chains and the successive replacement of hydrogen atoms in cyclic compounds by chlorine atoms at high temperatures. Polychlorinated benzenes, dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) are formed during the heterogeneous reactions of propene on fly-ash in the presence of air and HCl between 623 - 673 K. Formation of PCDD/F from thermal oxidation of polychlorinated phenol has been demonstrated to proceed at a rate 100 times faster than the competing de novo pathway. High temperature pyrolysis of 1, 3 -hexachlorobutadiene concludes in the production of hexachlorobenzene (C 6 Cl 6) and <b>other</b> highly chlorinated <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Along the same line of enquiry, experimental results have explained that unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as acetylene are readily converted to hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorobutadiene and other heavier perchlorinated species in the presence of cupric oxide and HCl under post combustion conditions. Taylor et al. observed the pyrolysis of hexachloropropene to occur readily, even at temperatures as low as 700 K to yield CCl 4, C 2 Cl 4, C 2 Cl 6 and C 3 Cl 4 (tetrachloroallene). At higher temperatures (up to 1223 K), distinct molecular growth was observed with reaction products including C 4 Cl 6 (1, 3 -hexachlorobutadiene), C 6 Cl 6 (hexachlorobenzene), C 6 Cl 8 (1, 3, 5 -octachlorohexatriene), C 8 Cl 8 (octachlorostyrene), possible other isomers of C 6 Cl 8, C 8 Cl 8 and four isomers of C 12 Cl 8. Cl displacement of CCl 3 radicals was observed to be the overriding origination pathway for conversion of C 3 Cl 6 into C 2 Cl 4, CCl 4 and C 2 Cl 6.
