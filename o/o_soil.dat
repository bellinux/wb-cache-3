40|$|Dynamic soil {{hydrology}} triggers important {{shifts in}} soil biogeochemical and physical processes that control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. <b>Soil</b> oxygen (<b>O</b> 2), a direct control on biogenic GHG production (e. g. nitrous oxide-N 2 O, carbon dioxide-CO 2 and methane-CH 4), {{may serve as}} both an important proxy for determining sudden shifts in subsurface biogenic GHG production {{as well as the}} physical transport of soil GHG to the atmosphere. Recent technological advancements offer opportunities to link in-situ, near-continuous measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>O</b> 2 concentration to soil biogeochemical processes and soil gas transport. Using high frequency data, this study asked: Do <b>soil</b> <b>O</b> 2 dynamics correspond to soil GHG concentration and GHG surface flux? Change in subsurface CO 2 and N 2 O concentrations were inversely related to short-term (3 ̆c 48 hrs) change in <b>soil</b> <b>O</b> 2 concentration at 10 and 20 cm whereas CH 4 concentrations did not change in response to <b>soil</b> <b>O</b> 2 dynamics.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to explore the {{relationship}} between the functional diversity pattern of soil bacteria and the vegetation diversity and structure in temperate forests (Poland). Pine-dominated forests occur on soils with lower pH, fewer nutrient contents (P, Na, Mg, Mn and K) and higher C/N and C/P ratios than beech-dominated forests and mixed broadleaved forest with hornbeam and ash. Both forest type and soil horizon (O and A) strongly influenced bacterial catabolic activity and the number of substrates decayed on Biolog® ECO plates. Pine forest soil bacteria were less active and less functionally diverse than those in deciduous forest soils. The community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) were dissimilar (one-way analysis of similarities) between pine and mixed deciduous forests, but only in the <b>O</b> <b>soil</b> horizon. Carboxylic acids primarily contributed to the average dissimilarity in CLPP between forests (the similarity percentage procedure); these substrates are preferentially used by pine forest soil bacteria.

40|$|Abstract. Recently developed, {{relatively}} low-cost, ECH 2 <b>O</b> <b>soil</b> moisture sensors have re-ceived {{considerable attention}} by both laboratory and field scientists. For these sensors to be in-stalled properly, the sampling volume {{that defines the}} volume of soil zone where the soil mois-ture affects the sensor readings has to be known. These dielectric sensors comprise plus and ground prongs, where {{the sensitivity of the}} plus prong is higher than that of the ground prong. Moreover, the sensor head in which the circuitry is embedded has some sensitivity. It is not straightforward to incorporate these characteristics into numerical quantification of the sampling volume that is often used for conventional TDR probes. Therefore, we re-visited a “classic” experimental approach for quantifying the bulk sampling volume of these sensors. We obtained sensor readings under varying distances between the sensor and a water-air interface, and de-termined the bulk sampling volume when the sensor readings start to show an “abrupt ” change. Firstly, we tested two TDR probes (CS- 640 and CS- 630, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) and showed that the experimental procedure yielded results that were consistent with the previous findings.

Undisturbed soil samples taken in September 2005 and February 2006 were incubated under laboratory conditions for 10 days. The N 2 <b>O</b> emission of <b>soils</b> taken in September 2005 varied from 50 to 1, 095 mu g N kg(- 1) dry soil. The N 2 <b>O</b> emissions of <b>soils</b> from the RT fields taken in September 2005 were statistically (P 0. 05) higher or comparable than the N 2 O emissions from their respective CT soil.

40|$|Aims The δ 18 <b>O</b> of <b>soil</b> {{evaporation}} (δE) is {{an important}} factor controlling the variations of atmospheric δ 18 O (δv), and {{it is also one of}} the key challenges of partitioning evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration components. δE is mostly simulated by the Craig-Gordon model, which is constrained by the δv of water vapor, the relative humidity (h), the equilibrium and kinetic factors and the δ 18 <b>O</b> of <b>soil</b> water (δs) at the evaporating front. Our objective is to investigate the diurnal variations of δE and factors affecting it. Methods We determined the δ 18 O of water vapor in a winter wheat-summer maize cropland based on the in-situ and continuous water vapor isotope ratio measurement system. We sampled soil water at different depths and analyzed it using the cryogenic vacuum distillation technique to acquire the δ 18 <b>O</b> of <b>soil</b> water at the evaporating front. Important findings During the growing period of winter wheat-summer maize, the diurnal variation of δE exhibited a bimodal pattern with peaks at 6 : 00 and 15 : 00. The h has a significant effect on the diurnal variation of δE in cropland ecosystems, and causes the Craig-Gordon model to be invalid under high humidity condition of h > 95 %. The in-situ and high resolution measurement of δv overcomes the uncertainty of using the local precipitation equilibrium method to evaluate δv, which improves the accuracy of δE. Different equilibrium factors have no significant influence on the accuracy of δE. Different kinetic factors, especially the canopy scale kinetic factor, influence the accuracy of δE significantly. The location of the evaporating front determines the h normalized to soil temperatureand the δ 18 <b>O</b> of <b>soil</b> water directly and also influences the accuracy of δE significantly.

40|$|There are {{increasing}} {{concerns about the}} ecological footprint of global animal production. Expanding livestock sectors worldwide contribute to expansion of agricultural land and associated deforestation, {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHG), eutrophication of surface waters and nutrient imbalances. Farm based studies indicate that there are large differences among farms in animal productivity and environmental performance. Here, we report on regional variations in dairy, beef, pork, poultry and egg production, and related GHG emissions in the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU- 27), based on 2003 – 2005 data. Analyses were made with the MITERRA-Europe model which calculates annual nutrient flows and GHG emissions from agriculture in the EU- 27. Main input data were derived from CAPRI (i. e., crop areas, livestock distribution, feed inputs), GAINS (i. e., animal numbers, excretion factors, NH 3 emission factors), FAO statistics (i. e., crop yields, fertilizer consumption, animal production) and IPCC (i. e., CH 4, N 2 O, CO 2 emission factors). Sources of GHG emissions included were enteric fermentation, manure management, direct and indirect N 2 <b>O</b> <b>soil</b> emissions, cultivation of organic soils, liming, fossil fuel use and fertilizer production. The dairy sector had the highest GHG emission in the EU- 27, with annual emission of 195 Tg CO 2 -eq, followed by the beef sector with 192 Tg CO 2 -eq. Enteric fermentation was the main source of GHG emissions in the European livestock sector (36 %) followed by N 2 <b>O</b> <b>soil</b> emissions (28 %). On a per kg product basis, beef had by far the highest GHG emission with 22. 6 kg CO 2 -eq/kg, milk had an emission of 1. 3 kg CO 2 -eq/kg, pork 3. 5 kg CO 2 -eq/kg, poultry 1. 6 kg CO 2 -eq/kg, and eggs 1. 7 kg CO 2 -eq/kg. However large variations in GHG emissions per unit product exist among EU countries, which are due to differences in animal production systems, feed types and nutrient use efficiencies. There are, however, substantial uncertainties in the base data and applied methodology such as assumptions surrounding allocation of feeds to livestock species. Our results provide insight into differences in GHG sources and emissions among animal production sectors for the various regions of Europe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Thick calcrete {{profiles}} {{occur in}} the Late Devonian-early Carboniferous Kinnesswood Formation of the Midland Valley of Scotland. These profiles consist of highly brecciated peloidal and coated grain fabrics with laminar calcrete horizons and linings to fractures. The profiles resemble supermature calcretes associated with late Cenozoic surfaces in the southwestern United States and reflect pedogenesis over periods of several hundred thousand years or more. The possible origins of the highly complex fabrics een are reviewed and the polygenetic nature of such profiles is stressed. It is suggested that brecciation takes place co-incident with subaerial exposure of the calcrete. Mature profiles may be predisposed to brecciation and surficial weathering because of their susceptibility <b>o</b> <b>soil</b> erosion {{as a result of}} changes in vegetation cover. The calcretes underwent phreatic ementation, burial dolomitization and silicification. Pedogenic alcretes, i. e. secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate in soil profiles, are relatively common in alluvial sequences in the geological record.

This paper investigates the potential for using nitrate (NO 3 −) ion selective electrodes (ISEs) and dual wavelength UV spectroscopy as part of a rapid soil NO 3 − diagnostic test. Three soil types, representing the major soil types for agriculture in the western UK, were tested. For the three soils, the ISE rapid test procedure gave a near 1 : 1 response (r 2 = 0. 978, 0. 968, 0. 989) compared to the internationally-approved standard laboratory method. However, the accuracy of the ISE rapid test was reduced at low soil NO 3 − concentrations (< 10 mg NO 3 − L− 1). We also show that NO 3 − analysis of H 2 <b>O</b> <b>soil</b> extracts by dual wavelength UV spectroscopy was also highly correlated (r 2 = 0. 978, 0. 983, 0. 991) to the standard laboratory method.

Barriers to use of these field-based assessment tools include, farmer perception of cost-benefit, general attitude to new technologies and the ability to generate useful fertiliser use strategies from soil NO 3 − measurements...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} {{the environmental impact of}} lead (Pb) in shooting range soils, Pb levels in three berm soils were characterized via size distribution, total Pb concentration, water-soluble Pb, sequential extraction and X-ray diffraction (XRD). About 60 % of the mid-berm soils of ranges G and O existed in grain sizes between 0. 5 and 0. 25 mm (medium sand) while range-L was most abundant in the 0. 25 – 0. 106 mm (fine sand) size fraction. All three range soils had the most accumulation of lead (60 – 70 %) in the very coarse sand size (2. 0 – 1. 0 mm). In ranges G and L, the index shows a decreasing Pb enrichment with decreasing particle size, which may be a result of bullet fragmentation and abrasion in shooting range soils. Sequential extractions reveal that ranges G and L had the highest proportion of Pb bound to organic matter while range-O was dominated by the carbonate-bound fraction. However, a substantial proportion (one-third) of Pb in soil from the three shooting ranges was associated with carbonates. The XRD result revealed the dominance of carbonates in range-O soil, calcite in range-G soil and metallic lead in ranges G and <b>O</b> <b>soil.</b> The conversion of metallic lead to carbonates may be a mechanism for natural attenuation of lead in shooting range soils. Implications for remediation of shooting range soils are further discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of photosynthesis and soil respiration to net land–atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO 2) exchange {{can be estimated}} based on the differential influence of leaves and soils on budgets of the oxygen isotope composition (δ 18 O) of atmospheric CO 2. To do so, the activity of carbonic anhydrases (CAs), a group of enzymes that catalyse the hydration of CO 2 in soils and plants, needs to be understood. Measurements of soil CA activity typically involve the inversion of models describing the δ 18 O of CO 2 fluxes to solve for the apparent, potentially catalysed, rate of CO 2 hydration. This requires information about the δ 18 O of CO 2 in isotopic equilibrium with soil water, typically obtained from destructive, depth-resolved sampling and extraction of soil water. In doing so, an assumption is made about the soil water pool that CO 2 interacts with, which may bias estimates of CA activity if incorrect. Furthermore, this can represent a significant challenge in data collection given the potential for spatial and temporal variability in the δ 18 <b>O</b> of <b>soil</b> water and limited a priori information {{with respect to the}} appropriate sampling resolution and depth. We investigated whether we could circumvent this requirement by inferring the rate of CO 2 hydration and the δ 18 <b>O</b> of <b>soil</b> water from the relationship between the δ 18 O of CO 2 fluxes and the δ 18 O of CO 2 at the soil surface measured at different ambient CO 2 conditions. This approach was tested through laboratory incubations of air-dried soils that were re-wetted with three waters of different δ 18 O. Gas exchange measurements were made on these soils to estimate the rate of hydration and the δ 18 <b>O</b> of <b>soil</b> water, followed by soil water extraction to allow for comparison. Estimated rates of CO 2 hydration were 6. 8 – 14. 6 times greater than the theoretical uncatalysed rate of hydration, indicating that CA were active in these soils. Importantly, these estimates were not significantly different among water treatments, suggesting that this represents a robust approach to assay the activity of CA in soil. As expected, estimates of the δ 18 <b>O</b> of the <b>soil</b> water that equilibrates with CO 2 varied in response to alteration to the δ 18 <b>O</b> of <b>soil</b> water. However, these estimates were consistently more negative than the composition of the soil water extracted by cryogenic vacuum distillation {{at the end of the}} gas measurements with differences of up to − 3. 94  ‰ VSMOW–SLAP. These offsets suggest that, at least at lower water contents, CO 2 –H 2 O isotope equilibration primarily occurs with water pools that are bound to particle surfaces and are depleted in 18 O compared to bulk soil water...|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} above, new <b>soil</b> <b>O</b> 2 sensors or {{models can}} be used as temporal scaling tools if they can depict hot moments of activity driven by rainfall events or events such as snowmelt or litterfall. These dynamics are likely complex, however, as <b>soil</b> <b>O</b> 2 is strongly affected by soil moisture, which inhibits diffusion of O 2 into the soil, but also by soil respiration, which consumes O 2 (Liptzin et al. 2011; Silver et al. 1999). However, new ecohydrological models have the potential to model the presence of wet areas in the landscape as well as the biogeochemical processes that drive soil respiration (Butterbach-Bahl et al. 2004; Tague 2009).|$|R
