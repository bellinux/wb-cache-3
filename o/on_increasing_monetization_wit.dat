A theoretically sound framework {{that can be used}} to examine the various modes that malware suppliers use to produce and sell malware is needed. We apply a general model specified recently by Hagiu and Wright to study five modes that malware suppliers use to deliver goods and services to their customers. The framework presented in this article can be used to predict the mode in which a malware supplier will function; to study which types of malware suppliers, agents, and customers are attracted to each mode; to discover new modes; and to better understand the threat a malware supplier presents...|$|R
40|$|The {{main body}} of {{research}} within climate-change induced migration has focused on displacement migration. The "sinking islands" reference {{is often used to}} describe island states being in the forefront of climate change impacts, and their inhabitants at risk of becoming the first climate change refugees in history. The aim of this thesis is to understand what circumstances are needed for Kiribati’s ‘Migration with Dignity’ concept to enhance the adaptive capacity of livelihoods. By using the Sustainable Livelihood Approach this thesis examines what impacts climate change has on different aspects of livelihoods in Kiribati. This study uses a case study approach. Data has been collected through 14 semi-structured interviews during an eight weeks long minor field study on the capital atoll South Tarawa. While Kiribati faces many development challenges, being a least developed country with a rent-based economy, climate change puts additional strains on the country’s capacities to cope with the <b>increasing</b> <b>monetization</b> and urbanisation, and abilities to satisfy the growing population’s aspirations. The empirical evidence shows a need among the population to find education and skilled wage employment. Harmonisation between migration, development and adaptation policies can increase livelihoods’ economic conditions and abilities to cope with climate change-related stresses, especially for future generations...|$|R
40|$|Classic {{accounts}} of the English industrial revolution present {{a long period of}} stagnation followed by a fast take-off. This picture has been adopted by models of the unified growth theory school (Galor 2005, 2009) and seems to be confirmed by the real wage data of economic historians (Phelps-Brown 1956, Robert Allen 2001 and Gregory Clark 2005, 2007). However, recent GDP data (as well as earlier evidence from historians of material culture) suggest this is a historically inaccurate portrait of early modern England. Slow but steady per capita economic growth preceded the transition. The changes were in part driven by specialization and structural change accompanied by an increase in market participation at both the intensive and extensive levels. These, I suggest, were supported by the gradual increase in money supply made possible by the discovery and exploitation of rich mines of precious metals in America. They allowed for a substantial <b>increase</b> in the <b>monetization</b> and liquidity levels of the economy, hence decreasing transaction costs, increasing market "thickness", changing the relative incentive for participating in the market, and allowing for agglomeration economies. By making trade with Asia possible, they also induced demand for new desirable goods, which in turn encouraged market participation at both the intensive and extensive levels. Finally, the <b>increased</b> <b>monetization</b> and market participation made it easier for governments to collect taxes, helping build up fiscal capacity and as a consequence provide for public goods. The structural change and market participation that ensued helped pave the way to modernization, hence transforming a level effect on a growth effect. The conclusion {{is that we need to}} pay closer attention to monetary developments and the avoidance of deflationary forces as critical preconditions for the emergence of modern economic growth...|$|R
30|$|The {{parallel}} economy {{refers to}} the pastoral economy of the hinterland {{that has yet to}} be, or may not be, integrated into the emerging non-traditional economic sector. Paradoxically, rural Soqotrans who were not nomadic seem to have become nomadic, or at least compulsively peripatetic, in their manic attempts to make ends meet in the current economic context. This is partly an imposition of the seasonal rhythm that economic activities on the island must inexorably mimic, {{but it is also a}} need created by dependence on non-pastoral food items and the ripple effects of the <b>increasing</b> <b>monetization</b> of the rural economy. Accordingly, rural Soqotrans whatever their ecological niches or primary means of livelihood are, by necessity, multiple livelihood pursuers animated by a chronic economic opportunism in quest of cash. This opportunistic pursuit takes the form of a kind of economic vagrancy compelled by the intrinsic insufficiencies of their subsistence livelihoods, caused by environmental conditions as well as an economic situation describable in the nomenclature of scarcity: a chronic precariousness of environmental resources (e.g., water and pasture), and seasonally variable exchange rate between pastoral by-products and the food basket made up almost entirely of imported items. The only available recourse is to be on the constant lookout for remunerative activities (e.g., odd jobs especially in the construction boom in Hadiboh town) that depend on the seasonal cycle.|$|R
30|$|This circumstantially imposed ascetic ethos, or put differently, this chronic {{involuntary}} frugality, {{seems to}} have induced a levelling of expectations, as if a form of social resignation has set in, induced by the inability to envision {{a way out of}} the eternal pendulum swing from a hand to mouth existence in the pastoral hinterland. There is a recognition of living under conditions of relative deprivation, but it has not mutated into a self-awareness of poverty as a defining self-concept. However, with the <b>increasing</b> <b>monetization</b> of the economy, and the resulting socio-economic differentiation within the population, poverty may well become a self-defining notion. Indeed, by established standards of poverty, Soqotran pastoralists emblematize socio-economic deprivation. Yet they are not begging in the streets of Hadiboh. In this regard, Sahlins' observation seems pertinent to the Soqotran situation: they may `have few possessions, but they are not poor. Poverty is not a certain small amount of goods, nor is it just a relation between means and ends; above all it is a relation between people. Poverty is a social status' (quoted in Fried [1975]: 44). This is echoed in Botting's remark that `On the island where almost everybody is poor, and there are as yet no foreign standards to shame and disturb them, poverty is accepted without degradation' (Botting [1958]: 77). It is perhaps a blessing in disguise that the UN interventions on the island have been under the banner of environmental protection and biodiversity conservation and not under that of poverty alleviation, which could have suggested itself as the `paradigm of self-definition'. The latter would have engendered the construction of underdeveloped subjectivities among Soqotrans, as they sought to accommodate themselves to the signifiers of poverty and the accompanying plethora of deficiencies that such a paradigm privileges in its discourse, in order to obtain assistance from UN projects. This would have generated an incentive among Soqotrans to appropriate poverty as a self-defining concept, which, in turn, would have entailed a communal submission to an `abstract universal measure of underconsumption' (Illich [1992]: 94).|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the link between global trade and economic development in the early modern period. Newly gathered price data on the Dutch-Asiatic trade suggests that commodity markets in Europe and Asia became more integrated over {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. This market integration was made possible by reductions in transport cost and increased maritime competition, but was significantly affected by differences in the VOCs ability to control commodity markets. Where commodities were traded between competitive markets, price convergence took place. In many of the purchasing markets, prices were not (only) determined by supply and demand, but were set by long-term contracts or influenced by the VOCs complete control over production and trade. In order to investigate the consequences of this ‘globalization’, new demographic, wage and price data were gathered in the VOC archives for different colonies around the Indian Ocean: Bengal, the Cape Colony, Ceylon and Java. These data suggest that living standards, as measured by real wages, were significantly below the levels in England and the Dutch Republic, but on similar levels as other parts of Asia and the lagging parts of Europe. The developments in living standards in these areas were partly determined by local conditions and partly by global developments. Demography, agricultural productivity and systems of labour coercion significantly influenced the developments in real wages. The rise in global trade may have led to <b>increased</b> <b>monetization</b> and commercialization in these societies. But the effects of globalization, and the related colonialism, were heterogeneous and could differ across and between regions, as well as between different population groups. While some peoples could have benefitted from larger global demand and employment opportunities, others suffered from increased labour coercion. It is concluded that colonialism and globalization affected patterns of economic development across the globe and thus {{played an important role in}} the rise in economic inequality between the ‘West’ and the ‘Rest’, or Great Divergence, in the early modern period...|$|R
