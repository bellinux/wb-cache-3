25|$|The SportStar is an {{all-metal}} design {{made from}} anodized, corrosion-proofed aluminum. The airframe uses a pop-riveted and bonded construction, {{which the company}} claims will improve fatigue characteristics and result in a longer service life. The company also claims this construction technique results in better crashworthiness, the elimination of rivet zippering in an accident and quieter in-flight noise levels due to the elimination of <b>oil-canning</b> and flexing.|$|E
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{basis for}} the design of a new process to form sheet metal into a flat, corrugated product is described. The underlying principle is to determine a surface between entry of the sheet into the device and the exit of the formed product such that all points across the width of the sheet under go as nearly as possible similar deformation histories and also that longitudinal strain in the sheet is minimized. The surface for forming a product having a sinusoidal profile and also that for a trapezoidal profile are presented as examples. For the sinusoidal product, an empirical equation is developed that relates the strain during forming with the initial and final width, the forming length and the number of profile segments. A physical model shows that a sheet can be formed to such a surface without straining or buckling. Although this paper does not describe the type of tooling or forming machine that would be used to plastically deform steel sheet, the authors believe such a device can be constructed. The results suggest that the new approach would reduce defects such as edge-wave, <b>oil-canning</b> and splitting and that the overall length of the forming device could be an order of magnitude smaller than that for existing roll-forming lines.

6000|$|The Tin Woodman {{had asked}} Dorothy {{to put the}} <b>oil-can</b> in her basket. [...] "For," [...] he said, [...] "if I should {{get caught in the}} rain, and rust again, I would need the <b>oil-can</b> badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get an <b>oil-can</b> and oil my joints," [...] he answered. [...] "They are rusted {{so badly}} that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again. You will find an <b>oil-can</b> on a shelf in my cottage." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dorothy at once {{ran back}} to the cottage and found the <b>oil-can,</b> and then she {{returned}} and asked anxiously, [...] "Where are your joints?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you see he's rusted, just as {{you were}} once?" [...] asked Polychrome, {{laughing}} again. [...] "Here, Nick Chopper, lend me your <b>oil-can</b> a minute!" ...|$|R
60|$|Woot {{seized the}} <b>oil-can</b> and did this, {{but all the}} others helped wiggle the soldier's joints {{as soon as they}} were oiled, until they moved freely.|$|R
6000|$|The Tin Woodman silently {{handed her}} his <b>oil-can,</b> without {{which he never}} traveled, and Polychrome first oiled the stranger's tin jaws and then worked them gently to and fro until the Tin Soldier said: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{thought so}} long that the tin man grew tired and tried to change his position, but found his joints had already rusted so badly {{that he could not}} move them. And his <b>oil-can</b> was back in the boat.|$|R
6000|$|His {{hand was}} on the lever laid, [...] His <b>oil-can</b> soothed the {{worrying}} cranks, [...] His whistle waked the snowbound grade, [...] His fog-horn cut the reeking Banks; [...] In dock and deep and mine and mill [...] The Boy-god reckless laboured still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Horroo! me hearty, ye're as clain as a lady's watch," [...] exclaimed {{a man of}} rugged form but {{pleasant}} countenance, as {{he issued}} from the small doorway of the lantern-house with a bundle of waste {{in one hand and}} an <b>oil-can</b> in the other.|$|R
60|$|They {{tore off}} the wings, {{for which they}} had no further use, and the Wizard piled them in a heap just outside the {{entrance}} to the cavern. Then he poured over them all the kerosene oil that was left in his <b>oil-can,</b> and lighting a match set fire to the pile.|$|R
6000|$|... "With pleasure," [...] she answered, {{and brought}} a towel at once. Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears {{carefully}} and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled <b>oil-can,</b> to guard against mishap.|$|R
60|$|The Tin Woodman {{looked around}} him in a puzzled way, for the Saw-Horse had until now {{remained}} quietly standing in a corner, where the Emperor had not noticed him. Tip immediately called the odd-looking creature to them, and it approached so awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful center-table and the engraved <b>oil-can.</b>|$|R
60|$|His necessities supplied, Derick departed; {{but he had}} not gained his ship's side, when whales {{were almost}} {{simultaneously}} raised from the mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that without pausing to put his <b>oil-can</b> and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.|$|R
60|$|The Emperor of the Winkies {{paused in}} {{his story to}} reach for an <b>oil-can,</b> with which he {{carefully}} oiled the joints in his tin throat, for his voice had begun to squeak a little. Woot the Wanderer, having satisfied his hunger, watched this oiling process with much curiosity, but begged the Tin Man {{to go on with}} his tale.|$|R
6000|$|At once an <b>oil-can</b> {{appeared}} before him, held {{on a level}} with his eyes by some unseen hand. Shaggy took the can and tried to oil Tik-Tok's joints. As if to assist him, a strong current of warm air was directed against the copper man which quickly dried him. Soon {{he was able to}} say [...] "Ma-ny thanks!" [...] quite smoothly and his joints worked fairly well.|$|R
60|$|The {{preparations}} {{made for}} this important journey were very simple. A knapsack {{was filled with}} food and given Woot the Wanderer to carry upon his back, for the food was for his use alone. The Tin Woodman shouldered an axe which was sharp and brightly polished, and the Scarecrow put the Emperor's <b>oil-can</b> in his pocket, that he might oil his friend's joints should they need it.|$|R
50|$|While {{brothers}} Adam and Shaun Lee {{were visiting}} their hometown of Johannesburg, South Africa, Shaun saw {{many of the}} street musicians using unconventional materials to create music. While he {{was impressed with the}} musician’s ingenuity and resourcefulness, he especially appreciated the sound quality of the <b>oil-can</b> guitar. When he arrived back in the U.S., he started building his own oil can and lunchbox guitars out of completely recycled materials in his parents’ basement in Marietta, Georgia.|$|R
60|$|Gur Sahai {{grinned and}} nodded, {{with his right}} hand upon the lever and an <b>oil-can</b> in his left. He could do no more than he was doing, but he could keep that up till the dawn. Were the Company's pumps to be beaten by the vagaries of that {{troublesome}} Tarachunda River? Never, never! And the pumps sobbed and panted: 'Never, never!' The Manager sat in the shelter of the pit-bank roofing, trying to dry himself by the pump-boiler fire, and, in the dreary dusk, he saw the crowds on the dam scatter and fly.|$|R
60|$|Together {{they ran}} to the river bank, but the boat was {{floating}} in midstream and the Wizard was obliged to mumble some magic words to draw it to the bank, so the Scarecrow could get the <b>oil-can.</b> Then back they flew to the tin man, and while the Scarecrow carefully oiled each joint the little Wizard moved the joints gently back and forth until they worked freely. After an hour of this labor the Tin Woodman was again on his feet, and although still a little stiff he managed {{to walk to the}} boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell," [...] was the answer, [...] "for I {{have never}} been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and {{he said it was a}} long journey through a {{dangerous}} country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have my <b>oil-can,</b> and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that will protect you from harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|George said: [...] "I {{should not}} show temper over the matter, if I were you. There {{will come a}} day, perhaps not far distant, when that bicycle, {{with a couple of}} {{mountains}} between it and the nearest repairing shop, will, in spite of your chronic desire for rest, have to be overhauled. Then you will clamour for people to tell you where you put the <b>oil-can,</b> and what you have done with the screw-hammer. Then, while you exert yourself holding the thing steady against a tree, you will suggest that somebody else should clean the chain and pump the back wheel." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gur Sahai {{grinned and}} nodded, {{with his right}} hand upon the lever and an <b>oil-can</b> in his left. He could do no more than he was doing, but he could keep that up till the dawn.

6000|$|... "Castin' down my eyes in despair, I {{happened}} {{to look through}} the crack {{in the bottom of the}} boat, and oh, what a blessed relief it was! for down there everything was smooth and still, and I could see the sand on the bottom, as level and hard, no doubt, as it was on the beach. Suddenly the thought struck me that that bottom would give me the only chance I had of gettin' out of the frightful fix I was in. If I could fill that <b>oil-can</b> with air, and then puttin' it under my arm and takin' a long breath if I could drop down on that smooth bottom, I might run along toward shore, as far as I could, and then, when I felt my breath was givin' out, I could take a pull at the <b>oil-can</b> and take another run, and then take another pull and another run, and perhaps the can would hold air enough for me until I got near enough to shore to wade to dry land. To be sure, the sharks and other monsters were down there, but then they must have been awfully frightened, and perhaps they might not remember that man was their nat'ral enemy. Anyway, I thought it would be better to try the smooth water passage down there than stay and be swallowed up by the ragin' waves on top.|$|R
50|$|Born in Coral Gables, Florida, January 9, 1944 {{and raised}} in Atlanta, Georgia, from the 1960s until the 1980s he {{recorded}} blues musicians such as Jessie Mae Hemphill, Fred McDowell and Johnny Woods, George Henry Bussey and Jim Bunkley, Charlie Burse and Will Shade, Gus Cannon, Mississippi Joe Callicott, John Lee Ziegler, Jimmy Lee Williams, Furry Lewis, Houston Stackhouse, R. L. Burnside and Sleepy John Estes, later to be issued on Arhoolie Records (late 1960s), Revival Records (1971) and Rounder Records (from c. 1975) as 33 rpm albums, on Arhoolie Records (2000) and Fat Possum Records (2003 ff.) as CDs. George Mitchell also plays the blues himself on an <b>oil-can</b> bass.|$|R
60|$|This {{they decided}} to do. The next day they called the Winkies {{together}} and bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick, {{to keep him from}} stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver <b>oil-can,</b> inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.|$|R
60|$|A greasy little cabin it was, suggestive, to {{the sense}} of smell, of a cabin in a Whaler. But there was a bright fire burning in its rusty grate, and on the floor there stood a wooden stand of newly trimmed and lighted lamps, ready for {{carriage}} service. They made a bright show, and their light, and the warmth, accounted for the popularity of the room, as borne witness to by many impressions of velveteen trousers on a form by the fire, and many rounded smears and smudges of stooping velveteen shoulders on the adjacent wall. Various untidy shelves accommodated a quantity of lamps and <b>oil-cans,</b> and also a fragrant collection of what looked like the pocket-handkerchiefs of the whole lamp family.|$|R
60|$|The {{travelers}} were {{at first}} somewhat awed by their surroundings, {{and even the}} Scarecrow seemed impressed as he examined the rich hangings of silver cloth caught up into knots and fastened with tiny silver axes. Upon a handsome center-table stood a large silver <b>oil-can,</b> richly engraved with scenes from the past adventures of the Tin Woodman, Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow: {{the lines of the}} engraving being traced upon the silver in yellow gold. On the walls hung several portraits, that of the Scarecrow seeming to be the most prominent and carefully executed, while a the large painting of the famous Wizard of Oz, in act of presenting the Tin Woodman with a heart, covered almost one entire end of the room.|$|R
6000|$|The firm of Grubb & Smallways, {{formerly}} Grubb, {{had indeed}} been singularly unlucky {{in the last year}} or so. For many years the business had struggled along with a flavour of romantic insecurity in a small, dissolute-looking shop in the High Street, adorned with brilliantly coloured advertisements of cycles, a display of bells, trouser-clips, <b>oil-cans,</b> pump-clips, frame-cases, wallets, and other accessories, and the announcement of [...] "Bicycles on Hire," [...] "Repairs," [...] "Free inflation," [...] "Petrol," [...] and similar attractions. They were agents for several obscure makes of bicycle,--two samples constituted the stock,--and occasionally they effected a sale; they also repaired punctures and did their best--though luck was not always on their side--with any other repairing that was brought to them. They handled a line of cheap gramophones, and did a little with musical boxes.|$|R
60|$|Dark it was, but {{she made}} no mistake, the {{familiar}} sag and screeching reproach of the front gate welcome under her hand. She went along the narrow walk to the rear, avoided the missing step without thinking about it, and entered the kitchen, where a solitary gas-jet flickered. She turned {{it up to the}} best of its flame. It was a small room, not disorderly, because of lack of furnishings to disorder it. The plaster, discolored by the steam of many wash-days, was crisscrossed with cracks from the big earthquake of the previous spring. The floor was ridged, wide-cracked, and uneven, and in front of the stove it was worn through and repaired with a five-gallon <b>oil-can</b> hammered flat and double. A sink, a dirty roller-towel, several chairs, and a wooden table completed the picture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} the hat is variable. Sometimes, {{especially}} in the 13th century, it is a soft Phrygian cap, but rather {{more common in the}} early period is a hat with a round circular brim—apparently stiff—curving round to a tapering top that ends in a point, called the [...] "so-called <b>oil-can</b> type" [...] by Sara Lipton. [...] Smaller versions perching on top of the head are also seen. Sometimes a ring of some sort encircles the hat an inch or two {{over the top of the}} head. In the 14th century a ball or bobble appears at the top of the hat, and the tapering end becomes more of a stalk with a relatively constant width. The top of the hat becomes flatter, or rounded (as in the Codex Manesse picture). The materials used are unclear from art, and may have included metal and woven plant materials as well as stiffened textiles and leather.|$|R
6000|$|The {{three men}} {{in command of}} the machine were set apart as [...] "the threshers."--William and David {{alternately}} [...] "fed" [...] or [...] "tended," [...] that is, one of them [...] "fed" [...] the grain into the howling cylinder while the other, <b>oil-can</b> in hand, watched the sieves, felt of the pinions and so kept the machine in good order. The feeder's position was the high place to which all boys aspired, and on this day I stood in silent admiration of Uncle David's easy powerful attitudes as he caught each bundle in the crook of his arm and spread it out into a broad, smooth band of yellow straw on which the whirling teeth caught and tore with monstrous fury. He was the ideal man in my eyes, grander in some ways than my father, {{and to be able to}} stand where he stood was the highest honor in the world.|$|R
60|$|During {{the rest}} of that day there was no other {{adventure}} to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the <b>oil-can</b> from Dorothy's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.|$|R
6000|$|... "While I was thinkin' and calculatin' a {{perfectly}} dreadful thing happened, {{which made me}} think if I didn't {{get out of this}} pretty soon I'd find myself in a mighty risky predicament. The <b>oil-can,</b> which I had forgotten to put the cork in, toppled over, and before I could grab it every drop of the oil ran into the hind part of the boat, where it was soaked up by a lot of dry dust that was there. No wonder my heart sank when I saw this. Glancin' wildly around me, as people will do when they are scared, I saw the smooth place I was in gettin' smaller and smaller, for the kerosene was evaporatin', as it will do even off woollen clothes if you give it time enough. The first pond I had come out of seemed to be covered up, and the great, towerin', throbbin' precipice of sea-water was a-closin' around me.|$|R
6000|$|... "My body shone so brightly in the {{sun that}} I felt very proud of it {{and it did not}} matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an <b>oil-can</b> in my cottage and took care to oil myself {{whenever}} I needed it. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her." ...|$|R
