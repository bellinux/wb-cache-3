Ever since the famous performances by Sviatoslav Richter, taking the <b>opening</b> movement at an extremely slow pace, similar tempo interpretations for this movement have been frequent. However, the majority of Schubert scholars tend to dismiss such an interpretation, arguing instead for a more flowing pace, a measured allegro.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} use of thin steel C sections with large circular, hexagonal and diamond web <b>openings</b> in applications where service integration in beams is required or where thermal bridging of members crossing the building envelope has to be minimised. The effect of these <b>openings</b> in terms of combined bending and shear effects on stainless steel and thin steel C sections is evaluated. The behaviour of thin steel C sections with large web <b>openings</b> in shear is a new subject and the knowledge gap is mainly concerned with the local buckling around and between <b>openings</b> which affect {{the ability of the}} perforated section to resist shear. Simply supported beams were considered in this research. The main part of the research was divided into various parts as follows: Simple theories were developed for the design of thin steel with circular web <b>openings</b> (Tangential Stress Method) and with hexagonal web <b>openings.</b> The Tangential Stress Method is a method in which the tangential stresses around the web <b>openings</b> are determined {{as a function of the}} applied shear force. A total of 16 tests on pairs of C sections with web <b>openings</b> was carried out. Three groups of beams were tested as follows: 1 -	Stainless steel C sections of 210 mm depth and 70 mm width with 150 mm diameter <b>openings</b> at 50, 100 and 250 mm edge distances were tested. Two groups of stainless steel were tested; Austenitic and Lean Duplex (LDX) grades of 2 and 3 mm thickness. For beams with isolated and widely spaced web <b>openings,</b> Vierendeel bending associated with local buckling was the mode of failure. Beams with closely spaced web <b>openings</b> failed by web-post buckling. 2 -	Galvanized steel sections of 250 mm depth and 63 mm flange width with 150 and 180 mm diameter web <b>openings</b> at 60 and 90 mm edge distances were tested in 1. 5 and 1. 8 mm steel thicknesses. The failure of the C sections with isolated web <b>openings</b> was due to Vierendeel bending associated with local buckling. For closely spaced web <b>openings,</b> the failure was due to web-post buckling and twisting of the top flange. 3 -	Galvanized C sections with diamond and hexagonal web <b>openings</b> were tested to investigate the shape of the web <b>openings</b> effect on the behaviour of the beams subject to shear. The diamond-shaped <b>openings</b> were 180 mm deep and hexagonal <b>openings</b> were 167 mm deep. The failure of beams with isolated diamond-shaped web <b>openings</b> was due to buckling of the un-supported web next to the <b>openings.</b> For the C sections with pairs of <b>openings,</b> it was due to web-post buckling and twisting of the top flange. The bending resistances of the two C sections were then predicted from the parametric study and were compared with the design resistance calculated using section properties to BS EN 1993 - 1 - 3 and BS EN 1993 - 1 - 4. The tangential stresses using the method presented in Chapter 4 were calculated at the failure loads in all tests for beams with circular web <b>openings</b> and compared to the measured steel strengths fy at 0. 2...|$|R
