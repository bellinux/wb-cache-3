5|$|A leader <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> {{is chosen}} by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election to sit in the Assembly. If a leader <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend. Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E
5|$|Burton v. United States is {{the name}} of two appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States by Senator Joseph R. Burton (R-KS) {{following}} his conviction for compensated representation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> in a proceeding in which the United States was interested: Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283 (1905) and Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344 (1906). Burton was convicted of acting as counsel to Rialto Grain and Securities Company in the United States Postmaster General's investigation of Rialto for mail fraud.|$|E

5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> of 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck {{in the head with}} a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Milner-Barry {{fiercely}} {{defended the}} reputation of Gordon Welchman, who had come under posthumous criticism for publishing details about the wartime work of Hut 6. In 1992, echoing his wartime visit to 10 Downing Street, Milner-Barry was a member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> who delivered a petition to the Prime Minister calling on the government to help preserve Bletchley Park, which was then under threat from demolition.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling helium can be {{dangerous}} if done to excess, since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006. In 1998, an Australian girl (her age is not known) from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> balloon.|$|E

5|$|Louis I of Anjou died on 10 September 1384, {{enabling}} his rival, CharlesIII of Naples, {{to stabilize}} his rule in Southern Italy {{during the next}} months. The consolidation of CharlesIII's position in Naples {{also contributed to the}} formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary. John Horvat, Ban of Macsó (now Mačva in Serbia), and his brother, Paul, Bishop of Zagreb, were the leading figures of their movement. Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to persuade the queen mother to consent to his marriage to Mary, but she refused him. He left Hungary in early 1385.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the salami tactics to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians {{cooperated with the}} left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power {{for the next four}} decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E

5|$|At the 3 March 1962 election, Askin led the Coalition {{to another}} defeat to the Labor Party, now under Bob Heffron, {{who had become}} Premier {{following}} Cahill's death in October 1959. Morton retained his seat again with 80.76%. Heffron was Premier until his retirement on 30 April 1964. He was succeeded by Jack Renshaw, whose tenure was {{perceived to be the}} last days <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> which, after almost {{a quarter of a century}} in government, was tired. At the May 1965 election, Askin led the Coalition to its first ever state electoral victory, gaining eight seats and a swing of 5.6% to achieve a majority of two. Askin became the first Liberal Premier. Morton was re-elected with 82.30%.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, John Rae, while {{surveying}} the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), discovered {{further evidence of}} the expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk near Pelly Bay (now Kugaaruk, Nunavut) on 21 April 1854, who told him <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> of 35 to 40white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. In particular, Rae brought from the Inuit several silver forks and spoons later identified as belonging to Franklin, Fitzjames, Crozier, and Robert Osmer Sargent, a shipmate aboard Erebus. Rae's report was sent to the Admiralty, which in October 1854 urged the HBC to send an expedition down the Back River to search for other signs of Franklin and his men.|$|E
5|$|James Clark Ross's 1839–43 Antarctic {{expedition}} in HMS Erebus and HMS Terror was {{a full-scale}} Royal Naval enterprise, the principal function {{of which was}} to test current theories on magnetism, {{and to try to}} locate the South Magnetic Pole. The expedition had first been proposed by leading astronomer Sir John Herschel, and was supported by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Ross had considerable past experience in magnetic observation and Arctic exploration; in May 1831 he had been a member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> that had reached the location of the North Magnetic Pole, and he was an obvious choice as commander.|$|E
50|$|The use of mixed-member {{proportional}} representation allows ready conversion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>partys</b> support into <b>a</b> <b>party</b> vote percentage and therefore <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> seats in Parliament. For {{the purposes of}} the calculation, it is assumed that there is no change to the number of electorate seats each party holds.|$|R
5000|$|Both open-list MMP {{and best}} near-winner MMP award {{compensatory}} seats strictly {{to the most}} popular remaining candidates of each party. Under DMP, one or more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party's</b> most popular candidates might be denied seats if they place 3rd or lower at the district level. If this occurs for all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small <b>party’s</b> candidates who placed above the district threshold, that party will forfeit one or more seats.|$|R

5|$|Over the 1956/57 new year, McCool was one <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> of 12 cricketers, {{all but one}} of them Test players, {{who made}} a brief trip to India to play two {{first-class}} matches in celebration of the silver jubilee of the Bengal Cricket Association in a side raised by the Lancashire secretary Geoffrey Howard. McCool did not play in the first match and in the second, he replaced Jock Livingston, the team's only wicketkeeper, who had been taken ill during the first game. McCool made only 23 and 1 with the bat, but he stumped Vinoo Mankad off the bowling of Dooland, one of only two stumpings in his career as a very occasional wicketkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Summer invites Ryan {{to a party}} {{after the}} show, and Ryan convinces Seth to join him. For the first time, Seth is {{introduced}} to the sex-, drug-, and alcohol-fueled side of Newport. He experiences the wildness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> for the first time, while Ryan flirts with Marissa. Luke takes a girl to the beach. Later at the party, Ryan rebuffs an intoxicated Summer, but Seth misinterprets the encounter and reveals Ryan's real background. Seth walks down the beach, and is bullied {{by a group of}} water polo players that includes Luke. Ryan defends Seth by punching Luke, but Luke's friends intervene and beat up Ryan and Seth. After returning to the Cohens, Ryan sees that Marissa's friends left her passed out on her drive; he carries her to the Cohens' pool house to sleep. When Kirsten finds Seth and Ryan asleep in the pool house the next morning, she is unhappy with Ryan's new influence and insists to Sandy that Ryan leaves. Sandy drives Ryan back to Chino, but when they find his home empty, they return to Newport.|$|E
5|$|The Famicom {{version of}} Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei is a {{traditional}} role-playing video game in which the player takes control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> composed of two humans {{and a number of}} demons. The party explores a large dungeon using a first-person perspective. The human characters use a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. The items, which can range from healing items to different types of currency, are picked up from enemies or found in chests scattered through the dungeon. Weapons and accessories are purchased at different shops found within the dungeon. Progress is saved using a password system.|$|E

5|$|The King {{was related}} by {{marriage}} to the rulers of Great Britain, Russia and Prussia, maintaining a particularly strong attachment to the Prince and Princess of Wales, who visited Athens in 1869. Their visit occurred despite continued lawlessness which culminated in the kidnap <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> of British and Italian tourists, including Lord and Lady Muncaster. Two female hostages, a child and Lord Muncaster were released, but four of the others: British diplomat E. H. C. Herbert (the first cousin of Lord Carnarvon), Frederick Vyner (the brother-in-law of Lord Ripon, Lord President of the Council), Italian diplomat Count Boyl di Putifigari, and Mr. Lloyd (an engineer) were murdered. George's relationships with other ruling houses assisted him and his small country but also often put them {{at the center of}} national political struggles in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The current Basque {{coat of arms}} (Spanish: Escudo del País Vasco, Basque: Euskal autonomi erkidegoaren armarria) is the {{official}} coat of arms of the Basque Country, Autonomous community of Spain. It consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> per cross representing the three historical territories of Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, {{as well as a}} fourth, void quarter. The arms are ringed by a regal wreath of oak leaves, symbolic of the Gernikako Arbola. The fourth quarter constituted since the late 19th century the linked chains of Navarre; however, following a legal suit by the Navarre Government claiming that the usage of the arms of a region on the flag of another was illegal, the Constitutional Court of Spain ordered the removal of the chains of Navarre in a judgement of 1986.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga Episode III is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} where players take control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> of characters; {{during the game}} they explore a variety of environments from towns and cities to dungeons. During {{the course of the}} game, a Database is filled out which holds entries on terminology, characters, story events and earlier events from past Xenosaga games. The game features a variety of quests including the main narrative and side quests accepted from non-playable characters. The party can purchase items and equipment from shops found in friendly environments throughout the game. Gameplay segments are separated by story sequences, which are told through both traditional full-motion cutscenes and segments with voiced text boxes within the game environments. Enemies such as monsters can be seen in environments, to be avoided or engaged as wished; the party can also place traps which temporarily immobilize an enemy unit. When the party makes contact with a monster, the battle is initiated. Triggering a battle with a trapped enemy grants a boost in battle. Combat is split into two types; one with the human party members, and one using combat mechs dubbed E.S. units.|$|E
