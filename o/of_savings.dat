5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> and investment.|$|E
40|$|A {{key element}} <b>of</b> houshold behavior, <b>saving</b> {{is still not}} satisfactorily understood. The seminal lif-cycle theory <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> by Modigliani et al has been {{augmented}} by the consideration of liquidity constraints, mortality, morbidity, income, interest, and other uncertaities, and, more recently, by behavioral elements. Each of these amendments explains part <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> behavior. However, contradictions remain widespread. This paper poses the question in how far observable age-saving profiles can identify competing theories <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> behavior. The paper departs from the age-saving profiles observed in Germany and compares them with age-saving profiles that were simulated using different variants <b>of</b> augmented life-cycle <b>saving</b> theories. It shows that age-saving profiles per se cannot separate competing theories <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> behavior. This means that the estimations of Euler-equation are not identified. ...|$|R

5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed {{that there was nothing}} in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth <b>of</b> <b>savings.</b> In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E

The Duke of Cambridge and the Duchess of Gloucester had a lawyer write to Conroy demanding that he account {{for the rest of}} their sister Sophia's funds, but Conroy simply ignored it. According to Flora Fraser, the most recent biographer of George III's daughters, Princess Sophia had in fact personally spent huge sums on Conroy, including heavy contributions to the purchase prices of his residences and supporting his family in a style he judged appropriate to their position. Conroy ultimately received £148,000 in gifts and money from Sophia.|$|E

40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between entrepreneurial saving practices and reinvestment? We develop a model of entrepreneurial finance and show that entrepreneurial reinvestment decisions depend on the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> practices. Utilizing a novel micro & small enterprise survey from Tanzania we test the empirical implications of this theory. We find (1) saving for business purposes and earnings reinvestment are positively related; (2) the practice <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> in a deposit account of a formal financial institution is more likely to facilitate reinvestment compared to the practice <b>of</b> keeping <b>savings</b> within the household. We also show that the negative impact <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> within-the-household on investment is more pronounced for family members with inherently low intra-household bargaining power- such as females and non-head household members. Our work contributes to the recent debate on the implications <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> instruments in developing countries...|$|R

The model incorporates the major factors that influence optimal saving, namely demographic change, the catch-up of total factor productivity in China {{to the level of}} high-income OECD countries, and an endogenous world rate of interest. The paper finds that the rate of time preference that would imply the current rate <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> is optimal is very low; in fact, it is negative. Thus, to justify China's current rate <b>of</b> <b>saving,</b> the social planner would have to put a higher weight on the economic welfare of future generations relative to the current generation, indeed up to 19 times the weight. This suggests that the current rate <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> in China is excessive. Saving, China, living standards...|$|R
