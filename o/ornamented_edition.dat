40|$|In 1841 John Murray {{published}} a sumptuously <b>ornamented</b> <b>edition</b> of John Gibson Lockhart’s Ancient Spanish Ballads. Murray’s new edition, printed using {{the very latest}} bookmaking technologies and pitched at a readership newly accustomed to paying exorbitant prices for book ornaments and illustrations, was radically different from {{the first edition of}} Lockhart’s ballads, which had appeared without accompanying ornament in 1823. Illustrated by the leading illustrators of the day and decorated throughout in multiple colors by the architect Owen Jones (who would go on to become famous as a Superintendent of the Great Exhibition and the author of The Grammar of Ornament), Murray’s edition represents a stunning departure in Victorian printing and a highpoint in mid-Victorian design generally. At the same time, it crystallizes a debate about the nature and application of artistic design that was beginning to emerge {{in the early years of}} Victoria’s reign and that would erupt with maximum vigor ten years later in the confrontation between John Ruskin and the South Kensington School. The tension between flat, stylized design and what Ruskin was later to term “truth to nature” is already palpable in the conflict between illustrations and ornaments to Murray’s book. However, it was the involvement of Owen Jones that especially distinguished the volume, as it gave Jones the opportunity to demonstrate in a practical way ideas about design, color, and style that he would theorize fifteen years later in The Grammar of Ornament. Those ideas are especially resonant today, given recent work on the history of the book and the “bibliographic codes” of literature, since the effect of Jones’s work is to expose the textual condition of Lockhart’s poetry itself and to harness the eye as an active constituent in the act of reading. Fifty years before the work of William Morris at the Kelmscott Press, Jones and Murray showed Victorian readers that a printed book might be a thing of real beauty and that poetry, no less than painting or architecture, is dependent on the perceptual structure of its textual vehicle...|$|E

50|$|Little {{is known}} about him. He {{designed}} <b>ornaments</b> for the <b>edition</b> of the 'kongeloven' published in 1709. He also produced portraits of Frederick IV of Denmark, Kirsten Bille, Berte Skeel and others, as well as producing images of scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses for the king. From 1686 to 1688 he painted the audience chamber at Frederiksborg Castle with scenes from the Scanian War.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Pope, in {{his last}} illness, amused himself, amidst the care of his higher concerns, in {{preparing}} a corrected and complete edition of his writings;[1] and, with his usual delicacy, was even solicitous to prevent any share of the offence they might occasion, from falling on the friend whom he had engaged to give them to the public.[2] In discharge of this trust, the public has here a complete edition of his works, executed in such a manner, as, I am persuaded, {{would have been to}} his satisfaction. The editor hath not, for the sake of profit, suffered the author's name to be made cheap by a subscription;[3] nor his works to be defrauded of their due honours by a vulgar or inelegant impression; nor his memory to be disgraced by any pieces unworthy of his talents or virtue. On the contrary, he hath, at a very great expense, <b>ornamented</b> this <b>edition</b> with all the advantages which the best artists in paper, printing, and sculpture could bestow upon it.[4] ...|$|R
60|$|The {{memory of}} Tinto is dear to me, from the {{recollection}} of the many conversations which we have had together, most of them turning upon my present task. He was delighted with my progress, and talked of an <b>ornamented</b> and illustrated <b>edition,</b> with heads, vignettes, and culs de lampe, all to be designed by his own patriotic and friendly pencil. He prevailed upon an old sergeant of invalids to sit {{to him in the}} character of Bothwell, the lifeguard's-man of Charles the Second, and the bellman of Gandercleugh in that of David Deans. But while he thus proposed to unite his own powers with mine for the illustration of these narratives, he mixed many a dose of salutary criticism with the panegyrics which my composition was at times so fortunate as to call forth.|$|R
