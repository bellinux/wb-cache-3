5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series <b>of</b> <b>blind</b> dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E

Thirteen months later, it is Father's Day and Adam tends to their son Jack (played variously by Joel Little and Dexter Little) in the night. Christine hears the Stranger's voice, but eventually finds Jack with Adam. Christine celebrates her birthday thirteen months later. Ernie no longer recognises Christine, while Adam {{is more interested}} in his colleague Zara (Ellerby). Marion blindfolds Christine for a game <b>of</b> <b>blind</b> man's buff. Christine hears noises from behind a door and removes her blindfold to step through. Thirteen months later, Adam is packing a case for a family holiday. Ernie has died, and Christine's relationship with Adam is strained.|$|E
40|$|Background: Blinding is {{recommended}} widely {{as a strategy}} in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce biases that can result from awareness of who is receiving the intervention being tested. The absence <b>of</b> <b>blinding,</b> especially when the primary outcomes are subjective, {{has been found to}} be associated with inflated estimates of treatment effects, yet little is known about the use <b>of</b> <b>blinding</b> in nursing RCTs. Objectives: The purposes of this study were (a) to describe the extent to which nurse researchers state that they used blinding as a bias-reduction strategy or explain why it was not used, (b) to identify the groups that are blinded when blinding is used, (c) to assess whether the term blinding or masking is more prevalent, and (d) to explore factors that might affect the use or acknowledgement <b>of</b> <b>blinding</b> in nursing trials. Methods: Data regarding blinding were extracted systematically and coded from a consecutive sample of 199 RCTs published in 16 nursing journals in 2007 to 2009. Results: Blinding, the term used predominantly in nursing, was reported to have been used in 33 % of the studies. Rates <b>of</b> <b>blinding</b> ranged from 2. 5 % for data analysts to 28 % for data collectors. The absence <b>of</b> <b>blinding</b> was discussed as a limitation in only 13 % of the studies in which blinding did not occur. The use or mention <b>of</b> <b>blinding</b> was related strongly to whether the journal in which the article was published had endorsed the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials guidelines (CONSORT). Conclusions: Nurse researchers conducting RCTs should be more diligent in following the CONSORT guidelines regarding the use and description <b>of</b> <b>blinding.</b> Although it is often impossible to blind study participants and intervention agents, the <b>blinding</b> <b>of</b> data collectors, data analysts, and nonresearch healthcare staff should be pursued.

5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race <b>of</b> <b>blind</b> soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows <b>of</b> <b>blind</b> arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the swastika {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E
5|$|The major studios, {{at first}} {{resistant}} to the double feature, soon adapted. All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking became standard practice: {{to get access to}} a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice <b>of</b> <b>blind</b> bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs' quality—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (20th Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO)—also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique <b>of</b> <b>blind</b> intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E
5|$|Smythe {{first became}} {{interested}} in horse racing as a boy, when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown. Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s, but he rarely had any success. One early purchase {{turned out to be}} one of his most famous. When Mrs. L. A. Livingston sold off her stable, he bought Rare Jewel, a filly, for $250. The filly regularly ran last. The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes, one of the best two-year-old races. Smythe was full <b>of</b> <b>blind</b> hope, and on the trainer's advice, entered her in the race. The day of the race, both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy, unknown to Smythe, who bet over $100 on Rare Jewel. She won the race, a 100–1 longshot paying $214.40 on a $2 bet, besting future Queen's Plate winner Froth Blower. Between the winnings from his bets and his portion of the winner's purse as horse owner, Smythe won more than $10,000 on that one race. Three weeks later, he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression-strapped Ottawa Senators for $35,000. The purchase was only possible because of his gambling winnings, as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators' then-high price, and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money.|$|E
