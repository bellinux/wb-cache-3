50|$|Traditionally, banks lend to borrowers under tight lending standards, keep loans {{on their}} balance sheets and retain credit risk—the risk that borrowers will default (be unable to repay {{interest}} and principal as {{specified in the}} loan contract). In contrast, securitization enables banks to remove loans from balance sheets and transfer the credit risk associated with those loans. Therefore, two types of items are of interest: <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> and off-balance sheet. The former is represented by traditional loans, since banks indicate loans on the asset side of their balance sheets. However, securitized loans are represented off the balance sheet, because securitization involves selling the loans to a third party (the loan originator and the borrower being the first two parties). Banks disclose details of securitized assets only in notes to their financial statements.|$|E

The results suggest that the CDS market views originators as having greater probabilities not to honour their implicit guarantees for off-balance sheet securitizations during the economic downturn.

It would be beneficial to investors if regulations take into considerations the changing credit risks of off-balance sheet securitizations and the different structures of asset securitizations...|$|E

This study presents the relationship between capital and on- and off-balance sheet credit risk and the effectiveness of capital standards in the United States. The selected banks are commercial banks and bank holding companies in the United States that involve in securitization from the third quarter of 2001 to the first quarter of 2008. Three simultaneous equations are estimated by using three-stage least squares (3 SLS) to account for three endogenous variables, which are capital, <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> credit risk, and off-balance sheet credit risk. The results of the main model indicate that banks with securitization only simultaneously determine change in capital and off-balance sheet credit risk and they have a positive relationship, that change in off-balance sheet credit risk exogenously determines change in <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> credit risk and they have a positive relationship, and that change in capital and change in <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> credit risk have no significant relationship. Next, regarding the effectiveness of capital standards, the results show that U. S. capital standards are partially effective during the sample period. Capital standards are effective in that regulatory pressure induces undercapitalized banks to increase book value capital ratio, which is the ratio of equity capital to total assets, and to adjust capital faster than adequately capitalized banks. However, capital standards are ineffective in that with regulatory pressure, undercapitalized banks take more off-balance sheet credit risk and decrease in risk-based capital ratios. Moreover, regulatory pressure has no significant impact on change in <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> credit risk. Therefore, during the sample period, U. S. capital standards are not stringent enough to achieve banking safety and soundness. ...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{derivatives}} have escalated in {{significance in}} terms of their volume in global financial markets, widespread use and financial impact on companies and markets. They are akin to a two-edged sword; their use may mitigate or increase risk. Spectacular collapses in the past have brought considerable attention to these instruments. However, when used for hedging purposes, they potentially enhance or preserve value and mitigate risk of financial distress. Accounting for derivative instruments has had a difficult history with accounting standards adopting a piecemeal approach in accounting for financial instruments. However, accounting standards now require derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair values. Special requirements relating to hedge accounting apply to derivative contracts that are entered into for risk mitigation. The United States were faster in arriving at a comprehensive standard that required companies to report their derivative contracts on the balance sheet. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) had a more challenging task to garner support from its member bodies worldwide to adopt the <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> recognition of derivative contracts.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} using the partial least squares (PLS) path {{modelling}} methodology in archival auditing research by replicating {{the data and}} research questions from prior bank audit fee studies. PLS path modelling allows for inter-correlations among audit fee determinants by establishing latent constructs and multiple relationship paths in one simultaneous PLS path model. Endogeneity concerns about auditor choice can also be addressed with PLS path modelling. With a sample of US bank holding companies for the period 2003 - 2009, we examine the associations among <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financial risks, off-balance sheet risks and audit fees, and also address the pervasive client size effect, {{and the effect of}} the self-selection of auditors. The results endorse the dominating effect of size on audit fees, both directly and indirectly via its impacts on other audit fee determinants. By simultaneously considering the self-selection of auditors, we still find audit fee premiums on Big N auditors, which is the second important factor on audit fee determination. On-balance-sheet financial risk measures in terms of capital adequacy, loan composition, earnings and asset quality performance have positive impacts on audit fees. After allowing for the positive influence of <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financial risks and entity size on off-balance sheet risk, the off-balance sheet risk measure, SECRISK, is still positively associated with bank audit fees, {{both before and after the}} onset of the financial crisis. The consistent results from this study compared with prior literature provide supporting evidence and enhance confidence on the application of this new research technique in archival accounting studies...|$|E
30|$|It may be objected {{that the}} sample {{is too small to}} be able to {{calculate}} reliable conversion factors. However, there are reasons to believe that the calculated conversion factors are robust. First, a great proportion of <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> items are treated in the same way across US-GAAP, IFRS, and LRD and hence limit the scope for unfounded measurement deviations. Second, thanks to pro-forma LRD calculations of UBS back to Q 4 2012 we can calculate the conversion factor for this period. It typically hovered in a small corridor slightly below 1 with an average conversion factor of 0.98. This suggests {{that the sample}}d conversion ratios between LRD and the accounting measurements IFRS and US-GAAP, respectively, are reliable.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} novel theory of securitization based on intermediaries minimizing the moral hazard that insiders can misuse assets held <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> The model predicts how intermediaries finance different assets. Under deposit funding, the moral hazard is greatest for low-risk assets that yield sizable returns in bad states of nature; under securitization, it is greatest for high-risk assets that require high guarantees and large reserves. Intermediaries thus securitize low-risk assets. In an extension, I identify a novel channel through which government bailouts exacerbate the moral hazard and reduce total investment {{irrespective of the}} funding mode. This adverse effect is stronger under deposit funding, implying that intermediaries finance more risky assets off-balance sheet. The dissertation discusses the implications of different forms of guarantees. With explicit guarantees, banks securitize assets with either low information-intensity or low risk. By contrast, with implicit guarantees, banks only securitize assets with high information-intensity and low risk. Two extensions to the benchmark static and dynamic models are discussed. First, an extension to the static model studies the optimality of tranching versus securitization with guarantees. Tranching eliminates agency costs but worsens adverse selection, while securitization with guarantees does the opposite. When the quality of underlying assets in a certain security market is sufficiently heterogeneous, and when the highest quality assets {{are perceived to be}} sufficiently safe, securitization with guarantees dominates tranching. Second, in an extension to the dynamic setting, the moral hazard of misusing assets held <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> naturally gives rise to the moral hazard of weak ex-post monitoring in securitization. The use of guarantees reduces the dependence of banks' ex-post payoffs on monitoring efforts, thereby weakening monitoring incentives. The incentive to monitor under securitization with implicit guarantees is the weakest among all funding modes, as implicit guarantees allow banks to renege on their monitoring promises without being declared bankrupt and punished...|$|E
30|$|The recent {{incarnation}} {{of the idea that}} banks create liquidity traces back to the studies of Bryant (1980) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983). According to these studies, banks create liquidity <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> by financing relatively illiquid assets with relatively liquid liabilities. Another set of studies point to the liquidity creation by off-balance-sheet activities of the banks. Holmstrom and Tirole (1998) and Kashyap et al. (2002) propose that banks also create liquidity off the balance sheet by commitments to provide liquidity to their clients, in case of need. Previous studies have also analyzed the role of banks as risk transformers. According to Diamond (1984) and Boyd and Prescott (1986), banks transform risk by issuing riskless deposits to lend risky loans. There are many similarities in the banks’ role as liquidity creator and risk transformer.|$|E
40|$|This article reexamines the {{conventional}} wisdom that commercial banking is in severe decline. A careful reading of the evidence does not support it. True, <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> assets held by commercial banks have declined as a share of total intermediary assets. But this measure ignores the substantial growth in banks' off-balance sheet activities, in off-shore lending by foreign banks, and {{in the size of the}} financial intermediation sector. Adjusted for these considerations, the bank-assets measure shows no clear evidence of secular decline. Neither does an alternative measure, constructed using data from the national income accounts. At most, banking may have suffered a slight loss of market share lately. But this loss is a temporary response to a series of adverse shocks rather than the start of a permanent decline.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper is to assess the potential economic consequences of the G 4 + 1 proposed changes to lease accounting by examining companies in the UK retail sector over the 1994 - 99 period. The magnitude {{of the impact of}} lease capitalisation is assessed by examining the effect on nine key accounting ratios that are used in decision-making and in financial contracts. A 'constructive capitalisation' procedure is used to estimate the unrecorded lease liability and asset. Operating lease finance is shown to be very important in the retail sector, with a long-term liability approximately 3. 3 times higher than <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> long-term debt; by contrast, finance leases are immaterial. Operating leased assets, the major part of which is 'land and buildings' (98 %), represent a significant proportion (28 %) of reported total assets. Capitalisation of operating leases would {{have a major impact on}} all nine ratios. Further, the ranking of companies changes markedly for asset turnover, interest cover and the three capital-based gearing measures, and especially for general retailers. Using credit-risk adjusted discount rates would lessen slightly the impact of capitalisation, but would have little impact on intra-sector ranking of company performance. Anticipation of future lease rental increases would have a significant impact on the level of operating lease assets/liabilities and on profit after tax. While the use of renewable short lease contracts (or break clauses) would reduce the level of operating lease assets and liabilities, substantial amounts would remain to be reported <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> These findings contribute to the assessment of the economic consequences of a policy change requiring operating lease capitalisation. Prior research suggests that individual users of financial statements are not efficient information processors, and also that company managers do not believe that users, even in aggregate (e. g. the stock market) are efficient processors. Consequently, the significant changes in the magnitude of key accounting ratios and the major shift in company performance rankings suggest that interested parties' economic decisions are likely to be affected...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{composition}} and drivers of cross-border bank lending between 1995 and 2012, distinguishing between syndicated and non-syndicated loans. We show that <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> syndicated loan exposures, which account for almost one third of total cross-border loan exposures, increased during the global financial crisis due to large drawdowns on credit lines extended before the crisis. Our empirical analysis of the drivers of cross-border loan exposures in a large bilateral dataset leads to three main results. First, banks {{with lower levels of}} capital favor syndicated over other kinds of cross-border loans. Second, borrower country characteristics such as level of development, economic size, and capital account openness, are less important in driving syndicated than non-syndicated loan activity, suggesting a diversification motive for syndication. Third, information asymmetries between lender and borrower countries became more binding for both types of cross-border lending activity during the recent crisis...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} financial intermediaries' {{interest rate}} risk management as the simultaneous decision of on-balance-sheet exposure and interest rate swap use. Our findings show that both decisions are substitute risk management strategies. A higher likelihood of bank distress makes banks reduce their <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> interest rate exposure and simultaneously intensify their swap use. Exogeneity tests indicate that both decisions are only endogenous {{to each other for}} banks that start using swaps for the first time. For other banks, the maturity gap is endogenous to the decision to use swaps, but the reverse relationship is exogenous. For banks with trading activity, both decisions are exogenous to each other. We interpret these findings as the maturity gap being largely determined by customer liquidity needs, whereas the decision to use swaps relies on compliance with the {{interest rate risk}} regulation. Although hedging motives dominate, we find selective hedging behavior in swap use driven by the slope of the yield curve as well as by funding uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Asset-backed {{securitisation}} (ABS) is {{an asset}} funding technique {{that involves the}} issuance of structured claims on the cash flow performance of a designated pool of underlying receivables. Efficient risk management and asset allocation in this growing segment of fixed income markets requires both investors and issuers to thoroughly understand the longitudinal properties of spread prices. We present a multi-factor GARCH process in order to model the heteroskedasticity of secondary market spreads for valuation and forecasting purposes. In particular, accounting for the variance of errors is instrumental in deriving more accurate estimators of time-varying forecast confidence intervals. On the basis of CDO, MBS and Pfandbrief transactions {{as the most important}} asset classes of off-balance sheet and <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> securitisation in Europe we find that expected spread changes for these asset classes tends to be level stationary with model estimates indicating asymmetric mean reversion. Furthermore, spread volatility (conditional variance) follows an asymmetric stochastic process contingent on the value of past residuals. This ABS spread behaviour implies negative investor sentiment during cyclical downturns, which is likely to escape stationary approximation in the long run...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between exchange-rate changes and stock returns for a sample of Dutch firms over 1994 - 1998. We find that over 50 % of the firms are significantly exposed to exchange-rate risk. Furthermore, all firms with significant exchange-rate exposure benefit from a depreciation of the Dutch guilder relative to a trade-weighted currency index. This result confirms that firms in open economies, such as the Netherlands, exhibit significant exchange-rate exposure. We collect unique information on the most relevant individual currencies for each firm with respect to their influence on firm value. Our results indicate that the use of a trade-weighted currency index and the use of individual exchange rates are complements. We also measure the determinants of exchange-rate exposure. As expected, we find that firm size and the foreign sales ratio are significantly and positively related to exchange-rate exposure. In contrast with our hypothesis, off-balance hedging using derivatives has no significant effects. Finally, in line with theory, we find that exposure is significantly reduced through <b>on-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> hedging, i. e. through foreign loans and by producing in factories abroad...|$|E
