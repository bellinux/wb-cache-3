40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to perform molecular sim-ulations using evolutionary algorithms. The main ap-plication of this work is the simulation of dense amor-phous polymers and the goal is to improve the efficiency of sampling, in other words to <b>obtain</b> <b>valid</b> <b>samples</b> from the phase state more rapidly. Our approach is based on parallel Markovian Monte Carlo simulations of the same physico-chemical system, where we optimise some Monte Carlo parameters by means of a real coded genetic algo-rithm. ...|$|E
30|$|After {{obtaining a}} certain number of initial samples, we select the weight of the sample as the {{objective}} function of the optimization and present the differential evolution algorithm to <b>obtain</b> <b>valid</b> <b>samples</b> rather than perform initial sample filtering and resampling. Finally, the node position is estimated by making the sample close to the actual location of the node instead of being filtered out. The simulation result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm provides a better position estimation with less localization error. In the future, we will study and validate the signal strength indicator to improve the performance of our method in aspect of computational and communication costs. And we are also planning to discuss the challenges and open research issues related to the parameters and focus on the localization accuracy of range-free schemes.|$|E
40|$|International audienceCompared to {{conventional}} processors, stochastic computing architectures have strong potential {{to speed up}} computation time and to reduce power consumption. We present such an architecture, called Bayesian Machine (BM), dedicated to solving Bayesian inference problems. Given a set of noisy signals provided by low-level sensors, a BM estimates the posterior probability distribution of an unknown target information. In the present study, a BM is used to solve a sound source localization (SSL) problem: the BM computes the probability distribution {{of the position of}} a sound source given acoustic signals captured by a set of microphones. Assuming free field wave propagation (no reverberations), we express the SSL problem as the maximization of a likelihood function fed with audio features provided by the time-frequency (TF) analysis of the captured audio waves. The proposed BM uses bitwise parallel sampling to fuse the resulting multi-channel information. As the number of channels to fuse is large, the standard BM architecture encounters the so-called " time dilution problem " (long delays are necessary to <b>obtain</b> <b>valid</b> <b>samples).</b> We tackle this problem by using max-normalization of the distributions combined with a periodic re-sampling of the bit streams after processing a reasonably small subset of evidences. Finally, we compare the localization performance of the proposed machine with the results obtained using a standard version of the machine. The re-sampling leads to an impressive acceleration factor of 10 ³ in the computation...|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects on}} the localization algorithm by setting different parameters, the average localization error {{and the number of}} candidate samples are regarded as key indicators. Among them, the number of candidate samples reflects the number of times as the sampling process is executed for <b>obtaining</b> the <b>valid</b> <b>samples.</b> Usually, the lesser the number of candidate samples is, the higher the success rate of sampling can obtain.|$|R
30|$|Mechanically {{ventilated}} {{critically ill}} adult patients, with an indwelling arterial line and {{admitted to the}} ICU for either medical or surgical conditions, were eligible for this study. Severe coagulopathy (prothrombin time[*]>[*] 2.5 ratio, platelet count[*]<[*] 10, 000 units/dl) and inability to obtain informed consent by the patient or next of kin were exclusion criteria. Sample size estimation for comparing capillary versus arterial samples {{was based on the}} method described by Walter and Shoukri [10, 11]. In order to compare the two methods using the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) approach, a minimum of 30 valid data points where needed. Due to an unexpected high sampling failure ratio, 55 patients were included in a non-consecutive fashion in order to <b>obtain</b> 31 <b>valid</b> <b>samples.</b> Two interim analyses were performed after the inclusion of the 15 th and 45 th patients in order to monitor sampling success, and to adjust patient inclusion for the observed data acquisition rate and the required number of <b>valid</b> <b>samples.</b> The study protocol was in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (IRB: 2009593.

40|$|Two {{apparent}} {{features that}} prevail at signalized intersections in China are green signal countdown device and long cycle lengths. The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate the impacts of green signal countdown device and long cycle length on queue discharge patterns and to discuss its implications on capacity estimation in the context of China's traffic. At five typical large intersections in Shanghai and Tianjin, 11 through lanes were observed, and 9251 saturation headways were <b>obtained</b> as <b>valid</b> <b>samples.</b> Statistical analyses indicate that the discharge process of queuing vehicles can be divided into three distinct stages according to the discharge flow rate: a start-up stage, a steady stage, and a rush stage. The average time for queuing vehicles to reach a stationary saturation flow rate, that is, the start-up stage, was found to be approximately 20 – 30 seconds; the rush stage usually occurs during the phase transition period. The finding is contrary to the conventional assumption that the discharge rate reaches a maximum value after the fourth vehicle is discharged and then remains constant during the green time until the queue is completely dissolved. The capacity estimation errors that might arise from the conventional methods are discussed through a comparative study and a sensitivity analysis that are based on the identified queue discharge patterns. In addition, a piecewise linear regression method was proposed in order to reduce such errors. The proposed method can be used for capacity estimation at signalized intersections with the identified queue discharge patterns...|$|R

30|$|An {{adequate}} {{sample size}} {{is essential to}} <b>obtaining</b> <b>valid</b> results. Our <b>sample</b> size calculations indicated that we would need 342 samples for each region to detect a 15 % prevalence. We achieved this in both the rural provinces (N[*]=[*] 388, 17.8 % prevalence) and the urban districts (N[*]=[*] 848, 13.2 % prevalence). However, there are some weaknesses in our study that could underestimate our prevalence estimates. These include the potential for drug outlet personnel to selectively provide drugs if they were suspicious about {{the reason for the}} purchase, and excluding drug samples from the unlicensed market, where the prevalence of substandard drugs has found to be significantly higher (Almuzaini et al. 2013). Another potential issue is that the biochemical analysis was performed at 3 different drug testing laboratories in Mongolia. Although they all used the same Pharmacoepeia standards, the possibility of variability in testing between facilities exists. In order to confirm the accuracy of the results, we had planned to send 10 % of the samples to an outside lab for verification. Because of budgetary constraints, only 4 substandard samples (2.2 %) were actually sent for testing at an outside reference laboratory (National Institute of Drug Quality Control of Vietnam, Hanoi, Vietnam). These 4 samples were all verified as correctly classified, {{but it is not a}} large enough number and did not include any acceptable samples, therefore we cannot claim to validate our findings by outside reference laboratory testing.|$|R

40|$|The {{delivery}} of five stimuli to each cranial site is recommended during {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) mapping.
