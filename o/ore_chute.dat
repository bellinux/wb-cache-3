However, yields from the Golden Gate claims were meagre until 1891, when a rich <b>ore</b> <b>chute</b> was {{discovered}} in Rogers' No. 1 Golden Gate mine. The large, well defined, north/northwest bearing Golden Gate reef contained gold- bearing quartz with abundant sulphides and was mined over a total length of 2.5km. Records suggest that payable ore was limited to a vertical depth of approximately 90m. Its most productive years, between 1886 and 1911, showed a yield of 483,000 ounces of gold from 244,364 tons of ore. This production totalled {{more than one-third of}} the entire Croydon yield.|$|E

When Jake crawls up the <b>ore</b> <b>chute</b> and tries to break out, the entire station locks down. An image of Gul Dukat plays on all the monitors, announcing that rioting Bajorans have escaped.

50|$|The battery {{contains}} three components, {{the battery}} shed, an associated cottage and a water pump. The battery shed is constructed on a bush timber frame with heavy bush timber uprights. The shed is clad in corrugated iron. Components of the crushing plant include timbered <b>ore</b> <b>chutes</b> to two primary crusher pits (one jaw crusher remains in situ), connected by two external ore bucket elevators to the ore bins, self-feeding 3 five-head stamp batteries. The two bucket elevators have been removed; however, their vertical housings form a distinctive external feature. The battery launders are intact {{but there are}} no copper amalgam plates. Only one of three slimes tables remain. A gas engine which formed the main power plant has recently been removed. Two berdan pans and a grinding pan remain in situ. A lean-to section alongside the battery building contains a smithy and a small workshop.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} process {{began with the}} awarding of contracts. The first one was awarded in March 1931 when the Lake Shore Engine Works of Marquette was contracted to construct 150 hoists for raising and lowering the dock chutes. The second contract was let out on 1 April, to the Merritt-Chapman & Whitney Corporation of Duluth. This company was the successor to Whitney Bros. which specialized {{in the building of}} docks, bridges, heavy construction work of all kinds as well as river and harbor improvements. They would bring their experience to this project. The fabricated steel for the dock including the large steel <b>ore</b> <b>chutes</b> would be furnished by McClintick, Marshall Corporation of Chicago. Jernstad Electric of Ishpeming would install the electrical work and the Worden—Allen Company of Chicago was given the contract for furnishing all of the reinforced steel for the dock and its approach.|$|R

50|$|The {{township}} of Golden Gate was {{surveyed in}} December 1892 by W.A. Irwin, {{although there were}} buildings constructed well before this. The survey {{was late in the}} history of the field considering that the first reward claim, Golden Gate PC, was taken up by Joseph Hardy and James Fulton on 12 April 1886. However, yields from the Golden Gate fields were meagre until 1891, when a rich <b>ore</b> <b>chute</b> was discovered in Roger's No. 1 mine. It went on to become the most productive field in the Croydon area. By 1900, Golden Gate had a population of 600, 11 hotels, 8 stores, 3 churches and 3 butchers. A school operated from 1896 to 1921, and a post office from 1891 to 1919. Production declined during the years leading up to World War I, and the township virtually disappeared after the closure of Forsythe's Pioneer Mill in 1922.|$|E

A PFC 2 D simulation showed that dynamic loads at the chute gate were reduced significantly when a dogleg transition was used, and simulations in which the ore pass was inclined showed significant reductions in chute impact loads compared to simulations of a vertical ore pass.

40|$|Synopsis U. S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{accidents}} statistics {{have identified}} ore-pass hazards {{as a significant}} safety problem in U. S. underground metal mines. The statistics show that nearly 75 % of injuries are directly or indirectly related to pulling or freeing of ore-pass chutes, the use of hand tools in ore passes, fails of broken rock in ore passes and structural failures of chutes or gates and ore-pass walls. Researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are investigating hazards in and around ore passes in hard rock mines. Risk assessment methods, such as fault-tree analysis, have been employed to identify the most probable causes of orepass failures, define research priorities and analyse the factors that result in malfunctioning and unsafe ore passes. Static and dynamic loads are being measured in a laboratory setting {{with the use of}} a reduced-scale orepass mock-up. Field tests are being initiated in mine ore passes to determine static and dynamic loads. Data from the test ore passes are being compared with data from the mine to characterize true system behaviour. Computer modelling with the use of closed-form solutions, finite-element analyses and a newly developed particle flow code predicts static and dynamic leads from the flow and the impact of ore and waste in the ore pass. Preliminary results indicate that dynamic impacts from ore and waste rock might be considerably greater than expected. The total static load is substantially less than is typically used fur the structural design of chute and gate support members. It is suggested that damping factors, normal and shear stiffness and mass frictional characteristics have a significant effect on particle flow and resulting impact loads. This is being verified with the use of results from laboratory tests, field tests and particle flow analyses. Ore passes are vertical or steeply inclined openings in a rock mass through which ore and waste are transported and where they mar also be stored. A typical underground mining system is shown in Fig. 1. The arrows indicate the locations of ore passes and loading pockets and their relative configurations. The control of material flow is potentially one of the most hazardous operations in underground mining. According to MSHA data. most of the ore pass-related accidents in the U. S. A. are associated with the loading-unloading cycle and removal of blockages from ore passes. In particular, attempts to free ore hang-ups have resulted in multiple fatalities. The hazards are obvious; there is uncertainty as to when the ore will break loose and miners are unable to escape falling rock to a safe location. Although <b>ore</b> passes and <b>chutes</b> and gate systems for underground metal and non-metal mines roust meet the requirements specified in the U. S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Parts 57 and 75, recent structural failures of ore-pass linings and gates have underlined the lack of adequate ore-pass design standards available to both MSHA enforcement staff and mine engineers. Because of the importance of an ore pass to the safe operation of a mine design criteria need to be assessed and new guidelines developed. Researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the Nationals Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are investigating hazards in and around ore passes in hard rock mines and studying design criteria for ore passes. The near-term goal is to conduct laboratory and field experiments and computer modelling to evaluate the ore-pass design criteria currently used. Literature searches, field sit...|$|R
