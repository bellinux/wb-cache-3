Factors that may help make such rules effective include the presence of informal sanctions by peers, and implementation through voting. I study the impact of non-deterrent formal sanctions on voluntary contributions to a public good in a laboratory experiment. The effect is studied both in the presence and absence of informal sanctions, under fully exogenous implementation and after both implemented and randomly overridden voting. I find that informal sanctions strengthen the effect of formal ones in most conditions. However, voted implementation of a non-deterrent formal sanction has no significant effect on contribution in my data, which suggests a reason for caution when studying exogenous implementation by a random vote <b>override</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E

The aim of object tracking is to findan object of a pre-defined class in a video frame. Videostructures consists of multiple frames and huge facts,hence video tracking is a time <b>overriding</b> <b>procedures.</b> Tracking is nothing but identification of interest,especially on tracking of moving vehicles or walkers. Inevent of any strange actions, an attentive should beprovided. Normally a video tracking system combinesthree stages of data treating: object extraction, objectrecognition and tracking, and decisions about activities. In this paper, we analysis various object trackingtechniques...|$|R

Module embedding is beneficial when modules and classes are used in combination {{and need to be}} extended together, or when modules are more appropriate medium than classes.

Shortly after, the commissioner Sean Lau (Aaron Kwok) receives a call {{from one of the}} culprits behind the theft of the police van. He is told that his wife has been kidnapped and that he must release Joe Lee (Eddie Peng) for her to survive. Lau <b>overrides</b> standard <b>procedure</b> to transfer Joe out of prison, and is told by the kidnapper to bring Joe to the metro station. There, Joe is able to escape with the aid of several accomplices, one of whom sets off a bomb. The culprits leave Lau's wife alive at the station.|$|R

The model {{is based on}} Tensor Invariants and <b>overrides</b> usual stochastic <b>procedure</b> limitations problems characterized by FP and FN. The computational model is related directly to physical world, and it offers three major operational advantages over previous methods. at least. The first advantage is progressive automatic model generation of the Complete Minimum Set of Tensor Invariants. The second one is the reduced computational power requirements over traditional method. Finally. target precision drives automatic model generation trough subsequent steps. In fact model precision is increased at each step. Robust discrimination or machine number representation saturation ends the computational process. Machine number representation saturation state suggests more power computational resource requirements for critical mission achievement. The general approach is tested on selected 2 -D image database and preliminary results are presented...|$|R
40|$|Employment Tribunals are {{the formal}} means of adjudicating {{disputes}} over individual employment {{rights in the}} UK. This paper hypothesises that because small firms favour informality over formality that they are (1) {{more likely to experience}} employee claims than large firms; (2) to be subject to different types of claims; (3) to be more likely to settle prior to reaching a formal Tribunal; and (4) be more likely to lose at a Tribunal. Data from the 2003 Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications (SETA) are used to examine these hypotheses. They are generally supported, though in relation to the third there was no size effect, and at Tribunal stage having and using (formal) disciplinary <b>procedures</b> <b>overrides</b> the effect of firm size. The most likely explanation is that day-to-day practice in small firms is not consistent with the standards of evidence and the audit trail expected by Tribunals...|$|R
40|$|The OMX-case entailed {{considerable}} {{uncertainty about}} the relationship between tax treaties and Swedish domestic law. Previous approaches to handle rule conflict between them was put out of action for the first time when an internal rule took precedence over tax treaties. The Greece-case came a few years later where there were hopes that it would be decided in plenary session to return to the view that prevailed before the OMX-case, which did not happen. Instead the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the tax treaties shall in principle be given preference, but that in exceptional situations tax treaties can be infringed to an internal rule's benefit, so called tax treaty <b>override.</b> Such <b>procedure</b> is acceptable if the legislature gives "clear expression" of the intention of a certain type of income is to be taxed in Sweden, or that a particular new rule applies regardless of the provisions in tax treaties. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the supreme administrative courts management of rule collision between domestic law and tax treaties in the Greece-case. Further analysis of the requirement "clear expression" shall take place and the basis of why the supreme administrative court justifies tax treaty override shall also be analyzed. The conclusion presented in this thesis initially includes problems that arise to conclude the meaning of the term "clear expression" and that application difficulties arise because the supreme administrative court did not provide further guidance of its meaning. Secondly, that the supreme administrative court justify tax treaty override occasionally since there is no constitutional or procedural obstacles for a newer internal law to expand the Swedish taxation when an already implemented taxation agreement restricts it...|$|R

Although all the areas are closely linked together, the requirements and standard procedures are in many respects different. From a Quality Assurance point of view, {{it is important to}} note that the main work of the WhoLoDancE project can be divided into three sections: • Work Section 1 : Gathering a Collection of Dance Motion making use of Advanced Motion Capture Technology and building Multimodal Rendering, Holographic / volumetric displays for the learning and teaching of dance. • Work Section 2 : Developing a Database with Data Analytics and Advanced Similarity Search Functionalities making use of innovative Semantic and Emotional Representation Models applied to the data acquired • Work Section 3 : Managing the Work and collaboration between the partners and effectively communicate and disseminate the project outcomes The main purposes of these guidelines are: To define the means of satisfying the objectives for the quality assurance process, and to establish the activities and resources (human organisation, methods and tools) to carry out them; To provide monitoring of all activities, to assure that the project will meet its specified requirements and will be fit-for-use. This guidelines document defines the activities and resources necessary to ensure that the quality requirements of the project are met. It defines quality assurance guidelines and quality assurance activities. It also defines policies for identifying threats on the project and for implementing corrective actions. These guidelines recognise that, with the diversity of the participating project partners, many different quality assurance and control systems are already in place - the guidelines do not, therefore, seek to <b>override</b> existing <b>procedures.</b> This {{document is}} applicable to the WhoLoDancE project until its end unless new updates of these QAG are issued in the course of the project...|$|R
