Production of livefish through aquaculture has also undergone vast changes during the past 20 years. In aquaculture, transport of broodstock from the wild to the hatchery or seed from the hatchery to the growouts forms one of the basic requirements. The demandfor livefiriflsh and shellfish is rapidly increasir^g and in most of the developed countries, more and more livefish traders and restaurants are offering live fishery products to their customers. Air liftiry of live se<^ood has also increased during the last few years. The mcgor constraint to the development of live seafood export is the lack of information on handling the aquatic organisms after they are caught, right through the transport and sale to the customers. Necessary precautions have to be taken while catching, packing and transporting the aquatic organisms. Apart from careful handling, a thorough knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of the animal is necessary to minimise the stress during storage and transportation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction.

Among {{the total number of}} bacteria tested, regardless of the genus and species, 56. 7 % of isolates were found to be sensitive to all antibiotics, 23. 1 % of isolates were resistant to one or two antibiotics, and 20. 2 % of isolates were resistant to three and up to 16 antibiotics.

Pseudomonas isolates showing phenotypic resistance to carbapenems, ureidopenicillins with or without ß-lactamase inhibitor and 3 rd and 4 th generation cephalosporins were tested and found negative for different resistance genes by PCR (MßL, ESBL, KPC, OXA- 23, OXA- 24, OXA- 40, OXA- 58, VIM, IMP, SPM, GIM, NDM, TEM, SHV, CTX-M- 1, CTX-M- 9, OXA- 1, OXA- 9 and the AmpC group, as well as single genes, MOXM, CITM, ACCM, EBCM, FOXM, DHAM).
