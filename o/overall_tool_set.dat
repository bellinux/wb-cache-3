40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in the development in blended learning is to facilitate the individual learning styles of the learners. The alignment of a learning styles assessment with a learning methodology, a mapping between learning styles and social media, recommendations in a guide book for facilitators and a checklist provide a tool set for a sustainable approach for a responsive learning environment. This paper analyzes how the different approaches, methods and studies interact to form an <b>overall</b> <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> to develop a learner-centered mix in blended learning. It proposes a tool set to adapt blended learning to the learning styles of the learners...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to guide {{companies}} in conducting benchmarking studies of their manufacturing processes by viewing across industries, locations and products. In particular, the proposed framework can help corporate decision makers in terms of production footprint and site location studies. The level of benchmarking performance can be measured by evaluating defined benchmarking evaluation profiles. Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops a tool to operationalize value-added manufacturing processes for benchmarking evaluations. In this context, an object-oriented database structure has been developed for the business areas such as product development, manufacturing and assembly. This paper focuses on manufacturing processes. Furthermore, a framework for applying high-performance benchmarking has been developed and applied in a case study. Findings: This paper shows that object class-oriented modeling approach can be applied to manufacturing processes. The higher the degree of independence in terms of locations, industry sectors and products, the more powerful thus a higher performance of benchmarking is achieved. The performance level of benchmarking has been defined by proving and demonstrating higher and lower performance levels. The high-performance benchmarking tool has been successfully applied to a production footprint case study. Originality/value: This paper takes up the superiority of process benchmarking that has been the focus of numerous research papers on benchmarking techniques in the past. The potential of process benchmarking has been enhanced and operationalized as a tool. A classification logic for benchmarking evaluation profiles has been developed and integrated in the <b>overall</b> <b>tool</b> <b>set.</b> The model helps decision makers to configure their benchmarking studies tailored to their strategic entrepreneurial questions and to guide them to achieve a higher benchmarking performance level...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews three Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) based high {{fidelity}} {{air traffic control}} human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations, {{with a focus on}} the expected requirement of enhanced automated trajectory assessment and modification tools to support future air traffic flow management (ATFM) planning positions. The simulations were conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Centers Airspace Operations Laboratory (AOL) in 2009 and 2010. The test airspace for all three simulations assumed the mid-term NextGenEn-Route high altitude environment utilizing high altitude sectors from the Kansas City and Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Centers. Trajectory assessment, modification and coordination decision support tools were developed at the AOL in order to perform future ATFM tasks. <b>Overall</b> <b>tool</b> usage results and user acceptability ratings were collected across three areas of NextGen operatoins to evaluate the tools. In addition to the usefulness and usability feedback, feasibility issues, benefits, and future requirements were also addressed. <b>Overall,</b> the <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> were rated very useful and usable, and many elements of the tools received high scores and were used frequently and successfully. Tool utilization results in all three HITLs showed both user and system benefits including better airspace throughput, reduced controller workload, and highly effective communication protocols in both full Data Comm and mixed-equipage environments...|$|R

This paper introduced the interface specifications and hardware connecting methods of handwheel NK 100 AB 2, developed control program based on PMAC (Programmable Multi-Axis Controller) and industrial personal computer, finally achieved the function of axes selecting and the feed rate selecting. Based on the traditional edge detector <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method, an improved <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method is proposed. The inverted micro milling cutter hilt is used to replace the traditional edge detector, which avoids the opposite reamer error caused by the irregular cutter blade shape, finally, <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> function is achieved through the collecting of electrical signal. The research will provide a useful reference for the {{realization of}} handwheel and <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> of micro milling machine based on PMAC...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical & Computer EngineeringSteve WarrenHandgrip contractions are a {{standard}} exercise modality to evaluate muscular system performance. Most conventional ergometer systems that collect handgrip contraction data are manually controlled, placing {{a burden on}} the researcher to guide subject activity while recording the resultant data. Further, post-processing tools {{for this type of}} experiment are not standardized within the domain, which requires investigators to process their data with multiple <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> and often create custom <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> for that purpose. This can make experimental data difficult to compare and correlate, even within the same research group. This thesis presents updates to a hand-forearm ergometer system that automate the control and data-acquisition processes as well as provide a <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> to post process hand contraction data. The automated system utilizes a LabVIEW virtual instrument as the system centerpiece; it provides the subject/researcher interfaces and coordinates data acquisition from both traditional and new sensors. The <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> also incorporates a collection of MATLAB scripts that allow the investigator to post process these data in {{a standard}} way, such as automating the processes of noise floor removal, burst start/stop time identification, and mean/median frequency calculation in electromyograms (EMGs). The <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> {{has proven to be a}} viable support resource for experimental studies performed by the Kansas State University Human Exercise Physiology lab that target muscle fatigue in human forearms. Initial data acquired during these tests indicate the viability of the system to acquire consistent and physiologically meaningful data while providing a usable <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> for follow-on data analyses...|$|R
