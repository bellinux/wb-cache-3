40|$|Creep {{deformation}} in <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> {{and plates}} {{is of particular}} importance in the power industries. Most failures of <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> occur in the type IV region at the boundary with the parent material, which is relatively much harder. This thesis extends the work of Nicol (1985), Hawkes (1989) and Newman (1993) on the Cosserat theory of plates and shells, and has two major aims. The first is to develop the work of Hawkes to model successfully the strain rates in four-zone, thickwalled <b>welded</b> <b>pipes.</b> It is possible {{to determine the effects}} that the thickness of the pipe wall, the radius of the pipe and the creep index, n, in Norton's law have on the strain-rate distribution throughout the pipe. Using Continuum Damage Mechanics and this Cosserat model, the position and time to rupture in <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> is then calculated. The second aim of this thesis is to develop further the initial modelling work of Nicol (1985) and Hawkes (1989) by obtaining some simple perturbation models for both <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> and plates. The results obtained with the perturbation solutions are then compared with the numerical solutions of Newman (1993) for a plate and the numerical solutions derived in this thesis for a pipe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the corrosion rate of <b>welded</b> carbon steel <b>pipe</b> (ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) A 106 Grade B) by GTAW under the currents of 60, 70, and 80 A. All <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> satisfied <b>weld</b> procedure specifications and were verified by a procedure qualification record. The property of used materials was in agreement with the ASME standard: section IX. The <b>welded</b> <b>pipe</b> was used for schematic model corrosion measurements applied in 3. 5 wt % NaCl at various flow rates and analyzed by using the electrochemical technique with Tafel’s equation. The results showed the correlation between the flow rate and the corrosion rate of the pipe; the greater the flow rate, the higher corrosion rate. Moreover, the <b>welded</b> <b>pipe</b> from the <b>welding</b> current of 70 A exhibited higher tensile strength and corrosion resistance than those from currents of 60 and 80 A. It indicated that the welding current of 70 A produced optimum heat for the welding of A 106 pipe grade B. In addition, the microstructure of the <b>welded</b> <b>pipe</b> was observed by SEM.

40|$|The {{detection}} {{and location of}} hydrogen induced cracks In steel pipes is unreliable and time consuming because of the unpredictable nature of the defect {{and the lack of}} sensitivity of conventional non destructive testing techniques. Determination of the susceptibility of steels to the formation of hydrogen induced cracking by attack from a sour gas environment has always been based on laboratory testing of small samples where the samples are subjected to attack from all sides. This is unrealistic compared to the in-service situation and a single sided exposure test is more realistic. In this thesis the subject literature is reviewed. Experiments on small samples show that seamless steel is the least susceptible to hydrogen induced cracking, whereas electric welded un directionally formed pipe is the most susceptible. The susceptibility of submerged arc <b>welded</b> <b>pipe</b> depends on the metallurgical form of the pipe but is always less susceptible than the electric <b>welded</b> <b>pipe.</b> Ultrasonic techniques have been used to detect the location of hydrogen induced cracks but manual techniques are labour intensive and unreliable. Four complete pipes were subjected to a sour gas environment from one side, one of which was seamless and one electric <b>welded.</b> These <b>pipes</b> were monitored using a passive non destructive testing technique, acoustic emission. A mechanised ultrasonic scanner was used to examine the last two pipes found to be susceptible to cracking using a specially selected ultrasonic transducer. The acoustic emission data collected was used to detect and locate areas of high acoustic activity produced by the formation of hydrogen Induced cracking. These areas were examined metallographically and shown to include several forms of hydrogen induced cracking. The mechanised ultrasonic technique failed to detect near surface (< 1 mm) cracks, but was able to resolve mid wall affected areas. The seamless steel pipe was unaffected, whereas the electric <b>welded</b> <b>pipe</b> was severely affected by the sour gas environment. The automatic <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> suffered varying degrees of attack. This supports laboratory based experiments on small samples reported previously by other workers...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contains}} an overview on automated ultrasonic weld inspection for various pipe types. Some inspection steps might by {{carried out with}} portable test equipment (e. g. pipe end test), but the weld inspection in all internationally relevant specifications must be automated. The pipe geometry, the production process, and the further pipe usage determine if NDT is required and thus, the number of required ultrasonic probes. Recent updates for some test specifications enforce {{a large number of}} ultrasonic probes, e. g. the SHELL standard. To save production cost, seamless pipes are sometimes replaced by ERW (electric-resistance <b>welded)</b> <b>pipes</b> and LSAW (submerged-arc <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> with longitudinal seam) pipes by SSAW (submerged-arc <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> with spiral seam) pipes, the inspection methods change gradually between the various pipe types.

Measurements have been made on pipes subjected to varying degrees of plastic pre-straining before welding, in order to assess the effects of plastic strain on the weld residual stresses and the intergranular strains in the material. The intergranular strains following plastic deformation will also be affected by the annealing effect of the <b>welding.</b> <b>Pipes</b> were initially prepared with plastic strain of 0, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % plastic deformation. Thereafter, the pipes were cut in half and welded with a circumferential butt-weld. Bar specimens were extracted from the remote end of the 0, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % pre-strained and <b>welded</b> <b>pipes.</b> Cross-weld bar specimens were also machined from the 0 and 20 % pre-strained and <b>welded</b> <b>pipes.</b> Neutron diffraction measurements were made at ENGIN-X, ISIS and FRM-II, Munich.
