5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration,</b> feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

40|$|Mai 2004; 9 p. International audienceThe paper {{analyzes}} {{the two major}} components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administrationś</b> climate policy, namely an emission intensity target and a technology strategy. The question is whether those components will generate net emission reductions that will contribute to <b>the</b> stabilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greenhouse gas concentration at a safe level in the long run. It comes out that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> climate policy does not guarantee any meaningful contribution to climate protection. The lenient emission intensity target set by the Administration will most likely allow near term emissions to grow. In the long run, <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> places a big bet on future climate-friendly technological breakthroughs to cost-effectively compensate for the current and near term net emission increases. But <b>the</b> outcomes <b>of</b> those technological developments are uncertain in terms of emission reduction potential, cost, and timing. The way towards enhanced climate protection will most likely not come from <b>the</b> policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current Administration, but rather from the growing concern about the climate issue in Congress and at the state, corporate and civil society levels. These combined forces may raise the playing field {{at the federal level}} in the near future...|$|R

25|$|Many {{adherents of}} the 9/11 Truth {{movement}} suspect that United States government insiders {{played a part}} in the attacks, or may have known the attacks were imminent, and did nothing to alert others or stop them.
