5|$|Not all, <b>one</b> <b>suspects,</b> were yielded willingly to Æthelwold's {{grasping}} representatives... Æthelwold obviously {{wanted his}} monasteries to be centres of spiritual power, an aim {{he sought to}} fulfil by making them the home of as many saints as possible. Undoubtedly too he was anxious to remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Van Severen issued an order proscribing the production of any pro-Nazi literature by members of Verdinaso. Nevertheless, on 9 May 1940, immediately prior to Fall Gelb, Van Severen was {{one of a number of}} far right and far left activists arrested. The arrested men were put under the care of the French Army and stationed near Abbeville. On 20 May, when the advancing German Army cut off the area, a group of French soldiers carried out a massacre and killed a number of members of Verdinaso, Rex and the Belgian Communist Party, among them Van Severen. Twenty <b>one</b> <b>suspects</b> of varying political stripe were selected and executed without trial.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{commercial}} success, reviews were mixed. The most common criticism {{focused on the}} human characters. Michael A. Rogers of Rolling Stone [...] declared that [...] "None of the humans are particularly likable or interesting" [...] and confessed the shark was his favorite character [...] "and <b>one</b> <b>suspects</b> Benchley's also." [...] Steven Spielberg shared the sentiment, saying he initially found many of the characters unsympathetic and wanted the shark to win, a characterization he changed in the film adaptation.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Monfette of IGN {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "This is an adult's {{interpretation of a}} childhood phenomenon, and if you're willing {{to give it a}} shot, <b>one</b> <b>suspects</b> that you'll find yourself entertained enough to give your best, [...] "Yo, Joe!" [...] He gave the film three and a half out of five stars. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times criticized the excessive flashbacks, but praised the action scenes and design, and considered that Marlon Wayans [...] "steals the show". Dan Kois of The Washington Post describing it as [...] "loudest, flashiest, silliest and longest blockbuster in a summer full of long, silly, flashy, loud blockbusters" [...] thought it was [...] "as polished and entertaining as war-mongering toy commercials get".|$|E

2500|$|In one archaic myth, related {{only in the}} Iliad by {{the goddess}} Dione to her {{daughter}} Aphrodite, two chthonic giants, the Aloadae, named Otus and Ephialtes, threw Ares into chains {{and put him in}} a bronze urn, where he remained for thirteen months, a lunar year. [...] "And {{that would have been the}} end of Ares and his appetite for war, if the beautiful Eriboea, the young giants' stepmother, had not told Hermes what they had done," [...] she related.

That day has not yet arrived. If and when it does, let it be said that the editors met the challenges of the post-9/11 era in a way that most other leading American publications did not, and that The New York Review of Books ... was there when we needed it most.|$|E

2500|$|In autumn 1972 Galbraith was {{an adviser}} and {{assistant}} to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern {{in the election}} campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China {{in his role as}} president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was [...] "no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system," [...] "issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, <b>one</b> <b>suspects,</b> with great politeness," [...] "Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York," [...] and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%.|$|E

He amassed a considerable fortune during his life through hard work and <b>one</b> <b>suspects</b> [...] hard nosed commercial brain. A document in the Plymouth and West Devon Record Office shows that his assets and income in 1718 amounted to £21,000. A remarkable sum bearing in mind it had nearly all come from the results of his medical practice. It is very difficult to compare monetary value of the past with today but by way of an example taking a compilation from several sources, in 1718 an average [...] farm labourer would have earned £18 a year and an attorney £120. It was this money which established the family in society for generations to come.|$|E
2500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "faithful, intelligent, admirably acted, superbly shot" [...] and added, [...] "It {{also offers a}} near-perfect case study {{of the ways in}} which film is {{incapable}} of capturing certain crucial literary qualities, in this case the very things that elevate the book from being a merely insightful study of a deteriorating marriage into a remarkable one... Even when the dramatic temperature is cranked up too high, the picture's underpinnings seem only partly present, to the point where <b>one</b> <b>suspects</b> that what it's reaching for dramatically might be all but unattainable—perhaps approachable only by Pinter at his peak." [...] McCarthy later significantly qualified his review, calling Revolutionary Road [...] "problematic" [...] and that it [...] "has some issues that just won't go away". He concludes that Revolutionary Road suffers in comparison to Billy Wilder's The Apartment and Richard Quine's Strangers When We Meet because of its [...] "narrow vision", even arguing that the television series Mad Men handles the issues of conformity, frustration, and hypocrisy [...] "with more panache and precision".|$|E

2500|$|Relapse {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. It holds an aggregate score of 59, based on 27 reviews, at Metacritic. Despite calling it an [...] "impressively focused and clever work", Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers felt {{the music was}} [...] "not transcendent" [...] and commented that [...] "Eminem could have pulled his music into a new category. What he presents is still powerful, but narrowly cast". Andy Gill of The Independent found the album to be [...] "drably repetitive, while its dated tone is emphasised by the return of Dr Dre as producer." [...] NMEs Louis Pattison found Eminem's wordplay [...] "wicked {{in the depths of}} its depravity", but felt that [...] "the overriding feel is of an album just too jaded, too joyless to truly count as a return to form". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson viewed that [...] "the further Relapse strays from narrative veracity, the more <b>one</b> <b>suspects</b> his fanbase feels he's tapping into his bottomless well for horror-show grandstanding." [...] The Times called Relapse [...] "an album that sits square between what Eminem is theoretically still capable of and what we feared he has become." [...] Nathan Rabin, writing in The A.V. Club, panned it as [...] "facile pre-adolescent shock mixed with gory, corpse-strewn, Fangoria-damaged horrorcore." [...] MSN Music's Robert Christgau called it a [...] "dud" [...] and accused Eminem of sensationalism: [...] "this is not a Slim Shady album. Slim Shady had a lightness about him".|$|E
