5|$|<b>Our</b> <b>understanding</b> of {{herbivory}} in {{geological time}} comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defense (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; {{the observation of}} plant debris in fossilised animal faeces; {{and the construction of}} herbivore mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge about dinosaurs {{is derived}} {{from a variety of}} fossil and non-fossil records, {{including}} fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues. Many fields of study contribute to <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of dinosaurs, including physics (especially biomechanics), chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} {{of quantum mechanics}} to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field, which are extended in space and time, is known as quantum field theory.

Quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle-like objects called quasiparticles.|$|E
5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance in <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of string theory and quantum gravity.

5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E

Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental to <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse {{under the influence of}} gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E

40|$|Generations, and generational categories, offer a {{means of}} organising <b>our</b> <b>understandings</b> of age and age-related issues. Particularly within practitioner-orientated debates, {{differences}} between generations are highlighted as creating tensions which organisations must address. In contrast, we offer a critical interrogation of generations and unpack the implications of particular constructions. Specifically we examine the discursive construction of generational issues in UK online news about age at work, focusing on baby boomers and the lost generation. We highlight the discursive work involved in constructing each generation as entitled to work and how responsibility for employment issues is variously positioned. These inter-related concerns develop into a debate about consequences, as {{different versions of the}} future are constructed. In contrast to essentialised <b>understandings,</b> <b>our</b> study shows how generations and generational categories are constructed and organise understandings of age at work. We further highlight how the constructions of generational differences and tensions become enrolled and legitimate age-related differences with regard to work. Such insights are essential to further <b>our</b> <b>understandings</b> of age-related issues in contemporary organising...|$|R
