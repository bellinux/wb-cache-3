5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the smokescreen, they dropped the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a mile from the battleship. Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.|$|E

25|$|British {{accounts}} {{describe the}} use of the rockets during the third and fourth wars. During the climactic battle at Srirangapatna in 1799, British shells struck a magazine containing rockets, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements. After Tipu's defeat in the fourth war the British captured a number of the Mysorean rockets. These became influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
25|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported {{hearing a}} sharp crack followed by cessation of {{noise from the}} engines. When they looked up they saw the Stinson spiralling downwards. Part of one wing had separated from {{the remainder of the}} aircraft and it was drifting slowly towards the ground. As they watched, they saw the whole tail assembly break free from the fuselage. Moments later the wreckage struck the ground and a pall <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> rose into the air. Part of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, continued to drift down slowly and reached the ground about ¾mile (1.2km) from the main wreckage.|$|E

25|$|In {{industrial}} cities local {{experts and}} reformers, especially after 1890, {{took the lead}} in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms. Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The Coal Smoke Abatement Society was formed in Britain in 1898 {{making it one of the}} oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir William Blake Richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>smoke.</b> The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{powerful}} explosion sent a ball {{of flame}} rolling {{down the street and}} a pall <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> rose upwards. The blast wave ripped into the crowds of people who had run into Donegall Street for safety, tossing them in all directions and killing another four men outright: three of them, Ernest Dougan (39), James Macklin (30) and Samuel Trainor (39) were corporation binmen working in the area, and the fourth man was Sydney Bell (65). Trainor was also an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier {{and a member of the}} Orange Order. A seriously wounded pensioner, Henry Miller (79) would die in hospital on 5 April. Most of the bodies of the dead were mutilated beyond recognition; one of the binmen lay in the road with his head shattered. With the exception of Constable O'Neill, who had been a Catholic, the other six victims were Protestants.|$|E

25|$|When a thick cloud <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> {{was spotted}} on Yermak, the Soviet {{icebreaker}} turned back east without firing {{a shot and}} called in reinforcements – her crew had mistaken Tarmo for the Finnish coastal defence ship Väinämöinen and ordered an airstrike against the ship they {{thought to be the}} most powerful warship of the Finnish Navy. In the meantime Tarmo opened fire on Kazakhstan. However, the guns malfunctioned again and only two shells were fired from the stern gun at the Soviet ship some seven miles away, both of which fell short. Continuing the naval engagement without operational guns was deemed futile and a decision was made to turn back to Kotka and return once the guns could be used again. On the way back the Soviet fighters and bombers attacked Tarmo several times, but none of the planes scored a hit on the Finnish icebreaker due to intense anti-aircraft fire. Around half past noon Tarmo arrived in Kotka and lunch was served for the crew.|$|E

500|$|Brothers Franz and Carl Hailer and {{the other}} two men in their party were from a German {{reconnaissance}} unit, Flieger-Abteilung A292.

The Hispano engine was known to flood its inlet manifold with fuel when upside down and then stop running. Franz Hailer and his three companions hurried to the crash site. [...] Ball was already dead when they arrived. [...] The four German airmen agreed that the crashed craft had suffered no battle damage. [...] No bullet wounds were found on Ball's body, even though Hailer went through Ball's clothing to find identification. Hailer also took Ball to a field hospital. A German doctor subsequently described a broken back and a crushed chest, along with fractured limbs, as the cause of death.|$|E

500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching a lot <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package on the aerodrome with a note reading, [...] "If you won't come up here and fight, herewith a pair of boots for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|E
