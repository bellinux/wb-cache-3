50|$|Microdialysis is a minimally-invasive {{sampling}} technique {{that is used}} for continuous measurement of free, unbound analyte concentrations in the extracellular fluid of virtually any tissue. Analytes may include endogenous molecules (e.g. neurotransmitter, hormones, glucose, etc.) to assess their biochemical functions in the body, or exogenous compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals) to determine their distribution within the body. The microdialysis technique requires the insertion of a small microdialysis catheter (also referred to as microdialysis probe) into the tissue of interest. The microdialysis probe is designed to mimic a blood capillary and consists of a shaft with a semipermeable hollow fiber membrane at its tip, which is connected to inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing.</b> The probe is continuously perfused with an aqueous solution (perfusate) that closely resembles the (ionic) composition of the surrounding tissue fluid at a low flow rate of approximately 0.1-5μL/min. Once inserted into the tissue or (body)fluid of interest, small solutes can cross the semipermeable membrane by passive diffusion. The direction of the analyte flow {{is determined by the}} respective concentration gradient and allows the usage of microdialysis probes as sampling as well as delivery tools. The solution leaving the probe (dialysate) is collected at certain time intervals for analysis.|$|E

Multiple porous stainless steel tubes were positioned 4 cm apart in a shallow tray (44 cm long, 32 cm wide and 8 cm deep), and then covered with a 4 cm layer of fine medium (≤ 1 mm in diameter). Nutrient solution was recirculated through the porous tubes under a negative pressure maintained with a siphoning procedure.

40|$|In {{anticipation}} of the TMIST- 2 experiment in the Advanced Test Reactor, {{there was a need}} to determine if the tritium that is expected to be observed at the outlet of the experiment would be seen or if it may be lost on its way from the experiment in the core to the measurement station. To assist in resolving that issue, a bench-scale experiment was conducted in the Idaho National Laboratory’s Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) facility using deuterium and a mass spectrometer in lieu of tritium with ion chambers, bubblers, and scintillation counting. The experiment replicated the concentration of the hydrogen isotope, the flow rates anticipated, and the residence times. It was found that there was initial uptake on tubing walls, presumably due to oxidation of the hydrogen isotopes to water and adsorption or isotopic exchange, but that saturates relatively quickly, and once saturated, the concentration of deuterium at the <b>outlet</b> of the <b>tubing</b> system was essentially {{the same as it was}} at the experiment inlet under the conditions modeled in the experiment...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} macrolides as P-glycoprotein inhibitors {{on the level of}} intestinal absorption of digoxin. Methods: Jejunal segments of anaesthetized rats were cannulated and perfused by digoxin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C in {{the presence or absence of}} macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin). Samples were obtained from <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing</b> at different time points and digoxin concentration assayed. The effective permeability of the drug was calculated after analyzing the samples using reverse-phase HPLC method.

40|$|Reduction of priming {{volumes of}} the {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) circuit in neonatal cardiac surgery to decrease haemodilution and blood transfusion requirements can be achieved {{with the use of}} neonatal low prime oxygenators and smaller diameter tubing. We have further reduced our prime volume {{with the use of a}} custom-designed arm allowing for remote positioning of a double-headed roller pump. This arm enables the double pump to be placed alongside the main heart-lung machine close to the operating table, and to position the pump inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing</b> immediately at the reservoir outlet and oxygenator inlet, respectively, therefore reducing tubing lengths. Priming volumes of four cases using this configuration were compared to four cases using our standard neonatal bypass setup. Results showed a 29 % decrease in priming volume and a 58 % reduction in blood utilization during CPB. This reduction in priming volume is clinically significant as it lowers the ratio of priming volume to patient blood volume and reduces homologous blood requirements...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{efficient}} method to concentrate suspensions in a flow channel comprising sparse periodic arrays of obstacles. The obstacle spacings {{are a few}} {{times larger than the}} diameter of the particles. We perform up-scaled experiments, in which all particles flow along a few obstacle lines rotated with respect to the main flow direction. We found that for a diluted suspension a single line is sufficient to displace all particles into a concentrated stream. With visual high speed camera images particle–particle interactions were observed at increasing concentrations. Although one obstacle line was no longer enough to retain all particles, few additional obstacle lines facilitated good separation. This provides the insight that while the angle of the lines determines the primary separation, the number of lines is coupled to the maximum particle volume fraction that can be separated. With CFD simulations we showed that the flow resistance in these sparse arrays is very low and that the flow distribution across the outlets is easily controlled by the <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing.</b> These conclusions show the potential of sparse obstacle arrays for effective concentration of suspensions...|$|E
30|$|A {{control circuit}} (“Minimax”) was tested to {{evaluate}} ULFED hemolysis against an approved low-flow blood oxygenator (Minimax Plus; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Blood {{flow in the}} control loop was maintained at the minimum rate necessary (1250  mL/min) to match ULFED CO 2 removal performance {{according to the manufacturer}} [28].

40|$|A unique {{in-house}} designed experimental apparatus {{for investigation}} of nucleation of droplets in CCS relevant systems {{is being developed}} by the present team. The apparatus allows simulating various processes relevant to CCS technologies. Gaseous mixtures with CO 2 are prepared in a Mixture Preparation (MPD) based on accurate adjustment of flow rates of individual components [EPJ Web of Conferences 143, 02140 (2017) ]. The mixture then flows into an expansion chamber, where it undergoes a rapid adiabatic expansion. As a consequence of adiabatic cooling, the mixture becomes supersaturated and nucleation and simultaneous growth of droplets occurs. In this study, we describe the design and testing of the expansion part of the experimental setup. The rapid expansion was realized using two valve systems, one for low pressures (up to 0. 7 MPa) {{and the other for}} high pressures (up to 10 MPa). A challenge for a proper design of the expansion system is avoiding acoustic oscillations. These can occur either in the mode of Helmholtz resonator, where the compressible gas in the chamber acts as a spring and the rapidly moving in the valve system as a mass, or in the “flute” mode, where acoustic waves are generated in a long <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing.</b> ...|$|E

Molecular properties of drugs including the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, log P, logD, topological polar surface area and number of rotatable bonds were considered. The results indicated that compounds which meet 10 or fewer number of rotatable bonds and topological surface area equal to or less than 140 A&# 9702; have a high probability of good intestinal permeability and fraction of dose which is absorbed in human. Moreover the results indicated that lower number of hydrogen bond counts and higher logD and logP values are associated with higher permeability and bioavailabilty of drugs. Therefore the experimental and computational methods could be used for the prediction of intestinal drug permeability...|$|E
40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} device for {{measuring}} the electrical conductivity of a flowing liquid. Unlike prior such devices, this one does not trap gas bubbles entrained in the liquid. Usually, the electrical conductivity of a liquid is measured by use of two electrodes immersed in the liquid. A typical prior device based on this concept contains large cavities that can trap gas. Any gas present between or near the electrodes causes a significant offset in the conductivity reading and, if the gas becomes trapped, then the offset persists. Extensive tests on two-phase (liquid/ gas) flow have shown {{that in the case}} of liquid flowing along a section of tubing, gas entrained in the liquid is not trapped in the section as long as the inner wall of the section is smooth and continuous, and the section is the narrowest tubing section along the flow path. The design of the device is based on the foregoing observation: The electrodes and the insulators separating the electrodes constitute adjacent parts of the walls of a tube. The bore of the tube is machined to make the wall smooth and to provide a straight flow path from the inlet to the outlet. The diameter of the electrode/insulator tube assembly is less than the diameter of the inlet or <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing.</b> An outer shell contains the electrodes and insulators and constitutes a leak and pressure barrier. Any gas bubble flowing through this device causes only a momentary conductivity offset that is filtered out by software used to process the conductivity readings...|$|E

Clarithromycin nanoparticles were prepared by nano-precipitation according to the modified quasi emulsion solvent diffusion technique and evaluated for their physicochemical characteristics. Permeability coefficients (Peff) in anaesthetized rats were determined at 3 different concentrations.

Microbiological assay of CLA and phenol red in the samples were analyzed using an agar well diffusion procedure and HPLC method respectively. The average particle size of prepared nanoparticles was 305 &# 177; 134 nm.

30|$|The sample {{preparation}} was conducted as previously described (Lachenmeier et al. 2006). In short, {{the sample was}} temperated in a water bath at 20  °C. Following this, the sample was pipetted into a 250  mL Kjeldatherm digestion tube. Rests of the sample sticking {{to the edge of}} the tube were rinsed down with distilled water. Subsequently the tube was clamped in the distillation device. After placing a graduated flask filled with 3  mL of distilled water under the distillate <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing,</b> the program was started, and the distillation was automatically performed while occasionally shaking the receiver flask. After termination, the receiver and the tube were replaced and the hoses were rinsed with distilled water to be ready for the next sample. The graduated flask with the distillate was shaken, temperated in a water bath at 20  °C and filled up to the calibration mark with water (20  °C) and again shaken. The shaking steps of the flask are absolutely essential because a considerably inhomogeneity of the solution has been observed following distillation, which may lead to errors up to 5  % vol if the solution is not carefully homogenized. An aliquot of the distillate (about 20  mL) was filled into glass vials placed into the autosampler and the alcoholic strength was automatically determined with the oscillation-type density meter. As alternative to pipetting, samples (temperated at 20  °C) may be filled in graduated flasks, followed by filling the content of the flask into the Kjeldatherm digestion tube. The residues in the flask then need to be carefully rinsed 3 times with distilled water into the Kjeldatherm digestion tube.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{patients}} on long-term oxygen therapy use stationary oxygen delivery systems. It {{is not uncommon}} for guidelines to instruct patients to use tubing lengths no longer than 19. 68 ft (6 m) when using an oxygen concentrator and 49. 21 ft (15 m) when using cylinders. However, these concepts are not based on sufficient evidence. Thus, our objective was to evaluate whether a 98. 42 -ft (30 -m) tubing length affects oxygen flow and FIO 2 delivery from 1 cylinder and 2 oxygen concentrators. METHODS: the 3 oxygen delivery systems were randomly selected, and 1, 3, and 5 L/min flows and Floz were measured 5 times at each flow at the proximal and distal outlets of the tubing by a gas-flow analyzer. Paired Student (test was used to analyze the difference between flows and FIO 2 at proximal and distal outlets of tubing length. RESULTS: A total of 45 flows were measured between proximal and distal outlets of the 98. 42 -ft (30 -m) tubing. Flows were similar for 1 and 3 L/min, but distal flow was higher than proximal flow at 5 L/min (5. 57 x 5. 14 L/min, P <. 001). FIO 2 was lower at distal than proximal <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing</b> at flows 1, 3, and 5 L/min, but the mean difference between measurements was less than 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Tubing length of 98. 42 ft (30 m) may be used by patients for home delivery oxygen with flows up to 5 L/min, as there were no important changes in flows or FIO 2.

40|$|In two-sided {{structural}} cold plates, typically {{there is}} a structural member, such as a honeycomb panel, that provides the structural strength for the cold plates that cool equipment. The cold plates are located {{on either side of}} the structural member and thus need to have the cooling fluid supplied to them. One method of accomplishing this is to route the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing</b> to both sides of the structural member. Another method might be to supply the inlet to one side and the outlet to the other. With the latter method, an external feature such as a hose, tube, or manifold must be incorporated to pass the fluid from one side of the structural member to the other. Although this is a more compact design than the first option, since it eliminates the need for a dedicated supply and return line to each side of the structural member, it still poses problems, as these external features can be easily damaged and are now new areas for potential fluid leakage. This invention eliminates the need for an external feature and instead incorporates the feature internally to the structural member. This is accomplished by utilizing a threaded insert that not only connects the cold plate to the structural member, but also allows the cooling fluid to flow through it into the structural member, and then to the cold plate on the opposite side. The insert also employs a cap that acts as a cover to seal the open area needed to install the insert. There are multiple options for location of o-ring style seals, as well as the option to use adhesive for redundant sealing. Another option is to weld the cap to the cold plate after its installation, thus making it an integral part of the structural member. This new configuration allows the fluid to pass from one cold plate to the other without any exposed external features...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidics is {{the science}} of {{processing}} microliters or less of fluid {{at a time in}} a channel with dimensions on the order of microns. The small size of the channels allows fluid properties to be studied in a world dominated by viscosity, surface tension, and diffusion rather than gravity and inertia. Microfluidic droplet generation is a well studied and understood phenomena, which has attracted attention due to its potential applications in biology, medicine, chemistry and a wide range of industries. This dissertation adds to the field of microfluidic droplet studies by studying individual droplet deformation and the process of scaling-up microfluidic devices for industrial use. ^ The study of droplet deformation under extensional and mixed shear and extensional flows was performed within a microfluidic device. Droplets were generated using a flow-focusing device and then sent through a hyperbolic contraction downstream of the droplet generator. The hyperbolic contraction allowed the smallest droplets to be deformed by purely extensional flows and for the larger droplets to experience mixed extensional and shear flows. The shear resulted from the proximity of the droplet to the walls of the microfluidic channel. The continuous phase in all of these devices was oil and the dispersed phase was water, an aqueous surfactant solution, or an aqueous suspension of colloidal particles. Droplet deformation dynamics are affected by the use of surfactants and colloidal particles, which are commonly used to stabilize emulsion droplets again coalescence. ^ Microfluidic droplet generating devices have many potential industrial applications, however, due to the low output of product from a single droplet generating device, their potential has not been realized. Using six parallel flow-focusing droplet generators on a single chip, the process of microfluidic droplet formation can be scaled up, thus resulting in a higher output of droplets. The tuning of droplet size and production frequency can be achieved on chip by varying the <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing</b> lengths, thus allowing for a single device to be used to generate a range of droplet sizes. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} thermodynamic operating parameter {{goals for the}} steady state operation of the control dewar/solenoid system. Specifically, how the control dewar pressure control valve, PV- 3062 -H and the magnet flow control valve EVMF are operated to give the lowest possible temperature fluid at the solenoid magnet. The goals are: (1) For PV- 3062 -H - The process variable is the helium reservoir pressure, minimize the reservoir pressure, provide only enough pressure plus a little margin to ensure leads flow; and (2) For EVMF - The process variable is firstly a manual setpoint of flowrate as read by the flow venturi, FE 3253 -H, and secondly the reservoir liquid level, minimize the pressure drop thru the solenoid cooling tubes, provide at least enough flow to maintain reservoir level and stable operation of the magnet. The thermodynamic states for the fluid thru the system are shown on the Pressure versus Temperature graph. Lines of constant enthalpy are also shown. State A is shown as two phase liquid entering the inlet of the subcooler. The subcooler subcools the fluid to State B. State B to State C {{is caused by the}} pressure drop across EVMF. State C to D is the estimated pressure drop from the outlet of EVMF thru the solenoid cooling tubes and back up to the helium reservoir inlet. To give the coolest fluid in the cooling tubes, the two phase fluid in the reservoir should be at the lowest pressure (and thus temperature). This lowest pressure is limited by the required pressure for leads flow and if this does not dominate, the low pressure side pressure drop thru the refrigerator and suction pressure set point. My guess is the lead flow requirement will dominate. I suggest putting the PV- 3062 -H set point such that the lead flow control valves operate at about 80 % open. The second parameter that will give the coolest fluid in the cooling tubes is a minimized pressure drop thru the cooling tubes. This can be accomplished by providing a minimized flowrate, sufficient only to ensure that the reservoir level is full and some liquid fraction leaves the helium <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing.</b> D-Zero Engineering note, EN- 338, 'LHe Flow Regime/Pressure Drop for DO Solenoid at Steady State Conditions' shows that even though the gas fraction increases at lower flowrates, the pressure drop decreases. This goal is ideal, and assumes good cooling at the magnet. Real effects such hot spots or quench experience in the magnet may necessitate a higher flowrate. The current design flow rate from Toshiba is somewhere around 2. 5 gls which is very low. Experience with the accuracy of the venturi flowmeter, coil characteristics etc. and some conservativeness will help determine the optimum flowrate. I would venture a guess {{that it would be a}} minimum of 5 g/s. The philosophy that I have been taking with transfer line and valve sizing is such that our refrigerator system will have the ability to supply up to at least 20 g/s if required and necessary. Preferably we will be around 5 g/s...|$|E
40|$|This project {{determined}} {{the performance of}} a new high efficiency refrigerant, Ikon B, in a residential air conditioner designed to use R- 22. The refrigerant R- 22, used in residential and small commercial air conditioners, is being phased out of production in developed countries beginning this year because of concerns regarding its ozone depletion potential. Although a replacement refrigerant, R- 410 A, is available, it operates at much higher pressure than R- 22 and requires new equipment. R- 22 air conditioners will continue to be in use for many years to come. Air conditioning is a large part of expensive summer peak power use {{in many parts of the}} U. S. Previous testing and computer simulations of Ikon B indicated that it would have 20 - 25 % higher coefficient of performance (COP, the amount of cooling obtained per energy used) than R- 22 in an air-cooled air conditioner. In this project, a typical new R- 22 residential air conditioner was obtained, installed in a large environmental chamber, instrumented, and run both with its original charge of R- 22 and then with Ikon B. In the environmental chamber, controlled temperature and humidity could be maintained to obtain repeatable and comparable energy use results. Tests with Ikon B included runs with and without a power controller, and an extended run for several months with subsequent analyses to check compatibility of Ikon B with the air conditioner materials and lubricant. Baseline energy use of the air conditioner with its original R- 22 charge was measured at 90 deg F and 100 deg F. After changeover to Ikon B and a larger expansion orifice, energy use was measured at 90 deg F and 100 deg F. Ikon B proved to have about 19 % higher COP at 90 deg F and about 26 % higher COP at 100 deg F versus R- 22. Ikon B had about 20 % lower cooling capacity at 90 deg F and about 17 % lower cooling capacity at 100 deg F versus R- 22 in this system. All results over multiple runs were within 1 % relative standard deviation (RSD). All of these values agree well with previous results and computer simulations of Ikon B performance versus R- 22. The lower cooling capacity of Ikon B is not a concern unless a particular air conditioner is near its maximum cooling capacity in application. Typically, oversized A/C systems are installed by contractors to cover contingencies. In the extended run with Ikon B, which lasted about 4. 5 months at 100 deg F ambient temperature and 68 % compressor on time, the air conditioner performed well with no significant loss of energy efficiency. Post-run analysis of the refrigerant, compressor lubricant oil, compressor, compressor <b>outlet</b> <b>tubing,</b> and the filter/dryer showed minor effects but nothing that was considered significant. The project was very successful. All objectives were achieved, and the performance of Ikon B indicates that it can easily be retrofitted into R- 22 air conditioners to give 15 - 20 % energy savings and a 1 - 3 year payback of retrofit costs depending on location and use. Ikon B has the potential to be a successful commercial product...|$|E
