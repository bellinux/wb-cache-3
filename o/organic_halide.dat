2500|$|Since 1979, Suzuki {{coupling}} {{has been}} an efficient method for aryl-aryl bond formation. [...] The reaction conditions of Suzuki coupling {{for the formation of}} a biphenyl repeat unit for CMPs include the palladium catalyzed cross-coupling of an organo-boron reagent with an <b>organic</b> <b>halide</b> or sulfonate in the presence of some base. An advantage of using this method to synthesize CMPs is that reaction conditions are mild, there is commercial availability of organo-boron reagents, and the reaction has high functional group tolerance.

40|$|Highly {{reactive}} copper {{was prepared}} by the lithium naphthalide reductions of various copper(I) salt/ligand complexes. In particular, the reductions of copper(I) halide/phosphine complexes resulted {{in the production of}} active copper which reacted with a variety of <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> to form highly functionalized, stable organocopper species. The nature and reactivity of the active copper was found to be highly dependent upon the choice of copper(I) salt and particularly upon the choice of ligand (phosphine). Organocopper species containing ester, nitrile, chloride, and even remote ketone and epoxide groups were prepared directly from the corresponding organic iodides or bromides. These highly functionalized copper reagents were utilized in a variety of reactions including conjugate additions to unsaturated carbonyl systems, epoxide-opening reactions, reactions with acid chlorides to form ketones, and cross-coupling reactions with other <b>organic</b> <b>halides.</b> Additionally, the copper was used to effect homocoupling of various <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> under very mild conditions. ^ Active nickel was used effectively for the room temperature generation of o-xylylene intermediates from the corresponding α,α'-dihalo-o-xylene species. These highly reactive intermediates were efficiently trapped in situ with electron-deficient olefins, yielding substituted 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene cycloadducts in moderate to good yields. Isoindene and 2, 3 -dihydronaphthalene intermediates were generated and trapped in an analogous fashion to give the one- or two-carbon bridged cycloadducts, respectively. ^ Active zinc was used for preparing organozinc halide species directly from <b>organic</b> <b>halides.</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> could contain considerable functionality such as ester, nitrile, and chloride groups.

The organozinc halides underwent facile transmetallation with copper(I) cyanide complexes, generating highly functionalized cuprate species. These cuprates were found to be effective for conjugate additions to unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and for the formation of ketones from the coupling reaction with acid chlorides. ...|$|R
