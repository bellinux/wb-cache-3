5|$|Enola Gay was {{personally}} selected by Colonel Paul W.

Crew B-9, commanded by Captain Robert A. Lewis, took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509th's base at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, on 14 June 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1945, Tibbets {{formally}} {{named his}} B-29 Enola Gay after his mother. Enola Gay had been personally selected by him {{while it was}} still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> at the Glenn L. Martin Company plant in Bellevue, Nebraska. The regularly assigned aircraft commander, Robert A. Lewis, was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious {{when he arrived at the}} aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.|$|E

5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E
25|$|Some P-38G {{production}} was diverted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> to F-5A reconnaissance aircraft.

25|$|IGUs {{are often}} {{manufactured}} on a {{made to order}} basis on factory production lines, but standard units are also available. The width and height dimensions, {{the thickness of the}} glass panes and the type of glass for each pane as well as the overall thickness of the unit must be supplied to the manufacturer. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line,</b> spacers of specific thicknesses are cut and assembled into the required overall width and height dimensions and filled with desiccant. On a parallel line, glass panes are cut to size and washed to be optically clear.|$|E
25|$|In early July 1953, {{the first}} US-built {{production}} aircraft (52-1418) rolled out; it conducted its maiden flight on 20 July 1953. One month later, this initial production aircraft {{was accepted by}} the USAF, by which point a cessation of hostilities had come into effect in Korea. This {{was one of only}} eight B-57A Canberras to be manufactured; the remaining 67 aircraft from this first batch, deemed no longer to be required as bombers, were converted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> to serve as medium-altitude reconnaissance aircraft while retaining all the basic Canberra features, and were accordingly re-designated as the RB-57A Canberra.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, workers started {{organizing}} {{to improve}} labor conditions. This proved difficult. Charles Piaget, {{the son of}} a clockwork artisan, who began working at the factory in 1946 as a skilled worker, became a representative of the Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens (CFTC, French Confederation of Christian Workers) trade union. He later recalled that during national strikes, only 30 or 40 workers at LIP {{out of a total of}} 1200 would go on strike. Those who did strike were listed by the management and called in to explain themselves. Semi-skilled workers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> were not allowed to talk or move more than 25 centimeters (less than ten inches) during their shifts.|$|E
25|$|With the {{injection}} of capital from its new Chinese owners, production resumed on 26 February 2014, beginning with the completion of five previously incomplete airframes already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> In April 2014 at Sun n Fun, the company announced a US$50M investment, including {{the construction of a}} Mooney museum in Kerrville to be run by a new nonprofit organization. With production underway, 85 employees were at work, with the workforce forecast to expand to 140 by the end of 2014. Chief Executive Officer Chen stated the company would deliver 6 aircraft in 2014 and 30 in 2015. In January 2015 the first aircraft, a Mooney M20TN, was delivered to a customer in China. The aircraft was shipped disassembled and then assembled and test flown in Zhengzhou, China.|$|E
25|$|A junior {{representative}} for South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Central District {{as well as}} playing cricket, Lehmann left school {{at the age of}} 16 to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> of Holden car manufacturers in Elizabeth, South Australia. He declined selection to the first intake of the newly formed Australian Cricket Academy, a full-time cricket centre, citing his enjoyment of the factory life. Lehmann entered the first-class scene as a 17-year-old in the 1987/88 season for South Australia, playing one match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after both Tim May and Peter Sleep were called into the national team. After making 10, Lehmann was omitted upon their return and did not play any further part in the season. In 1988/89, South Australia were {{at the bottom of the}} ladder, when coach Barry Richards called Lehmann into the team, playing against Western Australia at the WACA. Lehmann remembered little of the match; after being struck in the right temple by a Bruce Reid bouncer, he was knocked unconscious and temporarily ceased breathing. Lehmann made his mark in the following match against New South Wales Blues at Adelaide Oval, reaching 50, but the innings was marred by the manner in which it was ended. Going for a quick single, Lehmann collided with bowler Geoff Lawson and was run out after falling over. However, Richards and South Australian captain David Hookes claimed that Lawson had tripped Lehmann, leading to a confrontation between the two teams.|$|E

The bomb, code-named [...] "Little Boy", was targeted at the city of Hiroshima, Japan, and caused unprecedented destruction. Enola Gay participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target, Nagasaki, being bombed instead.|$|E
500|$|Solis {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California, as the {{daughter}} of immigrant parents who had met in citizenship class and married in 1953: Juana Sequeira (b.1926, from Nicaragua) and Raúl Solís (from Mexico). Her father was a Teamsters shop steward in Mexico and, after coming to the United States, worked at the Quemetco battery recycling plant in the City of Industry in the San Gabriel Valley. There he again organized for the Teamsters, to gain better health care benefits for workers, but also contracted lead poisoning. [...] Her mother worked for over 20years <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> of Mattel once her children were all of school age, belonged to the United Rubber Workers, and was outspoken about working conditions.
