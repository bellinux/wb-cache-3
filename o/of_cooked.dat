5|$|The {{extensive}} and complex arrangements required {{to support the}} infantry attack from {{the west and the}} mounted attack from the east were completed by 30 October, when these attacking forces moved to positions within a day's march of their deployment. Three divisions of XX Corps were concentrated in position: the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Goz el Geleib, the 60th (London) Division at Esani and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division at Khasif. In preparation for their final approach march, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen's Westminster Rifles (179th Brigade, 60th Division) were supplied with tea and rum for the following day. In their haversack rations were five onions, a tin of bully beef, a slice <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> bacon, biscuits and dates.|$|E
5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> vegetables.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

5000|$|All {{students}} <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> owe {{an enormous}} debt to Beaglehole for his all-encompassing editorship. So much so, in fact, that {{today it is}} difficult to view the subject <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> except through Beaglehole's perspective. Some recent biographies <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> have tended to be little else than abbreviated versions of Beaglehole. Nevertheless, {{it is also clear that}} Beaglehole’s work is, by and large, a continuation of the long tradition <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> idealisation, a tradition from which post-Beaglehole scholarship has started to diverge. [...] For Beaglehole, Cook was a heroic figure who could do practically no wrong, and he is scathing about those contemporaries <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> who ever ventured to criticise his hero, such as Alexander Dalrymple, the geographer, and Johann Reinhold Forster, who accompanied Cook on the second voyage. Recent research has to some extent rehabilitated both Dalrymple and Forster.|$|R

25|$|However, {{while it}} has flavor/texture {{components}} {{of each of the}} above, it is not prepared from a meat emulsion. Thus, it has the grainy consistency <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> salami or kielbasa rather than that of bologna or hot dogs. In fact, smoked kielbasa might be the closest nationwide comparison. But, pork roll is a bit sweeter, and that extra sugar becomes caramelized when it is fried or grilled, which adds to the final flavor. Also, the tangy variety includes lactic acid starter culture in its preparation, which adds a sour flavor component like some dry cured salami's or pepperoni.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{connection to}} grain {{was made in}} 1897 by Christiaan Eijkman (1858–1930), a military doctor in the Dutch Indies, discovered that fowl fed on a diet <b>of</b> <b>cooked,</b> polished rice developed paralysis, which could be reversed by discontinuing rice polishing. He attributed beriberi to a nerve poison in the endosperm of rice, from which the outer layers of the grain gave protection to the body. An associate, Gerrit Grijns (1865–1944), correctly interpreted the connection between excessive consumption of polished rice and beriberi in 1901: He concluded that rice contains an essential nutrient in the outer layers of the grain that is removed by polishing.|$|E

25|$|Korean temple cuisine {{originated}} in Buddhist temples of Korea. Since Buddhism was introduced into Korea, Buddhist traditions have strongly influenced Korean cuisine, as well. During the Silla period (57 BCE– 935 CE), chalbap (찰밥, a bowl <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> glutinous rice) yakgwa (a fried dessert) and yumilgwa (a fried and puffed rice snack) were served for Buddhist altars {{and have been}} developed into types of hangwa, Korean traditional confectionery. During the Goryeo Dynasty, sangchu ssam (wraps made with lettuce), yaksik, and yakgwa were developed, and since spread to China and other countries. Since the Joseon Dynasty, Buddhist cuisine {{has been established in}} Korea according to regions and temples.|$|E
25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string <b>of</b> (<b>cooked)</b> spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|E
500|$|Naem is a red-colored, {{semi-dry}} lactic-fermented pork sausage in Thai cuisine prepared using minced raw {{pork and}} pork skin, significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> sticky rice, chili peppers, garlic, sugar, salt and potassium nitrate. [...] Minced beef is sometimes used in its preparation. After the mix is prepared, it is encased in banana leaves, synthetic sausage casings or tubular plastic bags {{and left to}} ferment for three to five days. Naem has a sour quality to it due to the fermentation, in which lactic acid bacteria and yeasts grow within the sausage. The lactic acid bacteria and yeasts expand by feeding upon the rice and sugar, {{and the use of}} salt prevents the meat from rotting.|$|E

500|$|In 1836 the Poor Law Commission {{distributed}} six diets for workhouse inmates, one {{of which}} was to be chosen by each Poor Law Union depending on its local circumstances. [...] Although dreary, the food was generally nutritionally adequate, and according to contemporary records was prepared with great care. [...] Issues such as training staff to serve and weigh portions were well understood. [...] The diets included general guidance, as well as schedules for each class of inmate. [...] They were laid out on a weekly rotation, the various meals selected on a daily basis, from a list of foodstuffs. [...] For instance, a breakfast of bread and gruel was followed by dinner, which might consist <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> meats, pickled pork or bacon with vegetables, potatoes, yeast dumpling, soup and suet, or rice pudding.
