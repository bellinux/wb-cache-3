5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, <b>or</b> <b>fed</b> into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the less}} common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as Parasaurolophus, may {{represent}} the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested <b>or</b> <b>fed.</b> The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna.|$|E

OR from a non pressurised tank with the fuel being {{drawn into the}} torch by venturi action by the pressurised oxygen flow. Another low cost approach commonly used by jewelry makers in Asia is using air bubbled through a gasoline container by a foot-operated air pump, and burning the fuel-air mixture in a specialized welding torch.|$|E

25|$|Alfalfa {{is widely}} grown {{throughout}} the world as forage for cattle, and is most often harvested as hay, but can also be made into silage, grazed, <b>or</b> <b>fed</b> as greenchop. Alfalfa usually has the highest feeding value of all common hay crops. It is used less frequently as pasture. When grown on soils where it is well-adapted, alfalfa is often the highest-yielding forage plant, but its primary benefit is the combination of high yield per hectare and high nutritional quality.|$|E
25|$|The referee, who {{is usually}} located off the court, {{is the final}} {{authority}} about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact. If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision (This would only happen in Davis Cup <b>or</b> <b>Fed</b> Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair).|$|E
25|$|The {{first attempt}} by the Metropolitan Board of Guardians to remove the pigs {{prompted}} a petition that revealed 188 families with 582 children relied on fattening pigs for their existence.

The edible was fed to {{the children and the}} rest boiled down for the fat <b>or</b> <b>fed</b> to the pigs, chickens and ducks. Dogs abounded, being used to protect the pigs. In 1850, after cholera had taken victims on Latimer Road, Charles Dickens in his publication Household Words described this as a 'Plague Spot'.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is likely}} that most farms practiced some limited animal husbandry; poultry or small animals grazing on waste land <b>or</b> <b>fed</b> kitchen scraps.

An inscription also mentions a certain Eubolos of Elateia, in Phocis, the owner of 220 head of cattle and horses and at least 1000 sheep and goats. Flocks of sheep were herded between the valley in winter and the mountains in summer. Taxes existed for the transit or stopover of flocks in cities.|$|E

2500|$|To produce {{milk from}} dairy cattle, calves are {{separated}} from their mothers soon after birth and slaughtered <b>or</b> <b>fed</b> milk replacer in order to retain the cows milk for human consumption. Vegans state that this breaks the natural mother and calf bond. Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production. To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination. After about five years, once the cows milk production has dropped, they are considered [...] "spent" [...] and sent to slaughter for beef and their hides. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.|$|E
2500|$|Wells and Carnegie both mistreated Aborigines they {{encountered}} on their expeditions, {{forcing them to}} cooperate by tying them up and encouraging them to find water. Carnegie is also believed to have fed them salt, and he was later publicly criticised for this. Evidence supports that Alfred Canning had read both the Calvert and Carnegie expedition accounts {{to find out about}} the country (both described the terrain as [...] "extremely difficult") and the use of Aboriginal people to find water, an example Canning followed during his own expedition.Both Wells and Carnegie used ropes to tie Aboriginals up so that they could not escape. In Carnegie's case to help them find water and in Wells's case, for help in finding two lost members of their party. Carnegie also deprived his captives of water <b>or</b> <b>fed</b> them salt beef so that they would lead him to water more quickly and he was publicly criticised for this at the time.|$|E

60|$|The {{peculiar}} ingenuity of the American has {{supplied the}} want of laborers, {{in a country}} where agriculture is carried on by wholesale, especially in the cereals, by an instrument of the most singular and elaborate construction. This machine is drawn by sixteen or eighteen horses, attached to it laterally, so as to work clear of the standing grain, and who move the whole fabric on a moderate but steady walk. A path is first cut with the cradle {{on one side of the}} field, when the machine is dragged into the open place. Here it enters the standing grain, cutting off its heads with the utmost accuracy as it moves. Forks beneath prepare the way, and a rapid vibratory motion of a great number of two-edged knives effect the object. The stalks of the grain can be cut as low or as high as one pleases, but it is usually thought best to take only the heads. Afterward the standing straw is burned, <b>or</b> <b>fed</b> off, upright.|$|E
