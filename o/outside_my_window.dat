He entered into a relationship with– and subsequently became engaged to– Marie Moke, despite the symphony being inspired by Berlioz's obsession with Harriet Smithson. As his fourth cantata for submittal to the Prix de Rome neared completion, the July Revolution began. [...] "I was finishing my cantata when the revolution broke out," [...] he recorded in his Mémoires. [...] "I dashed off the final pages of my orchestral score {{to the sound of}} stray bullets coming over the roofs and pattering on the wall <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window.</b> On the 29th I had finished, and was free to go out and roam about Paris till morning, pistol in hand." [...] He finally won the prize with the cantata Sardanapale. He also arranged the French national anthem La Marseillaise and composed an overture to Shakespeare's The Tempest, which was the first of his pieces to play at the Paris Opéra. An hour before the performance, a sudden storm created the worst rain in Paris in 50 years, meaning the performance was almost deserted. Berlioz met Franz Liszt who was also attending the concert. This proved to {{be the beginning of a}} long friendship. Liszt would later transcribe the entire Symphonie fantastique for piano to enable more people to hear it.|$|E
60|$|He {{certainly}} did look uncommonly like the carved {{face on the}} beam <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window,</b> as he sat, in his humility, eyeing me sideways, with his mouth widened, and the creases in his cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Early {{next morning}} a great hubbub rose <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window,</b> and I jumped {{up to see}} what was going on. Little Thief had come back, and Big Thief caught him in the act of robbery. Away they went pell-mell, jabbering like a flock of blackbirds, along a linden branch, through two maples, across a driveway, and up a big elm where Little Thief whisked out of sight into a knot hole.|$|E
60|$|I {{never saw}} how it ended; {{but for a}} day or two there was an unusual amount of chasing and scolding going on <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, Mitchell published The Serbs Chose War, {{an account}} of her year with Mihailović and the Chetniks and her subsequent life as a German prisoner of war. Here is part of her description of the Nazi bombing of Belgrade on April 6, 1941: I ran to a smashed window. There in the street among piles of stones men and women lay still in strange, contorted attitudes. I had a surge of uncontrollable wild fury.... There were two unexploded incendiary bombs imbedded in the pavement just <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was a cool, gray {{afternoon}} {{and we got}} back to Green Gables just as the rain was beginning to fall. When we went up to my room the wind was rising and whistling through the boughs of the big old Snow Queen <b>outside</b> of <b>my</b> <b>window.</b> Diana was excited, and, I really believe, a little bit frightened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, in the night," [...] {{explained}} Rinkitink, {{sitting up}} {{and beginning to}} dress himself, [...] "I was wakened by the mewing of a cat that sat upon a wall of the palace, just <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window.</b> As the noise disturbed me, I reached out {{in the dark and}} caught up something and threw it at the cat, to frighten the creature away. I did not know what it was that I threw, and I was too sleepy to care; but probably it was your shoe, since it is now missing." ...|$|E
60|$|To return; I engaged him in {{conversation}} {{and with his}} help {{made a list of}} what we should require on our vendetta journey, all of which served to occupy his mind. Then I sent him to bed, saying that I would call him before dawn, having first put a little more bromide into his third cup of coffee. After this I turned in and notwithstanding the sight of those remains of the cannibal feast and the knowledge of the dead men who lay <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window,</b> I slept like a top.|$|E
60|$|I never undressed that night, {{but just}} {{lay down on}} my bed, thinking. The house was very still at times, but at others I could hear the tramp of the police agents {{up and down the}} stairs and also <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window.</b> The latter gave on a small, {{dilapidated}} back garden which had a wooden fence at the end of it. Beyond it were some market gardens belonging to a M. Lorraine. It did not take me very long to realize that that way lay my fortune of twenty thousand francs. But for the moment I remained very still. My plan was already made. At about midnight I went to the window and opened it cautiously. I had heard no noise from that direction for some time, and I bent my ear to listen.|$|E
60|$|And he came {{as he had}} promised. But when I {{asked him}} to enter my cottage, he declined, {{and said he would}} talk to me <b>outside,</b> at <b>my</b> <b>window.</b> This disinclination to be under my roof, {{reminded}} me that my supplies of food had, for the last week, been left on the window-ledge, instead of being brought into my room as usual. I had been too constantly occupied to pay much attention to the circumstance at the time; but I thought it very strange now.|$|R

60|$|I {{gathered}} {{up a handful}} of snow from the window-sill. It crumbled in my fingers like patent camphorated tooth-powder, for which purpose I instantly proceeded to use it. Necessity is the mother of invention. Then I turned, as a final test, to my bath. Oh, joy! it was frozen ten inches thick! No tub for me today! I ran downstairs gleefully, and glanced at the thermometer <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> study <b>window.</b> Hooray, it registered twenty degrees below zero! It registered! That reminded me of my oath! I registered it once more, regardless of legal expenses.|$|R
60|$|While I was yet inconsolable for his loss, {{another friend}} of mine in Yorkshire {{discovered}} an older and more gifted raven at a village public-house, which he prevailed upon the landlord to part with for a consideration, and sent up to me. The first act of this Sage, was, to administer {{to the effects of}} his predecessor, by disinterring all the cheese and halfpence he had buried in the garden--a work of immense labour and research, to which he devoted all the energies of his mind. When he had achieved this task, he applied himself to the acquisition of stable language, in which he soon became such an adept, that he would perch <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window</b> and drive imaginary horses with great skill, all day. Perhaps even I never saw him at his best, for his former master sent his duty with him, 'and if I wished the bird to come out very strong, would I be so good as to show him a drunken man'--which I never did, having (unfortunately) none but sober people at hand.|$|E
60|$|Indeed I {{dislike the}} idea that those I have loved are immortal in any real sense; it conjures up dim uncomfortable {{drifting}} phantoms, that have no kindred with the flesh and blood I knew. I would as soon think of them trailing after the tides {{up and down the}} Channel <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window.</b> Bob Stevenson for me is a presence utterly concrete, slouching, eager, quick-eyed, intimate and profound, carelessly dressed (at Sandgate he commonly wore a little felt hat that belonged to his son) and himself, himself, indissoluble matter and spirit, down to the heels of his boots. I cannot conceive of his as any but a concrete immortality. If he lives, he lives as I knew him and clothed as I knew him and with his unalterable voice, in a heaven of daedal flowers or a hell of ineffectual flame; he lives, dreaming and talking and explaining, explaining it all very earnestly and preposterously, so I picture him, into the ear of the amused, incredulous, principal person in the place.|$|E
6000|$|Coming nearer home, I {{hope that}} Georgina is almost quite well. She has no attack of pain or flurry now, {{and is in}} all respects immensely better. Mary is neither married nor (that I know of) going to be. She and Katie {{and a lot of}} them have been playing croquet <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window</b> here for these last four days, to a mad and maddening extent. My sailor-boy's ship, the Orlando, is {{fortunately}} in Chatham Dockyard--so he is pretty constantly at home--while the shipwrights are repairing a leak in her. I am reading in London every Friday just now. Great crams and great enthusiasm. Townshend I suppose to have left Lausanne somewhere about this day. His house in the park is hermetically sealed, ready for him. The Prince and Princess of Wales go about (wisely) very much, and have as fair a chance of popularity as ever prince and princess had. The City ball in their honour is to be a tremendously gorgeous business, and Mary is highly excited by her father's being invited, and she with him. Meantime the unworthy parent is devising all kinds of subterfuges for sending her and getting out of it himself. A very intelligent German friend of mine, just home from America, maintains that the conscription will succeed in the North, and that the war will be indefinitely prolonged. I say [...] "No," [...] and that however mad and villainous the North is, the war will finish by reason of its not supplying soldiers. We shall see. The more they brag the more I don't believe in them.|$|E
60|$|As {{with most}} wild creatures, the {{squirrels}} {{that live in}} touch with civilization are much keener witted than their wilderness brethren. The most interesting one I ever knew lived in the trees just <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> dormitory <b>window,</b> in a New England college town. He was the patriarch of a large family, and the greatest thief and rascal among them. I speak of the family, but, so far as I could see, {{there was very little}} family life. Each one shifted for himself the moment he was big enough, and stole from all the others indiscriminately.|$|R
6000|$|March 24. The {{spring is}} fairly with us now. <b>Outside</b> <b>my</b> {{laboratory}} <b>window</b> the great chestnut-tree is all {{covered with the}} big, glutinous, gummy buds, {{some of which have}} already begun to break into little green shuttlecocks. As you walk down the lanes you are conscious of the rich, silent forces of nature working all around you. The wet earth smells fruitful and luscious. Green shoots are peeping out everywhere. The twigs are stiff with their sap; and the moist, heavy English air is laden with a faintly resinous perfume. Buds in the hedges, lambs beneath them--everywhere the work of reproduction going forward! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{like things}} to have handles {{even if they}} are only geraniums. It makes them seem more like people. How do you know but that it hurts a geranium's {{feelings}} just to be called a geranium and nothing else? You wouldn't like to be called nothing but a woman all the time. Yes, I shall call it Bonny. I named that cherry-tree <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> bedroom <b>window</b> this morning. I called it Snow Queen because it was so white. Of course, it won't always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can't one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{are very}} nearly halfway to-day. The weather was {{favourable}} for us until yesterday morning, {{when we got}} a head-wind which still stands by us. We have rolled and pitched, of course; {{but on the whole}} have been wonderfully well off. I have had headache and have felt faint once or twice, but have not been sick at all. My spacious cabin is very noisy at night, as the most important working of the ship goes on <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window</b> and over my head; but it is very airy, and if the weather be bad and I can't open the window, I can open the door all night. If the weather be fine (as it is now), I can open both door and window, and write between them. Last night, I got a foot-bath under the dignified circumstances of sitting on a camp-stool in my cabin, and having the bath (and my feet) in the passage outside. The officers' quarters are close to me, and, as I know them all, I get reports of the weather and the way we are making when the watch is changed, and I am (as I usually am) lying awake. The motion of the screw is at its slightest vibration in my particular part of the ship. The silent captain, reported gruff, is a very good fellow and an honest fellow. Kelly has been ill all the time, and not of the slightest use, and is ill now. Scott always cheerful, and useful, and ready; a better servant for the kind of work there never can have been. Young Lowndes has been fearfully sick until mid-day yesterday. His cabin is pitch dark, and full of blackbeetles. He shares mine until nine o'clock at night, when Scott carries him off to bed. He also dines with me in my magnificent chamber. This passage in winter time cannot be said to be an enjoyable excursion, but I certainly am making it under the best circumstances. (I find Dolby to have been enormously popular on board, and to have known everybody and gone everywhere.) ...|$|E

60|$|Every summer I suffer {{much from}} indignation. I {{love to watch}} the {{swallows}} building. They build beneath the eaves <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> study <b>window.</b> Such cheerful little chatter-boxes they are. Long after sunset, when all the other birds are sleeping, the swallows still are chattering softly. It sounds {{as if they were}} telling one another some pretty story, and often I am sure there must be humour in it, for every now and then one hears a little twittering laugh. I delight in having them there, so close to me. The fancy comes to me that one day, when my brain has grown more cunning, I, too, listening in the twilight, shall hear the stories that they tell.|$|R
5000|$|Commenting on the {{veracity}} of these events as portrayed in the song, Michelle said: [...] "I think he's used a bit of artistic licence in the song. It was a dance class so we never used any pencils but I suppose he had ample opportunity {{to look at my}} bum. There was never any tree <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> bedroom <b>window</b> though - I think I might have noticed a Peeping Tom." [...] Reflecting on his time under the tutelage of Miss Blair, Matt said, [...] "She was kind of nice and there was always something really sexy about her." [...] Being identified as the object of adolescent lust, and the subject of a pop song, hasn't caused any friction with her husband according to Michelle: [...] "My husband thinks its (sic) hilarious and takes the mickey. I don't think he's really worried I'm going to run off with a pop star. I'm proud of them. Looking back it was obvious Matt had what it takes." ...|$|R
60|$|The dog was Strickland's dog, so I said nothing, but I {{felt all}} that Strickland felt In being thus made light of. Tietjens encamped <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> bedroom <b>window,</b> and storm after storm came up, thundered on the thatch, and died away. The {{lightning}} spattered {{the sky as}} a thrown egg spatters a barn-door, but the light was pale blue, not yellow; and, looking through my split bamboo blinds, I could see the great dog standing, not sleeping, in the verandah, the hackles alift {{on her back and}} her feet anchored as tensely as the drawn wire-rope of a suspension bridge. In the very short pauses of the thunder I tried to sleep, but it seemed that some one wanted me very urgently. He, whoever he was, was trying to call me by name, but his voice {{was no more than a}} husky whisper. The thunder ceased, and Tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low moon. Somebody tried to open my door, walked about and about through the house and stood breathing heavily in the verandahs, and just when I was falling asleep I fancied that I heard a wild hammering and clamouring above my head or on the door.|$|R

60|$|<b>Outside</b> of <b>my</b> <b>window,</b> two narrow {{perpendicular}} mirrors, {{parallel with}} the casement, project into the street, yet with a certain unobtrusiveness of angle {{that enables them to}} reflect the people who pass, without any reciprocal disclosure of their own. The men and women hurrying by not only do not know they are observed, but, what is worse, do not even see their own reflection in this hypocritical plane, and are consequently unable, through its aid, to correct any carelessness of garb, gait, or demeanor. At first this seems to be taking an unfair advantage of the human animal, who invariably assumes an attitude when he is conscious of being under human focus. But I observe that <b>my</b> neighbors' <b>windows,</b> right and left, have a similar apparatus, that this custom is evidently a local one, and the locality is German. Being an American stranger, I am quite willing to leave the morality of the transaction with the locality, and adapt myself to the custom: indeed, I had thought of offering it, figuratively, as an excuse for any unfairness of observation I might make in these pages. But my German mirrors reflect without prejudice, selection, or comment; and the American eye, I fear, is but mortal, and like all mortal eyes, figuratively as well as in that literal fact noted by an eminent scientific authority, infinitely inferior to the work of the best German opticians.|$|R
60|$|It was a rimy morning, {{and very}} damp. I {{had seen the}} damp lying on the <b>outside</b> of <b>my</b> little <b>window,</b> as if some goblin had been crying there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of spiders' webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post {{directing}} people to our village--a direction which they never accepted, for they never came there--was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.|$|R
60|$|But the katydid--how shall I {{describe}} its piquant utterances? One sings from a willow-tree just <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> open bedroom <b>window,</b> {{twenty yards}} distant; every clear {{night for a}} fortnight past has sooth'd me to sleep. I rode through a piece of woods for a hundred rods the other evening, and heard the katydids by myriads--very curious for once; but I like better my single neighbor on the tree. Let me say more about {{the song of the}} locust, even to repetition; a long, chromatic, tremulous crescendo, like a brass disk whirling round and round, emitting wave after wave of notes, beginning with a certain moderate beat or measure, rapidly increasing in speed and emphasis, reaching a point of great energy and significance, and then quickly and gracefully dropping down and out. Not the melody of the singing-bird--far from it; the common musician might think without melody, but surely having to the finer ear a harmony of its own; monotonous--but what a swing there is in that brassy drone, round and round, cymballine--or like the whirling of brass quoits.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} {{objective}} and subjective mental representations. Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks {{what is in}} the environment.

For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> <b>window</b> will not appear blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue).

60|$|A {{singular}} opportunity was afforded me {{last summer}} for making myself thoroughly {{at home with}} the habits and manners of the common English geometrical spider. By the pure chance of circumstance, two ladies of that intelligent and interesting species were kind enough to select for their temporary residence a large pane of glass just <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> drawing-room <b>window.</b> Now, it so happened that this particular pane was constructed not to open, being, in fact, part of a big bow-window, the alternate sashes of which were alone intended for ventilation. Hence it came to pass that by diligent care I was enabled to preserve my two eight-legged acquaintances from the devouring broom of the British housemaid, and to keep them constantly under observation at all times and seasons during a whole summer. Of course this result was only obtained by a distinct exercise of despotic authority, for I know those poor spiders were a constant eyesore in Ellen's sight--the housemaid of the moment bore the name of Ellen--but I persisted in my prohibition of any forcible ejectment, and I carried my point in the end in the very teeth of that constituted domestic authority. So successful was I, indeed, that when at last we flitted southwards ourselves with the swallows on our annual migration to the Mediterranean shores, we left Lucy and Eliza--those were the names we had given them--in undisturbed possession of their prescriptive rights in the drawing-room windows. This year they are gone, and our home is left spiderless.|$|R
