5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} time and what humanity's place is within time. Life is described metaphorically as travelling in a boat and humanity's fixation <b>on</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> future gain keeping the travellers from reaching their destination.

5|$|Increasingly {{concerned}} about the potential danger to humanity arising from scientific discoveries, Oppenheimer joined with Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Rotblat and other eminent scientists and academics to establish what would eventually become the World Academy of Art and Science in 1960. Significantly, after his public humiliation, he did not sign the major open protests against nuclear weapons of the 1950s, including the Russell–Einstein Manifesto of 1955, nor, though invited, did he attend the first Pugwash Conferences <b>on</b> <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> World Affairs in 1957.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 1961, Soviet {{cosmonaut}} Yuri Gagarin {{became the}} first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US House Committee <b>on</b> <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> Astronautics one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up. Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.|$|E

Perhaps most significantly, Brittain is attributed with providing the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching-oriented trade school and towards a new focus <b>on</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> technology research.|$|E

5|$|Malawi’s first {{science and}} {{technology}} policy dates from 1991 and was revised in 2002. The National Science and Technology Policy of 2002 envisaged {{the establishment of a}} National Commission for Science and Technology to advise the government and other stakeholders <b>on</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> technology-led development. Although the Science and Technology Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Council. The Science and Technology Act of 2003 also established a Science and Technology Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, as of 2014, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for Science and Technology has reviewed the Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (2011–2015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.|$|E
