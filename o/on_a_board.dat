5|$|Ponsford {{was named}} captain of a Victorian side made of up of {{promising}} youngsters, {{to play against}} Tasmania at the MCG on 2–5 February 1923. In this, only his third first-class match, Ponsford broke the world record for the highest individual innings score at that level {{on the final day}} of the match, scoring 429runs and batting for nearly eight hours. Along the way, he broke Armstrong's record for the highest score for Victoria (250), before surpassing former England captain Archie MacLaren's world record individual score of 424. The team score of 1,059 was also a new record for a first-class innings—an impromptu paint job was needed to show the score <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>board</b> that was not designed to display a four-figure total.|$|E
50|$|Each full {{stone of}} {{handicap}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 13&times;13 <b>board</b> {{is in any}} case probably equivalent to about 2.5 to 3 ranks, and each full stone <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 9&times;9 <b>board</b> is equivalent to about 6 ranks. For example, if the appropriate handicap is 9 (i.e., 8.5) stones <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 19&times;19 <b>board,</b> the handicap between those two players is reduced to 4 (because 3.5 &times; 2.5 = 8.75) stones <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 13x13 <b>board</b> and 2 (1.5 &times; 6 = 9) stones <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 9&times;9 <b>board.</b> <b>A</b> 5 (i.e., 4.5) stone handicap <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 9&times;9 <b>board</b> is accordingly equivalent to a handicap of 27 or 28 stones <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 19&times;19 <b>board.</b>|$|R

Kinkaid was one of three admirals, the others being Spruance and Hewitt, who would have to retire or be reduced in rank to rear admiral. After some lobbying, this was averted, and they were permitted to remain in the grade until 1 July 1950, past Kinkaid's retirement age. Retirement ceremonies, including a parade through New York City, were held on 28 April 1950 and Kinkaid formally retired two days later.|$|E
