5|$|Grant {{was nearly}} broke and worried {{constantly}} about leaving {{his wife a}} suitable {{amount of money to}} live on. Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend Mark Twain, understanding how bad Grant's financial condition was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking. Because of the summer heat and humidity, his doctors recommended that he move upstate to a cottage at the top of Mount McGregor, <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> family friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{drama is}} based on Ovid's tale of the {{abduction}} of Proserpine by Pluto, which itself {{was based on the}} Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone. Mary Shelley's version focuses on the female characters. In a largely feminist retelling from Ceres's point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> community of women. Ceres represents life and love, and Pluto represents death and violence. The genres of the text also reflect gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women's writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.|$|E

5|$|In May 1995, Belarus held a {{referendum}} on changing its national symbols; the referendum also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian, and forged closer economic ties to Russia. Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband the Supreme Soviet by decree. In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution. Shortly after that, {{a referendum}} was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> group of Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues (changing independence day to 3 July, abolition of the death penalty) to the national constitution. As {{a result of the}} referendum, the constitution that was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by the Supreme Soviet was voided. The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship. His decrees now had the force of law, and he also acquired near-total control over government spending. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum.|$|E

25|$|The Tosefta to this {{treatise}} {{is divided}} into six chapters. Noteworthy is the story it narrates of the high priest Simon the Just, who never partook of the sacrifice <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Nazarite, {{with the exception of}} that <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> handsome youth from the south, since in this case he could assume that the young man had made his vow with the best intentions and acceptably to God. When Simon asked why he had decided to clip his hair, the youth replied that on beholding his image in a pool he had become vain of his own beauty, and had therefore taken the Nazaritic vow to avoid all temptations (4:7).|$|E
