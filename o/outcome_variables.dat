25|$|The {{main reason}} for using {{mathematical}} models and diagrams in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness, performance or technical attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these <b>outcome</b> <b>variables.</b> The heart of any mathematical model {{is a set of}} meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships {{can be as simple as}} adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express causality, not just correlation. Furthermore, key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However, diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of 'Modeling & Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.|$|E
2500|$|With {{regard to}} the {{condition}} of healthy narcissism, {{it is suggested that}} this is correlated with good psychological health. Self-esteem works as a mediator between narcissism and psychological health. [...] Therefore, because of their elevated self-esteem, deriving from self-perceptions of competence and likability, high narcissists are relatively free of worry and gloom. Other researchers suggested that healthy narcissism cannot be seen as 'good' or 'bad'; however, it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured. In certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships, and with certain <b>outcome</b> <b>variables,</b> such as feeling good about oneself, healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with other <b>outcome</b> <b>variables,</b> such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.|$|E

30|$|In step three, {{mediation}} {{analysis was}} conducted when a predictor variable was correlated to the proposed <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> and another dependent variable. Mediation analysis measures {{the significance of the}} indirect effect {{and the extent to which}} the mediator variable accounts for the relationship between the predictor and the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable.</b> Mediation analysis is particularly appropriate to use when (A) the predictor variable is experimentally manipulated and the mediator variable measured and (B) the dynamic change in the predictor variable precedes the dynamic change in the mediator variable; and both precede the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> [23, 26].|$|R

Further, to achieve power more than 0. 80, at least 50 groups are required for both ML and PQL methods of estimation.

30|$|It is {{important}} to bear in mind, however, that the quantile regressions (conditional or unconditional) do not tell us anything {{about the effect of}} a policy/treatment on individuals (or households). In fact, they only inform us as to whether the effect of the treatment is different at distinct points of the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> distribution. In other words, if the coefficient of the first decile is higher than the coefficient of the top decile, {{this does not mean that}} individuals in the first decile were more affected by the treatment. That coefficient merely tells us that the effect is higher at the lower tail of the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> distribution. However, by assuming that the intervention does not change the households’ ordering in terms of the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> distribution, then one can argue that the impact is higher amongst the individuals in the lower tail of the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> distribution. This assumption is known as rank-invariance or rank-preserving.|$|R

40|$|SummaryA key {{question}} for ecological studies with HIV as the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> is what measure of HIV prevalence to use. In {{this study we}} compared {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of a variety of measures of HIV prevalence, focusing on peak HIV prevalence and HIV prevalence measured at the same time as the exposure variable. We explored the theoretical problems with each of the two measures of HIV prevalence. We then investigated the difference that substituting one variable for the other made to two published ecological studies. One published study found a strong relationship between migration intensity and HIV prevalence measured at the time the migration was measured. When we repeated the analysis using peak HIV prevalence as the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable,</b> there was no evidence of an association. The second study found evidence of a strong relationship between concurrency and peak HIV prevalence. On repetition of the analysis (but utilizing HIV prevalence at the time the concurrency was measured as the <b>outcome</b> <b>variable)</b> there was no longer a significant association. The choice of HIV measure as <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> in ecological studies makes a large difference to the study results.

50|$|In {{the pure}} {{experimental}} design, the independent (predictor) variable is manipulated {{by the researcher}} - that is - every participant of the research is chosen randomly from the population, and each participant chosen is assigned randomly to conditions of the independent variable. Only when this is done {{is it possible to}} certify with high probability that the reason for the differences in the <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> are caused by the different conditions. Therefore, researchers should choose the experimental design over other design types whenever possible. However, the nature of the independent variable does not always allow for manipulation. In those cases, researchers must be aware of not certifying about causal attribution when their design doesn't allow for it. For example, in observational designs, participants are not assigned randomly to conditions, and so if there are differences found in <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> between conditions, it is likely that there is something other than the differences between the conditions that causes the differences in outcomes, that is - a third variable. The same goes for studies with correlational design. (Adér & Mellenbergh, 2008).|$|E
