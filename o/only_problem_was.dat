25|$|In the Edo period, sports {{became a}} popular {{way to spend}} time. The <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that they were often {{accompanied}} by gambling. A notice to punish playing and betting on sumo without authorization was repeatedly posted to little effect. Kyūdō was encouraged by shoguns and daimyōs as a pastime, and contests as well as record making attempts were held. On April 26, 1686, a samurai named Wasa Daihachiro competing in the Tōshiya made an unsurpassed record of shooting 13,053 arrows and hitting the mark 8,133 times over a 24-hour period. This is even more remarkable when one considers the shooting range for this attempt, a 120-meter-long corridor with a ceiling of only 2.2 meters. In the Olympic Games, archers shoot over a distance of only 70 meters. Martial arts like jujutsu were popular but schools avoided inter-school matches, leaving room only for intramural matches.|$|E
500|$|The first Ju 87 {{prototype}} {{was built}} by [...] in Sweden and secretly brought to Germany in late 1934. It {{was to have been}} completed in April 1935, but, due to the inadequate strength of the airframe, construction was not completed until October 1935. However, the mostly complete Ju 87 V1 W.Nr. 4921 (less non-essential parts) took off for its maiden flight on 17 September 1935. The aircraft originally did not carry any registration, but later was given the registration D-UBYR. The flight report, by Hauptmann Willy Neuenhofen, stated the <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> with the small radiator, which caused the power plant to overheat.|$|E
500|$|According to University of Georgia {{historian}} Ann E. Marshall, {{she was a}} [...] "tireless {{advocate of}} the 'Lost Cause' version of southern history" [...] (referring to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy). Goals of her writing included [...] "establishing the South's contribution to United States history, legitimizing secession, and idealizing the antebellum plantation", and she defended American slavery, thinking its <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> the burden it put upon the white slaveholders. She viewed [...] "true history"the way she saw, defined, and proselytized itas a potential common ground between North and South, and also believed {{it to be a}} potent political weapon in support of the causes she espoused. She was willing to alter the historical record to make her point—in a speech in Dallas in 1916 she claimed that [...] "the negroes in the South were never called slaves. That term came in with the abolition crusade," [...] even though her own state of Georgia used the word [...] "slaves" [...] in its official Declaration of Causes of Secession ...|$|E

500|$|After Edson's Ridge, he {{was placed}} {{in command of the}} 5th Marine Regiment. In this capacity, {{he was one of the}} primary leaders in the Matanikau actions from September 23 to October 9, 1942. [...] He also {{commanded}} the 5th Marines during the Battle for Henderson Field and until the regiment was withdrawn from Guadalcanal, along with the rest of the 1st Marine Division, in November 1942. Shortly after, another officer stated [...] "that officers and men would willingly follow him anywhere—the <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> to keep up with him". A combat correspondent testified that [...] "he is not a fierce Marine. In fact he appears almost shy. Yet Colonel Edson is probably among the five finest combat commanders in all the United States armed forces." [...] It was also said that he was not readily given to a show of emotion but when his personal runner of several months' service was killed at the Matanikau River on Guadalcanal, witnesses said he [...] "cried like a baby", and later stated that the man could never be replaced.|$|E
500|$|After their {{break up}} Charlie gets drunk {{and goes into}} work as normal the next day. While on duty Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best) becomes stuck down a storm drain. Charlie {{attempts}} to save her but a storm forces the water levels to rise. As Charlie is hungover, Anderson told Inside Soap that [...] "Charlie's a bit dazed and confused when all this happens". However, she is a [...] "professional and goes straight into work mode". When Charlie frees Annie, a wave of water floods the drain and Charlie is swept away. Roman then arrives {{on the scene and}} fights to save Charlie. Anderson explained that it is up to Roman to save Charlie's life and said [...] "of all people it has to be the guy who's just broken her heart". Off-screen the scenes in the storm drain posed a series of logistical challenges for the production team. The series had a specially built set for the scenes and they placed jets under the water to create rough waves. Anderson said that she could swim and was not afraid to film in the water. The <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> the temperature of the water. Anderson said [...] "It was absolutely freezing. Filming was tough work, but I think the finished result is worth it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{that the}} new theatre only had toilets for men and women, and there were {{immediate}} objections from the Salisbury Public Works Committee.

He wrote it in a short time, somewhere between six and sixteen weeks between January and 21 April 1885. However, the book was a {{complete}} novelty and was rejected by one publisher after another. [...] After six months, King Solomon's Mines was published, and the book became the year's best seller; the <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> how to print copies fast enough (much to the chagrin of those who had rejected the manuscript).|$|E

2500|$|From 1978 until 1982, only eleven devotees {{were allowed}} to {{initiate}} new disciples and give brahmana (or second) initiation to existing ISKCON devotees, who became known as Prabhupada disciples despite receiving sampradaya mantra from new ISKCON gurus. There was noticeable difference between these newly appointed ISKCON gurus and Prabhupada. The new ISKCON gurus, known as Zonal acharyas, were all young and immature, Kirtanananda Swami was the eldest at 40—many were still in their twenties—and some had only been devotees for five years {{at the time of}} their appointment. Yet they had not only become the movement's elders, they were catapulted to an absolute status. Beginning in 1980, less than three years after Prabhupada's death, guru controversies arose in rapid succession. In general, ISKCON was led by young men who, until the formation of the first schisms, wielded much power despite their lack of maturity. In the words of one GBC member: [...] "In Prabhupada's time the <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that there was only one real adult in the movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1956, IDF {{chief of}} staff General Moshe Dayan advised Prime Minister David Ben Gurion that Israel should attack Egypt at the first chance, but Ben Gurion stated he {{preferred}} to attack Egypt {{with the aid of}} France. On 7 August 1956 the French Defense Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury asked Peres if Israel would attack Egypt together with France, to which he received a positive reply. On 1 September 1956 the French government formally asked that France and Israel begin joint planning for a war against Egypt. By 6 September 1956, Dayan's chief of operations General Meir Amit, [...] was meeting with Admiral Pierre Barjot to discuss joint Franco-Israeli operations. On 25 September 1956 Peres reported to Ben Gurion that France wanted Israel as an ally against Egypt, and that the <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> Britain, which was opposed to Israel taking action against Nasser. In late September 1956, the French Premier Guy Mollet had embarked upon a dual policy of attacking Egypt with Britain, and if the British backed out (as Mollet believed that they might), with Israel. On 30 September 1956 secret Franco-Israeli talks on planning a war started in Paris, which were {{based on the assumption that}} Britain would not be involved. The French very much wanted to use airfields in Cyprus to bomb Egypt, but being not certain about Britain's attitude, wanted to use Israeli airfields if the ones in Cyprus were not free. Only on 5 October 1956 during a visit by General Maurice Challe to Britain where he met with Eden, were the British informed of the secret Franco-Israeli alliance.|$|E
