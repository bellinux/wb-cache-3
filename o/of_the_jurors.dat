5|$|The {{trial was}} {{postponed}} until January 17 because Jackalow's counsel was not {{served with the}} list of names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> until the morning of January 15, and federal law required that the panel be served two full days before trial. The government planned to call 34 witnesses, and to pay each $500 for their time. Jackalow moved to compel the attendance of Dr. Theodore R. Vanck, Robert J. Dalton, and Professor George Hammell Cook of Rutgers College. Voorhees and Wilson represented Jackalow, and the prosecution was conducted by U.S. Attorney Cannon and Andrew Dutcher.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sarria {{found himself}} {{at the center of}} a legal {{controversy}} over his role on the jury in the 1991 murder trial of Clifford Bolden. Bolden had been sentenced to death in 1991 for the 1986 murder of Henry Michael Pederson, whom Bolden allegedly picked up in a bar in San Francisco's Castro district. Bolden's attorneys claimed that Sarria, who was not on the jury that convicted Bolden but was seated as an alternate for the penalty phase, had known Bolden's lover, Pederson and another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors.</b> They alleged that he had concealed this knowledge in order to remain on the jury and push for a death sentence. Sarria acknowledged having spoken occasionally with the other juror but denied the rest of the allegations. Sarria was cleared of wrongdoing in February 2008.|$|E

As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cher {{starred in}} three films in 1987. In Suspect, {{she played a}} public defender who is both helped and romanced by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> in the {{homicide}} case she is handling. Along with Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, she starred as one of three divorcees involved with a mysterious and wealthy visitor from hell who comes to a small New England town in the comedy horror The Witches of Eastwick. In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy Moonstruck, she played an Italian widow {{in love with her}} fiancé's younger brother. The two latter films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively. For her performance in Moonstruck, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. By 1988, Cher had {{become one of the most}} bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1million per film. That year, she released the fragrance Uninhibited, which earned about $15million in its first year sales.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire on <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>juror's</b> potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|R

25|$|Harriman's campaign, however, {{was tied}} to the {{asserted}} innocence of the McNamaras.

Moreover, the politically provocative language and irreverent tone of Socrates’s self-defence speech angered the jurors and invited their punishment of him.|$|E

25|$|The union hired Clarence Darrow {{to defend}} the McNamaras.

Now more desperate than ever, he persuaded the McNamaras to plead guilty on the basis of an unwritten plea bargain that would have freed John. Once they pleaded guilty, however, the authorities denied that they had any deal at all. John McNamara served nearly ten years, while his brother spent his remaining years in prison.|$|E
