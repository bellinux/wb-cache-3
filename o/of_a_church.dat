5|$|Across {{the mountainous}} {{northern}} Barlavento Islands, Fred produced gusty winds and downpours; São Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h)—the highest recorded wind speed from the hurricane. Rainfall on that island was moderate, peaking at 3.5in (90mm) at Juncalinho. Many old trees were uprooted, a few landslides took place, and several villages lost power on that island. The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked the roof <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> {{in the village}} of Cabeçalinho. In Ribeira Brava, São Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farm, leaving several families homeless and others without a source of income. In Carriçal, similar effects were felt as torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops. Much of São Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortelã, was lost in the storm. Damage to property and agriculturein particular banana and sugarcaneon the island reached CVE$50million ($500,000).|$|E
5|$|Although Wigan is not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book, possibly because it was included in the Neweton barony (now Newton-le-Willows), it is thought that the mention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> in the manor of Neweton is Wigan Parish Church. The rectors of the parish church were lords of the manor of Wigan, a sub-manor of Neweton, until the 19th century. Wigan was incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a charter by King Henry III to John Maunsell, the local church rector and lord of the manor. The borough was later granted another charter in 1257–1258, allowing the lord of the manor to hold a market on every Monday and two annual fairs. The town is recorded on the earliest-surviving map of Britain, the Gough Map made around 1360 which highlights its position on the main western north-south highway with distance markers to Preston and Warrington.|$|E
