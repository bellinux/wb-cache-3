Animal chlamydiosis often remains underdiagnosed or undiagnosed, and its status {{in many parts of}} India is still unknown. Hence, the present study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of animal chlamydiosis amongst ruminant livestock species of five states of India. Materials and Methods: Totally, 2127 randomly selected serum samples collected from ruminant livestock species viz. cattle (n= 430), buffaloes (n= 429), sheep (906) and goats (n= 362), were tested by agar gel precipitation test for chlamydiosis between 2002 and 2011.

40|$|Problem statement: Q fever is a {{ubiquitous}} zoonosis {{caused by}} Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular rickettsial organism that caused abortion and stillbirth in ruminants. Approach: The prevalence of Coxiella burnetii in Iran is essentially unknown. Its traditional diagnosis {{is based on}} culture, serology and conventional PCR. In this present study, for more sensitive and accurate detection and prevalence's determination of Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caprine</b> fetuses, the nested and real-time PCR methods are recommended. Results: About 98 (12. 53 %) and 122 (16. 39 %) out of 782 <b>and</b> 744 <b>Ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caprine</b> aborted fetuses, were positive for presence of Coxiella burnetii by nested PCR, respectively. After LSI Taqvet Coxiella burnetii real-time PCR, it was recognized that 121 (15. 47 %) and 152 (20. 43 %) samples were positive for Coxiella burnetii in <b>Ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caprine</b> aborted fetuses, respectively. Results indicated that the real-time PCR was 7 times more sensitive than the nested PCR. Statistical analysis showed significant differences about P Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caprine</b> fetuses by both nested and real-time PCR assays and P Coxiella burnetii. The Ct values which obtained from real-time PCR had significant differences about P Coxiella burnetii between aborted <b>Ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caprine</b> fetuses. Our results indicated that Caprine is more sensitive than Ovine to Coxiella burnetiis abortion Khozestan and Gilan have the highest and Khorasan and Sistan va Baluchistan provinces have the lowest prevalence of Coxiella burnetii, respectively. Conclusion: To our knowledge, {{this study is the}} first prevalence report of direct identification of Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caprine</b> fetuses by evaluation of nested and real-time PCR assays in Iran.

In addition, several characteristics related to the virulence of strains producing F 17 fimbriae were studied. Most of the strains (73 %) possessed the f 17 cA structural subunit gene, whereas the f 17 aA and f 17 dA genes were detected only on three (6 %) and two (4 %) strains, respectively. The f 17 bA gene was not detected. All but one of these strains possessed the f 17 G genes of the adhesin subfamily II. The only strain having the f 17 G gene of subfamily I possessed the structural subunit gene f 17 dA. Sequencing of the f 17 A and f 17 G genes of four selected strains confirmed the association of f 17 cA and f 17 dA structural subunit genes with the f 17 G genes of the adhesin subfamily II. These results indicated that adhesins of the subfamily II are prominent among <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> isolates <b>and</b> that they are indistinctly associated with the F 17 structural subunit subtypes on these field strains.

Studies on their replication indicated that <b>ovine</b> lentiviruses <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) recently isolated in the United States establish persistent infection in <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> fibroblasts, whereas older prototype ovine lentiviruses such as Icelandic visna virus or American progressive pneumonia virus irreversibly lyse fibroblast cultures. Since all of the recent isolates were found to be persistent, Narayan et al. (J. Gen. Virol. 59 : 345 - 356, 1982) concluded that the highly lytic viruses were only tissue-culture-adapted strains. In the present report, we isolated new ovine lentiviruses from French sheep with naturally occurring progressive pneumonia which are either highly lytic (five isolates), as are the Icelandic strains of visna virus, or persistent (one isolate), as are CAEV or American persistent <b>ovine</b> lentiviruses. Protein <b>and</b> nucleic acid content analyses of these new highly lytic (type I) and persistent (type II) isolates indicated that type I <b>and</b> type II <b>ovine</b> lentiviruses were genetically distinct, type I and type II viruses being closely related to the Icelandic strains of visna virus and to CAEV, respectively. We conclude that (i) highly lytic ovine lentiviruses, such as the Icelandic prototype strains of visna virus and persistent lentiviruses more related to CAEV, are naturally present in the <b>ovine</b> species, <b>and</b> (ii) irreversible cell lysis induced by highly lytic viruses does not result from a tissue culture adaptation of field isolates that were originally persistent but is instead the consequence of a genetic content distinct from that of persistent viruses...|$|R

Extensive variation in genome content exists among S. aureus pathogenic clones. However, the genomic variation among S. aureus strains infecting different animal species has not been well examined. To investigate variation in the genome content of human and ruminant S. aureus, we carried out whole-genome PCR scanning (WGPS), comparative genomic hybridizations (CGH), and the directed DNA sequence analysis of strains of human, bovine, <b>ovine,</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> origin. Extensive variation in genome content was discovered, including host- and ruminant-specific genetic loci. <b>Ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> strains were genetically allied, whereas bovine strains were heterogeneous in gene content. As expected, mobile genetic elements such as pathogenicity islands and bacteriophages contributed to the variation in genome content between strains. However, differences specific for ruminant strains were restricted to regions of the conserved core genome, which contained allelic variation in genes encoding proteins of known and unknown function. Many of these proteins are predicted to be exported and could play a role in host-pathogen interactions. The genomic regions of difference identified by the whole-genome approaches adopted in the current study represent excellent targets for studies of the molecular basis of S. aureus host adaptation.

At the end of ripening the pH in the centre was (mean ± ISD) 5. 05 ± 0. 07, 5. 15 ± 0. 21 and 4. 91 ± 0. 07 for bovine, <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> milk cheeses, respectively; whereas the pH {{at the top of}} the cheese was 5. 21 ± 0. 09, 5. 44 ± 0. 12 and 5. 12 ± 0. 07, respectively; the moisture content values of bovine, <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> milk cheeses were 37. 68 ± 2. 32, 40. 23 ± 4. 34 and 45. 73 ± 1. 44 %, respectively; the NaCl content values were 4. 00 ± 0. 43, 4. 00 ± 0. 56 and 4. 08 ± 0. 58 (%TS); the fat content values were 41. 01 ± 5. 32, 63. 60 ± 7. 80 and 45. 14 ± 9. 14 (%TS); the protein content values were 28. 96 ± 1. 84, 22. 89 ± 2. 37 and 30. 02 ± 1. 22 (%TS); the water-soluble nitrogen values were 32. 91 ± 1. 76, 46. 44 ± 1. 86 and 48. 72 ± 1. 08 (%TN); the values of nitrogen soluble in trichloroacetic acid were 10. 25 ± 1. 93, 10. 41 ± 2. 91 and 7. 25 ± 0. 84 (%TN); the values of nitrogen soluble in phosphotungstic acid were 1. 50 ± 0. 18, 1. 87 ± 0. 65 and 1. 38 ± 0. 32 (%TN); finally, the free amino acid content values were 21. 33 ± 5. 34, 17. 51 ± 5. 08 and 23. 93 ± 4. 80 μM equivalents of leucine. Urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of water-insoluble fractions from cheeses indicated high degrees of proteolysis of αs 1 -casein in bovine cheeses and more extensive proteolysis of the αs-casein region in caprine than in ovine cheeses, but a moderate degree of proteolysis of β-casein in all types of cheese; electrophoregrams of the water-soluble fraction displayed increasing numbers of bands throughout ripening, an observation that is consistent with the increase in the ratio of water-soluble nitrogen to total nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|Q {{fever and}} chlamydiosis often affect <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> flocks {{simultaneously}} or successively. Combination vaccines effective against these 2 diseases {{would be of}} great value in veterinary medicine. Unfortunately, the current effective vaccines are a live vaccine for chlamydiosis and killed vaccine for Q fever. Vaccination of mice with live chlamydiosis vaccine 1 B and killed phase I vaccine against Q fever at 2 points on the back {{at the same time}} produced good protection against chlamydial abortion.

40|$|Several {{members of}} the {{lentivirus}} family of complex retroviruses {{have been shown to}} encode proteins that are functionally equivalent to the Rev posttranscriptional regulatory protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). Furthermore, the domain organization of HIV- 1 Rev, featuring a highly basic N-terminal RNA binding domain and a leucin-rich C-terminal effector domain, has also been shown to be highly conserved among Rev proteins derived from not only the primate but also the <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> lentiviruses. Although it has therefore appeared highly probable that the lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) also encodes a Rev, the predicted amino acid sequence of this putative EIAV regulatory protein does not display any evident homology to the basic and leucine-rich motifs characteristic of other known Rev proteins. By fusion of different segments of the proposed EIAV Rev protein to the well-defined RNA binding domain of either HIV- 1 or visna virus Rev, we have identified a segment of this EIAV protein that can efficiently substitute in cis for the otherwise essential activation motif. Interestingly, the minimal EIAV Rev activation motif identified in this study comprises approximately 18 amino acids located toward the protein N terminus that lack any evident similarity to the leucine-rich activation domains found in these other lentivirus Rev proteins. It therefore appears that the Rev protein of EIAV, while analogous in function to Rev proteins defined in lentiviruses of primate, <b>ovine,</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> origin, is nevertheless distinguished by an entirely novel domain organization...|$|R
40|$|In the Iberian Peninsula, the proteinases {{present in}} the flowers {{of members of the}} Cynara genus, C. cardunculus, C. humilis and C. scolymus, have for many years been {{successfully}} used in the manufacture of traditional cheeses from ovine and/or caprine milk on individual farms (Vieira de Sá & Barbosa, 1972; Trujillo et al. 1994). In Portugal, C. cardunculus is the species most frequently employed. Although commercial thistle was tentatively assumed to be pure in taxonomic terms, accurate analyses have shown that the flowers of C. cardunculus are often mixed with flowers of C. humilis (Pires et al. 1994). The clotting activity of C. humilis is due to an aspartic proteinase, currently designated cardosin A and similar to another enzyme obtained from C. cardunculus. This enzyme is similar in specificity and activity to chymosin (Pires et al. 1994). The action of cardosin A from C. cardunculus upon <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> caseins has been reported recently (Ramalho-Santos et al. 1996; Simo 4 es, 1998; Sousa & Malcata, 1998), but as yet there is no information on the proteolytic activity of the proteinase from C. humilis upon caseins from milks other than bovine. Caseins from small ruminants' milks are the usual substrates of cardosin during milk coagulation and cheese ripening, and sodium caseinate represents an intermediate system between isolated caseins and the cheese matrix that is free from interference by fat. Thus <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> caseinates may be useful substrates for investigating the proteolytic activity of cardosin. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the action of pure cardosin A, obtained from C. humilis, on <b>caprine</b> <b>and</b> <b>ovine</b> caseinates, <b>and</b> to assess the in vitro contribution of this enzyme to the overall proteolytic action of thistle rennet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Ly- 6 (Ly- 6 /uPAR) {{superfamily}} members {{share the}} Ly- 6 domain defined by distinct disulfide bonding patterns between 8 or 10 cysteine residues. They comprise membrane- and secretory-type proteins. We recently reported the gene and protein {{characterization of the}} bovine secreted protein of Ly- 6 domain 1 (SOLD 1). Bovine SOLD 1 is expressed in trophoblast mononucleate cells (TMCs) and is localized in the cotyledonary mesenchyme. Here, we compared the expression and functionality of SOLD 1 among the ruminants. We examined mRNA expression by chorionic fibroblasts {{as a measure of}} one of the SOLD 1 functions. Results <b>Ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> SOLD 1 mRNAs have 303 bp open reading frames and encode for deduced SOLD 1 proteins with 100 amino acids, including a 22 -aa-long signal peptide at the N-terminal. Both of the SOLD 1 amino acid sequences have high similarities with the bovine sequence. Both SOLD 1 mRNAs were also expressed in TMCs of cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes. The mature SOLD 1 proteins were localized in the mesenchymal villi of cotyledons after secretion. Bovine, <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> SOLD 1 affected gene expression in mesenchymal fibroblasts in vitro; nucleoredoxin expression was upregulated and BCL 2 -like 13 was downregulated. Thus, we suggest that SOLD 1 acts as a modulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Conclusion Expressing cells and protein localization of SOLD 1 coincided among the three ruminants. SOLD 1 participated in regulating nucleoredoxin and BCL 2 -like 13 expression in chorionic fibroblasts. SOLD 1 is produced specifically in the cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes in ruminants and appears {{to be involved in the}} construction of the ruminant placenta. </p...|$|R
40|$|Growth of, {{and acid}} {{production}} by Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus using <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> milk as media were evaluated for their potential use in cheese-making. A protein hydrolysate (MHP, obtained from incubation of bovine milk with protease) or {{a mixture of}} free amino acids (FAA, similar to the amino acid fraction of MHP) was added as a nitrogen enrichment source. Bifidobacterium lactis and Lact. acidophilus were inoculated at 50 ml l− 1 and incubated at 37 °C with growth supplements added at ratios in the range 25 – 50 ml l− 1. The maximum viable counts of Bif. lactis were lower in plain <b>ovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>caprine</b> milk than in nitrogen-enriched milk, and MHP was a better growth promoter than FAA. A similar trend was observed with the acidity values developed, and attempts to correlate growth with acidity were successfully performed. The highest uptake rates of amino acids in ovine milk were observed for lysine, isoleucine, leucine and proline, but only isoleucine was taken up at a similar rate in caprine milk. Final bacterial viable counts of Lact. acidophilus in the plain and enriched forms of ovine milk did not differ greatly from each other, although FAA was statistically a better growth promoter than MHP. Unlike results in ovine milk, cultures of Lact. acidophilus in caprine milk exhibited drops of 1 – 1 · 5 log cycles in viable cell counts by 24 h of fermentation, irrespective {{of the nature of}} the nitrogen source. Parallel studies indicated that the excess of fatty acid residues in caprine milk could be responsible for the poor growth of Lact. acidophilus...|$|R
