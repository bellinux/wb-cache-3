5|$|After {{the team}} finds and stores Pierce's body, Mulder reviews Trepkos' {{fragmented}} notes.

When he is put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretcher</b> for a medivac pickup, Mulder notices a throbbing bulge in his neck. Tanaka flees {{into the woods and}} dies when a tentacle bursts out of his throat. An autopsy by Scully finds sand in his lungs, indicating the existence of a silicon-based spore; she theorizes that when exposed, the spore infects the nearest hosts or otherwise dies.

5|$|Gascoigne {{was named}} on the PFA Team of the Year in the 1990–91 season as Tottenham reached the FA Cup Final, with {{victories}} over Blackpool, Oxford United, Portsmouth, Notts County and North London derby rivals Arsenal.

After being on the ice for a goal during {{a game against the}} Atlanta Thrashers, Ballard aimed to smash his stick in frustration against the post and mistakenly hit Vokoun in the mask. Vokoun was taken from the ice <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretcher</b> and suffered a cut on his ear that required stitches; he missed two games before returning to the lineup.
