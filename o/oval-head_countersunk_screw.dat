40|$|A {{connector}} retainer {{and mounting}} {{system has been}} designed to replace screw-mounting of Winchester connectors. <b>Countersunk</b> <b>screws</b> are normally used to secure connectors to structures, and to keep them from coming apart. These screws are normally put into threaded or through-holes in metallic structures. This unique retainer is designed such that integral posts keep the connector halves retained, and a groove permits a cable tie to be fastened around the retainer and composite tube, thus securing the connector to the structure. The system is compatible for use on cryogenic (and conventional) bonded composite tube assemblies. Screws and tapped/through-holes needed to retain and mount Winchester connectors cannot be used on blind-access composite tubes. This system allows for rapid installation, removal, low-molecular-outgassing materials, and particulate-free installation and removal. Installation and/or changes late in the integration, and test flow with limited access in a cleanroom environment are possible. No sanding or bonding is needed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To achieve {{extensor}} mechanism {{stability in}} postpatellectomy patients by elevating the lateral femoral condyle, thus creating a deeper trochlear groove. INDICATIONS: Instability of the quadriceps tendon after patellectomy and other realignment interventions, including {{but not limited}} to the release of the lateral patellofemoral ligaments, advancement of the vastus medialis obliquus muscle and, in some cases, transfer of the tibial tubercle. Stabilization of a normal dislocating patella in presence of a hypoplastic lateral femoral condyle. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Medical conditions precluding surgery. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: An open-wedge osteotomy of the lateral femoral condyle is performed. Predrilling at the osteotomy level is followed by a multiple-step curved-type osteotomy starting laterally, directed upward to the trochlea. Bone wedges are inserted under the levered bony fragment and the intrinsically stable osteotomy is secured with one or more <b>countersunk</b> <b>screws.</b> POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: A removable splint is applied in 30 degrees of knee flexion. With patellectomy, the splint is applied in 90 degrees of knee flexion for the first 3 days. Continuous passive motion and partial weight bearing are started 4 days after surgery in all patients. Use of the splint is advocated for 6 weeks in total. RESULTS: Eight knees (six patients) with extensor mechanism instability underwent this procedure. In five knees patellectomy had been performed earlier, one patient underwent an osteotomy combined with patellectomy bilaterally, in one patient a normal patella was left in situ. No instability was reported after surgery (average follow-up 8 years, range 2 - 17 years). Modified Lysholm Knee Scores showed two excellent, two good, and four fair results.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of refracture following the removal ofscrews and plates from the diaphyses of 1 15 forearm bones in 80 patients has been studied. Refracture occurred in four adult patients {{as a result}} of minimal trauma, in two patients at the original fracture site after premature plate removal, at the site of a <b>countersunk</b> intel-fragmentary <b>screw</b> in one and at the original fracture site in another who had required three operative procedures to achieve ‘union’. It is suggested that refracture could have been avoided in at least two of these patients. If the 3. 5 mm plating system has been used, the {{incidence of}} refracture should be minimal. The use of internal fixation plates is a well-established method of fracture management. The technique is controversial in other bones but its application to displaced diaphyseal fractures of the forearm has been almost universal. The theoretical adverse effect of rigid plates on bone and the desire to avoid leaving a foreign body implanted indefinitely has led to the practice of removing plates when fractures have united (Uhthoff and Finnegan 1983).

30|$|The {{results of}} our study {{demonstrate}} that PETS is a minimally invasive and safe technique for treating LLD by creating a growth inhibition of the longer limb. The screws can {{be placed in a}} parallel or crossed pattern and it may be beneficial to <b>countersink</b> the <b>screw</b> heads, particularly if they are placed in a parallel fashion to decrease the risk of pain from a prominent screw head irritating the soft tissues. Clinicians may use the growth predictor method of choice with the understanding {{that there may be a}} large variability in the result, but usually the variability is not clinically significant. We found that the Green−Anderson and Moseley methods tended to underpredict and the Paley method tended to overpredict the final LLD. Several studies have reported that PETS creates delayed growth inhibition and recommend performing PETS between 6 and 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis [5, 8, 18]. We believe that PETS is reversible by removing the screws and are now performing the PETS 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis. We believe that PETS creates growth inhibition by locking the epiphysis to the metaphysis with screw threads on both sides of the growth plate. Although we have not used fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated screws, we believe that fully threaded screws would be equally successful and would decrease the problems associated with screw removal.|$|R
30|$|The six {{patients}} who complained of pain over their screws at maturity had screws {{placed in a}} parallel fashion. We are now <b>countersinking</b> the <b>screw</b> heads partially into the cortical bone at the meta-diaphyseal junction to address this concern. Although crossed screws are more technically demanding to achieve precise placement, crossed screws may have less screw head prominence and decrease the risk of irritating the adjacent soft tissues. Song et al. [17] treated 59 patients with PETS using crossed screws and reported no screw-related pain, infection, neurologic injury or hematoma. Three screws broke during attempted removal and the removal was abandoned in 2 others. Five patients (8  %) developed an axial deviation that was attributed to inadequate purchase of the epiphysis on one side {{in three of the}} five cases. In our study, no patient developed asymmetric growth that created an axial, coronal or sagittal deformity and we had no problems removing screws. Parallel screws are shorter than crossed screws and can be placed within 10 degrees of perpendicular to the physis in both the anteroposterior and lateral views making them theoretically more mechanically effective to inhibit growth than crossed screws. Since crossed screws are longer than parallel screws, 7.3 -mm cannulated screws with a 32 -mm thread are placed in a crossed fashion in case they are difficult to remove even though they have reverse-cutting threads. We believe that the ideal screw to address all these shortcomings would be a fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated stainless steel screw.|$|R
60|$|About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two {{lanterns}} {{of sperm}} oil, Stubb stoutly {{stood up to}} his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.

Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in <b>countersinking</b> for a <b>screw.</b>|$|R
30|$|These {{injuries}} {{are the result}} of high-energy mechanisms with associated multiple organ damage as in this case [1, 2, 5, 9]. The high-energy transfer during impact is not dissipated with the femoral head fracture alone but propagates further, causing the intertrochanteric fracture [5] and greater vascular damage [11]. Accurate diagnosis is essential [9] and a clear anteroposterior view of the pelvis, including both hips, and a lateral of the injured hip are necessary. This could be supplemented by oblique views and a CT scan [4, 7, 9]. Immediate reduction is mandatory unless the condition of the patient does not allow it. Based on the outcome data of Marchetti et al. [10], the definitive surgical procedure to the hip and femur can be delayed to allow stabilisation of the patient’s condition, as in this case. Open reduction has become the primary treatment for hip dislocations associated with femoral head fractures. The management of these lesions can include fragment excision, fixation using <b>countersunk</b> AO <b>screws,</b> Herbert screws and bioabsorbable pins [2, 6], or even arthroplasty [5, 7]. There are different surgical approaches that can be used: anterior, lateral or posterior [8]; many authors prefer the anterior approach because it permits less estimated blood loss, shorter surgical times and better visualisation and fixation. However, it has the theoretical disadvantage of producing greater vascular damage and the development of more clinically significant heterotopic ossification [3]. In contrast, Marchetti et al. [10] did not observe a statistically significant difference between these different approaches. A standard rehabilitation protocol for this type of injury has not been reported but this patient, like others reported, began weight-bearing at 25 % from 3  months, 50 % weight-bearing at 4 – 5  months and to an ‘as-tolerated’ level at 6 – 7  months. Although it is anticipated that these patients will have a poor prognosis, the outcome thus far has been reasonable. This {{may be due to the}} short-term follow-up that is found with previous and this current report.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Although {{there has}} been {{significant}} progress {{in the design of}} implants for osteosynthesis, the occurrence of failures in these medical devices are still frequent. These implants are prone to suffer from fretting corrosion due to micromotion that takes place between the screw heads and plate holes. Consequently, fretting corrosion {{has been the subject of}} research in order to understand its influence on the structural integrity of osteosynthesis implants. The aim of this paper is to correlate the surface finish characteristics of bone plate-screw systems with fretting corrosion. Methods The surface finish (machined and polished) of five specimens taken from three commercial dynamic compression plates (DCP) were evaluated. For testing, the specimens were fixed with bone screws, immersed in a solution of 0. 90 % NaCl and subjected to a rocking motion with an amplitude of 1. 70 mm and frequency of 1. 0 Hz for 1. 0 &# 215; 106 cycles, according to the ASTM F 897 standard. Both, plate and screws were manufactured in Brazil with ASTM F 138 stainless steel. Results Flaws on the hole countersink area and on the screw thread of some specimens were identified stereoscopically. At the end of the test all the specimens showed evidence of fretting corrosion with an average metal loss of 4. 80 mg/million cycles. Conclusion An inadequate surface finish in some areas of the plates and screws may have favored the incidence of damage to the passive film, accelerating the fretting corrosion at the interfaces between the plate hole <b>countersink</b> and the <b>screw</b> head.
