5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E

25|$|Motivating operations, MOs, {{relate to}} the field of {{motivation}} in that they help improve understanding aspects <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence future behavior. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.|$|E
25|$|After its peak, gin {{consumption}} rapidly declined. From eighteen {{million gallons}} in 1743, it dropped {{to just over}} seven million gallons in 1751 and to less than two million by 1758, and generally declined {{to the end of}} the century. A number of factors appear to have converged to discourage consumption of gin. These include the production of higher quality beer of lower price, rising corn prices and taxes which eroded the price advantage of gin, a temporary ban on distilling, an increasing criticism of drunkenness, a newer standard <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> criticized coarseness and excess, increased tea and coffee consumption, an increase in piety and increasing industrialization with a consequent emphasis on sobriety and labor efficiency.|$|E
25|$|From 1974 to 1979, Haig {{served as}} the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), the Commander of NATO forces in Europe, and Commander-in-Chief of United States European Command (CinCUSEUR). Haig took the same route to SHAPE every day – a pattern <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> did not go unnoticed by {{terrorist}} groups. On June 25, 1979, Haig {{was the target of}} an assassination attempt in Mons, Belgium. A land mine blew up under the bridge on which Haig's car was traveling, narrowly missing Haig's car and wounding three of his bodyguards in a following car. Authorities later attributed responsibility for the attack to the Red Army Faction (RAF). In 1993 a German court sentenced Rolf Clemens Wagner, a former RAF member, to life imprisonment for the assassination attempt.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} portion of Toole's {{military}} career {{one of his}} primary motivations for advancement was to acquire a private office. Privacy was a significant luxury on the island {{with some of the}} men renting rooms in nearby hotels so they could have some solitude. Toole's army buddy David Kubach, also an aspiring writer, lent him a green Swedish-made Halda typewriter for use in his office. The barracks consisted solely of college educated English professors, which gave it a different makeup from usual army companies. In contrast to almost all other army barracks where gays kept their sexual orientation a secret, there was an openly gay contingent which flaunted their homosexuality. The gay men reserved a portion of the barracks for themselves and as they did not proposition any of the straight instructors, they were left alone. However, this particular group of gay men drank significantly more {{than the rest of the}} group and eventually began to exhibit a loud, rowdy, and vulgar brand <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> made the straight men uncomfortable. Toole's response was to ignore their behavior and it lost him the respect of some of the men in the barracks. The problem came to a head when a gay instructor attempted suicide by overdosing on APC (aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine) tablets after being spurned by another soldier. When Toole found the man he waited a half-hour to call for help, hoping he would awaken on his own. His friend Kubach stated that this was because it would look bad for the soldier and that he would most likely get himself court martialed for a suicide attempt. Some of his fellow soldiers were livid and held a meeting deciding whether to report Toole's negligence. Ultimately, they did not report his behavior and the army never filed any charges but his relationships with many of the men were irrevocably changed.|$|E
