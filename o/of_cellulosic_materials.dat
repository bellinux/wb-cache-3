The impact of toxic metal ions can be minimized by different technologies, viz., chemical precipitation, membrane filtration, oxidation, reverse osmosis, flotation and adsorption.

Cellulosic materials are of low cost and widely used, and very promising for the future. These are available in abundant quantity, are cheap and have low or little economic value.

40|$|Since Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{lacks the}} {{cellulase}} complexes that hydrolyze cellulosic materials, which are {{abundant in the}} world, two types of hydrolytic enzymes involved in the degradation <b>of</b> <b>cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> to glucose were genetically co-immobilized on its cell surface for direct utilization <b>of</b> <b>cellulosic</b> <b>materials,</b> one of the final goals of our studies. The genes encoding FI-carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) and β-glucosidase from the fungus Aspergillus aculeatus were individually fused with the gene encoding the C-terminal half (320 amino acid residues from the C terminus) of yeast α-agglutinin and introduced into S. cerevisiae. The delivery of CMCase and β-glucosidase to the cell surface {{was carried out by}} the secretion signal sequence of the native signal sequence of CMCase and by the secretion signal sequence of glucoamylase from Rhizopus oryzae for β-glucosidase, respectively. The genes were expressed by the glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase promoter from S. cerevisiae. The CMCase and β-glucosidase activities were detected in the cell pellet fraction, not in the culture supernatant. The display of CMCase and β-glucosidase proteins on the cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. The cells displaying these cellulases could grow on cellobiose or water-soluble cellooligosaccharides as the sole carbon source. The degradation and assimilation of cellooligosaccharides were confirmed by thin-layer chromatography. This result showed that the cell surface-engineered yeast with these enzymes can be endowed with the ability to assimilate cellooligosaccharides.

As we care more about the spontaneous of organic materials,we want to know how much effect the two approximations have for spontaneous combustion of organic materials. Cellulosic materials (such as sawdust) are typical organic materials of spontaneous combustion. In this paper, we provide an efficient indirect method to calculate the critical parameters of spontaneous combustion <b>of</b> <b>cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> at different conditions. We can know that, the effect of dimensionless activation energy and Biot number to critical Frank-Kamenetskii parameter can be almost offset for cellulosic materials. However, the effect of dimensionless activation energy and Biot number to critical dimensionless temperature cannot be ignored. But, as the critical Frank-Kamenetskii parameter is more useful than the dimensionless temperature, the two approximations can be reasonable for spontaneous combustion <b>of</b> <b>cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> or other materials like them...|$|E

This work examined four practical ways of transforming the vast amount of cellulosic wastes in our environment into a valuable resource. Being a natural habitat of cell-wall hydrolyzing organisms, cellulosic wastes are good sources of viable cellulolytic organisms. These are organisms that produce enzymes that degrade plant cell-wall polymers. The wastes can therefore serve {{as a source of}} low-cost fermentation substrates for producing industrial enzymes needed for the saccharification <b>of</b> <b>cellulosic</b> <b>materials.</b> It could also be used as cheap carbon and energy source for selective media used in cultivating cellulolytic organisms. Such uses will undoubtedly reduce the cost microbial media and also the production cost of cellulolytic enzymes. The waste cellulosic materials can also be enzymatically hydrolyzed into simple sugars using cellulolytic enzymes such as cellulases and xylanases. Hydrolysis of plant cell wall polysaccharides into simple sugars is the primary step needed for the conversion <b>of</b> <b>cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> into bulk chemicals such as ethanol and biogas...|$|E

Time courses of CO 2 evolution rate and conversion of carbon, corresponding to total amount of organic matter decomposed, differed substantially among the experimental runs with controlled different moisture levels. The moisture level yielding the most rapid decomposition of organic matter in the grass clippings was around 50 % (W/W).

The single-step treatment <b>of</b> <b>cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> by a composite suspension of rGO/SMB {{was developed to}} create a barrier layer on sawdust surface providing highly effective fire retardant protection with multiple modes of action.

To utilize this renewable resource in the production of fuel and chemicals, the so called bio-refineries specialized in fractionation and making use of all component of the biomass are needed. Ionic liquids could aid in this task. Ionic liquids (ILs) have shown great potential in the field of biomass processing in general and in the pretreatment of (ligno) -cellulose in particular.
