500|$|Since her {{breakout}} with Pink Friday, Minaj {{has been}} involved in a feud with rapper Lil' Kim, who accused Minaj of copying her style. Although Minaj's [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] was thought to be directed at Kim, she said she was [...] "talking about everyone who has been in interviews talking ... no one is worth being singled out. No one is worth having their name mentioned out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and they never will get that." [...] Kim escalated the feud with her mixtape, Black Friday (2011), whose title and artwork mimic Pink Friday; a fragment from Minaj's diss track, [...] "Tragedy", previewed that April. Their conflict sparked a feud between Minaj and rapper Foxy Brown, who said Minaj misrepresented their conversation about Kim. Brown released the diss tracks [...] "Hold Yuh" [...] and [...] "Massacre" [...] (directed at Kim and Minaj) in November 2010 and January 2011, respectively, but Brown and Minaj settled their dispute in June 2012.|$|E

500|$|In October 2016, in {{response}} to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with [...] "2016 is not over yet". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return {{by the end of the}} year: [...] "Those words did come out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> didn't they? [...] Just wait and see what happens." [...] Three days later, Reznor announced an extended play entitled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip being released later in 2017. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.|$|E
2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, but I take it out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, but I take it out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> occasionally'? [...] I never said that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E

This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} that came out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat.

2500|$|The introitus of the {{traditional}} Requiem Mass in the Catholic Church is loosely based on 2:34–35: [...] "Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them." [...] Several other liturgical prayers are taken from the book.The same chapter, verses 36 and 37, is cited in the Introit of Pentecost Tuesday in the extraordinary liturgy of Missals of 1962 and prior. “Accipite jucunditatem gloriae vestrae, alleluia: gratias agentes Deo, alleluia: qui vos ad caelestia regna vocavit, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
