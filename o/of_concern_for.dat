5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition is <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> museum scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E

Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work {{has not been}} published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists' traps. Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat.|$|E
5|$|Sarraj and Bizri wielded {{substantial}} {{influence in}} Syrian politics, checking {{the power of}} the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from the officer corps. This was a source <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> Quwatli, but he kept both men in their posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his ties with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.|$|E

Out <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> Falle's safety, they taught her how to put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle.

The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E

The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E

The next flight to Mir, STS-86, carried David Wolf aboard Atlantis. During the orbiter's stay, Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to affix a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members to seal the leak in Spektrs hull. Wolf spent 119 days aboard Mir with the EO-24 crew and was replaced during STS-89 with Andy Thomas, who carried out the last US expedition on Mir. The EO-25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–Mir mission, STS-91.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E
