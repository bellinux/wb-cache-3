5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> ice suggests that its supply <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen {{fixation}} requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, sources <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> {{compounds}} were limited. Natural sources originated {{either from}} biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions.

At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E
