5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials questioned about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex <b>offenders</b> <b>and</b> Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than any amount of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance. The 27-year-old priest {{had been at the}} church since completing seminary training in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{judicial}} system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use {{during and after the}} Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual <b>offenders</b> <b>and</b> jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{headquarters}} of North Yorkshire County Council (County Hall) and Hambleton District Council (the Civic Centre) are both located in Northallerton; these serve many parishes in the area.

Northallerton Prison, which used to house young <b>offenders</b> <b>and</b> adults from the North Yorkshire area, closed in 2014. It once had the world's largest treadmill.|$|E

5|$|The {{team had}} tens of {{thousands}} of documents translated, released an age-progressed image, and investigated over 8,000 potential sightings. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 650 sex <b>offenders</b> <b>and</b> 60 persons of interest. The inquiry was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four. In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining line of inquiry, and another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year. By March 2017 the inquiry had cost £11.1 million.|$|E
5|$|In the senate, Mount {{served on}} a variety of committees, chairing the Senate Committees on Coastal Restoration and Flood Control, Revenue and Fiscal Affairs, and also serving as Vice-Chair of the Senate Committee on Education. In 2008, she became {{chairwoman}} of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare. Mount often sponsors legislation regarding health and public service. This includes bills intended to identify sex <b>offenders</b> <b>and</b> enact term limits for various boards and commissions. She was responsible for passing these term limits as an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution, as SB 232 on November 4, 2008. Mount also sponsored legislation to merge New Orleans criminal and civil district courts, create a childhood and family learning center, couple the opening of new hospice care providers with inspections of existing ones, allow police to suspend driver's licenses of teenagers with problems at school, and create a state-run internet database providing information on the quality of health care providers. Mount was responsible for legislation that made Louisiana water fluoridation mandatory, and, in her capacity as chair of the Senate Health committee, Mount in 2008 declared major Louisiana health care reform unlikely without prior federal reform.|$|E

5000|$|The National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the {{research}} {{arm of the}} U.S. Department of Justice, has also conducted research into the continued development of the DNA forensic evidence backlog. In their research, the NIJ tracked the processing of the two main types of DNA evidence: [...] "casework" [...] DNA <b>and</b> [...] "convicted <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> arrestee" [...] DNA. Casework DNA refers to DNA samples collected from crime scenes, victims and suspects in criminal cases, while convicted <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> arrestee DNA refers to samples taken in accordance with state and federal laws for entry into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's CODIS system. In a 2010 survey, the NIJ found that the nationwide casework DNA backlog exceeded 111,500 samples, a substantial increase over the 38,000 cases considered to be backlogged in a 2005 Bureau of Justice Statistics survey. Convicted <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> arrestee DNA samples have experienced even more substantial backlogging according to the NIJ, {{although there is a}} larger number of convicted <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> arrestee samples sent for processing. Regardless, a 2009 NIJ study found that the year-end backlog of convicted <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> arrestee samples had reached over 950,000 samples, almost the equivalent of an entire year's capacity for the nation's crime laboratories.|$|R

Statistically significant associations emerged for the following characteristics: (a) prior physical and sexual victimization of the <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> having another family member identified as a perpetrator of sexual abuse; (b) prior sexual victimization of the <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> prior sexual victimization of another family member; and (c) a history of sexual abuse of the <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> having a family member with prior sexual victimization...|$|R

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{critical}} analysis of how the main crime stakeholders (victim, <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> community) are represented within policy and legal statutes on restorative justice. The paper starts by sketching out the legal and policy archive of restorative justice, focussing on the most recurrent normative representations of the victim, <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> community, and unearthing their theoretical underpinnings. The goal is to identify a range of typified features and to assemble them together by profiling the ‘ideal stakeholders’ of restorative justice. The research includes a comparison between the ‘ideal’ victim, <b>offender</b> <b>and</b> community, pinpointing any overlaps and differences. Finally, it interrogates the cultural context within which these representations have emerged historically, influencing policy and laws. By way of reconstructing and discussing what is taken for granted in restorative justice and its background, {{the aim of the}} work is to foster critical reflection on the normative dimension of a popular development of western penal policies...|$|R
