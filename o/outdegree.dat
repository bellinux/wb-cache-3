The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information). In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and <b>outdegree.</b> Accordingly, indegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node and <b>outdegree</b> is the number of ties that the node directs to others.

Like an undirected graph, a directed graph consists of vertices and edges, but each edge is directed from one of its endpoints to the other endpoint. A directed pseudoforest is a directed graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge; that is, it has <b>outdegree</b> at most one. A directed 1-forest [...] most commonly called a functional graph (see below), sometimes maximal directed pseudoforest [...] is a directed graph in which each vertex has <b>outdegree</b> exactly one.

For k= 3 the edge-connectivity 8 suffices. This implies the weak 3 -flow conjecture proposed in 1988 by Jaeger (a natural weakening of Tutteʼs 3 -flow conjecture which is still open) and also a weakened version of the more general circular flow conjecture proposed by Jaeger in 1982. It also implies the tree-decomposition conjecture proposed in 2006 by Bárat and Thomassen when restricted to stars.

40|$|We {{perform a}} reverse {{engineering}} from the ``extended Spellman data'', consisting of 6178 mRNA levels measured by microarrays at 73 instances in four time series during the cell {{cycle of the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. By assuming a linear model of the genetic regulatory network, and imposing an extra constraint (the Lasso), we obtain a unique inference of coupling parameters. These parameters are transfered into an adjacent matrix, which is analyzed with respect to topological properties and biological relevance. We find a very broad distribution of <b>outdegrees</b> in the network, compatible with earlier findings for biological systems and totally incompatible with a random graph, and also indications of modules in the network. Finally, we show there is an excess of genes coding for transcription factors among the genes of highest <b>outdegrees,</b> a fact which indicates that our approach has biological relevance.

40|$|Abstract—We present novel {{indexing}} {{and searching}} schemes for semantic graphs {{based on the}} notion of the i. degrees of a node. The i. degrees allow searches performed on the graph to use “type ” and relationship information, rather than textual labels, to identify nodes. We aim to identify a network graph (fragment) within a large semantic graph (database). A fragment may represent incomplete information that a researcher has collected on a sub-network of interest. While textual labels might be available, they are highly unreliable, and cannot be used for identification. Since this problem comes from the classical NP-hard problem of identifying isomorphic subgraphs, our algorithms are heuristic. This paper presents an expansion from our previous i. degree work to include i. indegrees in addition to i. <b>outdegrees.</b> The i. <b>outdegrees</b> of a node are determined by the types in the node’s neighborhood, while a node’s i. indegrees are determined by the types of the nodes to which it is a neighbor. To start, all nodes in the database are indexed (can be done offline) according to their i. degrees. The nodes in the database are then filtered and scored for similarity. We present the results from Wikipedia and Random graphs. I...|$|R
