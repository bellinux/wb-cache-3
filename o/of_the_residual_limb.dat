50|$|Initial {{alignment}} of a prosthetic leg is {{conducted by a}} prosthetist or physician to ensure proper use of the limb. The length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> {{is related to the}} amount of asymmetry in the walking pattern, with longer stumps on average having greater control. Mis{{alignment of}} joints could result in postures similar to those seen in congenital malformations such as bow-leggedness, knock-knee, pigeon toe, and club foot. Misaligned sockets can simulate excessive hip and knee flexion and extension. As individuals get more experience on the limb, it is expected that they will optimize the alignment for their own preference.|$|E
50|$|An {{amputation}} {{between the}} knee and ankle joints transecting the tibia, or shinbone, {{is referred to as}} a transtibial amputation. In this situation, the patient may retain volitional control over the knee joint. The cause of amputation may dictate the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and the corresponding level of control of the prosthesis. The main impairment for transtibial amputees is the lack of adjustment of the foot and ankle. The foot acts as a lever arm directly attached to the calf muscle, but more than that, it absorbs the impulse from the ground and adapts dynamically to changes in the ground's surface. Transtibial amputees lose the muscle activation pathways necessary for the physical ability to generate work about the ankle joint, as well as the somatosensory and proprioceptive pathways of the lower leg.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, {{with what}} he had learned at Sunnybrook Hospital, {{opportunity}} drew James to the University of California,Berkeley, where, working with C.W. Radcliff, he helped to develop the quadrilateral socket by developing a jig fitting system for amputations above the knee. Unlike previous technology, these jigs held the correct position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb,</b> therefore making fitting of the socket for the residual limb easier and more comfortable for amputees to walk. As Kevin Carroll, James C. Baird, and Katherine Binder relate in their book, Prosthetics and Patient Management: A Comprehensive Clinical Approach, the work that James Foort did at Berkeley and subsequently with the “exploration of the biomechanics of alignment during ambulation remains the basis of contemporary prosthetic alignment.” In addition to developing the quadrilateral socket, the team at Berkeley systematized the prosthesis developed by Colin MacLaurin and Fred Hampton for total absence of the limb. The Berkeley team developed the PTB Below knee prosthesis for amputations below the knee, completely new technologies, The PTB prosthesis enabled the amputee to walk around with no corset or side joints. Not only did these new adaptations {{solve the problem of}} constriction of circulation and ease restriction on the thigh, but it allowed people to be amputated below the knee twice as was usual for amputations related to circulatory problems, thereby increasing their function.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The socket is {{considered}} an element of major importance in <b>the</b> makeup <b>of</b> a prosthesis. Each socket is a tai-lor-made device, designed to fit <b>the</b> unique geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient’s <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> <b>The</b> design and manufacture of a pros-thetic socket traditionally has been a manual process that relies on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> plaster of Paris casts to capture <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient’s <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and then artisan fabrication techniques to manufacture the socket. Computer-aided design and manu-facturing technologies have overcome some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shortcom-ings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional process, but <b>the</b> final manufacture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosthetic socket is still performed manually. Rapid prototyp-ing (RP), a relatively new class of manufacturing technologies, creates physical models directly from three-dimensional (3 -D) computer data. Previous research into <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> RP systems to <b>the</b> manufacture <b>of</b> prosthetic sockets has focused on expensive, high-end technologies that have proven too expensive. This paper investigates <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a cheaper, low-end RP technology known as 3 -D printing.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the pain-pressure relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and the interface pressure at the prosthetic socket-residual limb interface during walking. Load was indented to different regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> through Pelite and polypropylene indenters connected to a force transducer until pain was just perceived. A finite element (FE) model was built simulating the indentation process to evaluate the pressure distribution beneath the indenter upon indentation. Results suggested that pain is triggered when the applied peak pressure overshot a certain threshold. A second FE model was built to predict the socket-limb interface pressure, considering friction/slip and pre-stress produced by donning the limb into a shape-modified socket which were commonly ignored in previous models under simplifying assumptions. The predicted interface pressure was {{in the range of}} previous clinical pressure measurement and was below the thresholds causing pain. In future investigations, more subjects will be involved for the pain-pressure relationship and more analysis on interface pressure under different conditions, such as alignment, walking speed and style, will be performed.

40|$|Purpose: Many trans-tibial amputees {{could not}} {{tolerate}} long-distance walking. Lack of walking could explain {{for the increased}} cardiovascular diseases mortality rate. This study investigated the effects of long-distance walking (LDW) on socket-limb interface pressure, tactile sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb,</b> and subjective feedbacks, which potentially identified the difficulties in LDW. Method: Five male unilateral trans-tibial amputees walked on a level treadmill {{for a total of}} one hour at comfortable speed. Tactile sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and socket-limb interface pressure during over-ground walking were measured before and after the treadmill walking. Modified Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaires were also administered. Results: After the treadmill walking, the socket-limb interface pressure and the tactile sensitivity at the popliteal depression area were significantly reduced. This corresponds well with the questionnaire results showing that the level of discomfort and pain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> did not increase. The questionnaire revealed that there were significant increases in fatigue level at the sound-side plantar flexors, which could lead to impaired dynamic stability. Conclusions: Fatigue of sound-side plantar-flexor was the main difficulty faced by the five subjects when walking long-distances. This finding might imply the importance of refining prosthetic components and rehabilitation protocols in reducing the muscle fatigue. Implications for Rehabilitation After long-distance walking (LDW) of the trans-tibal amputee subjects, there were significant increases in fatigue level at the plantar flexors. These might explain the reduced walking stability as perceived by the subjects. LDW did not produce any problems in residual-limb comfort and pain feeling. These were in line with the significant reductions of socket-limb interface pressure and the tactile sensitivity at the popliteal depression after LDW. Refinements of prosthetic components and rehabilitation protocols should be attempted to reduce the fatigue of the plantar flexors and facilitate LDW.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{there are at least}} three million amputees in the world. Amputation can be caused by vascular diseases, infection, cancer, and traumatic accidents. Prosthetic replacement is one of the most significant rehabilitation programs. A good lower-limb prosthesis can restore locomotive function and improve the self body-image as well as general health of an amputee. A prosthesis replaces some of the important functions lost due to amputation, and should do so without causing discomfort, pain, or damage to the soft tissue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> An external prosthesis is composed of a prosthetic socket and a prosthetic foot, which are interconnected by a shank and possibly some prosthetic joints. A socket is a part of a prosthesis that connects to the residual limb. A good understanding of the mechanical interaction between the socket and the residual limb is required to provide comfort and prevent skin breakdown around the residual limb. The shape of the socket is not exactly a replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb,</b> but should be modified so that the load is transferred to the residual limb efficiently. This addresses the nonuniform thickness of soft tissue around the residual limb and the difference in load-tolerant abilities over residual limb regions. A socket is designed to support the body weight of an amputee by applying a reasonable pressure to the residual limb. A number of factors, such as socket design, residual limb length, and alignment, may influence the socket-limb interface pressure.

40|$|The biomechanical {{interaction}} between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket determines the quality of fit of the socket in lower limb prosthetics. An understanding of this interaction {{and the development of}} quantitative measures to predict the quality of fit of the socket are important for optimal socket design. Finite-element modeling is used widely for biomechanical modeling of the limb/socket interaction and requires information on the internal and external geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> Volumetric imaging methods such as X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound have been used to obtain residual limb shape information. Of these modalities, ultrasound has been introduced most recently and its development for visualization in prosthetics is the least mature.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{suspension}} in lower limb prosthetics has {{significant role in}} amputee's satisfaction. Good suspension lessens the pistoning movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> inside the prosthetic socket. A number of methods are used for measuring pistoning; however {{most of them are}} difficult to be performed inside the prosthetic clinic and by every prosthetist. The {{purpose of this study was}} to introduce a new simple method for measuring pistoning in Transtibial prosthesis in static position. This method was developed in-house at Össur for the first time. In this study we used this technique to measure pistoning between socket and liner in three subjects. The result showed that this method can be an alternative method for measuring pistoning. Moreover, that makes it simple for prosthetists to test pistoning in the clinic and is a safe method for the subject. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|This work, {{supported}} by the Media Lab Consortium, evaluates <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a Variable Impedance Prosthetic (VIPr) socket for a transtibial amputee using computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Compliant features are seamlessly integrated into a 3 D printed socket to achieve lower interface peak pressures over bony protuberances by using anthropomorphic data acquired through surface scanning and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. An inverse linear mathematical transformation spatially maps quantitative measurements (bone tissue depth) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> to <b>the</b> corresponding socket shape and impedance characteristics. The CAD/CAM VIPr socket is compared to a state-of-the-art prosthetic socket of similar internal geometry and shape, designed by a prosthetist using conventional methods. An active, bilateral transtibial male amputee of weight 70 kg walks on a force plate loaded 5 -meter walkway, at self-selected speeds while synchronized ground reaction forces, motion capture data and socket <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> interface pressures are measured for the evaluated sockets. We anticipated a decreased average interface pressure (measured using the Teksan F-SocketTM pressure sensors) in the VIPr socket, especially over stiff anatomical landmarks including the fibula head, the tibia, lateral and medial femoral condyles and medial tibial flare. Contact interface pressure recorded during stance of a complete gait cycle indicated a 15 % and 17 % reduction at toe-off and heel-strike respectively at the fibula head while the subject uses a VIPr socket in comparison to a conventional socket of similar internal shape. A corresponding 7 % and 8 % reduction in pressure is observed along the tibia. Similar trends of high-pressure reductions are observed during stair ascent trials with the VIPr socket. by David Moinina Sengeh. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{care and}} {{rehabilitation}} of individuals after lower limb amputation presents a substantial and growing socioeconomic challenge. Clinical outcome is {{closely linked to}} successful functional rehabilitation with a prosthetic limb, which depends upon comfortable prosthetic <b>limb</b> – <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> load transfer. Despite early interest in the 1980 s, the amputated limb has received considerably less attention in computational biomechanical analysis than other subjects, such as arthroplasty. This systematic literature review investigates <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art in <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> finite element analysis published since 2000. The identified studies were grouped into the following categories: (1) residuum-prosthesis interface mechanics; (2) residuum soft tissue internal mechanics; (3) identification of residuum tissue characteristics; (4) proposals for incorporating FEA into the prosthesis fitting process; (5) analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> prosthetic componentry concepts to improve load transfer to the residuum, such as the monolimb and structural socket compliance; and (6) analysis of osseointegrated (OI) prostheses. <b>The</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art is critically appraised in order to form recommendations for future modelling studies in terms of geometry, material properties, boundary conditions interface models, and relevant but un-investigated issues. Finally, <b>the</b> practical implementation <b>of</b> these approaches is discussed...|$|R

Thirty participants, consisting of unilateral (n = 10), and bilateral (n = 10) amputees, and non-injured controls (n = 10) volunteered to complete eight activities; resting in a supine position, walking on a flat (0. 48, 0. 67, 0. 89, 1. 12, 1. 34 m. s- 1) and an inclined (3 and 5 % gradient at 0. 89 m. s- 1) treadmill. During each task, expired gases were collected and an Actigraph GT 3 X+ accelerometer was worn on the right hip, left hip and lumbar spine. Linear regression analyses were conducted between outputs from each accelerometer site and criterion PAEE (indirect calorimetry). Mean bias ± 95 % limits of agreement were calculated. Additional covariates were incorporated to assess whether they improved <b>the</b> prediction accuracy <b>of</b> regression models. Subsequent mean absolute error statistics were calculated for the derived models at all sites using a leave-one out cross-validation analysis. Predicted PAEE at each anatomical location was significantly (P< 0. 01) correlated with criterion PAEE (P< 0. 01). Wearing the GT 3 X+ on <b>the</b> shortest <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> demonstrates <b>the</b> strongest correlation (unilateral; r = 0. 86, bilateral; r = 0. 94), smallest ± 95 % limits of agreement (unilateral; ± 2. 15, bilateral ± 1. 99 kcal·min- 1) and least absolute percentage error (unilateral; 22 ± 17 %, bilateral 17 ± 14 %) to criterion PAEE. We have developed accurate PAEE population specific prediction models in lower-limb amputees using an ActiGraph GT 3 X+ accelerometer. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 3 anatomical locations considered, wearing the accelerometer on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shortest <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> provides <b>the</b> most accurate prediction <b>of</b> PAEE with <b>the</b> least error in unilateral and bilateral traumatic lower-limb amputees...|$|R
