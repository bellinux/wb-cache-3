Vergniauds crew mutinied after one of its members was killed when a protest against intervention in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> was bloodily suppressed and forced the return of the French ships supporting the Whites. Mirabeau ran aground in February 1919 off the coast of the Crimea and could not be refloated until some of her guns and armor were removed.|$|E
5|$|In February 1918 General Mannerheim {{weighed the}} {{question}} of where to focus the general offensive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites,</b> between two strategically vital enemy strongholds: Tampere, Finland's major industrial town in the south-west, and Viipuri, Karelia's main city. Although seizing Viipuri offered major advantages, the lack of combat skills of his army and potential for a major counterattack by the enemy in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{carried out}} an {{unsuccessful}} general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive combats were the Battle of Tampere and Viipuri, {{won by the}} Whites, and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> and the German forces. Both the Reds and Whites engaged in political terror. A high number of Red POWs died due to malnutrition and disease. Altogether, around 39,000 people – 36,000 Finns – perished in the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Chariot {{racing in}} the Byzantine Empire also {{included}} the Roman racing clubs, which {{continued to play}} {{a prominent role in}} these public exhibitions. By this time, the Blues (Vénetoi) and the Greens (Prásinoi) had come to overshadow the other two factions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> (Leukoí) and Reds (Roúsioi), while still maintaining the paired alliances, although these were now fixed as Blue and White vs. Green and Red. These circus factions were no longer the private businesses they were during the Roman Empire. Instead, the races began to be given regular, public funding, putting them under imperial control. Running the chariot races at public expense was probably a cost-cutting and labor-reducing measure, making it easier to channel the proper funds into the racing organizations. The Emperor himself belonged to one of the four factions, and supported the interests of either the Blues or the Greens.|$|E
5|$|The White Guards {{executed}} Red Guard {{and party}} leaders, common Red troopers, socialist {{members of the}} Finnish parliament and local Red administration, and those active in the Red terror. The level of killings varied over the months as they conquered southern Finland, and initially did not encounter marked resistance in White Finland. The comprehensive White terror started with the general offensive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> in March 1918, increased constantly, culminated {{in the end of}} the war and ceased soon after the enemy had been sent to the prison camps. During the peak of the executions, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. The White terror hit strong against the Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds and several Russian non-socialist civilians were killed in the aftermath of the Battle for Viipuri.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of White Finland, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud's first senate, {{was called the}} Vaasa Senate after relocation to the west-coast city of Vaasa, acting as the capital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> from 29 January to 3 May. In domestic policy the White Senate's main goal was to return the political right to power in Finland. The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported monarchy and opposed democracy; others approved parliamentarianism since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917-1918 concluded, that empowering the common people would not work. Social liberals and reformist non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism. They initially resisted German military help, but the prolonged warfare changed their stance.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} five {{ships were}} obsolescent {{by the end}} of the war and most were assigned to secondary roles. Two of the sisters were sent to the Black Sea to support the Whites during the Russian Civil War. One ship ran aground and the crew of the other mutinied after one of its members was killed during a protest against intervention in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites.</b> Both ships were quickly condemned and later sold for scrap. The remaining three sisters received partial modernizations in the mid-1920s and became training ships until they were condemned in the mid-1930s and later scrapped. The only survivor still afloat at the beginning of World War II in August 1939 had been hulked in 1931 and was serving as part of the navy's torpedo school. She was captured by the Germans when they occupied Vichy France in 1942 and scuttled by them after the Allied invasion of southern France in 1944.|$|E

She was further damaged by the explosion of a mine when the Whites abandoned the Crimea in 1920. Once she fell into Soviet hands she spent several years under repair, which required parts and material from her sisters that were even more damaged. She was given the proper revolutionary name of Komintern, after the Communist International on 31 December 1922 and was recommissioned in June 1923.|$|E
5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites,</b> then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed {{by a number of}} white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|E
