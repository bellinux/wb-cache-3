A cumulative gross revenue for the film was reported to be as 25 crore including 3.5 crore from overseas, the largest for any Telugu film at that time.|$|E

5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%).

5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} in about 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries {{the risk of}} acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections. Although rare because <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> it is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Naimski, {{as a head}} of the State Protection Office, {{started the}} process <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> people {{suspected}} of being Communist collaborators in Poland. In June that year he helped Antoni Macierewicz prepare a list of 64 members {{of the government and}} parliament who were named as spies in the police records; these included Wałęsa, then the Polish president. Wałęsa's name was included on the list after a wrenching internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political discretion. In response to the publication of this list, President Wałęsa immediately engineered the fall of prime minister Jan Olszewski and the dismissal of Interior Minister Macierewicz. A parliamentary committee later concluded Wałęsa had not signed an agreement with the secret police.|$|E

40|$|Screen {{time during}} the {{preschool}} years is detrimental to wellbeing. The impact of parental perceptions on preschoolers' screen time is unknown. This paper explores the association between maternal perceptions of the impact <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> time on their preschoolers' wellbeing with their child's screen time and the potential mediating role of {{their perception of the}} appropriate amount <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> time. In 2013 – 2014, mothers of 575 preschoolers (2 – 5  years; metropolitan Melbourne and online sources) reported: their perceptions of the impact <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> time on 11 aspects of wellbeing, conceptually grouped to physical, social and cognitive well-being; their perceptions of the appropriate amount <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> time for preschoolers; and their child's actual screen time. Regression analyses investigated associations between perceptions and children's screen time. Mediation by perception of the appropriate amount <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> time was examined using indirect effects. Mothers' perceptions of the impact <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> time on social and cognitive wellbeing had a significant indirect effect on children's actual screen time through mothers' perception of the appropriate amount <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> time for their child. Findings illustrate the potential impact of parents' perceptions on their children's behaviors. Although a significant indirect effect was identified, direction of causality cannot be implied. Further exploration of the direction of association to determine causality, and interventions targeting parental perceptions, are warranted...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Heideggerian phenomenological analysis <b>of</b> <b>screens.</b> In a world and an epoch where screens pervade {{a great many}} aspects of human experience, we submit that phenomenology, much in a traditional methodological form, can provide an interesting and novel basis for our understanding <b>of</b> <b>screens.</b> We ground our analysis in the ontology of Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time [1927 / 1962], claiming that screens will only show themselves as they are if taken as screens-in-the-world. Thus, the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> is not investigated in its empirical form or conceptually. It is rather taken as a grounding intentional orientation that conditions our engagement with certain surfaces as we comport ourselves towards them “as screens. ” In doing this we claim to have opened up the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> {{in a new and}} meaningful way...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} the length <b>of</b> exposure to <b>screens</b> and {{the prevalence of}} consumption of meals and snacks by Brazilian adolescents in front <b>of</b> <b>screens.</b> METHODS We evaluated 74, 589 12 to 17 -year old adolescents from 1, 247 schools in 124 Brazilian municipalities. A self-administered questionnaire was used. Its segment regarding nutrition contained questions about using TV, computers, and video game systems, having meals while watching TV, and consuming snacks in front <b>of</b> <b>screens.</b> Consumption <b>of</b> meals and snacks in front <b>of</b> <b>screens</b> was analyzed according to the following variables: geographical region, gender, age range, type of school (public or private), and school shift. The prevalences and their respective 95 % confidence intervals were estimated under a complex sampling design. RESULTS A {{great deal of the}} adolescents (73. 5 %, 95 %CI 72. 3 - 74. 7) reported spending two or more hours a day in front <b>of</b> <b>screens.</b> That habit was more frequent among male adolescents, private school students, morning shift students, and students from Brazil&# 8217;s South region. More than half of the adolescents (56. 6 %, 95 %CI 55. 4 - 57. 8) reported almost always or always having meals in front of TV, and 39. 6 % (95 %CI 38. 8 - 40. 5) of them said they consumed snacks in front <b>of</b> <b>screens</b> exactly as often. Both situations were the most prevalent ones among the girls, who attended public schools and were from Brazil&# 8217;s Midwest region. CONCLUSIONS Length <b>of</b> exposure to <b>screens</b> and consumption <b>of</b> meals and snacks almost always or always in front <b>of</b> <b>screens</b> are high among Brazilian adolescents. It is necessary to develop strategies aiming to reduce the length <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> use, considering the media reality that children and adolescents have been experiencing from earlier and earlier ages.
