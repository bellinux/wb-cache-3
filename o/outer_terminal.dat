Though the plans included a new rapid transit rail line in the median strip of the new highway, connecting with the Milwaukee-Dearborn subway, and though a temporary right-of-way was established to allow rail service to continue during construction, a number of operational and political obstacles led to the interurban deciding to change their service to the <b>outer</b> <b>terminal</b> of the elevated line at Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park.

40|$|A {{new species}} of Parameiropsis Becker, 1974 is {{described}} from the Porcupine Seabight and questions about the position of this genus within Harpacticoida are briefly addressed. The new species is the smallest representative of the genus and extends the depth and distribution range of Parameiropsis to 880  m and 51 ° 25. 9 ’N. Parameiropsis antennafortis sp. n. differs from the known species (viz. P. rapiens Becker, 1974, P. peruanus Becker, 1974 and P. magnus Itô, 1983) basically in total body size, shape of labrum, robustness of A 2, armature of mouthparts and P 1 -P 5, shape of P 5 and shape of copulatory pore and tube. Additionally, the new species has the apical elements of P 1 enp- 3 transformed into a unipinnate spine, a spiniform <b>outer</b> <b>terminal</b> seta and a miniaturized inner terminal seta. This condition is not homologous to the Podogennonta pattern.

40|$|Two {{new species}} of the {{freshwater}} copepod genus Eucyclops are described from two sites in the Chihuahuan Desert (CHD), which includes parts of northern Mexico and southern United States. Eucyclops cuatrocienegas sp. nov. is distinguished by having a short inner spiniform seta on the fifth leg, relatively short caudal rami, and a partially naked spine of the fourth endopod, among other characters. The finding of E. cuatrocienegas in Cuatro Ciénegas, an area in the CHD that is known for harbouring {{the highest number of}} endemic aquatic species in North America, suggests that these habitats could yield other endemic forms. The other new species resembles the Neotropical E. pseudoensifer Dussart, 1984 but differs in having a shorter basipodal spine of the first leg, shorter <b>outer</b> <b>terminal</b> spiniform caudal seta, a different length ratio of inner/outer spines of leg 4 third endopodal segment, and a different pattern of the serra on the caudal rami. Eucyclops pseudoensifer, originally collected from a high altitude lake in the Andean system of western Venezuela, is here redescribed from female and male type specimens. The description of E. chihuahuensis sp. nov. recognizes both the subtle but consistent differences of this population and its environmental isolation in this arid region. The North American records of E. pseudoensifer should be revised in the light of these findings {{in order to determine the}} real distributional ranges of these species.

40|$|Sialic acids {{are common}} monosaccharides that are widely {{expressed}} as <b>outer</b> <b>terminal</b> units on all vertebrate cell surfaces, and {{play fundamental roles}} in cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions. The predominant sialic acids on most mammalian cells are N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu 5 Gc) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu 5 Ac). Neu 5 Gc is notable for its deficiency in humans, due to a species-specific and species-universal inactivating deletion in the CMAH gene encoding the hydroxylase that converts CMP-Neu 5 Ac to CMP-Neu 5 Gc. However, Neu 5 Gc is metabolically incorporated into human tissues from dietary sources (particularly red meat), and detected at even higher levels in some human cancers. Early life exposure to Neu 5 Gc containing foods {{in the presence of}} certain commensal bacteria that incorporate dietary Neu 5 Gc into lipooligosaccharides can lead to generation of antibodies that are also cross-reactive against Neu 5 Gc-containing glycans in human tissues (xeno-autoantigens). Such anti-Neu 5 Gc xeno-autoantibodies are found in all humans, although ranging widely in levels among individuals, and displaying diverse and variable specificities for the underlying glycan. Experimental evidence in a human-like Neu 5 Gc deficient Cmah-/- mouse model shows that inflammation due to xenosialitis caused by this antigen-antibody interaction can promote tumor progression, suggesting a likely mechanism for the well-known epidemiological link between red meat consumption and carcinoma risk. In this review, we discuss the history of this field, mechanisms of Neu 5 Gc incorporation into tissues, the origin and specificities of human anti-Neu 5 Gc antibodies, their use as possible cancer biomarkers, implications of xenosialitis in cancer initiation and progression, and current and future approaches towards immunotherapy that could take advantage of this unusual human-specific phenomenon...|$|E
