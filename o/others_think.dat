5|$|The {{nature of}} the dark patches, which mainly occur on the leading {{hemisphere}} and inside craters, is not known. Some scientists hypothesized that they are of cryovolcanic origin (analogs of lunar maria), while <b>others</b> <b>think</b> that the impacts excavated dark material buried beneath the pure ice (crust). In the latter case Oberon {{should be at least}} partially differentiated, with the ice crust lying atop the non-differentiated interior.|$|E
5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what <b>others</b> <b>think,</b> and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near the inner Solar System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while <b>others</b> <b>think</b> that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what <b>others</b> <b>think,</b> further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

25|$|The {{source of}} the folktale is uncertain. Some {{speculate}} an Indian origin, while <b>others</b> <b>think</b> that the Indian parallels stem from the biblical story.

Hermann Gunkel rules out the possibility that such a sophisticated motif had developed independently in different places.

25|$|In its broader context, the Judgment of Solomon forms part of {{the account}} of Solomon's reign, {{generally}} conceived as a distinct segment in the Book of Kings, compassing chapters 3–11 in 1 Kings; Some include in it also chapters 1–2, while <b>others</b> <b>think</b> that these chapters originally ended the account of David's reign in 2 Samuel. According to Liver, the source for the Judgment of Solomon story, {{as well as other}} parts of the account of Solomon's reign, is in the speculated book of the Acts of Solomon, which he proposes to be a wisdom work which originated in the court circles shortly after the split of the united monarchy.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{primitive}} marginocephalians were bipedal or facultative quadrupedal, and derived {{individuals were}} obligate quadrupedal. This is especially prominent in Ceratopsia, where only the primitive Psittacosaurus is bipedal. All the derived forms were strong quadrupeds, although their stance is controversial. Some {{think they were}} fairly columnar, with front limbs erect under the body, {{which would have been}} more efficient for speed. <b>Others</b> <b>think</b> the legs were more sprawling, as evidenced by the shape of the forelimb bones. Although not as fast, this posture would have been efficient for grazing vegetation on the ground. Less is known about bipedal pachycephalosaur locomotion, although they must have had a fairly broad girth in order to make room for their enlarged gut.|$|E

25|$|However, a bear's first {{reaction}} upon detecting a human {{is to run}} away. Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from {{thousands of years ago}} when they had to be wary of larger and more dangerous carnivores. Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that they have come to fear. Still <b>others</b> <b>think</b> that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before.|$|E
25|$|Plan Dalet was {{finalized}} on 10 March 1948, {{under the}} direction of Yigael Yadin. 75 pages long, it laid down the rules and the objects that were to be followed by Haganah during {{the second phase of the}} war. Its principal objective was to secure Yishuv's uninterrupted territorial connections, particularly in response to the war of the roads carried out by Al-Hussayni and in preparation for the Arab states' declared intervention. Plan Dalet caused quite a controversy among historians. Some see it as a plan that was primarily defensive and military in nature and a preparation against invasion, whereas <b>others</b> <b>think</b> that the plan was offensive in nature and aimed at conquering as much of Palestine as possible.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authorities}} also {{equate the}} town named Menapia (or Manapia) as Wexford town – others place it further {{north along the}} east coast, roughly near Wicklow town. A river called the Modonnu(s), whose estuary is near Menapia, is often {{said to be the}} Slaney – <b>others</b> <b>think</b> it is the Avoka river. It is because the Slaney is the only major river in the south-east that many as a result think that it is the Modonnu(s) river, thereby making Menapia equal to Wexford town (this theory only seems to work if Hook Head is made the Sacred Cape). Most authorities seem to agree that Menapia is not Wexford, but is a town located further north along the coast. However, this is not certain.|$|E
