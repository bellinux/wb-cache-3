50|$|In 1826 Benoit Fourneyron {{developed}} a high efficiency (80%) <b>outward-flow</b> water <b>turbine.</b> Water was directed tangentially through the turbine runner, {{causing it to}} spin. Jean-Victor Poncelet designed an inward-flow turbine in about 1820 that used the same principles. S. B. Howd obtained a US patent in 1838 for a similar design.|$|R
