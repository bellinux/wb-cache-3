5|$|A Kentucky {{governor}} is elected under <b>our</b> <b>constitution</b> {{for four years}} without legal opportunity, regardless of how acceptable his program has been, to put it before the public for approval or rejection. In practical application he must successfully run the legislative gauntlet during the first hurried ninety days he is in office {{if he is to}} adopt a program and have an administration worthy of history's harsh pen. The remaining general assembly two years hence is invariably plagued with vicissitudes common to 'lame duck' tenures.|$|E
5|$|Our {{way forward}} lies in decisively turning our backs on the {{policies}} and practices that violate our greatest strength: <b>our</b> <b>Constitution</b> and the commitment it embodies {{to the rule of}} law. Liberty and security do not compete in a zero-sum game; our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security. The ACLU's National Security Project advocates for national security policies that are consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and fundamental human rights. The Project litigates cases relating to detention, torture, discrimination, surveillance, censorship, and secrecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{young men}} and women of Hazelwood East {{expected}} a civics lesson, but not the one the Court teaches them today...Such unthinking contempt for individual rights is intolerable from any state official. It is particularly insidious from (a school principal) to whom the public entrusts the task of inculcating in its youth an appreciation for the cherished democratic liberties that <b>our</b> <b>constitution</b> guarantees.|$|E
5000|$|... "The old {{constitution}} {{had actually}} written that we banned political parties {{but these days}} when you read <b>our</b> new <b>constitution,</b> <b>our</b> new <b>constitution</b> allows the freedom of rights. There is nothing which says we ban parties." [...] April 2006.|$|R

25|$|The {{fact that}} anybody {{would say that}} {{impeachment}} is off the table {{when we have a}} president who has been so egregious in his violations of <b>our</b> <b>constitution,</b> a president who asserts a unitary executive power, that is absolutely chilling.|$|E
25|$|Keep in mind <b>our</b> <b>Constitution</b> predates the Industrial Revolution. Our founders did {{not know}} about electricity, the train, telephones, radio, television, automobiles, airplanes, rockets, nuclear weapons, satellites, or space exploration. There's a lot they didn't know about. It would be {{interesting}} {{to see what kind of}} document they'd draft today. Just keeping it frozen in time won't hack it.|$|E
25|$|This president, by {{engaging}} in such incredible abuses of power, breaches of trust with both the Congress and the American people, and misleading us into this tragic and unbelievable war, the violation of treaties, other international law, <b>our</b> <b>constitution,</b> our own domestic laws, and then his role in heinous human rights abuses; I think all of that together calls for impeachment.|$|E

50|$|We conclude, therefore, that Section 800.01, as {{previously}} construed by this {{court in the}} cited cases, does prohibit the act charged against this appellant, and did and does afford him, and all others persons, notice that the act complained of was a crime in this state with at least the degree of definiteness required by <b>our</b> <b>constitutions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Your honor, I {{feel that}} I {{have been convicted}} of violating an unjust statute. I will {{continue}} in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom—that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in <b>our</b> <b>constitution,</b> of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.|$|E
25|$|The {{politics}} {{of this would be}} very easy. The politics would be, {{to be one of the}} lads, the safest way in Ireland. But I do not believe that the interests of this State, or <b>our</b> <b>Constitution</b> and of this Republic, would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this. There is a choice of a kind that can only be answered by saying that I stand by the Republic and accordingly I will not oppose this Bill.|$|E
25|$|The {{white race}} deems {{itself to be}} the {{dominant}} race in this country. And so it is in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. So, I doubt not, {{it will continue to}} be for all time if it remains true to its great heritage and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberty. But in view of the constitution, {{in the eye of the}} law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. <b>Our</b> <b>constitution</b> is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved....|$|E

25|$|The {{promulgation}} of law for {{the protection}} of a position held purely on religious grounds cannot therefore be justified. It is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary. We do not live in a society where all the people share uniform religious beliefs. The precepts of any one religion – any belief system – cannot, by force of their religious origins, sound any louder in the general law than the precepts of any other. If they did, those out in the cold would be less than citizens; and <b>our</b> <b>constitution</b> would be {{on the way to a}} theocracy, which is of necessity autocratic. The law of a theocracy is dictated without option to the people, not made by their judges and governments. The individual conscience is free to accept such dictated law; but the State, if its people are to be free, has the burdensome duty of thinking for itself.|$|E
500|$|While {{arguing for}} a bill, Roche once said, [...] "It {{would surely be}} better, Mr. Speaker, to give up not only a part, but, if necessary, even the whole, of <b>our</b> <b>constitution,</b> to {{preserve}} the remainder!" ...|$|E
500|$|Conservative media figure Glenn Beck (who {{joined the}} LDS Church in 1999) has alleged that President Barack Obama [...] "is {{going to bring}} us to the verge of {{shredding}} the Constitution, of massive socialism." [...] On November 14, 2008—following Obama's election—Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor and said that [...] "we are {{at the place where}} the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up." [...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or we are very near the point where <b>our</b> <b>Constitution</b> is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe <b>our</b> <b>Constitution</b> hangs by a thread." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of granting new trials because {{the verdict is}} excessive was well established at common law when <b>our</b> <b>constitutions</b> were adopted. Where the damages are liquidated or can be ascertained by the application of fixed rules of law to any given set of facts, a verdict which awards more than the legal rules would yield (under any finding of facts justified by the evidence) appears to be wrong {{as a matter of}} law and should clearly be set aside...|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, Book II {{is also a}} {{systematic}} argument {{for the existence of}} an intelligent being: [...] "Thus, from the consideration of ourselves, and what we infallibly find in <b>our</b> own <b>constitutions,</b> <b>our</b> reason leads us to the knowledge of this certain and evident truth, that there is an eternal, most powerful, and most knowing being; which whether any one will please to call God, it matters not!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Those {{who wrote}} <b>our</b> <b>constitutions</b> knew from history and {{experience}} {{that it was}} necessary to protect against unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the voice of higher authority. The framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right trial by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1993 and 1994, McCain {{voted to}} confirm President Clinton's nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg whom he {{considered}} to be qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court.

[...] McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, including Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.|$|E
500|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} is no longer, {{if it ever}} was, absolute ... It is no longer {{right to say that}} its freedom to legislate admits of no qualification whatever. Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament ... is being qualified ... The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which <b>our</b> <b>constitution</b> is based. The fact that your Lordships have been willing to hear this appeal and to give judgment upon it is another indication that the courts have a part to play in defining the limits of Parliament's legislative sovereignty.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 1937, Hugo Black made a {{statement}} over the radio. Black said in part, [...] "I number among my friends {{many members of the}} colored race.

I never rejoined.... Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan. I have {{had nothing to do with}} it since that time. I abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization. I have never resumed it and never expect to do so."

500|$|The Congressional inquiry {{triggered}} by MacArthur's relief ruled that Truman's actions violated both constitutional and statutory requirements. While presidents {{had in the}} past used extra-legal military force, this was in [...] "fights with pirates, landings of small naval contingents on barbarous or semi-barbarous coasts, the dispatch of small bodies of troops to chase bandits or cattle rustlers across the Mexican border, and the like." [...] Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who opposed the war in Korea, argued that [...] "when we agreed to the United Nations Charter we never agreed to supplant <b>our</b> <b>Constitution</b> with the United Nations Charter. The power to declare and make war is vested in the representatives of the people, in the Congress of the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|Conservatives {{were worried}} that these {{treaties}} {{could be used to}} expand the power of the Federal government {{at the expense of the}} people and the states. [...] In a speech to the American Bar Association's regional meeting at Louisville, Kentucky on April 11, 1952, John Foster Dulles, an American delegate to the United Nations, said, [...] "Treaties make international law and they also make domestic law. Under <b>our</b> <b>Constitution,</b> treaties become the Supreme Law of the Land. They are indeed more supreme than ordinary laws, for Congressional laws are invalid if they do not conform to the Constitution, whereas treaty laws can override the Constitution." [...] Dulles said the power to make treaties [...] "is an extraordinary power liable to abuse." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1993, McCain {{was named}} {{chairman}} of the board of directors of the International Republican Institute, a non-profit democracy-promotion organization with informal ties to the Republican party. [...] The position would allow McCain to bolster his foreign policy expertise and credentials as well as his future fundraising prospects. At the same time, he was named head of recruiting and fund-raising for Republican senatorial candidates. [...] Further in 1993, a melanoma was discovered on his shoulder and removed. [...] In 1990, McCain voted to confirm David Souter as a Supreme Court justice, and in 1991, he supported the contentious but eventually successful nomination of Clarence Thomas. In 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm President Clinton's nominees Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, whom he considered to be qualified for the Supreme Court despite differing judicial philosophies from his. He would later explain that [...] "under <b>our</b> <b>Constitution,</b> it is the president's call to make." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The real {{difficulty}} would be," [...] said Harold, [...] "to {{find anything}} {{in which we}} didn't exactly resemble one another. Well, now I must be off to this horrid office with the Pater. Are you ready, Pater? I'll call in at Estwood's {{in the course of}} the morning, Ernest, and tell him to look after my teeth. I don't want to miss the Balfours' party this evening. Curious that we should be going to a party this evening too. That isn't fated in <b>our</b> <b>constitutions,</b> anyhow, is it, Ernest? Good morning, Miss Holt; the first waltz, remember. Come along, Pater." [...] And he went out, followed immediately by his father.|$|R
