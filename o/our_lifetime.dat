25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1981, Marvin Gaye had {{relocated}} to Ostend, Belgium, {{following the end of}} a European tour amid financial difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service and the end of his second marriage. Struggling with depression and cocaine addiction, Gaye had agreed to move to Ostend on the advice of longtime resident Freddy Cousaert. While in Ostend, Gaye began to curb his drug use and recover from his depression, partaking in Ostend's beaches. Gaye also began cutting ties with his longtime recording label, Motown, following the release of In <b>Our</b> <b>Lifetime,</b> an album the musician did not declare to be finished. He declared that he would never record with the label ever again after he accused the label of betraying his creativity.|$|E

This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept.
