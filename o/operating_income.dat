5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs.

The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss.

40|$|Non-interest incomes {{have become}} an {{increasingly}} important part of banks' <b>operating</b> <b>incomes</b> because the wealth in Asia is largely increasing. Most banks regard non-interest incomes {{as one of the}} stable sources of bank revenues. In general, the industry believes increasing the ratio of non-interest <b>incomes</b> to <b>operating</b> <b>incomes</b> can not only improve profitability but also reduce the risk to the bank. However, Mercieca et al. (2007) and Stiroh (2004) have stated increasing non-interest activities increases the volatility of bank revenues and reduces the profitability of the bank. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate whether the reliance on different sources of non-interest incomes will affect profitability of the bank in Asia. Moreover, we evaluate the performance and volatility at commercial banks of 13 countries in Asia for the period of 1997 through 2006. The results are associated with different ex outcomes. We find no direct diversification benefits cross most of countries and the different degree of develop. Finally, the data show that performance improves with size for commercial banks. These results have implications for bank managers to choose the best strategy to expand according to experience, technology, size and comparative advantage. 隨著亞洲財富的增加，富裕人士快速成長，財富管理與投資成為熱門的話題。非利息收入儼然成為銀行營運收入中重要的一環。大部分銀行視非利息收入能使銀行更趨穩定，因為它們認為非利息收入不但能改善獲利且能降低風險。但是，Mercieca et al.

Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a short link in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E

After an unaudited €43,411,481 net loss was recorded {{in the first nine}} months of 2010–11 season, the board of directors announced that a capital increase of €120million was planned, scheduled to submit to the extraordinary shareholder's meeting in October. Eventually, the 2010–11 season net loss was €95,414,019. In the 2012–13 season, Juventus continued to recover from recent seasons' net losses thanks to the biggest payment in UEFA's Champions League 2012–13 revenue distribution, earning €65.3million. Despite being knocked out in the quarterfinal stage, Juventus took the lion's share thanks to the largesse of the Italian national TV market and the division of revenues with the only other Italian team making the competition's final phase, Milan.

At that time the club was using cash plus player swap to boost short term profit (€28,329,090 in 2000–01; €17,721,534 in 2001–02 season), but also increased the long term cost (as amortization) by purchasing players. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard accounting practice of amortization. {{it was due to}} Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and prime minister of Italy, introducing Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B. Napoli dramatically reduced the amortization from €33,437,075 to €1,659,088 + €4,660,123, due to €46,601,225 of the intangible asset (player contracts), which was deferred to amortize in 10-year installments, instead of varying from 1 to 5 years by the length of player contract. However, the practice was unable to save the club from the financial aid from a sugar daddy, when the owner withdrew.|$|E

This study is an examination of the agency costs that result from the conflict of interests between owners and managers.

Agency costs, measured as operating expenses per square foot, are found to be significantly higher for institutional owners than for noninstitutional owners, but not significantly higher in cases where no competition for property management services exists.

Recent improvements for accessing transaction data have stimulated interest in commercial property hedonic pricing models, the structures of which follow traditions in single-family real estate in that the implicit prices of property characteristics and site-specific variables represent city and national market conditions. Adding present value variables has become increasingly common to account for general market conditions. We test two hedonic pricing models; one that follows the residential tradition and another that departs by incorporating city-specific net <b>operating</b> <b>incomes</b> and the discount rates. Modeling prices in these alternative ways allows for recognition of the relative contributions of property, city, and capital market determinants. Empirical testing relies on a sample of hotel transactions from 2005 – 2010. The responsiveness of hotel cash flows to market changes is an important consideration. We find that models with property characteristics perform {{about the same as}} models that also include present value variables. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that implicit prices corresponding to property characteristics and site-specific variables appear to reflect income streams associated with city and nationwide economic conditions...|$|R
