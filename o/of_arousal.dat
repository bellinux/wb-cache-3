Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties.

40|$|International audienceSleep in {{patients}} with Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) is frequently interrupted with <b>arousals.</b> Increased amounts <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> result in shortening total sleep time and repeated sleep-arousal change can result in sleep fragmentation. According to the American Sleep Disorders Association (ASDA) an arousal is a marker of sleep disruption representing a detrimental and harmful feature for sleep. The nature <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> and its role on the regulation of the sleep process raises controversy and has sparked {{the debate in the}} last years. In this work, we analyzed and compared the EEG spectral content of respiratory and spontaneous arousals on a database of 45 SAHS subjects. A total <b>of</b> 3980 <b>arousals</b> (1996 respiratory and 1984 spontaneous) were analyzed. The results showed no differences between the spectral content of the two kinds <b>of</b> <b>arousals.</b> Our findings raise doubt as to whether these two kinds <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> are truly triggered by different organic mechanisms. Furthermore, they may also challenge the current beliefs regarding the underestimation of the importance <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>arousals</b> and their contribution to sleep fragmentation {{in patients}} suffering from SAHS...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} {{a link between}} restricted sleep and risk indicators for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, such as levels of cortisol, lipids, and glucose. The present study sought to identify relations between polysomnographic measures of disturbed sleep (frequency <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> from sleep, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency) {{and a number of}} such indicators. A second purpose was to relate the number <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> to mood, stress, work characteristics, and other possible predictors in daily life. Methods: Twenty-four people (10 men, 14 women; mean age 30 years), high vs. low on burnout, were recruited from a Swedish IT company. Polysomnographically recorded sleep was measured at home before a workday. Blood pressure, heart rate, morning blood sample, and saliva samples of cortisol were measured the subsequent working day. They were also recorded for diary ratings of sleep and stress, and a questionnaire with ratings of sleep, stress, work conditions, and mood was completed. Results: A stepwise regression analysis using sleep parameters as predictors brought out number <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> as the best predictor of morning cortisol (serum and saliva), heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol, and LDL/HDL-ratio. Work stress/unclear boundaries between work and leisure time was the best predictor <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> among the stress variables. Conclusion: Consistent with sleep restriction experiments, sleep fragmentation was associated with elevated levels of metabolic and cardiovascular risk indicators of stress-related disorders. Number <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> also seems to be related to workload/stress. Key words: sleep arousals, polysomnography, metabolic, cortisol, stress, burnout.

This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the maturation <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>arousals</b> {{during the first year of}} life in healthy infants. DESIGN: Nineteen infants were studied with nighttime polysomnography on 3 occasions: aged 2 to 3 months, 5 to 6 months, and 8 to 9 months. Ten infants with a median age of 3 weeks were added to the main study to assess the maturation <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> from birth. The infants were born full-term, were healthy at the time of study, and had no history of apnea. Sleep-state and cardiorespiratory parameters were scored according to recommended criteria. Arousals were differentiated into subcortical activations or cortical arousals, according to the presence of autonomic and/or electroencephalographic changes. Frequencies of subcortical activations and cortical arousals were studied at different ages in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. RESULTS: During sleep time, the frequency <b>of</b> total <b>arousals,</b> cortical arousals, and subcortical activations decreased with age. The maturation <b>of</b> the <b>arousal</b> events differed according to sleep states and types <b>of</b> <b>arousals.</b> With age, cortical arousals increased in REM sleep (P = 0. 006) and decreased in NREM sleep (P = 0. 01). Subcortical activations decreased with age in REM (P < 0. 001) and NREM sleep (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: During total sleep time, the frequency <b>of</b> cortical <b>arousals</b> and subcortical activations decreased with maturation. However, the maturation process was different between cortical arousals and subcortical activations. This finding suggests a difference in the maturational sequence of the different brain centers regulating arousals...|$|R

40|$|Background: Both obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) are common {{diseases}} that share similar risk factors. There have been ongoing controversies regarding the role of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) in {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA). Aims: To determine whether the presence and the severity of GERD {{is related to the}} severity of OSA. Methods: Consecutive patients with OSA diagnosed on polysomnography (PSG) (defined as respiratory distress (RDI) index > 5) were recruited. Subjects completed a validated GERD questionnaire. The presence and the severity of nocturnal reflux were also assessed. Results: A total of 47 cases were recruited. The median RDI was 17. 3 (range 5. 1 - 63. 1). The median arousal per hour was 23. 5 (range 4. 1 to 62. 2). BMI positively correlated with RDI (r= 0. 606, p< 0. 001) but not with the number <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> (p= 0. 201). No correlation was found between the presence of GERD and RDI (p= 0. 622) or number <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> per hour (p= 0. 557). The severity of GERD did not correlate with both RDI (p= 0. 551) or number <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> per hour (p= 0. 451). However, the severity of nocturnal reflux correlated with the number <b>of</b> <b>arousals</b> per hour (r= 0. 299, p= 0. 048). The severity of nocturnal reflux was also linked to RDI but it did not reach statistical significance (r= 0. 293, p= 0. 054). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that nocturnal reflux appeared to affect sleep quality and contribute to the severity of sleep apnea. It is possible that the conflicting results of OSA and GERD from the current literature is that the population studied may not all have nocturnal GERD. Further study in this area should focus on patients that complain of nocturnal reflux. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} cardiac changes evoked by spontaneous and sound-induced arousals from sleep. Cardiac responses to spontaneous and auditory-induced arousals were recorded during overnight sleep studies in 28 young healthy subjects (14 males, 14 females) during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Computerized analysis was applied to assess beat-to-beat changes in heart rate, atrio-ventricular conductance, and ventricular repolarization from 30 s before to 60 s after the auditory tone. During both types <b>of</b> <b>arousals,</b> the most consistent change was {{the increase in the}} heart rate (in 62 % of spontaneous and in 89 % <b>of</b> sound-induced <b>arousals).</b> This was accompanied by an increase or no change in PR interval and by a decrease or no change in QT interval. The magnitude of all cardiac changes was significantly higher for tone-induced vs. spontaneous arousals (mean +/- SD for heart rate: + 9 +/- 8 vs. + 13 +/- 9 beats per min; for PR prolongation: 14 +/- 16 vs. 24 +/- 22 ms; for QT shortening: - 12 +/- 6 vs. - 20 +/- 9 ms). The prevalence of transient tachycardia and PR prolongation was also significantly higher for tone-induced vs. spontaneous arousals (tachycardia: 85 % vs. 57 % <b>of</b> <b>arousals,</b> P < 0. 001; PR prolongation: 51 % vs. 25 % <b>of</b> <b>arousals,</b> P < 0. 001). All cardiac responses were short-lasting (10 - 15 s). We conclude that cardiac pacemaker region, conducting system, and ventricular myocardium may be under independent neural control. Prolongation of atrio-ventricular delay may serve to increase ventricular filling during arousal from sleep. Whether prolonged atrio-ventricular conductance associated with increased sympathetic outflow to the ventricular myocardium contributes to arrhythmogenesis during sudden arousal from sleep remains to be evaluated...|$|R
