40|$|This study {{discusses}} how {{charter party}} marine bills of lading {{should be made}} in accordance with <b>the</b> letter <b>of</b> credit-L/C method. In an L/C, in order that <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> payment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> (issuing) bank and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confirming bank, if any, against the beneficiary can continue, exporting companies are required to prepare documents {{in accordance with the}} UCP 600, ISBP 745 and terms of documentary letter of credit and present them properly (complying presentation). In order to prepare appropriate documents, it is essential for the exporting companies to act according to the three important criteria (letter of credit requirements, UCP 600 and ISPB 745) prevailing in this regard. Since competence of complying presentation requires a certain level <b>of</b> expertise, <b>the</b> exporting companies established in Turkey have experienced difficulties in terms of how to prepare documents and could not get benefit from payment <b>obligation</b> undertaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> bank and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confirming bank, if any, due to <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> discrepant documents, getting export prices late, and payment of extra fees/commissions. Due to trade property, importing company’s demands and the conditions required by <b>the</b> legislation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country where the exporting company is established, exporting companies are required to prepare many types of documents. In this study, the common mistakes that exporting companies in Turkey made in preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charter party and <b>the</b> other types <b>of</b> B/Ls are analyzed, the basic and critical features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charter party B/Ls, in particular, are considered and different and common parts compared to other bill of ladings are evaluated and how they can be organized properly according to letter of credit payment is shown...|$|R
