5|$|In 1974 Boycott's form dipped, when {{he scored}} only 75runs {{in the first}} innings of the season, other than a non-championship century against Cambridge University. He did, however, score 152* against Worcestershire on 15 May to {{complete}} his tour of centuries against every first-class county. Both he and Yorkshire suffered through 1975 and 1976, as did his international career, since he refused to play for England from 1974 until 1977. During the summer of 1978 Boycott broke a finger, so John Hampshire temporarily took over as captain. Boycott returned later in the season, scoring 968runs at 50.94, but this was second to Hampshire's 1,463 at 54.18. A poll <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room showed that 95% of the players wanted a permanent change in the captaincy. On 15 September 1978 Boycott's mother, to whom he was very close, died of cancer, placing further pressure on him. On 29 September, the Yorkshire club committee met with Boycott to discuss terminating his captaincy. A statement by the club outlined Yorkshire's intention to retain Boycott as a player while giving the captaincy to Hampshire. Boycott, in response, attacked the Yorkshire club and its decision in an appearance on the BBC's flagship chatshow Parkinson on 7 October, prompting both strong criticism from the club and strong public support for his own position.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly's final {{first-class}} cricket {{came on a}} four-match tour by an Australian team to New Zealand {{in early}} 1946. O'Reilly was the vice-captain of the team, which was led by Bill Brown. The main fixture during the tour was a four-day match against a representative New Zealand side in Wellington, retrospectively designated as the first Test {{between the two countries}} in 1948. The uncertain nature of the tour saw the Australians wear blazers labelled ABC for Australian Board of Control, rather than the usual coat of arms. New Zealand were outclassed; after winning the toss and electing to bat on a rain-affected pitch, they made 42 in their first innings and 54 in their second to lose by an innings and 103 runs. O'Reilly took 5/14 in the first innings, and 3/19 in the second, dominating with Toshack. It was his last Test and his last first-class game. O'Reilly dominated in the other tour games as well; he took match totals of 9/103 and 8/128 against Auckland and Otago respectively, and ended with 28 wickets at 10.60 for the tour. Having only decided to tour New Zealand after much consideration, O'Reilly retired {{at the end of the}} Test, throwing his boots out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room window.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} costume {{as a source}} of information. By making a case study of an 1880 's dress it aims to explore the conservators {{potential}} as an investigator and conveyor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information contained in a costume. Further explanation of this role is made by reference to several statements made by well known textile conservators. The paper also explores the different words used to make a new version of a preserved or inexistant garment, gives an extensive presentation of taking patterns and an insight to the other methods used for analysing costumes. The case study consists of an investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> construction, during which a pattern is taken, and a literature study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary fashion, <b>the</b> owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> and <b>the</b> maker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dress.</b> <b>The</b> pattern from <b>the</b> analysed <b>dress</b> will also serve as source for the Hallwyl Museum in <b>the</b> making <b>of</b> a pattern to sell in the museum shop. Further investigation includes analysing <b>of</b> fibres from <b>the</b> 24 different fabrics and trimmings in <b>the</b> <b>dress,</b> using an optical microscope, which shows that only wool, silk and cotton is present in the original material. <b>The</b> complete analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dress,</b> including pattern, construction description, close-up photos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabrics and photos of their fibres, is presented in inserts at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper.

After further discussions between both teams, umpires and cricket board officials it was eventually agreed that the match could not be restarted. Thus, Inzamam became the first captain in history to forfeit a Test match. Inzamam was later charged with tampering with the ball and bringing the game into disrepute (the latter charge associated with the teatime protest). He strenuously denied the charges.

There are two sides out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not." [...] The leak caused a sensastion, as Woodfull had publicly remained composed in the face of the body barrage, neither complaining nor retaliating. Fingleton was dropped for the remaining two Tests of the series. New South Wales played England after the Third Test and Fingleton had a chance to show his credentials against Bodyline but made only 19 and 7 in a four-wicket defeat, and was unable to force his way back into the Test team. Fingleton always denied responsibility for the leak, blaming Bradman. This incident was the first in a string of open disagreements between Fingleton and Bradman.|$|E
40|$|In Feb 2015 {{an image}} of a dress posted on Tumblr {{triggered}} an internet phenomenon: Is <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> blue and black (BB) or white and gold (WG) ? Many claim BB and others insist WG while the true colors are BB. The prevailing theory is that assumptions about the illuminant govern perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> with WG due to bluish lighting and BB due to yellowish. Our purpose was to determine if early stage optical, retinal and/or neural factors also impact perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dress.</b> Thirty-nine subjects were categorized as BB or WG based on their initial perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> and their perception reported when viewing <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> on iPhone 5, iPad, and 22 " LCD displays. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measured with the QuantifEye™ MPS II and visual brainwaves (VEPs) in response to brief presentations of a transparency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> illuminated by a flashing light were measured on each subject and compared between BB and WG groups. Additionally, CIE chromaticity (color) and luminance (brightness) were measured from multiple areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> image to determine cone stimulation and contrast. Mean MPOD was higher in the WG group (0. 49) vs. the BB (0. 41, p = 0. 04) and median values were higher as well (WG = 0. 46, BB = 0. 36, p = 0. 03). There was no difference in VEP amplitude between groups (p > 0. 85) but mean VEP latency was longer in WG (130 msec.) vs. the BB group (107 msec., p = 0. 0005). Colorimetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> showed significantly greater stimulation of blue cones (contrast = 73 %) vs. red and green sensitive cones (contrast = 13 %). Our findings indicate that observers with denser MPOD may be predisposed to perceive <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> as WG due to great absorption of blue light by the macular pigment. Moreover, the novel, substantial stimulation of blue cones by <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> may contribute to ambiguity and dichotomous perception since the blue cones are so sparse in the retina. Finally, the delayed WG VEPs indicate distinct neural processing in perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consistent with fMRI evidence that the WG percept is processed at higher cortical levels than the BB. These results do not fully explain <b>the</b> dichotomous perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dress</b> but do exemplify the need to consider early stage processing when elucidating ambiguous percepts and figures...|$|R
