5000|$|Mason Monterey was {{generally}} made from <b>Oregon</b> <b>alder,</b> and the [...] "classic period", from 1930-1932 was painted with a lively Mexican palette toned {{down with an}} asphaltum glaze that created the look of antique furniture. Many layers of paint went into the final finish in the Mason line. The colors used were bold: Spanish Red, Spanish Green, Spanish Blue, Straw Yellow. Neutrals had an old antiqued charm in Straw Ivory and Old Wood. In the beginning most pieces {{had some sort of}} decorative elements, such as the [...] "river of life," [...] a lively squiggle, or a floral decoration. The Mexican cartoonist Juan Intenoche headed the paint department, and the most valuable pieces of Monterey contain his whimsical designs. Donkeys, caballeros, sleeping men under wide hats, cactus and other images are his trademark. Mason branded most of their furniture with a horseshoe and the name, [...] "Monterey," [...] though not all are branded. Smoke from the branding occasionally was too thick for the workers; on those days they simply stopped branding. The company produced furniture for 14 years, and went through the following periods: classic, transitional, and middle. Toward the end of its manufacturing career, the company began making rather mundane furniture that did not look like Monterey style, but was a revival of American Colonial.|$|E
40|$|The authors varied {{the number}} of red alder {{retained}} with 300 Douglas-fir per acre on a high-quality site in coastal <b>Oregon.</b> <b>Alder</b> densities of 0, 20, 40, and 80 per acre were tested. The authors' fifth treatment eliminated nitrogen-fixing alder, but substantial nitrogen fertilizer. Treatment 6 had neither thinning nor alder control. Treatments were randomly assigned within each of three blocks in a 9 -year-old plantation. Stand density was reduced within 15 of these 18 experimental units. Surplus conifers were cut, but surplus red alder were controlled by the 'hack-and-squirt' method. Because numerous trees of other species regenerated naturally, combined density of all species before thinning ranged from 1, 400 to 5, 700 trees per acre. Subsequent 17 -year change in number, average height, basal area, and volume of Douglas-fir were compared. Retaining 20, 40, or 80 alder per acre reduced numbers of associated Douglas-fir by about 10, 17, and 23 percent, respectively. In pur Douglas-fir plots, gross volume growth was similar for nonfertilized and fertilized plots, indicating no measureable benefits of additional nitrogen. in mixed stands, red alder reduced yield of associated Douglas-fir, but not yield of combined species. Similar comparisons are needed at other locations, especially those with known nitrogen deficiency...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} prescribed burning, soil depth, antagonistic fungi (Trichoderma harzianum Rifai), and time since burning on {{the viability of the}} root pathogen Armillaria ostoyae (Romagnesi) Herink in wood pieces buried in the soil of a mixed-conifer forest in northeastern <b>Oregon.</b> Red <b>alder</b> (Alnus rubra Bong) stem segments colonized with A. ostoyae were buried at two soil depths in plots that were burned and not burned. Half of the Armillaria segments were buried with segments of T. harzianum. Prescribed burning in the fall significantly reduced the recovery of A. ostoyae immediately after the burn at a soil depth of 8 cm but not at a soil depth of 30 cm. Adding T. harzianum inoculum to the soil did not appear to reduce A. ostoyae recovery immediately after the fire, but effects appeared after several months. Differences may also be due to the timing (fall or spring) of the prescribed burns. The effects of fire either natural or prescribed on pathogenic and saprophytic fungi may greatly influence infections of woody roots, subsequent disease occurrence, and patterns of tree mortalityFilip and YangErve "Effects of prescribed burning on the viability of Armillaria ostoyae in mixed-conifer forest soils in the Blue Mountains of Oregon.

50|$|Because of its abundance, {{red alder}} {{delivers}} {{large amounts of}} nitrogen to enrich forest soils. Red alder stands {{have been found to}} supply between 120 and 290 pounds of nitrogen per acre (130 to 320 kg per ha) annually to the soil. From Alaska to <b>Oregon,</b> Sitka <b>alder</b> characteristically pioneer fresh, gravelly sites at the foot of retreating glaciers. Studies show that Sitka alder, a more shrubby variety of alder, adds nitrogen to the soil at an average of 55 pounds per acre (60 per ha) per year, helping convert the sterile glacial terrain to soil capable of supporting a conifer forest. Alders are common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from floods, windstorms, fires, landslides, etc. Alder groves themselves often serve as natural firebreaks since these broad-leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers. Their foliage and leaf litter does not carry a fire well, and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light surface fires. In addition, the light weight of alder seeds (650,000 per pound, or 1.5 million per kg) allows for easy dispersal by the wind. Although it outgrows coastal Douglas-fir for the first 25 years, it is very shade intolerant and seldom lives more than 100 years. Red alder is the Pacific Northwest's largest alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad-leaved tree in the coastal Northwest. Groves of red alder 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 cm) in diameter intermingle with young Douglas-fir forests west of the Cascades, attaining a maximum height of 100 to 110 feet (30 to 33 m) in about sixty years and then lose vigor as heart rot sets in. Alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them.|$|R
2500|$|The Portland/Vancouver Basin {{ecoregion}} (named for {{the cities}} of Portland and Vancouver) is a geological depression {{at the base of}} the Portland Hills fault-block. It contains the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers and is composed of deltaic sands and gravels deposited by Pleistocene floods, notably the Missoula Floods. Elevation varies from 0 to 300 feet (0 to 90 m), with buttes as high as 650 feet (200 m). Historically, the basin was characterized by Garry oak groves and Douglas-fir forests on the uplands; black cottonwood groves on riverbanks and islands; <b>Oregon</b> ash, red <b>alder,</b> and western redcedar in riparian areas; and prairie openings maintained by Native American burning, with camas, sedges, tufted hairgrass, fescue, and California oatgrass. Numerous wetlands, oxbow lakes, and ponds can still be found, but today the region is dominated by urban and suburban development, pastures, cropland, and tree farms. The climate is usually marine-influenced, but easterly winds from the Columbia River Gorge periodically bring continental temperature extremes. The region covers [...] in Washington and [...] in Oregon, including the northern and eastern suburbs of the Portland metropolitan area. It contains several National Wildlife Refuges within the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge Complex.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Mar. 5, 2014 - Mar. 5, 2016 The genus Phytophthora contains {{some of the most}} destructive pathogens of forest trees, including the most destructive pathogen of alder in recent times, Phytophthora alni. Alder trees were reported to be suffering from canopy dieback in riparian ecosystems in western Oregon, which prompted a survey of alder health and monitoring for P. alni. In 2010 surveys in western Oregon riparian ecosystems were initiated to gather baseline data on damage and on the Phytophthora species associated with alder. Damage was recorded and analyzed from transects containing alder trees with canopy dieback symptoms according to damage type: (1) pathogen, (2) insect, or (3) wound. Phytophthora species from western Oregon riparian ecosystems were systematically sampled, isolated, identified, stored and compared. Koch's Postulates were evaluated for three key Phytophthora species recovered: P. alni, P. siskiyouensis and P. taxon Oaksoil, and alder disease in the western United States was described. Then, the ecological role of the most abundant Phytophthora species from streams was evaluated. The data indicated that many of the same agents reported causing damage to alder trees in the western United States were also damaging alder trees in western <b>Oregon</b> including the <b>alder</b> flea beetle, sawflies, flood debris, Septoria alnifolia, and Mycopappus alni. The most important damage correlated with canopy dieback was incidence of Phytophthora cankers, and isolation of Phytophthora siskiyouensis. In the initial systematic survey of Phytophthora species, 1190 individual Phytophthora isolates were recovered but were of many different species. In the survey of alder roots, P. alni subsp. uniformis was one of the species recovered from necrotic red alder roots, but overall incidence was low; it was isolated four times. From the evaluation of Koch's postulates, Phytophthora canker of alder in the western United States was described, and is a bole canker caused by Phytophthora. Phytophthora canker of alder was only found caused by P. siskiyouensis in nature, and it was isolated 74 times. Isolation was mainly from bole cankers and diseased roots on red and white alder, and from water and alder leaf debris floating in the stream. The most abundant Phytophthora species associated with red alder is an informally described species P. taxon Oaksoil, which appears to be a relatively benign aquatic saprotroph of alder leaf debris. Canopy dieback was more prevalent in riparian alder trees from transects with P. siskiyouensis than from transects with P. taxon Oaksoil but without P. siskiyouensis (70 % and 35 %, respectively). The informally described P. taxon Oaksoil from western Oregon is formally described here as P. obrutafolium sp. nov., closely related to P. bilorbang from western Australia, and P. taxon Oaksoil ss from an oak forest in France. In summary, other agents besides Phytophthora can damage alder trees in western Oregon. Many Phytophthora species associate with <b>alder</b> in western <b>Oregon</b> but not all of them are important damaging agents of alder. However, Phytophthora canker of alder is widespread in western Oregon. In the United States, Phytophthora canker of alder has only been found to be caused by P. siskiyouensis...|$|R
