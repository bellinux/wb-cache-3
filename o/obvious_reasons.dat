5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons,</b> delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E

25|$|Although {{successful}} as a precision timekeeper, the Admiralty for <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons</b> wanted a timekeeper on every major ship, and Kendall's {{was too expensive}} and took too long to make. Kendall made a simplified version (K2) in 1771, leaving out the complicated remontoir system. But the result was still too costly and, moreover, not as accurate as the original.|$|E
25|$|Two annexes in Ave. 25 de Mayo are {{internally}} {{connected to}} the main facility thus extending the Secretariat's offices. Surveillance around the whole surroundings of the Presidential Palace and Plaza de Mayo is tight for <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons.</b> In the late 1960s, there was a serious incident when members of Montoneros breached the building and stayed inside for a whole weekend, taking objects, folders, and other sensitive material.|$|E
25|$|Both the Eastern {{practice}} of alchemy and the later Western practice are remarkably similar in their methods and ultimate purpose. To be sure, {{the desire to}} create an elixir of immortality was more appealing to the Taoists, but European alchemists were not averse to seeking out formulas for various longevity-boosting substances. The secret of transmuting one element into another, specifically base metals into gold or silver, was equally explored by both schools for <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{research}} has established that Arnold's success was {{not due to}} the form of detent escapement, but to his original methods of adjusting the balance spring for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. For <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons,</b> Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him {{in no uncertain terms}} not to use his Helical balance spring.|$|E
25|$|The most shocking, frightening, and {{fascinating}} image in {{rock in the}} last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression... For <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons,</b> the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.|$|E
25|$|Placing {{the hand}} of a dead or {{unconscious}} person on a scanner to gain unauthorized access has become a common plot device. However, a MythBusters episode revealed that this doesn't work (at least with the scanners available to the program). But Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman found a way to convert fingerprints lifted from the hand to a photographic form that the sensor would accept. For <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons,</b> they refuse to reveal the technique.|$|E

25|$|For <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons,</b> the Talmud adds to {{the biblical}} {{regulations}} a prohibition against consuming poisoned animals. Similarly, the Yoreh De'ah prohibits the drinking of water, if the water had been left overnight and uncovered {{in an area where}} there might be serpents, on the basis that a serpent might have left its venom in the water. In a place where there is no suspicion of snakes, this prohibition does not apply (tosafos, beitzah 6a).|$|E
25|$|When {{isolated}} from the base-camp, on distant sorties or remote observations, it was prudent for only the skilled radio operators {{to establish and maintain}} medium and/or long range communications (a life-line for evacuation, re-supply, etc.) often assisted by a fugacious relay station tactically placed in an expedient vicinity (higher ground). The use of Morse code decreased after the introduction of more reliable radios. For <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons,</b> at least one skilled radio operator had to be present (even if alone for a while) on observation posts and relay stations, as maintaining a constant connection to the base-camp and/or JOC was critical for successful outcomes.|$|E
25|$|With {{interest}} growing, {{the members}} {{decided that it}} was time to formalize the group and scheduled a meeting for September 10, 1889. Seventeen men showed up for this first official gathering, which resulted in the election of Brother Fairchild as leader of the group. The office he assumed was dubbed “King Devil,” in honor of the moniker the brotherhood had earned. Brother Sidney D. Smith was elected Secretary on the same day and the basics began to take shape. They immediately decided to limit membership to Master Masons for <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons.</b> It was also voted that Brothers R.R. Riddell and H.P. Tompkins would be the first candidates for the Order and an initiation date was set.|$|E

25|$|In stylistic {{terms the}} motets of the Gradualia form a sharp {{contrast}} {{to those of the}} Cantiones sacrae publications. The vast majority are shorter, with the discursive imitative paragraphs of the earlier motets giving place to double phrases in which the counterpoint, though intricate and concentrated, assumes a secondary level of importance. Long imitative paragraphs are the exception, often kept for final climactic sections in the minority of extended motets. The melodic writing often breaks into quaver (eighth-note) motion, tending to undermine the minim (half-note) pulse with surface detail. Some of the more festive items, especially in the 1607 set, feature vivid madrigalesque word-painting. The Marian hymns from the 1605 Gradualia are set in a light line-by-line imitative counterpoint with crotchet pulse which recalls the three-part English songs from Songs of sundrie natures (1589). For <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons,</b> the Gradualia never achieved the popularity of Byrd's earlier works. The 1607 set omits several texts, which were evidently too sensitive for publication {{in the light of the}} renewed anti-Catholic persecution which followed the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A contemporary account which sheds light on the circulation of the music between Catholic country houses, refers to the arrest of a young Frenchman named Charles de Ligny, who was followed from an unidentified country house by spies, apprehended, searched and found to be carrying a copy of the 1605 set. Nevertheless, Byrd felt safe enough to reissue both sets with new title pages in 1610.|$|E

500|$|Rashid Khalidi states about Darwaza, [...] "Moved {{as he was}} by {{the civilization}} of Arabs, he evoked a distant Arab past. For <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons</b> Islam was central to that past. But {{in the case of}} Darwaza, Islam was {{important}} not as the binding substance of the nation, but as a culture and civilization. In other words, culture, language, and history not religious solidarity were posited as the glue that was to hold the Arab nation together." [...] According to Khalidi, Darwaza contributed to Arab nationalism in the practical and intellectual domains greatly.|$|E

Douglas recalled that they ended up having a [...] "great session", saying [...] "I was incredibly nervous for <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons,</b> but she showed up, was super personable {{and was ready to}} work.

500|$|This {{impedance}} matching approach not only led to better filters but the techniques developed {{could be used}} to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances. Zobel continued to invent {{impedance matching}} networks throughout his career. During World War II he moved on to waveguide filters for use in the newly developed radar technology. Little was published during the war for <b>obvious</b> <b>reasons</b> but towards the end with Bell Labs in the 1950s, Zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear. [...] However, the circuit noted above which still bears Zobel's name today, the constant-resistance network, can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains Zobel's finest achievement in this regard.|$|E
