5|$|NY410 {{begins at}} a rural {{intersection}} with NY26 {{in the town}} of Denmark. The two-lane route heads eastward from the junction, winding to the north and south across open, rolling terrain with several cultivated fields. After , the highway meets County Route19 (CR19, named East Road) and turns to the northeast toward the village of Castorland. The open fields gradually give way to homes as NY410 enters the village limits as Main Street. The route passes {{through the center of the}} village, serving four lightly developed residential blocks before crossing the Mohawk, Adirondack and Northern Railroad at the northeastern edge of the community. At the rail crossing, the highway passes south <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> the New York Central Railroad's Castorland passenger station.|$|E
5|$|The AdelaideMannum {{pipeline}} {{crosses the}} park and the Anstey Hill water filtration plant lies on its southern boundary; together they supply 20% of Adelaide's reticulated water. Significant historical uses of the area are preserved as ruins and highlighted with interpretive signs. The ruins of Newman's Nursery are all that remains <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> the largest plant nursery in the Southern Hemisphere. Ellis Cottage {{is one of the}} earliest homes in the area, and the Rumps Bakery building housed the first bakery in Tea Tree Gully. Quarries supplied stone for significant Victorian buildings in Adelaide and aggregate for road building. Klopper's quarries in the southwest hosted plays for the Festival of the Arts in 1980 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|West of Plattsburgh, NY3 {{exits the}} park and {{encounters}} NY374 via an interchange. Past the exit, the two routes follow parallel routings before separating outside of Plattsburgh. NY3 curves to the southeast toward the former Clinton County Airport, where it meets NY22B just west <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> the main entrance to the airport. From NY22B, NY3 continues east {{to the outskirts of}} Plattsburgh, where it meets the Adirondack Northway (I-87). Past I-87, NY3 follows Cornelia Street into the city, where it becomes city-maintained. Within Plattsburgh, NY3 intersects NY22 before terminating at US9 just west of Lake Champlain.|$|E

5|$|In August and September 2006, Streep starred onstage at The Public Theater's {{production}} of Mother Courage and Her Children at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park. The Public Theater production {{was a new}} translation by playwright Tony Kushner (Angels in America), with songs in the Weill/Brecht style written by composer Jeanine Tesori (Caroline, or Change); veteran director George C. Wolfe was at the helm. Streep starred alongside Kevin Kline and Austin Pendleton in this three-and-a-half-hour play. Around the same time, Streep, along with Lily Tomlin, portrayed the last two members <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> a popular family country music act in Robert Altman's final film A Prairie Home Companion (2006). A comedic ensemble piece featuring Lindsay Lohan, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline and Woody Harrelson, the film revolves around the behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film grossed more than US$26million, the majority of which came from domestic markets.|$|E
25|$|Not all Christians {{believe that}} demons {{exist in the}} literal sense.

This museum offers a detailed overview <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> the consequences <b>of</b> a divided Germany.|$|R
50|$|The {{extent of}} the lieutenancy area was defined in 1975 as {{covering}} the districts of Inverness, Badenoch & Strathspey, and Lochaber. Thus it differs from the county in that it includes parts <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> Moray and Banffshire, but does not include any of the Outer Hebrides which were given their own lieutenancy area — the Western Isles.|$|R
25|$|The base <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> the Schiller Piano Company's {{water tower}} remains {{standing}} on the lot's northwest corner.

40|$|Greater toleration of premarital and extramarital coitus and the {{increased}} emphasis on sexual gratification in marriage are not novel trends in American society, but {{the pace of change}} today probably is unprecedented. There is intense public discussion <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> exclusively personal matters. Practices that a generation ago were considered socially deviant, such as cohabitation or homosexuality, are tolerated, if not accepted...|$|R
50|$|Shaarei Tzedec {{has been}} {{located in a}} {{converted}} Victorian semi-detached house on Markham Street, near Bathurst Street and College Street, since 1937. The Markham Street Shul {{is one of the}} few remaining synagogues and the last remaining shtiebel <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> dozens <b>of</b> small congregations in the area around Kensington Market, Spadina Avenue and Bathurst Street - which was a vibrant Jewish area prior to World War II.|$|R

5000|$|Orbán's social conservatism, soft Euroscepticism and {{advocacy}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he calls an [...] "illiberal state" [...] have attracted significant international attention. Politico states that his political philosophy [...] "echoes the resentments <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> the peasant and working classes" [...] by promoting an [...] "uncompromising defense {{of national sovereignty}} and a transparent distrust of Europe's ruling establishments".

50|$|Contained {{within the}} Zuiderzee were five small islands, the remains <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> larger islands, peninsulas {{connected}} to the mainland, {{or in the case}} of Pampus, an artificial island. These were Wieringen, Urk, Schokland, Pampus, and Marken. The inhabitants of these islands also subsisted mainly on fishing and related industries and still do in the case of Urk and Wieringen. All of these islands, except for Pampus, are now part of the mainland or connected to it.|$|R
25|$|Since the mid-1980s, {{the former}} Humber ferry, PS Lincoln Castle, has been moored in Alexandra Dock. She was used {{during this time}} as a pub\restaurant. Although her design and status as Britain's last {{coal-fired}} paddle steamer was unique, these operations no longer yielded a profit. The ship was broken up in 2010. Berthed in the Alexandra Dock is the Ross Tiger, the last survivor <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> the world's largest fleet of sidewinder trawlers.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 Carclew was {{destroyed}} by fire and today just a few ruins are visible <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> one of Cornwall's great houses. It was then owned by Captain Charles H. Tremayne, a descendant of Sir Charles Lemon. In the late 1930s though, one wing was ‘made habitable by hard work’ and brought into service as a reception centre for refugees coming from Europe. This was a project of the Society of Friends’ Peace Committee and was run by James T. Baily.|$|E
25|$|The Susquehanna Boom was {{a system}} of cribs and chained logs in the West Branch Susquehanna River, {{designed}} to catch and hold floating timber until it could be processed {{at one of the}} nearly 60 sawmills along the river between Lycoming and Loyalsock Creeks in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Susquehanna State Park is located within just a small section <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> the boom. The Susquehanna Boom was originally built under the supervision of James H.
