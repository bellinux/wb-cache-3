5|$|The Action of 3 July 1810 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, in which a French frigate squadron under Guy-Victor Duperré attacked and defeated a convoy of Honourable East India Company East Indiamen near the Comoros Islands. During the engagement the British convoy resisted strongly and suffered heavy casualties but two ships were eventually forced to surrender. These were the British flagship, the Windham, which held off the French squadron to allow the surviving ship Astell to escape, and the Ceylon. The engagement was the third successful French attack on an Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>convoy</b> in just over a year, the French frigates {{being part of a}} squadron operating from the Île de France under Commodore Jacques Hamelin.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar {{played a}} key role. The <b>Ocean</b> <b>Convoy</b> System adopted by Britain {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940 ran on two routes – an east–west route between the UK and North America, and a north–south route between the UK, Gibraltar and Freetown in British-ruled Sierra Leone. Even before the war, Gibraltar had been {{designated}} as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe. From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region. A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.|$|E
25|$|U-162 withdrew into {{shallower}} {{waters and}} submerged, {{resting on the}} bottom of the St. Lawrence River, effecting repairs. Once the repairs were completed, Vogelsang took his submarine out of the St. Lawrence area into the Belle Isle Strait. Finding all the merchant vessels heavily escorted in the area, U-162 was given the chance to withdraw on 12 July. Instead, on 20 July, Vogelsang attacked convoy QS-19, sinking another merchant. The submarine departed the St. Lawrence during the night of 20–21 July and joined the pursuit of the <b>ocean</b> <b>convoy</b> ON 112, sinking another merchant. The submarine returned to its base in France on 16 August.|$|E

50|$|Fitted {{out with}} {{advanced}} sonar and antisubmarine weapons, Glover {{was designed to}} serve as an experimental research escort for developing and testing the latest antisubmarine weapons systems. As a research ship, she tested equipment designed to more readily detect and track enemy submarines, and evaluated tactics and procedures which were used on future classes of escorts. Capable of participating in offensive operations against submarines, she provided support for hunter killer groups, amphibious forces, and <b>ocean</b> <b>convoys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sir Errol Manners K.B.E (1883-1953) was a {{distinguished}} Royal Navy admiral and author on theology and British Israelism. He completed fifty-two <b>ocean</b> <b>convoys</b> during the Second World War, including ONM 249 {{which consisted of}} 153 ships. [...] He wrote segments of research in a lengthy book titled Bible Research published in 1946, which quickly became popular among proponents of British Israelism for its chapter titled [...] "The Hebrew origin of English. Israelite heraldry in Anglo-Saxon countries".|$|R
25|$|After a short {{assignment}} to Fremantle as an anti-submarine patrol ship, Gawler {{was assigned to}} the British Eastern Fleet as a convoy escort. In April 1943, she was sent to the Mediterranean for minesweeping duties. The corvette participated in the Allied invasion of Sicily, rescued survivors from the torpedoed troopship , and on one occasion escorted a convoy in the Atlantic. In October, Gawler rejoined the Eastern Fleet and resumed Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>convoy</b> escort duties. After a refit at the start of 1945, Gawler joined the British Pacific Fleet. At the war's end, the corvette was tasked with mine-clearing and anti=piracy operations around Hong Kong, then sent to the Molucca Islands to inspect former Japanese facilities.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} week of the war, Britain lost 65,000 tons of shipping; in the second week, 46,000 tons were lost, and in the third week 21,000 tons.By the end of September 1939, regular <b>ocean</b> <b>convoys</b> were in operation, outward from the Thames and Liverpool, and inwards from Gibraltar, Freetown and Halifax. To make up the losses of {{merchant}} vessels and to allow for increased imports of war goods, negotiations began with neutral countries such as Norway and the Netherlands towards taking over their freighters on central government charter.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} convoys as an anti-submarine tactic {{during the world}} wars can be {{ascribed}} to several reasons related to U-boat capabilities, {{the size of the}} <b>ocean</b> and <b>convoy</b> escorts.|$|R
50|$|One {{coastal convoy}} {{in the fall}} of 1940 lost {{fourteen}} of twenty-five ships between London and Bristol. The toll on the East Coast convoys was just as great, with the threat of E-boats making a quick dash from ports in the Low Countries. The problem was that if coastal convoys were discontinued, the British rail network could not handle the extra traffic and factories would be idle for lack of raw materials. The vessels used in the coastal trade were small and specially designed for the service, and of limited utility on <b>ocean</b> <b>convoys.</b> The traffic in coal from the northeast of England to London was especially important.|$|R

5000|$|The Clyde {{formed an}} {{important}} sea route {{from the earliest}} times, and the Battle of Largs in 1263 marked the turning point {{for the end of}} Viking ambitions in Britain. Progressively from the 16th century onwards the Clyde became the conduit for commerce and industry, including herring, timber, wine, sugar, tobacco, textiles, iron and steel, coal, oil, chemicals, distilling and brewing, ships, locomotives, vehicles and other manufactured products. During World War II Glasgow and the Clyde became Britain's main entry point for Allied merchant shipping, military personnel and equipment, and for the assembly, despatch and control of <b>ocean</b> <b>convoys.</b> The Clyde formed the largest base of naval ships.
