5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} developed in 1990.

5|$|A {{number of}} Welsh writers have drawn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> the quarrymen for their material, {{for example the}} novels of T. Rowland Hughes. Chwalfa, {{translated}} into English as Out of their night (1954), has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background, while Y cychwyn, translated as The beginning (1969), follows the apprenticeship of a young quarryman. Several novels by Kate Roberts, {{the daughter of a}} quarryman, give a picture of the area around Rhosgadfan, where the slate industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders. Her novel Traed mewn cyffion (1936), translated as Feet in chains (2002), gives a vivid picture of the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914. Y Chwarelwr ("The Quarryman") produced in 1935 was the first Welsh-language film. It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman's life at Blaenau Ffestiniog.|$|E
