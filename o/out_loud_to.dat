According to Lawrence Wright, [...] "the entire base became paralyzed with anxiety about being thrown into the Hole. People were desperately trying to police their thoughts, but it was difficult to keep secrets when staff members were constantly being security-checked with E-Meters." [...] Wright reports that David Miscavige's statements were transcribed for the executives in the Hole, who would then have to repeatedly read them <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E

500|$|Song Ci (1186–1249) was a Chinese {{physician}} and judge during the Southern Song dynasty. His famous work Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified was {{a basis for}} early forensic science in China. Song's predecessor Shen Kuo offered critical analysis of human anatomy, dispelling the old Chinese belief that the human throat had three valves instead of two. A Chinese autopsy in the early 12th century confirmed Shen's hypothesis of two throat valves: the esophagus and larynx. [...] However, dissection and examination of human bodies for solving criminal cases was of interest to Song Ci. His work was compiled {{on the basis of}} other Chinese works dealing with justice and forensics. His book provided a list of types of death (strangulation, drowning, poison, blows, etc.) and a means of physical examination in order to distinguish between murder, suicide, or accident. Besides instructions on proper ways to examine corpses, Song Ci also provided instructions on providing first aid for victims close to death from hanging, drowning, sunstroke, freezing to death, and undernourishment. For the specific case of drowning, Song Ci advised using the first aid technique of artificial respiration. He wrote of examinations of victims' bodies performed in the open amongst official clerks and attendants, a coroner's assistant (or midwife in the case of women), actual accused suspect of the crime and relatives of the deceased, with the results of the autopsy called <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> the group and noted in the inquest report.

500|$|... "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] {{was written}} by Dana Gould and {{directed}} by Pete Michels. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. The idea for the episode was also pitched by Gould, who had just moved to southern California with his wife. After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, [...] "the police aren't enough. Too many people wanna kill you." [...] When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes {{the owner of a}} security company, which then became [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge." [...] Although current showrunner Al Jean found it [...] "very funny," [...] the episode's first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> the other writers. During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store, causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was [...] "somewhat obsessed" [...] with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said [...] "I love the idea of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels." [...] While trying to determine who stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa [...] "Look at him over there, eating that apple. What is he planning?" [...] Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because it bothered the character's voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed. American actor Joe Mantegna reprises his role as Fat Tony in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "avant-garde" [...] aura of [...] "Trust a Try" [...] fuses {{elements}} of mock-operetta and hard rock with classical music, dance, and hip-hop. In the song, Jackson delivers an [...] "angry aria" [...] of betrayal. Its [...] "rock 'n' roll sass" [...] is laced with theatrical vocal arrangements, electric guitars, violins and cinematic strings. The following track, [...] "Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)" [...] features spoken vocals from folk singer Carly Simon and interpolates Simon's hit [...] "You're So Vain." [...] Its composition excoriates an unfaithful lover {{for attempting to}} extort money, described as a [...] "mean-spirited duet that rails against enemies." [...] Jackson unveils anger and deceit, saying [...] "Thought you'd get the money too / Greedy motherfuckers try to have their {{cake and eat it}} too." [...] In response to critics regarding it about her divorce, Jackson explained it was directed towards several people, while Jimmy Jam revealed it to be written in regards to music executives and lawyers.

2500|$|While Peter Hitchens {{used to be}} {{an atheist}} like his older brother Christopher Hitchens, he became a Christian later in his life. He {{became a member of the}} Church of England and is now an {{advocate}} of moral virtues founded on the Christian faith and institutions such as marriage. Today Hitchens defends the use of the Church of England's 1662 Book of Common Prayer and of the King James Bible. Of the latter, he has written [...] "it is not simply a translation, but a poetic translation, written to be read <b>out</b> <b>loud...</b> <b>to</b> lodge in the mind and to disturb the temporal with the haunting sound of the eternal." [...] He argues Christianity has been systematically undermined by social liberals and cultural Marxists. [...] "The left's real interests are moral, cultural, sexual and social. They lead to a powerful state. This is not because they actively set out to achieve one," [...] Hitchens writes. [...] "It is because the left's ideas – by their nature – undermine conscience, self-restraint, deferred gratification, lifelong marriage and strong, indivisible families headed by authoritative fathers." [...] He also believes that the First World War is the cause of the demise of Christianity in Europe.|$|E
