5|$|Despite the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in 1950, most of Gyeongju was spared from the fighting, and remained under South Korean control throughout the conflict. However, for a brief time in late 1950 portions of the city stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> as North Korean forces pushed the Pusan Perimeter southward from Pohang.|$|E

In March 1949, he went south with the People's Liberation Army to East China and served as vice-principal of the newly established East China People's Revolution University.|$|E

5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E
5|$|In early November, the 13th Brigade began readying {{itself for}} {{an attack on the}} Hindenburg Line with the {{division}}, which was part of the Second Army. The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre Plain, but before it could begin a full assault, the Allies signed an Armistice ending hostilities. After 33 days <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> the 7th Division suffered 1,988 casualties. It was awarded one campaign streamer for Lorraine. The brigade performed occupation duties for the next year as it began preparations to return to the continental United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} {{in and around the}} fortress, the North Koreans were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and the North Koreans were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to fight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> eventually preventing the North Koreans from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove the North Koreans from the area.|$|E

5|$|Innis's {{role as an}} {{artillery}} signaller gave him firsthand experience of life (and death) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on Vimy Ridge. Signallers, or spotters, watched where each artillery shell landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.|$|E
5|$|The 40th Infantry Division {{shipped out}} to Korea in January 1952, and shortly thereafter, Bleak was {{promoted}} to Sergeant. His unit was assigned to a mountainous area near Minari-gol, South Korea, along the 38th Parallel. By that point in the war, the fronts had largely stabilized, and the duty in the area was characterized by constant, low-level trench warfare and continued battles over the same ground which produced high casualties. Bleak served as a field medic, assisting troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> instead of in Mobile Army Surgical Hospital units.|$|E
5|$|The unit {{returned}} to combat again in 2003 during {{the invasion of}} Iraq, Operation Iraqi Freedom I. The 101st Airborne Division and the 3rd Infantry Divisions made the main attacks into Iraq, while elements of the 82nd Airborne Division supported them. The initial push was a rapid success, but the insurgency that followed saw convoys become a primary target for Iraqi insurgents. For the first time, these service and support paratroopers found themselves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> as supply convoys became the central target of resistance fighters.|$|E

5|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in 1914, Edward had reached the minimum age for active service and was keen to participate. He had joined the Grenadier Guards in June 1914, and {{although}} Edward was willing to serve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if {{the heir to the}} throne were captured by the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Melbourne family, Bruce {{studied at the}} University of Cambridge and spent his early life tending to the {{importing}} and exporting business of his late father. He served <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I and returned to Australia wounded in 1917, becoming a spokesperson for government recruitment efforts. He gained {{the attention of the}} Nationalist Party and Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who encouraged a political career. He was elected to parliament in 1918, becoming treasurer in 1921 and then prime minister in 1923, {{at the head of a}} coalition with the Country Party.|$|E
5|$|By May, the Rangers were emplaced at Hill 258, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> {{between the}} 31st RCT and the 7th Marine Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. They {{conducted}} frequent patrols along an outpost network, often encountering and engaging Chinese troops. They fortified {{the hill and}} surrounding areas, which served as an advance outpost to warn the 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked. During this period, the fighting entered a lull, and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations. Allen, Pryor, and Freeman left on one such rotation {{with a number of}} men, leaving Queen and only 80 enlisted men on the hill.|$|E

5|$|Chodkiewicz was not {{particularly}} involved {{in the politics of}} the Commonwealth, although his high office and wealth gave him significant influence; for the most part he used his political influence, and base of support in Lithuania, to gather support for his military plans, increased the size of the army, and personal gratifications. His life was dominated by warfare, if not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> then on the political scene against other Lithuanian magnates, particularly the Radziwiłł family and the Sejm politicians whom he held responsible for not passing enough taxes to support the army he wanted.|$|E
5|$|Following the armistice, IX Corps {{remained}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> in Korea in case hostilities erupted again. On 1 January 1954, it was reassigned {{from the}} Eighth Army to the Far East United States Army Forces. Camp Sendai was Headquarters XVI and then IX Corps during the 1950s. In November 1956, {{over three years}} after the signing of the armistice, IX Corps headquarters left the front lines, moving to Fort Buckner, Okinawa, and the divisions under its command were shifted to the command of other headquarters. There, as a part of consolidation of US forces in the region, IX Corps merged with the US Army's Ryukyu Command to form a joint command element on 1 January 1957. The command oversaw administrative duties of US forces in the Ryukyu Islands area.|$|E
5|$|He {{played a}} major role, often as the top {{commander}} of the Commonwealth forces, in the Wallachian campaign of 1599–1600, the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–11, the Polish–Muscovite War of 1605–18, and the Polish–Ottoman War of 1620–21. His most famous victory was the Battle of Kircholm in 1605, in which he dealt a major defeat to a Swedish army {{three times the size}} of his own. He died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> during the battle of Chocim, in the besieged Khotyn Fortress, a few days before the Ottomans gave up on the siege and agreed to negotiate.|$|E

5|$|King {{decided to}} appoint two {{additional}} ministers, one {{in charge of}} the Royal Canadian Air Force, the other to oversee the Royal Canadian Navy.

Macdonald, who had fought in World War I as a soldier <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> in France and Belgium, decided it was his duty to fight World War II as a political leader in Ottawa. He handed over his responsibilities as premier to A. S. MacMillan and was sworn into the federal cabinet on July 12, 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department, {{and one of}} the city's few honest police officers.

Gordon feels guilty over his role in covering up Harvey Dent's crimes and is prepared to resign from his position as Commissioner over it, but then senses that Gotham is about to come under threat.|$|E
5|$|The Jurchens {{tried to}} end the siege by {{negotiating}} a peace treaty. There was some progress towards an agreement {{in the summer of}} 1232, but the assassination of the Mongol diplomat Tang Qing and his entourage by the Jurchens made further talks impossible. The Jin grew desperate. They had enlisted most of the available men in the empire to either defend Kaifeng or fight against the Mongols <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> While the negotiations were ongoing, a plague was devastating the population of the city. Starvation was rampant. The supplies stored in Kaifeng were running out, even with what had been forcibly seized from people. The city's political disintegration created unfounded fears that there was an internal threat. Several residents of the city were executed on the suspicion that they were traitors.|$|E
