MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>faces</b> and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number <b>of</b> <b>faces</b> plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} improves {{our understanding}} of Asian consumers by providing {{a new perspective on}} the role <b>of</b> <b>face</b> in consumer decision-making. This dissertation develops a theory <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure which argues that consumers consider the effects of their decisions on their face (e. g. saving face) during the decision-making process and this exerts a pressure on conspicuous consumption intentions. This research contributes to the literature by fundamentally re-conceptualizing the role <b>of</b> <b>face</b> in the decision-making process to be a direct motivator of specific behavior. This conceptualization also incorporates important aspects <b>of</b> <b>face</b> that are critical to understanding its role in decision-making. The theory <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure considers face a direct motivator of behavior and, due to this novel perspective, identifies a pair <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure motivations-a motivation to gain face and a motivation to avoid the loss <b>of</b> <b>face.</b> It also captures the interdependence <b>of</b> <b>face</b> which theorizes that an individual’s behavior impacts the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> others. Finally, the theory <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure hypothesizes that face is context specific and the influence <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure will depend on the consumption context. A scale to measure face pressure is developed and, over four studies, evidence is provided t...|$|R

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face gear drives, and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives, dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives.

5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us <b>of</b> <b>faces</b> of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E

Two further {{locations}} announced were the Milwaukee Art Museum and the former Tower Automotive complex on Milwaukee's north side, then under redevelopment for mixed use as well as the city's equipment yard. Filming was scheduled to take place there after work was done in Chicago. On September 23, scenes were filmed at the former city hall in Detroit. On October 16, a scene in the later-1960s was shot at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, utilizing extras with period fashion and hairstyles. One day of shooting was also spent at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. Other planned filming locations included Africa and China. Though about 70% of the film's live action footage was shot in 3-D using Arri Alexa and Sony F35 cameras, more than half of the film still had to be converted into 3-D in post production to fix technical flaws 3-D filming produces. Other footage that needed to be converted into 3-D in post production was either entirely computer generated or shot in the anamorphic format on 35mm film. 35mm film was used for scenes filmed in slow motion and scenes such as closeups <b>of</b> <b>faces</b> or shots of the sky which required higher image quality than the HD digital 3-D cameras could provide. 35mm cameras were also used for scenes where the 3-D cameras proved to be too heavy, or were subject to strobing or electrical damage from dust.

40|$|The broad {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the representation <b>of</b> <b>face</b> negotiation in subtitling between the Chinese and English languages and how British and Chinese viewers respond to face management, as reflected in films via subtitles.

The study reviews development in research on face management in Far East cultures and in the West, and establishes a Composite Model <b>of</b> <b>Face</b> Management for the purpose <b>of</b> analysing <b>face</b> interactions in selected Chinese and English film sequences and the representation <b>of</b> <b>face</b> in their corresponding subtitles in English and Chinese.

The independent audience responses show that, although absence <b>of</b> <b>face</b> markers and change <b>of</b> <b>face</b> strategies may not fundamentally affect viewers’ understanding of the thematic content of film sequences via subtitles, viewers who rely on subtitles have produced significantly different impressions of interlocutors’ personality, attitude and intentions, as well as {{the nature of the relationship}} and power relations between interlocutors, from those by native audiences...|$|R

30|$|The data {{presented}} {{in these three}} cases run against {{one aspect of the}} current sociological understanding <b>of</b> <b>face.</b> The complex bases <b>of</b> an individual’s <b>face</b> state and the responsibility of another person’s behavior in relation to a particular individual’s face state is outside of the scope of the conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>face</b> in Goffman’s account <b>of</b> <b>face.</b> In light <b>of</b> the difference between cultural suppositions underlying the notion <b>of</b> <b>face,</b> it is important to notice the possibility in any cultural setting of a person being embarrassed by the behavior of another person with whom they are in some way connected or associated. That is, {{it seems to be a}} wide-spread and not a culturally limited experience that one can lose face through the behavior of another. A gain <b>of</b> <b>face</b> may similarly arise. In Europe or America, a daughter would feel embarrassed, lose face, if her mother jumped a queue. Similarly, it is not unusual for an American, Australian or British student to take pride, gain face, by having an eminent scholar as their supervisor. Studies <b>of</b> <b>face</b> typically understand the social production <b>of</b> the <b>face</b> state <b>of</b> an individual only in relation to the individual’s own behavior and how that behavior is regarded by others. Nevertheless, as indicated above, there is a further dimension <b>of</b> <b>face</b> in which an individual’s face is a consequence of the behavior of face-related others.|$|R
