5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex <b>of</b> <b>even</b> degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number <b>of</b> <b>even</b> degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E

5|$|Analogously, the {{alternating}} {{group is a}} subgroup of index 2 in the symmetric group on n letters. The elements of the {{alternating group}}, called even permutations, are the products <b>of</b> <b>even</b> numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, is an even permutation since zero is even; it is the identity element of the group.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} {{to accept his}} election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction <b>of</b> <b>even</b> the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, a {{large number}} of pre-dreadnoughts {{remained}} in service. The advances in machinery and armament meant that a pre-dreadnought was not necessarily the equal <b>of</b> <b>even</b> a modern armoured cruiser, and was totally outclassed by a modern dreadnought battleship or battlecruiser. Nevertheless, the pre-dreadnought {{played a major role in}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's {{third and}} final exile was <b>of</b> <b>even</b> shorter duration, and after two months he was reunited with Edward in England. Archbishop Winchelsey responded by excommunicating Gaveston, as the Ordinances had stipulated. Lancaster, who had by this time {{inherited}} his father-in-law Lincoln, had taken over leadership of the baronial opposition. A number of the barons set out in pursuit of Gaveston while the king left for York. Gaveston ensconced himself at Scarborough Castle, and on 19 May 1312 agreed on a surrender to Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, {{as long as his}} security would be guaranteed.|$|E

5|$|Lody {{was unaware}} that his latest letters had {{galvanised}} the British authorities into action. They had hitherto been content with merely monitoring his communications but the militarily significant content {{of his most}} recent letters caused them to consider him now {{to be a serious}} threat.

His lack <b>of</b> <b>even</b> basic security precautions had left the authorities with a trail of clues that enabled them to track him down in less than a day.|$|E
5|$|Most recently, Triumph International {{has been}} the subject <b>of</b> <b>even</b> greater {{criticism}} after mass layoffs in Thailand and the Philippines at the end of 2009 were met with transnational protests by trade unions.

5|$|Only minute {{traces of}} {{technetium}} occur naturally in the Earth's crust. This is because technetium-98's half-life is only 4.2millionyears. More {{than a thousand}} of such periods have passed since {{the formation of the}} Earth, so the probability for the survival <b>of</b> <b>even</b> one atom of primordial technetium is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1nanogram (10−9g) of technetium. Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium. These red-giants are known informally as technetium stars.|$|E
5|$|Social {{divisions}} {{did appear}} both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland.

5|$|The Bloomberg Businessweek rankings, {{which are}} based on three sources of data (a student survey, a survey of {{corporate}} recruiters, and an intellectual capital rating), are published in mid-October <b>of</b> <b>even</b> numbered years. The 2006 student survey of 45 online questions of students' ratings of their programs was distributed to 16,595 students three weeks before graduation; there were 9,290 responses. The recruiter survey determines how many MBAs a recruiter's company hired in the previous two years and which schools it actively recruits from. 223 respondents participated out of 426 solicited. The intellectual capital is determined based on a formula incorporating academic publications in journals, books written, and faculty size.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to continually retain or return gifted experts (Experten) to front line battle proved extremely costly, {{resulting in the}} death in combat {{of many of the}} earlier experts and aces. This, coupled with the acute shortage of well trained pilots and the fact that by 1943 they were facing a better equipped and well-trained enemy, meant the life expectancy <b>of</b> <b>even</b> the most gifted was tragically short. Author John Weal says that, although other Geschwaderkommodore would end up dying in combat, nothing would showcase the changing fortunes of Luftwaffe fighter forces than the death of Walter Oesau.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{colonisation}} of the Pacific islands and eventually Australia by the Acrocephalus warblers from Asia was complex, with multiple colonisations <b>of</b> <b>even</b> remote archipelagos. Although the Hawaiian islands were colonised about 2.3million years ago, the other islands were reached much more recently, in the mid-Pleistocene (between 0.21.4million years ago) or even later. The nearest other warblers geographically to Nauru are the Carolinian reed warbler and the nightingale reed warbler.|$|E
