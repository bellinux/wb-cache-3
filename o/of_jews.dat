5|$|According to Maulana Muhammad Ali's Quranic commentary, there indeed existed a group <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> who venerated Ezra {{as the son}} of God. According to Ali, Qastallani {{held that}} in the Kitan al-Nikah, that there was a party <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> who held this belief.|$|E
5|$|Classical Muslim {{scholars}} who {{were aware of}} Jewish and Christian denials of belief in the sonship of Ezra, explained {{that it was only}} one Jew or a small group <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> who worshipped Uzayr, or that the verse refers to the extreme admiration <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> for their doctors of law.|$|E
5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of groups <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> venerating Ezra to an extent greater than mainstream Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that the verse merely speaks of a small group <b>of</b> <b>Jews.</b> The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E
