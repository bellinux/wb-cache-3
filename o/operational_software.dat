40|$|AbstractOperational Profile {{is found}} to be an {{important}} technique for critical fault removal. <b>Software</b> <b>Operational</b> Profile (SOP) plays a vital role in reliability estimation, quality valuation, performance analysis and test case allocation of software. However, some problems are detected by software experts with the development of SOP as data resources are very limited and large effort is required to convert gathered data into point estimate. Also uncertainty is involved with SOP as it often changes during <b>operational</b> phase. <b>Software</b> <b>operational</b> profile plays a crucial role in improving the software quality. Therefore, in this paper, software test case allocation using fuzzy logic based on operational profile based is proposed and it takes usage data in terms of linguistic variable. The model is validated with the existing literature. Validation result is satisfactory...|$|R

A usage structure represents the flow and interaction of operation calls. Statecharts are used to model the usage structures. A usage distribution represents probabilities of the operations. The method is illustrated on two Java classes but can be applied to any software component that is accessed through an Application Program Interface (API) ...|$|R
