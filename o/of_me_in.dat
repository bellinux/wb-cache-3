40|$|Microemulsions (MEs) are {{thermodynamically}} stable systems {{consisting of}} nanosized droplets dispersed in a solvent continuous medium (known as pseudo-phase), which is immiscible with the dispersed phase. These systems consist of water, a hydrophobic solvent called "oil," an amphiphile and often, a co-surfactant that is normally a medium chain alcohol. A {{large number of}} publications describe the importance <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> many branches <b>of</b> chemistry, {{and there is an}} intensive search for new applications. <b>In</b> addition, <b>MEs</b> have been applied in many areas, including oil extraction, removal of environmental pollutants from soils and effluents, dissolution of additives in lubricants and cutting oils, cleaning processes, dyeing and textile finishing, as nanoreactors to obtain nanoparticles of metals, semiconductors, superconductors, magnetic and photographic materials, and latex. However, only some studies indicate the potential applications <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> food and even fewer evaluate their chemical behavior. Potential applications <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> food comprise dissolution of lipophilic additives, stabilization of nutrients and biologically active compounds, using as an antimicrobial agent and to maximize the efficiency of food preservatives. This work consists of a literature review focusing on composition and physical and chemical characteristics of microemulsions. Despite the small number of studies on the subject reported in the literature, we demonstrate some potential applications <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> food chemistry...|$|R

500|$|Hugh Mason was {{influenced}} by his father's Liberal politics and strongly opposed to injustice and prejudice. Thomas Mason was a supporter of political representation for Ashton-under-Lyne and supported {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws. In the early 19th century, the area was poorly represented in Parliament. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport with a combined population of almost one million were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire (or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport). By comparison, {{more than half of all}} MPs were elected by a total of just 154voters. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform and eventually the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. Hugh said of his father that [...] "To his life of honest industry, to his example of commercial probity, to his high Christian character, to his training, <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my early years, to his wise consuls, I owe under God my position in society." ...|$|E

Prior to recording with Albini, the band recorded a second session with John Peel on 22 September and recorded a version of Bob Dylan's [...] "Highway 61 Revisited," [...] and two new songs [...] "Me Jane" [...] and [...] "Ecstasy." [...] The recording sessions with Albini took place at Pachyderm Recording Studio and resulted in the band's major label debut Rid <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> May 1993.

500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} {{locate and}} review {{studies that have}} investigated the incidence <b>of</b> medication errors (<b>MEs)</b> <b>in</b> pediatric inpatients and identify common errors. METHODS: A systematic search of studies related to <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> children was performed using the following databases: MEDLINE (1951 -April 2006), EMBASE (1966 -April 2006), Pharm-line (1978 -April 2006), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 -April 2006), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1982 -April 2006), and British Nursing Index (1994 -April 2006). Studies of the incidence and nature <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> pediatrics were included. The title, abstract, or full article was reviewed for relevance; any study not related to <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> children was excluded. RESULTS: Three methods were used to detect <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> the studies reviewed: spontaneous reporting (n = 10), medication order or chart review (n = 14), or observation (n = 8). There was great variation <b>in</b> the definitions <b>of</b> <b>ME</b> used and the error rates reported. The most common type <b>of</b> <b>ME</b> was dosing error, often involving 10 times the actual dose required. Antibiotics and sedatives were the most common classes of drugs associated with MEs; these are probably among the most common drugs prescribed. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of the literature was hindered by variation in definitions employed by different researchers, varying research methods and setting, {{and a lack of}} theory-based research. Overall, it would appear that our initial concern about <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> pediatrics has been validated; however, we do not know the actual size of the problem. Further work to determine the incidence and causes <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> pediatrics is urgently needed, as well as evaluation of the best interventions to reduce them. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
