5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as <b>octreotide,</b> {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and <b>octreotide)</b> leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>octreotide</b> has {{not been}} shown to improve outcome.|$|E
25|$|Corn starch {{can be used}} in feeding; {{unexpected}} interruptions {{of continuous}} feeding regimens can result in sudden, hypoglycemia, gastrostomy tube insertion (requires a minor surgical procedure) is used for such feeding.Prolonged glucocorticoid use incurs the many unpleasant side effects of Cushing's syndrome, while diazoxide can cause fluid retention requiring concomitant use of a diuretic, and prolonged use causes hypertrichosis. Diazoxide works by opening the KATP channels of the beta cells. <b>Octreotide</b> must be given by injection several times a day or a subcutaneous pump must be inserted every few days, <b>octreotide</b> can cause abdominal discomfort and responsiveness to <b>octreotide</b> often wanes over time. Glucagon requires continuous intravenous infusion, and has a very short half life.|$|E
25|$|For initial fluid {{replacement}} colloids or albumin {{is preferred}} {{in people with}} cirrhosis. Medications typically include <b>octreotide</b> or, if not available, vasopressin and nitroglycerin to reduce portal venous pressures. Terlipressin {{appears to be more}} effective than <b>octreotide,</b> but it is not available {{in many areas of the}} world. It is the only medication that has been shown to reduce mortality in acute variceal bleeding. This is in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varices. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varices. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In those with cirrhosis, antibiotics decrease the chance of bleeding again, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and decrease mortality. <b>Octreotide</b> reduces the need for blood transfusions and may decrease mortality. No trials of vitamin K have been conducted.|$|E
25|$|Surgical removal is {{the usual}} {{treatment}} for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other drugs like <b>octreotide</b> (somatostatin agonist) and bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) {{can be used to}} block GH secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{focuses on}} resuscitation which may include intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. Often blood transfusions are not recommended unless the hemoglobin {{is less than}} 70 or 80g/L. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, <b>octreotide,</b> and antibiotics may be considered in certain cases. If other measures are not effective, an esophageal balloon may be attempted in those with presumed esophageal varices. Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum or endoscopy of the large bowel are generally recommended within 24hours and may allow treatment as well as diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} tests {{differ from}} most other imaging modalities in that diagnostic tests primarily show the physiological {{function of the}} system being investigated as opposed to traditional anatomical imaging such as CT or MRI. Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, head CT scan, etc.). In addition, there are nuclear medicine studies that allow imaging of the whole body based on certain cellular receptors or functions. Examples are whole body PET scans or PET/CT scans, gallium scans, indium white blood cell scans, MIBG and <b>octreotide</b> scans.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{evidence}} from people with {{other health problems}} crystalloid and colloids {{are believed to be}} equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may reduce mortality in those with severe disease as well as the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group. Oral and intravenous formulations may be equivalent; however, the evidence to support this is suboptimal. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. There is tentative evidence of benefit for tranexamic acid which inhibits clot breakdown. Somatostatin and <b>octreotide,</b> while recommended for varicial bleeding, have not been found to be of general use for non variceal bleeds. After treatment of a high risk bleeding ulcer endoscopically giving a PPI once or a day rather than as an infusion appears to work just as well and is less expensive (the method may be either by mouth or intravenously).|$|E
500|$|Midodrine is an alpha-agonist and <b>octreotide</b> is an {{analogue}} of somatostatin, {{a hormone}} involved in regulation of blood vessel tone in the gastrointestinal tract. [...] The medications are respectively systemic vasoconstrictors and inhibitors of splanchnic vasodilation, {{and were not}} found to be useful when used individually in treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] However, one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement in kidney function when the two were used together (with midodrine given orally, <b>octreotide</b> given subcutaneously and both dosed according to blood pressure), with three patients surviving to discharge. Another nonrandomized, observational study of individuals with HRS treated with subcutaneous <b>octreotide</b> and oral midodrine showed that there was increased survival at 30 days.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{evidence}} from people with {{other health problems}} crystalloid and colloids {{are believed to be}} equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. In people with a confirmed peptic ulcer, there is conflicting evidence if proton pump inhibitors reduce death rates, but PPIs do reduce the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. [...] Tranexamic acid might be effective to reduce mortality, but the evidence for this is weak. But the evidence is promising. Somatostatin and <b>octreotide</b> while recommended for varicial bleeding have not been found to be of general use for non varicial bleeds.|$|E
2500|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} can {{be treated}} with palliative surgery (colostomy, ileostomy, or internal bypass) or medicine, but surgery {{has been shown to}} increase survival time. Palliative surgery may result in short bowel syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, or re-obstruction; or may not be possible due to the extent of obstruction. Other treatments of complications can include total parenteral nutrition, a low-residue diet, palliative gastrostomy, and adequate pain control. Bowel obstruction can also be treated with <b>octreotide</b> when palliative surgery is not an option. Cancer can also block the ureters, which can be relieved by a nephrostomy or a ureteric stent. Ascites can be relieved by repeated paracentesis or placement of a drain to increase comfort. Pleural effusions can [...] be treated in a similar manner, with repeated thoracentesis, pleurodesis, or placement of a drain.|$|E
2500|$|The hormone insulin {{increases}} the uptake of potassium into the cells. Therefore, insulin deficiency can cause hyperkalemia. In addition to that, hyperglycemia, which causes hyperosmolality in extracellular fluid, [...] increases water diffusion {{out of the}} cells, which in turns {{increases the}} intracellular potassium concentration and causes potassium to move alongside {{water out of the}} cells also. The co-existence of insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and hyperosmolality is often seen in those affected by diabetic ketoacidosis. Apart from diabetic ketoacidosis, there are other causes that reduce insulin levels {{such as the use of}} the medication <b>octreotide,</b> and fasting which can also cause hyperkalemia. Increased tissue breakdown such as rhabdomyolysis, burns, or any cause of rapid tissue necrosis, including tumor lysis syndrome can cause the release of intracellular potassium into blood, causing hyperkalemia.|$|E

50|$|An <b>octreotide</b> scan or octreoscan {{is a type}} of {{scintigraphy}} used to find carcinoid, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and {{to localize}} sarcoidosis. <b>Octreotide,</b> a drug similar to somatostatin, is radiolabeled with indium-111, and is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive <b>octreotide</b> attaches to tumor cells that have receptors for somatostatin. A radiation-measuring device detects the radioactive <b>octreotide,</b> and makes pictures showing where the tumor cells are in the body.|$|E
50|$|Some studies {{reported}} alopecia {{in patients who}} were treated by <b>octreotide.</b> Rats which were treated by <b>octreotide</b> experienced erectile dysfunction in a 1998 study.|$|E
50|$|<b>Octreotide</b> {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of Acromegaly, a disorder of excessive growth hormone (GH). <b>Octreotide,</b> being a somatostatin analog, inhibits the release of GH from the pituitary gland through a process normally involved in negative feedback.|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>octreotide</b> {{has been}} described.|$|E
50|$|<b>Octreotide</b> {{has also}} been used off-label for the {{treatment}} of severe, refractory diarrhea from other causes. It is used in toxicology {{for the treatment of}} prolonged recurrent hypoglycemia after sulfonylurea and possibly meglitinides overdose. It {{has also been}} used with varying degrees of success in infants with nesidioblastosis to help decrease insulin hypersecretion. Several clinical trials also proves the effect of <b>octreotide</b> as acute treatment (abortive agent) in cluster headache, where it shows that administration of subcutaneous <b>octreotide</b> is effective when compared with placebo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Octreotide</b> {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with midodrine to partially reverse peripheral vasodilation in the hepatorenal syndrome. By increasing systemic vascular resistance, these drugs reduce shunting and improve renal perfusion, prolonging survival until definitive treatment with liver transplant. Similarly, <b>octreotide</b> can be used to treat refractory chronic hypotension.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>octreotide</b> {{inhibits}} gastrointestinal and pancreatic function, {{long-term use}} causes digestive {{problems such as}} loose stools, nausea, and gas in one third of patients. In addition, approximately 25 percent of patients develop gallstones, which are usually asymptomatic. In some cases, <b>octreotide</b> treatment can cause diabetes {{due to the fact}} that somatostatin and its analogues can inhibit the release of insulin. On the other hand, scientists have found that in some acromegaly patients who already have diabetes, <b>octreotide</b> can reduce the need for insulin and improve blood sugar control.|$|E
50|$|Advances {{in nuclear}} {{medicine}} imaging, {{also known as}} molecular imaging, has improved diagnostic and treatment paradigms in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. This is because {{of its ability to}} not only identify sites of disease but also characterize them. Neuronedocrine tumours express somatostatin receptors providing a unique target for imaging. <b>Octreotide</b> is a synthetic modifications of somatostatin with a longer half-life. OctreoScan, also called somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS or SSRS), utilizes intravenously administered <b>octreotide</b> that is chemically bound to a radioactive substance, often indium-111, to detect larger lesions with tumor cells that are avid for <b>octreotide.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Octreotide</b> {{can reduce}} the {{intestinal}} resorption of ciclosporin, possibly making it necessary to increase the dose. Patients with diabetes mellitus might need less insulin or oral antidiabetics when treated with <b>octreotide.</b> The bioavailability of bromocriptine is increased; [...] besides being an antiparkinsonian, bromocriptine is also used {{for the treatment of}} acromegaly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Octreotide</b> is {{an analog}} of the peptide hormone somatostatin, which {{inhibits}} {{the production of}} the growth hormone as well as numerous peptide hormones of the gastrointestinal system, including insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and gastrin. <b>Octreotide</b> is used for suppression of the hormonal syndromes which accompany several pancreatic islet cell tumors, including the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome of gastrinoma and the chronic hypoglycemia of insulinoma. It is also effective in suppression of the carcinoid syndrome, caused by advanced or extra-gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. <b>Octreotide</b> may also be used for treatment of severe diarrhea caused by 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy or radiation therapy.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary current}} medical {{treatment}} of acromegaly {{is to use}} somatostatin analogues - <b>octreotide</b> (Sandostatin) or lanreotide (Somatuline).These somatostatin analogues are synthetic forms of a brain hormone, somatostatin, which stops GH production. The long-acting forms of these drugs must be injected every 2 to 4 weeks for effective treatment. Most patients with acromegaly respond to this medication. In many patients, GH levels fall within one hour and headaches improve within minutes after the injection. <b>Octreotide</b> and lanreotide are effective for long-term treatment. <b>Octreotide</b> and lanreotide have also been used successfully to treat patients with acromegaly caused by non-pituitary tumors.|$|E
