5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection {{in conjunction with a}} well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
