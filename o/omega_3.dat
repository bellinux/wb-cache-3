25|$|Plant-based, or vegetarian, {{sources of}} <b>Omega</b> <b>3</b> fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy {{vegetables}} such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more <b>Omega</b> <b>3</b> {{than any other}} known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While {{the health effects of}} low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).|$|E

25|$|Salmon is {{a popular}} food. Classified as an oily fish, salmon is {{considered}} to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, with a range of 23–214mg/100g depending on the species. According to reports in the journal Science, farmed salmon may contain high levels of dioxins. PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) levels may be up to eight times higher in farmed salmon than in wild salmon, but still well below levels considered dangerous. Nonetheless, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the benefits of eating even farmed salmon still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants. Farmed salmon has a high <b>omega</b> <b>3</b> fatty acid content comparable to wild salmon. The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health functions.|$|E

HiPER will deliver a <b>3</b> <b>omega</b> (wavelength lambda= 0. 35 mu m), multibeam, multi-ns pulse of about 250 kJ and a 2 <b>omega</b> or <b>3</b> <b>omega</b> pulse of 70 - 100 kJ in about 15 ps. Its goal is the demonstration of laser driven inertial fusion via fast ignition. The baseline target concept is a direct-drive single shell capsule, ignited by hot electrons generated by a conically guided ultraintense laser beam. The paper first discusses ignition and compression requirements, and presents gain curves, based on an integrated model including ablative drive, compression, ignition and burn, and taking the coupling efficiency eta(ig) of the igniting beam as a parameter. It turns out that ignition and moderate gain (up to 100) can be achieved, provided that adiabat shaping {{is used in the}} compression, and the efficiency eta(ig) exceeds 20 %. Using a standard ponderomotive scaling for the hot electron temperature, a 2 <b>omega</b> or <b>3</b> <b>omega</b> ignition beam is required to make the hot electron range comparable to the desired size of the hot spot. A reference target family is then presented, based on one-dimensional fluid simulation of compression, and two-dimensional fluid and hybrid simulations of fast electron transport, ignition, and burn. The sensitivity to compression pulse shape, as well as to hot electron source location, hot electron range, and beam divergence is also discussed.

40|$|Abstract Chicken {{meat with}} reduced {{concentration}} of arachidonic acid (AA) and reduced ratio between omega - 6 and <b>omega</b> - <b>3</b> fatty acids has potential health benefits because {{a reduction in}} AA intake dampens prostanoid signaling, and the proportion between omega - 6 and <b>omega</b> - <b>3</b> fatty acids is too high in our diet. Analyses for fatty acid determination are expensive, and finding the optimal number of analyses to give reliable results is a challenge. The objective {{of the present study}} was i) to analyse the intraclass correlation of different fatty acids in five meat samples, of one gram each, within the same chicken thigh, and ii) to study individual variations in the concentrations of a range of fatty acids and the ratio between omega - 6 and <b>omega</b> - <b>3</b> fatty acid concentrations among fifteen chickens. Fifteen newly hatched broilers were fed a wheat-based diet containing 4 % rapeseed oil and 1 % linseed oil for three weeks. Five muscle samples from the mid location of the thigh of each chicken were analysed for fatty acid composition. The intraclass correlation (sample correlation within the same animal) was 0. 85 - 0. 98 for the ratios of total omega - 6 to total <b>omega</b> - <b>3</b> fatty acids and of AA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). This indicates that when studying these fatty acid ratios, one sample of one gram per animal is sufficient. However, due to the high individual variation between chicken for these ratios, a relatively high number of animals (minimum 15) are required to obtain a sufficiently high power to reveal significant effects of experimental factors (e. g. feeding regimes). The present experiment resulted in meat with a favorable concentration ratio between omega - 6 and <b>omega</b> - <b>3</b> fatty acids. The AA concentration varied from 1. 5 to 2. 8 g/ 100 g total fatty acids in thigh muscle in the fifteen broilers, and the ratio between AA and EPA concentrations ranged from 2. 3 to 3. 9. These differences among the birds may be due to genetic variance that can be exploited by breeding for lower AA concentration and/or a more favorable AA/EPA ratio to produce meat with health benefits. </p...|$|R
