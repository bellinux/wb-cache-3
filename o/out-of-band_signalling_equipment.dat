50|$|How {{the user}} {{activates}} this feature {{depends on their}} phone system â€” generally it is either in-band-signaling DTMF sequence such as the *57 Vertical service code or a special button attached to their phone generating an <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal.</b> For analogue services, many exchanges will interpret DTMF sequences to activate POTS. Digital services, such as ISDN or GSM, enable the CPE to activate MCI via <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling.</b> Often with PABXs with analogue phone connections, the PABX will interpret the DTMF and then activate the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Telephone network {{infrastructure}} moved from In-band <b>signalling</b> to <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{telecommunication}} signaling on {{a dedicated}} channel separate from that used for the telephone call. <b>Out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> has been used since Signaling System No. 6 (SS6) {{was introduced in the}} 1970s, and also in Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) in 1980 which became the standard for signaling among exchanges ever since.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, in-band {{signaling}} is the sending of control information {{within the same}} band or channel used for voice or video. This {{is in contrast to}} <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> which is sent over a different channel, or even over a separate network. In-band signals may often be heard by telephony participants, while <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> are inaccessible to the user.|$|R
50|$|Some digital trunks, such as SS7, use <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> to {{indicate}} termination of a call.|$|R

5000|$|The {{class of}} {{vulnerabilities}} Draper and others discovered {{was limited to}} call-routing switches that employed in-band <b>signaling,</b> whereas newer <b>equipment</b> relies almost exclusively on <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling,</b> the use of separate circuits to transmit voice and signals. Though they no longer serve a practical use, the Cap'n Crunch whistles did become valued collector's items. Some hackers sometimes go by the handle [...] "Captain Crunch" [...] even today; 2600: The Hacker Quarterly is named after this whistle frequency.|$|R

5000|$|A {{band-pass filter}} (BPF) to reduce image response. This removes any signals {{at the image}} frequency, which would {{otherwise}} interfere with the desired signal. It also prevents strong <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> from saturating the input stages.|$|R
50|$|Most analog {{telephone}} adapters for Internet-based telecommunications (VoIP) recognize and translate DTMF tones but ignore dial pulses, an issue which also exists for some PBX systems. Like cellular handsets, telephones designed for voice-over-IP use <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> {{to send the}} dialed number.|$|R
50|$|Modern prepay {{mobile phone}} {{solutions}} use an <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling</b> called the Intelligent Network {{to monitor the}} credit {{without the need for}} hairpinning trunks. These are developed as international standards which allow prepay use of a phone all over the world.|$|R
50|$|Exceptions are one {{widely used}} scheme for solving this problem. An error {{condition}} {{is not considered}} a return value of the function at all; normal control flow is disrupted and explicit handling of the error takes place automatically. They are an example of <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling.</b>|$|R
50|$|Selective tuning is {{the process}} by which the radio {{frequency}} (RF) of the television channel is selected by a receiver from within a band of transmitted RF signals. The tuner usually performs the function of frequency-agile selection, along with rejection of unwanted <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{international}} standard for telephone signaling utilizes dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, more {{commonly known as}} touch-tone dialing. It replaced the older and slower pulse dial system. The push-button format is also used for all cell phones, but with <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> of the dialed number.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{telephones}} and most voice-over-IP systems use <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> {{and do not}} send any digits until the entire number has been keyed by the user. Many VoIP systems {{are based on the}} Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which uses a form of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) for addressing, instead of digits alone.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s and 80s some trunks were {{modified}} {{to filter out}} SF tone arriving from a caller. Later in the 20th century, long-distance companies adopted the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> system Signaling System 7. This system separated the voice and signaling channels, {{making it impossible to}} generate these signals from an ordinary phone line.|$|R
30|$|More recently, {{vehicular}} delay-tolerant networks (VDTNs) were {{proposed as}} an alternative network architecture for sparse vehicular networks [24]. VDTN architecture also adopts a store-carry-and-forward paradigm from DTNs. Nonetheless, it distinguishes itself from the DTN architecture by positioning the bundle layer between the network and data link layers, introducing a clear separation between control and data planes using <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|R
30|$|Using {{an active}} {{component}} and a spreading code correlation algorithm, our high sensitivity wake-up radio provides good rejection of out-of-band and in-band interference {{and reduces the}} false alarm rate to reduce power consumption and latency. As for other wake-up radios that use passive components, such as diode rectifiers, they detect <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals,</b> increasing their false wake-up packets, power consumption and latency.|$|R
50|$|CAS {{potentially}} {{results in}} lower available bandwidth for the payload. For example, in the PSTN {{the use of}} <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> within a fixed bandwidth reduces a 64 kbit/s DS0 to 56 kbit/s. Because of this, and the inherent security benefits of separating the control lines from the payload, telephone systems introduced since the 1960s rely more on common-channel signaling (CCS).|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of digital switching <b>equipment</b> and <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> prevented {{the use of}} blue boxes. The [...] "blue box" [...] terminology has therefore been recycled for other purposes. The hacking community evolved into other endeavors and there currently exists a commercially published hacking magazine, titled 2600, {{a reference to the}} 2600 Hz tone that was once central to so much of telephone hacking.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microring {{resonators}} side {{coupled to}} signal waveguides provide compact, narrow band, and large free spectral range photonic channel dropping wavelength switch. Wavelength switch with improved passband characteristics and larger <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> rejection are realized through the coupling of rings. The {{analysis of these}} devices is demonstrated by the novel method of coupling. The response of switch comprised of different coupling gap may be written down by attenuation ratio...|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to also get a bad picture if the signal strength of the TV transmitter is too high. An attenuator inserted in the antenna lead-in wire may be used if the television receiver displays signs of overload in the RF front end. Strong <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> may also affect television reception and may require band-pass filters to reduce {{the level of the}} undesired signal at the receiver.|$|R
50|$|Channel-associated {{signaling}} (CAS), {{also known}} as per-trunk signaling (PTS), {{is a form of}} digital communication signaling. As with most telecommunication signaling methods, it uses routing information to direct the payload of voice or data to its destination. With CAS signaling, this routing information is encoded and transmitted in the same channel as the payload itself. This information can be transmitted in the same band (in-band signaling) or a separate band (<b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling)</b> to the payload.|$|R
50|$|The PHY {{layer is}} {{responsible}} for detecting the other SATA/device on a cable, and link initialization. During the link-initialization process, the PHY {{is responsible for}} locally generating special <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> by switching the transmitter between electrical-idle and specific 10b-characters in a defined pattern, negotiating a mutually supported signalling rate (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 Gbit/s), and finally synchronizing to the far-end device's PHY-layer data stream. During this time, no data is sent from the link-layer.|$|R
30|$|Over the years, several {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} {{to address the problems}} related with achieving data communication in vehicular networks. These networks are characterized by a highly dynamic network topology, short contact durations, connectivity disruption, intermittent connectivity, and even network partition. VDTNs appeared as an innovative solution for handling these issues. VDTN architecture integrates the concepts of end-to-end, asynchronous, and variable-length bundle-oriented communication, Internet protocol over VDTN, and control and data plane separation performing <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|R

Voice signals are encoded for carriage over E0 according to ITU G.711. Note that when a T-carrier system is used as in North America, robbed bit signaling can mean that a DS0 channel carried over that system is not an error-free bit-stream. The <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> used in the European E-carrier system avoids this.|$|R

30|$|VDTN {{architecture}} identifies two logical planes (using <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling),</b> i.e., {{the control}} plane {{and the data}} plane [24]. These planes are logically divided into two layers, the bundle signaling control (BSC) layer and the bundle aggregation and de-aggregation (BAD) layer. BSC is responsible for executing the control plane functions such as signaling messages exchange, resources reservation (at the data plane), and routing. The data plane functions that deal with data bundles are executed in BAD. These functions include data bundles aggregation/de-aggregation, queuing and scheduling, and traffic classification.|$|R
50|$|Typically a {{spectrum}} analyzer {{is used to}} measure the emission levels of the DUT across a wide band of frequencies (frequency domain). Specialized spectrum analyzers for EMC testing are available, called EMI test receivers or EMI analyzers. These incorporate bandwidths and detectors as specified by international EMC standards. EMI receivers along with specified transducers can often be used for both conducted and radiated emissions. Pre-selector filters may also be used to reduce the effect of strong <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> on the front-end of the receiver.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the driving}} factors in {{developing}} clock networks was the broadcast industry.

A central clock system allows a television station's master control and production personnel to work within that schedule. A clock network synchronized to the standard UTC time also allows different television facilities to coordinate their activities without complicated <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling.</b> It also provides accurate timing to equipment in stations that are becoming increasingly automated.|$|R
