Their work was mostly complete later in development but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. Edgar Froese, Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music. He recorded with Tangerine Dream in Austria but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and <b>Oh</b> <b>No</b> used as well.|$|E

Experimental results suggested that Zn 5 (<b>OH)</b> 8 (<b>NO</b> 3) 2 · 2 H 2 O rectangle sheets and Zn 5 (<b>OH)</b> 8 (<b>NO</b> 3) 2 · 2 H 2 O upright-standing plates were obtained by limiting ethanol-water volume ratio.

For [...] "Life in Marvelous Times", Mr. Flash reused the beat from [...] "Champions"—his 2006 collaboration with the French hip hop group TTC—while [...] "History" [...] used a beat produced by J Dilla before his death. With Preservation, Mos Def produced [...] "Casa Bey" [...] after a 2006 trip to Rio de Janeiro, where local rapper MV Bill {{introduced him to the}} music of Banda Black Rio. Mos Def and Preservation altered one of the band's songs—"Casa Forte", an instrumental featuring their characteristic blend of funk, jazz, soul, and Brazilian rhythms—and used it as the beat. The original song title—meaning [...] "strong house" [...] in Portuguese—was changed to [...] "Casa Bey"; Bey was Mos Def's family surname.

500|$|Mirkin {{wanted to}} produce a surreal, Monty Python-esque, single-camera comedy series. He had a {{development}} deal with Newharts producers MTM Enterprises and persuaded them to buy the rights {{to produce a}} pilot for an American adaptation of the British sitcom The Young Ones. The pilot was entitled <b>Oh</b> <b>No,</b> Not Them!, and featured Nigel Planer from the original series, as well as Jackie Earle Haley and Robert Bundy. Mirkin had wanted to cast comedian Chris Elliott in the pilot, but was prevented by Fox, which wanted Elliott for another show. <b>Oh</b> <b>No,</b> Not Them!, in Mirkin's words, [...] "tested through the floor" [...] {{because it was too}} [...] "surreal" [...] and [...] "sarcastic" [...] and was not picked up. Mirkin and Elliott decided to develop a show together, along with Adam Resnick. In 1990, they created the sitcom Get a Life, which was conceived as a dark, surreal, psychotic version of the cartoon Dennis the Menace. The show stars Elliott as Chris Peterson, a 30-year-old newspaper delivery boy who still lives with his parents, and who is increasingly losing his grip on reality. Fox was lukewarm about the idea, but Mirkin convinced them to order a pilot by understating how dark the show would be. The network executives disliked the pilot after seeing an initial run-through, but Mirkin felt that this was because they [...] "didn't get" [...] the show and opted not to change it. The executives enjoyed the finished pilot and it was aired. However, throughout the show's run, the network's initially negative attitude prevailed. According to Mirkin, many of the executives struggled to understand it and objected to the darkness and surrealism of the show's humor, which included the frequent death of Elliott's character, and regularly threatened to shut down production. After its first season, on the insistence of the network, Chris moves out of his parents' garage, attempts to get additional jobs to his paper route, and attempts to get a girlfriend. However, Mirkin and Elliott refused to [...] " [...] the essential goofiness of the show".|$|E
500|$|Grand Theft Auto V is {{the first}} game in its series to use an {{original}} score. Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich summarised the original score idea as [...] "daunting", because it was unprecedented for a Grand Theft Auto game. Like most previous series entries, the game uses licensed music tracks provided by an in-game radio as well. Pavlovich hoped that the original score would enhance the licensed music use, not detract from it. He further noted the balancing act between the score's [...] "ambient subtext and tensions" [...] and the game's onscreen action. To work on the score, Rockstar engaged The Alchemist, <b>Oh</b> <b>No</b> and Tangerine Dream with Woody Jackson, who had previously worked on Red Dead Redemption, L.A. Noire and Max Payne 3s music. The team of producers collaborated over several years to create more than twenty hours of music that scores both the game's missions and dynamic gameplay throughout the single-player and multiplayer modes.|$|E

500|$|Jackson’s initial {{role was}} to provide score for Trevor’s missions, and he took {{influence}} from artists such as The Mars Volta and Queens of the Stone Age. When he learnt that the team would be building off each other’s work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. [...] "Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing", Jackson said. Froese had interpolated funk sounds with Jackson’s hip-hop influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and <b>Oh</b> <b>No,</b> who heavily sampled it. The Alchemist opined, [...] "We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there...We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that". DJ Shadow then mixed the team's creations together and matched it to the gameplay. Pavlovich considered [...] "how to make the hip-hop and rock score not sound like they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score" [...] a challenge.|$|E
500|$|Mos Def {{collaborated with}} singer Georgia Anne Muldrow and rappers Slick Rick and Talib Kweli—his {{partner in the}} rap duo Black Star. Muldrow sang and played piano on [...] "Roses", which she {{originally}} wrote and recorded in 2008 for her album Umsindo (2009). She said Mos Def [...] "borrowed" [...] the song for The Ecstatic after they met through a mutual friend. [...] "They came over one day and started playing 'Roses.' He was singing the song and knew it. He said 'I wanna grab that.' I said, 'Man, I already got this as a single'. He just wanted that song. He snatched it up real quick", she recalled in laughter. Along with Madlib, <b>Oh</b> <b>No,</b> and J Dilla, Muldrow had been an affiliate of Stones Throw Records; according to journalist Nathan Rabin, they collectively produced half of the album, giving its sound a [...] "sympathetic" [...] quality.

[...] "No disrespect to [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Pavlovich {{found that}} while Rockstar {{assigned}} the team missions to write music for, some of their random creations influenced other missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. He discussed a [...] "stem-based" [...] system used to make music fit dynamic game factors where the team would compose music to underscore outcomes players could make immediately after completing missions. Each of these stems, Froese reflected, included up to 62 five-minute WAV files, which were sent to Pavlovich in New York. [...] "He then created, very professionally, a mix down {{for each of the}} eight stems needed for a mission and sent out the material to the other artists involved", Froese elaborated. <b>Oh</b> <b>No</b> drew from scenes within the game to make his work feel contextually pertinent with the action onscreen. The iconographic introduction of Los Santos early in the game, for example, inspired him to [...] "create a smooth West Coast vibe that embodied" [...] the city. He supplied horns, electric and bass guitars, and percussion parts to fit with the car chase scenes. [...] "We wanted everything to set the right tone", he explained.|$|E
