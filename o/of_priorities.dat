The BP section of the site {{is a good way}} from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number <b>of</b> <b>priorities,</b> including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013.|$|E
5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in the conference and shared this information with the British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation to reconsider the necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely to do both, but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing the Soviets to capture territory beyond that which had been promised to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to that which had occurred in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1920s {{the tension between}} the air and naval {{services}} had declined. It arose briefly again in 1937 when the question of the FAA operational control arose. On this occasion the British Government sided with the Admiralty. Despite a spirited defence of its asset, once the Minister for Coordination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip had decided to transfer the arm, the Air Ministry was content to let the matter rest. Any threat to the Air Ministry's existence had long since passed; budgetary constraint, and the reluctance to engage in another battle which would waste resources were also factors in the Air Ministry's decision not to contest the issue further. However, inter-service squabbling assured maritime aviation's stagnation, especially in shore-based elements. Virtually no co-operation existed in the area of research and development. In the case of Coastal Command, it continued to come third in the Air Ministry's list <b>of</b> <b>priorities,</b> after Fighter and Bomber Commands, well into the late 1930s.|$|E

Attendance was down, animal {{importation}} and supplying zoo animals with food was low on the New Zealand Government's list <b>of</b> <b>priorities.</b> Due to these pressures, exhibits changed to more localised and rural representatives. The arrival of United States military personnel in June 1942 helped the zoo, especially because the personnel were quartered close to Western Springs. It was not infrequent for the majority of weekend visitors to be in uniform. The end of the war found the zoo in a state of slight disrepair and depletion of stocks, but in good condition considering the conflict of the last six years. Furthermore, this time saw the retirement, and movement of many of the early or original members of the zoo staff.|$|E
25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. There might be some space set aside for a netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport as the most important for things to do in their free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list <b>of</b> <b>priorities.</b>|$|E
25|$|Search engines such as Google {{serves as}} a default means {{of access to the}} Web and its wide array of {{linguistics}} resources. However, for linguists working in the field of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search engine load and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves. This will then lead to a large number of possibilities opening in the area of harnessing the rich potential of the Web.|$|E
40|$|Aristotle’s notion <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> {{in nature}} and in substance, as {{introduced}} in Metaphysics 1019 a 2 - 4, has been traditionally understood in terms <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> in existence: x is prior to y if x can exist without y’s existing, but y cannot exist without x’s existing. In this paper I challenge this traditional view. I argue for an alternative view in terms <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> in being, which is ontological counterpart <b>of</b> definitional <b>priority.</b> According to priority in being, x is prior to y if x can be what it is without y’s being what it is, whereas y cannot be what it is without x’s being what it is...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{with the}} Germans {{retreating}} {{in the face}} of the Allied onslaught, harried all the way by the resistance, there were widespread instances of revenge attacks on those accused of collaboration. A number of prominent officials and members of the feared Milice were murdered, often by exceptionally brutal means, provoking the Germans into appalling reprisals, such as in the destruction of the village of Oradour-sur-Glane and the killing of its 642 inhabitants. Liberation of the French capital was not high on the Allies' list <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> as it had comparatively little strategic value, but both de Gaulle and the commander of the 2nd Armored Division, General Philippe Leclerc were still extremely concerned about a communist takeover. De Gaulle successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter the capital first. A few days later, General Leclerc's French Armoured Division entered the outskirts of the city, and after six days of fighting in which the resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic outbreaks of fighting continued for several days. General Dietrich von Choltitz, the commander of the garrison, was instructed by Hitler to raze the city to the ground, however, he simply ignored the order and surrendered his forces.|$|E
25|$|Corporate insolvencies {{happen because}} {{companies}} become excessively indebted. Under UK law, {{a company is}} a separate legal person {{from the people who}} have invested money and labour into it, and it mediates a series of interest groups. Invariably the shareholders, directors and employees' liability is limited to the amount of their investment, so against commercial creditors they can lose no more than the money they paid for shares, or their jobs. Insolvencies become intrinsically possible whenever a relationship of credit and debt is created, as frequently happens through contracts or other obligations. In the section of an economy where competitive markets operate, wherever excesses are possible, insolvencies are likely to happen. The meaning of insolvency is simply an inability to repay debts, although the law isolates two main further meanings. First, for a court to order a company be wound up (and its assets sold off) or for an administrator to be appointed (to try to turn the business around), or for avoiding various transactions, the cash flow test is usually applied: a company must be unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Second, for the purpose of suing directors to compensate creditors, or for directors to be disqualified, a company must be shown to have fewer overall assets than liabilities on its balance sheet. If debts cannot be paid back to everybody in full, creditors necessarily stand in competition with one another for a share of the remaining assets. For this reason, a statutory system <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> fixes the order among different kinds of creditor for payment.|$|E
25|$|The {{regression}} of naval aviation continued {{regardless of its}} potential. During the Spanish Civil War German aircraft—mainly Heinkel He 59 and Heinkel He 60s—sank 144 ships out of the 554 lost by the Republican forces and played {{a big role in}} General Franco's victory. Shortly before the fall of Barcelona in 1939, for example, aircraft sank 30 ships and damaged scores more in the harbour. The success of anti-shipping operations did not spur naval aviation to a place of importance under the new Luftwaffe staff. Resembling the faulty policies of Admiral Zemker, air doctrine produced under Walter Wever's tenure as Chief of the General Staff (1933–1936) relegated naval concerns to fourth place on the list <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> in his draft of the Conduct of the Air War in 1935. Nevertheless, much of the progress in naval aviation was initiated by the Luftwaffe, rather than the Kriegsmarine. Other members of the air arm tried to give naval aviation the attention in needed. General Hellmuth Felmy, commanding Luftlotte 2, set up a specialised naval aircraft corps in his command under the control of Hans Geisler—a naval aviator and former sailor. Felmy was responsible for conducting air operations against England in May 1939. The experienced airmen suggested Wever appoint another naval airman, Joachim Coeler, as inspector of naval aviation. These men developed air-dropped torpedoes and naval mines which proved very successful from 1940. However, all attempts to produce a naval air arm were thwarted by Hitler's deputy and commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring.|$|E
