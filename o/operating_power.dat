5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they be decommissioned. This involved the removal of hazardous materials and contaminants, to keep in line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to <b>operating</b> <b>power</b> stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E

2500|$|Initial {{superheat}} {{performance was}} disappointing. Superheat {{at full power}} was limited deliberately to [...] {{so as to avoid}} reliability problems, which then meant that it was ineffective at low powers. Development work by Babcock & Wilcox resolved this by increasing the steam flow speed through the superheater to 150ft/sec, avoiding the problems of tube distortion and metallurgical failure. [...] New boilers for the Nelson-class battleships and the Kent-class cruisers could achieve a superheat of [...] throughout the <b>operating</b> <b>power</b> range at 250psi.|$|E
2500|$|The facility, {{located at}} the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) {{approximately}} [...] west of Idaho Falls, Idaho, {{was part of the}} Army Nuclear Power Program and was known as the Argonne Low Power Reactor (ALPR) during its design and build phase. It was intended to provide electrical power and heat for small, remote military facilities, such as radar sites near the Arctic Circle, and those in the DEW Line. The design power was 3 MW (thermal), but some 4.7 MW tests were performed in the months prior to the accident. <b>Operating</b> <b>power</b> was 200 kW electrical and 400kW thermal for space heating.|$|E
2500|$|Apparent {{power is}} {{taken into account}} when {{designing}} and <b>operating</b> <b>power</b> systems, because although the current associated with reactive power does no work at the load, (it heats the conductors and wastes energy) it still must be supplied by the power source. Conductors, transformers and generators must be sized to carry the total current, not just the current that does useful work. Failure {{to provide for the}} supply of sufficient reactive power in electrical grids can lead to lowered voltage levels and under certain operating conditions to the complete collapse of the network or blackout. Another consequence is that adding the apparent power for two loads will not accurately give the total power unless they have the same phase difference between current and voltage (the same power factor).|$|E
