5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{specialized}} as a bamboo feeder with strong, curved and sharp semi-retractile claws standing inward for grasping narrow tree branches, leaves, and fruit. Like the giant panda, {{it has a}} “false thumb” which is an extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> bone. When descending a tree head-first, the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent, {{one of the few}} climbing species to do so.|$|E
5|$|With an {{unconventional}} front-on bowling action, Meckiff progressed through the district cricket ranks at South Melbourne Cricket Club, making his first-class debut for Victoria in 1956–57. After a productive first season, Meckiff was named in a new-look Australian {{team for the}} 1957–58 tour of South Africa. This {{was the result of}} a generational change in the Australian Test team after a decline in performances in the 1950s. The shift saw Meckiff open the bowling in his debut Test, where he performed strongly to take eight wickets. Generating his pace from an unusual bent-arm action which involved a flick <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> Meckiff reached his peak in the Second Test of the 1958–59 season against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He took 6/38 in the second innings as England were dismissed for 87, setting up an Australian victory. His achievement was engulfed by controversy, as English media and former players accused him of throwing Australia to victory.|$|E
25|$|Arthroscopy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> {{is used to}} {{investigate}} and treat symptoms of repetitive strain injury, fractures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and torn or damaged ligaments. It {{can also be used}} to ascertain joint damage caused by wrist osteoarthritis.|$|E
40|$|Measuring fidgeting is an {{important}} goal for <b>the</b> psychology <b>of</b> mind-wandering and for human computer interaction (HCI). Previous work measuring <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, torso and thigh during HCI has shown that engaging screen content leads to non-instrumental movement inhibition (NIMI). Camera-based methods for measuring wrist movements are limited by the occlusion, supination and friction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arm. Here we used a high pass filtered magnitude of wearable tri-axial accelerometer recordings during 2 -minute passive HCI stimuli as a surrogate for movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> and ankles. With 24 seated, healthy volunteers experiencing HCI, this metric showed that wrists moved significantly more than ankles. We found that NIMI could be detected in <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> and ankles; it distinguished extremes of interest and boredom via restlessness. We conclude that both free-willed and forced screen engagement can elicit NIMI <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> and ankles...|$|R
25|$|A {{short bone}} {{is one that}} is cube-like in shape, being {{approximately}} equal in length, width, and thickness. The only short bones in the human skeleton are in <b>the</b> carpals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> and <b>the</b> tarsals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ankles. Short bones provide stability and support as well as some limited motion.|$|R
2500|$|This {{primarily}} {{involves the}} person being {{lifted from the}} ground by their wrists. This is usually achieved by use of rope or by special suspension cuffs. When using rope, extreme damage can be caused to <b>the</b> soft tissues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrists,</b> as well as reducing circulation, so being suspended by ropes can only normally be achieved for {{a very short period}} of time. Often in fiction and movies a person may be pictured hanging from metal cuffs or handcuffs. This is possible, although extremely painful and will leave deep marks in <b>the</b> <b>wrists.</b> <b>The</b> safest and [...] "most comfortable" [...] method <b>of</b> suspension by <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> is to use suspension cuffs as they are specifically designed to spread the weight around <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> as much as possible.|$|R

25|$|The {{carpal bones}} {{function}} as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. The scaphoid is also involved in movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> It, along with the lunate, articulates with the radius and ulna to form the major bones involved in movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> The scaphoid serves as {{a link between the}} two rows of carpal bones. With wrist movement, the scaphoid may flex from its position in the same plane as the forearm to perpendicular.|$|E
40|$|A 22 -year-old man {{was injured}} in an {{automobile}} accident. He sustained fracture-dislocations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>wrist</b> and right elbow. Initial radiographs showed a fracture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radius 3 cm proximal to <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> joint angulated anteri-orly with the ulnar head dislocated dorsally (Fig 1). Closed reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>wrist</b> and right elbow was per-formed immediately. Successful reduction was achieved in the right elbow, but in <b>the</b> left <b>wrist</b> <b>the</b> ulnar head remained dorsally dislocated.

30|$|Regular {{assessments}} of ROM and strength {{provide insight into}} the degree and progression of functional impairment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hands. Both active and passive ROM <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> and digits should be determined using a goniometer. Grip strength should be assessed using a dynamometer, and pinch strength should be measured using a pinch meter. ROM <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elbows and shoulders may also be examined if deemed useful.|$|R
25|$|The {{scaphoid}} bone {{is one of}} the carpal bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> It is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> (also called the lateral or radial side). It forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel. The {{scaphoid bone}} is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward, lateralward, and forward. It is approximately {{the size and shape of}} a medium cashew.|$|E

25|$|As {{compared}} with apes, which have an elongated Pisiform, humans have a shorter pisiform bone. This {{is due to}} the loss of the single growth plate typically found in other mammalian pisiforms. This may be because of evolutionary benefits from having a shorter pisiform bone, including facilitating ulnar deviation of the hand, and preventing hyperextension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> actions that improve the action of clubbing.|$|E
25|$|Code {{writes a}} monthly column in Motorcyclist {{magazine}} called Code Break. He has also opened a specialized school for racing techniques, called Code R.A.C.E. He has written three books about sportsbike riding and racing techniques {{as well as}} two feature length DVDs covering both his first and second A Twist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wrist</b> books. His works have been translated into Russian, German, Estonian, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Dutch and Turkish.|$|E
25|$|When active wrist {{extension}} is present, it {{must not}} be weakened. Therefore, the extensor carpi radialis longus can only be used on patients in IC 3 and higher where active extension is supplied by both the extensor carpi radialis longus and the extensor carpi radialis brevis. In IC 2 patients active extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> depends only on the m. extensor carpi radialis longus, therefore this muscle {{must not be used}} for a transfer in this group of patients.|$|E
5|$|None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carpals (<b>wrist</b> bones) fit {{together}} precisely, suggesting <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> {{a large amount}} <b>of</b> cartilage in <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> which would have stiffened it. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digits were able to hyperextend (bend backwards) until they nearly touched <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> When flexed, <b>the</b> middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. <b>The</b> first digit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.|$|R
40|$|Object : This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> clinical effect <b>of</b> Scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture on two patients suffering from Wrist Ganglion. Methods : We treated two patients suffering from Wrist Ganglion with both acupuncture and injection of Scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture. Then we measured <b>the</b> sizes <b>of</b> <b>Wrist</b> Ganglion and Visual Analogue Scale(VAS). Results and Conclusions : We found that <b>the</b> sizes <b>of</b> <b>Wrist</b> Ganglion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two patients were significantly reduced. Moreover, the pain and discomfort <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients were reported to be reduced. So, we concluded that Scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture has an excellent effect on Wrist Ganglion. However, further studies are needed to investigate its exact effects...|$|R
25|$|The Wii Remote {{comes with}} a wrist strap {{attached}} to the bottom to ensure <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device. <b>The</b> <b>wrist</b> strap is tied with a Cow hitch knot. Most Wii games displays a caution screen upon loading to warn the player to use the strap {{in order to avoid}} the remote slipping from the grip during erratic movements.|$|R
25|$|Stretches and {{isometric}} exercises {{will aid}} in prevention for persons at risk. Stretching before the activity and during breaks will aid in alleviating tension at the wrist. Place the hand firmly {{on a flat}} surface and gently press for a few seconds to stretch the wrist and fingers. An example for an isometric exercise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> is done by clenching the fist tightly, releasing and fanning out fingers. None of these stretches or exercises should cause pain or discomfort.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the right moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered with a flick <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b>|$|E
25|$|The manus and carpus {{are among}} the few areas of the Protoavis {{material}} which are well preserved, and they are astonishingly non-avian. The distal carpals, while long, are in no way similar to those observed in the urvogel or other archaic birds. There is no semilunate element, {{and the structure of}} the radiale and ulnare would have limited the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> joint. The manus is not tridactyl, and metacarpal V is present. In even the most basal avialian, Archaeopteryx, there is no vestige of the fifth metacarpal and its presence in Protoavis seems incongruous with the claim that it is a bird, let alone one more derived than Archaeopteryx.|$|E
40|$|Kinematic {{resolved}} rate equations {{allow an}} operator with visual feedback to dynamically control a robot hand. When <b>the</b> robot <b>wrist</b> is degenerate, <b>the</b> computed joint angle rates exceed operational limits, and unwanted hand movements can result. The generalized matrix inverse solution can also produce unwanted responses. A method is introduced {{to control the}} robot hand in <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degenerate robot <b>wrist.</b> <b>The</b> method uses a coordinated movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first and third joints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot <b>wrist</b> to locate <b>the</b> second <b>wrist</b> joint axis for movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot hand in the commanded direction. The method does not entail infinite joint angle rates...|$|R
