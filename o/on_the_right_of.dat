5|$|While the 60th Division's {{attack on}} the coast was proceeding, the 75th Division on their right {{attacked}} the Tabsor defences, fighting its way towards Et Tire which they captured. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the 75th Division, the 7th (Meerut) Division advanced north-eastwards towards the north of Et Tire to attack the defences west of Tabsor, while the 3rd (Lahore) Division, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the 7th (Meerut) Division, advanced rapidly and seized the first line defences between Bir Adas and the Hadrah road. This division then turned eastwards to make a flank {{attack on the}} defences at Jiljulieh and Kalkilieh in the Judean foothills. Meanwhile, the 54th (East Anglian) Division <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the 3rd (Lahore) Division with the French detachment on its left, achieved their objective of establishing and acting as a firm pivot {{for the rest of}} the British infantry line, although they experienced strong resistance from Asia Corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} were {{to advance}} in echelon {{from the left}} {{at a distance of}} 400 paces apart — the 2nd Division (Donzelot's) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> Bourgeois' brigade, the 3rd Division (Marcognet's) next, and the 4th Division (Durutte's) on the right.They were led by Ney to the assault, each column having a front of about a hundred and sixty to two hundred files.|$|E
5|$|About 10:30, some of Leane's scouts {{reported}} that the 13th Brigade, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the 12th Brigade and opposite Dernancourt, was falling back. Around the same time, his right forward company on the embankment sent back a message indicating that the Germans had penetrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the brigade {{in the area of}} the 47th Battalion, and that it was taking over part of the left of the 47th Battalion line to assist. In response to a probe by the Germans against his northern-most company in the series of posts alongside the Albert–Amiens road, Leane immediately sent part of his reserve company from Pioneer Trench to reinforce it. Sensing the danger in the 13th Brigade area, Leane ordered Major Arthur Samuel Allen, commanding the nearby 45th Battalion, to move his battalion forward to vacant trenches overlooking that sector. As Allen was implementing these orders, he received conflicting orders from Gellibrand to send two companies forward to Pioneer Trench. Allen saw the wisdom of Leane's orders, and tried to convince the brigade major that Leane's preferred course of action was best. Nevertheless, Allen was directed to carry out Gellibrand's orders. Later events proved that, being the most experienced commander on the ground, Leane actually had the most accurate conception of the real danger to the 12th Brigade's position.|$|E

5|$|After a {{brief period}} of rest, they {{returned}} to the line near Broodseinde on 1 October, taking up a position near Molenaarelsthoek, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> I Anzac's position for the upcoming battle. The attack went in on 4 October, and after overcoming an encounter with a German infantry regiment, the 212th, in no man's land, the Australians successfully managed to capture their objectives. During the battle, the 2nd Battalion lost 10 officers and 144 other ranks killed or wounded, some of which were suffered after an intense German mortar barrage had fallen upon the troops in their form-up point prior to the attack, killing or wounding up to one seventh of the assault force.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was booked}} in Celtic's {{penultimate}} league game against Kilmarnock, which {{caused him to}} go over the disciplinary points threshold and receive a suspension for the first two matches of the 2011–12 season. Brown helped Celtic to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final, which Celtic won 3–0 against Motherwell. This allowed him to collect his first trophy as Celtic captain. Brown played 39 times for Celtic, scoring four goals, during the 2010–11 season. He was often used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> midfield, partly due to the form of other central midfielders such as Beram Kayal, Joe Ledley and Ki Sung-Yueng, but also because Brown is more able to play in wide areas than them.|$|E

5|$|In early 1863, Major General James Longstreet {{was given}} {{command of the}} Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His {{objectives}} were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied a position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by {{the bank of the}} Nansemond River. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.|$|E
5|$|In early June, {{plans were}} made for the Australian 2nd Division to attack around Morlancourt in {{preparation}} for a more significant attack at Hamel. On 10 June, the battalion advanced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the 7th Brigade's line, capturing the German front line trenches around Morlancourt and wiping out a whole battalion, taking 325 prisoners for the loss of 400 men. On 4 July the battalion undertook a supporting role in the successful Australian attack at Hamel, following up the initial success with a further, albeit small, advance on 8 July. After the German offensive petered out, the 27th Battalion undertook peaceful penetration operations against the German line as the Allies began to prepare to launch their own offensive.|$|E

5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly {{in his ability to}} present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Mons {{took place}} {{as part of}} the Battle of the Frontiers, in which the {{advancing}} German armies clashed with the advancing Allied armies along the Franco-Belgian and Franco-German borders. The British position on the French flank meant that it stood {{in the path of the}} German 1st Army. The British reached Mons on 22 August and at the time, the French Fifth Army, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the British, was heavily engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi. The British agreed to hold the line of the Condé–Mons–Charleroi Canal for twenty-four hours, to prevent the advancing German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank. The British thus spent the day digging in along the canal.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> human <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> {{children}} have been established step by step since {{the early part of}} the 20 th century. In 1989, the UN adopted <b>the</b> Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child, in which children were accorded not only <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child but also those <b>rights</b> established in <b>the</b> UN Universal Declaration <b>of</b> Human <b>Rights.</b> In Japan, however, both the government and public opinion maintain a conservative attitude toward <b>the</b> Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child. Hence, <b>the</b> Committee <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child and local Japanese governmental bodies, which obey Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child, carry out important roles for insuring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children. Recently, <b>the</b> effects of globalization have been increasing in many areas. International competition has intensified and the ideas of economic and social value promoted by international capital are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rise in many countries. In Japan, educational policy and methods of childcare have been altered as a result of these broader changes. For these reasons, <b>the</b> Committee <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child has developed new recommendations for reconstructing the current system in order to protect <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children which may be threatened by the global social changes produced by this highly competitive environment. Moreover, local Japanese governmental bodies, which obey <b>the</b> Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child, now have a new set of problems arising from the need to consider <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children in regions outside their jurisdiction...|$|R

5|$|The {{attack was}} {{to involve the}} New Zealand Division's 2nd and Rifle Brigades, with 4th Brigade in reserve, attacking along Belluvue Spur and onto Goudberg Spur while the 3rd Australian Division, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the New Zealanders, {{attempted}} to take Passchendaele itself. On the division's left was the 9th (Scottish) Division. The plan required both New Zealand brigades to advance with a one-battalion frontage, with three battalions of each brigade leapfrogging each other in sequence to capture objectives designated Red, Blue and Green lines, the last of which was Goudberg Spur.|$|E

5|$|After a month {{engaged in}} {{reorganisation}} and training at Sidi Azeiz, the New Zealanders re-entered {{the campaign in}} mid-December at El Agheila {{in an attempt to}} trap the Panzer Army Africa. On 11 December, the division carried out a flanking move to the south and west, led by the 6th Brigade with the 25th Battalion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the advance. The move was unopposed for five days until the evening of 15 December, when a reconnaissance element that included the brigade's commander, Brigadier William Gentry, came under fire from a ridge. The 25th Battalion supported the 24th Battalion's subsequent attack on the ridge but {{it was found that the}} trap had failed, with the Germans slipping through the gap between the 5th and 6th Brigades. A second attempt to trap the Germans was made at Nofilia a few days later but this also failed when the rearguard prevented the 5th Brigade from closing the road along which the retreat was being made. The advance continued and on 23 January 1943, the 2nd New Zealand Division entered Tripoli. Shortly after reaching the city, Bonifant was given command of the New Zealand Divisional Cavalry with Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Morten taking over the 25th Battalion. Initially stationed outside of Tripoli, it moved into the city proper later in February with the rest of the 6th Brigade as part of the occupying force.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the return}} of Tesche on a {{permanent}} contract seemed likely to endanger Davis's first-team place, he began the 2016–17 season in the starting eleven. He was booked {{in each of the}} first four matches, but two goals and a series of strong performances meant that when the fifth booking finally arrived in mid-October, he came straight back into the side after serving his suspension. He was named man of the match in the Second City derby against Aston Villa. Initially used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> midfield to counteract the attacking threat of Jordan Amavi, he moved into a more familiar central role after David Cotterill entered the match, and within minutes scored the equalising goal with a composed finish {{from the edge of the}} penalty area.
