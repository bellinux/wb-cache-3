500|$|The song's lyrics {{underwent}} many changes, {{in order}} to find the right level of vulgarity. The initial version was much more “genteel,” while later versions included references to ‘turtleheads’ and other slang for feces; as was the line “It may sound gross, it may sound crass, but we need to see what comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ass”; which was changed to “It may sound gross, you may say shush, but we need to see what comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> tush.” ...|$|E

500|$|... "We're Not Makin' Love Anymore" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Barbra Streisand for her fourth greatest hits album, [...] (1989). It was released on September 14, 1989 by Columbia Records on 7", 12", cassette, and CD. It was written by Michael Bolton and Diane Warren and produced by Narada Michael Walden. Bolton's inspiration for the song was derived from his divorce; he and Warren debated what singer {{would be able to}} sing their work well and ultimately decided that Streisand would be the right fit. The song is a ballad that is similar in sound to Streisand's [...] "Comin' In and <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Life" [...] (1981).|$|E
500|$|According to Allison J.

Furthermore, she liked that the new single was [...] "emotional and strenuous", but she also considered it to be unmemorable. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic questioned the placement of [...] "We're Not Makin' Love Anymore" [...] and [...] "Someone That I Used to Love" [...] on A Collection: Greatest Hits...and More, stating that the overall track listing [...] "made no apparent sense, but then neither had Memories, and that album sold several million copies".|$|E

She began by brainstorming ideas for the visual, and she talked to Alexandra Young and the video's editor Winston Case, who suggested her the concept of breaking world records. Peer selected 30 records for the band to break, nonetheless, they reduced the number due to the short length of the video shoot. The records selected were picked to match [...] "different sections of the song" [...] and were based on other already-existent records.|$|E

During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mind? What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question!

500|$|During World War II, the 91st Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces {{referred}} to the gesture as the [...] "rigid digit" [...] salute. It was used in a more jocular manner, to suggest an airman had committed an error or infraction; the term was a reference to British slang terms for inattentiveness (i.e. [...] "pull your finger <b>out</b> (<b>of</b> <b>your</b> bum)"). The [...] "order of the rigid digit" [...] continued after the war {{as a series of}} awards presented by the veteran's association of the 91st, marked by wooden statuettes of a hand giving the single finger gesture.
