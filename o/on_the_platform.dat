5|$|Beginning with Rag Doll Kung Fu in October 2005, {{third-party}} games {{became available}} for purchase and download on Steam, and Valve announced that Steam had become profitable because of some highly successful Valve games. Although digital distribution could not yet match retail volume, profit margins for Valve and developers were far larger on Steam. Large developer-publishers, including id Software, Eidos Interactive, and Capcom, began distributing their games on Steam in 2007. By May that year, 13million accounts had been created on the service, and 150 games were for sale <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> that Carter {{was weak}} on defense, citing the {{cancellation}} of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s.

5|$|LucasArts {{developed}} a port of the enhanced edition for the Sega CD, but the release was eventually canceled because The Secret of Monkey Island failed {{to be much}} of a commercial success <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> The arcade-style game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game designed by Attention To Detail was released almost simultaneously with its adventure counterpart, and loosely follows its plot.|$|E

5|$|On release Iridion {{garnered}} generally poor reviews.

Despite lukewarm reception to the title upon release, Iridion 3D influenced future Shin'en shooters such as Iridion II and Nanostray.|$|E

The rough black tiles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> edge mark the location of the doorway of approaching trains, allowing passengers to wait at the right place to board. All faregates and ticket vending machines were replaced.|$|E
5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a {{warm summer}} day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, they were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of}} a platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} as a playing experience that newcomers to the series could come to. Its presentation was compared to that of a fairy tale, as depicting the usual style of the series would have been difficult <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> Both Tetsuya Nomura and Yoko Shimomura, veterans from the main series, returned as director and composer respectively. The game received favorable reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{southbound}} {{platform is}} {{adjacent to the}} station building, and its high-level section requires crossing only a lightly used spur of State Street. However, access to the northbound platform requires crossing both Northeast Corridor tracks. The footbridge to the planned Coast Guard Museum will allow access to the northbound platform without crossing tracks, which will improve safety and prevent passengers from being trapped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> by stopped trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{underground}} station was opened on 27 March 1907 by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway {{under the name}} Great Central (following a change from its intended name Lisson Grove). The railway terminated here until the extension to Edgware Road opened on 15 June. The station was renamed Marylebone on 15 April 1917. The original name still appears in places <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> wall tiling, although the tiling scheme is a replacement designed to reflect the original scheme.|$|E

The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Because the Dreamcast had a {{much smaller}} user base than PlayStation platforms, Capcom knew the series could not survive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> This led to {{bringing}} an extended cut, titled Code: Veronica X in the West and Code: Veronica Kanzenban in Japan, to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 in 2001. The extended cut was announced in November 2000. It has approximately 10 minutes of new cinematic sequences that reveal more about Wesker's involvement with Umbrella. The rest of the game remains mostly unchanged, although Capcom claimed they made some graphical enhancements. Capcom printed special DVDs of Wesker's Report for the North American PlayStation 2 release. They were sold on Capcom's website and given to customers who purchased the game at specialty retailers such as Electronics Boutique and GameStop.|$|E
5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimalâ€“ shelters, benches and {{timetable}} information are provided. Customer help points give live train information.

There is step-free access to the northern platform from the car park, and a set of steps from the footbridge. There is also stepped access to the footbridge from the south, and a ramp down to the southern platform. There is no taxi rank, but there are bus stops on Whiteladies Road.

Only the two main-line through tracks remain. The old information displays made in Czechoslovakia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>platforms</b> are still present, although {{they are no longer}} functional. Since the electrification of the lower track in 1999, there is only one platform (platform 1, formerly platform 7) in operation. The exit signals of the crossing track are switched off, but are operational, the position of the points has been locked, but they still exist.|$|R
