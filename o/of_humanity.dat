5|$|The {{ending of}} Redemption varies {{depending}} upon on the quantity <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> Christof has retained during the game. If the quantity is great, Christof reconciles with Anezka and turns {{her into a}} vampire, sparing her from death. If his humanity is moderate, he surrenders to Vukodlak and becomes a ghoul; Vukodlak betrays Christof and forces him to murder Anezka. A lesser quantity <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> results in Christof killing Vukodlak by drinking his blood. Greatly empowered, Christof forsakes his humanity, murders Anezka, and revels in his new power.|$|E

Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E

And what role can interdisciplinary studies play in the development <b>of</b> <b>humanities?</b> The results <b>of</b> the study show that according to experts, “interdisciplinary development”, having the twelfth place among the sixteen important factors in the development <b>of</b> <b>humanities,</b> does not have a considerable effect on the development <b>of</b> <b>humanities</b> in Iran per se, and its efficacy depends on the existence of more important conditions, such as the provision of an open intellectual climate at universities and the independence of scientific community. The development of interdisciplinary studies {{can play a}} part in the development <b>of</b> <b>humanities</b> in Iran, only if it results in scientific synergy among experts in different disciplines <b>of</b> <b>humanities,</b> improves the scientific ability of professors, students and researchers, and makes humanities more applicable in society. ...|$|R
