40|$|The {{study of}} floral nectary {{structures}} of thirteen <b>ornamental</b> <b>apple</b> cultivars examined using light microscope (MS) and {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) was performed. It was found that nectary glands in the selected cultivars were located in {{the upper part of}} the flower receptacle, between the ovary of the pistil and the base of stamen filaments, and they generally belonged to the epimorphic or transitoric type. The nectary surface area, its thickness, the number of glandular tissue layers, the height of epidermal cells of the nectary and the thickness of the outer wall of the epidermis, together with the cuticle, were determined by light microscope. By using SEM, the structure of the surface of nectaries in four <b>ornamental</b> <b>apple</b> cultivars was observed. The epidermis of {{the upper part of the}} nectaries was composed of elongated cells of which outer cell wall was covered with a striated cuticle. The remaining part of the nectary was characterised by cells of similar arrangement and shape, but their surface was marked by a thinner and smoother layer of cuticle. Closed or opened stomata were generally situated at the level of the epidermal cells. Their pores were often filled with granular or plate-shaped structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{represents}} {{the first major}} attempt to characterise the biochemical profile in different tissues of a large selection of apple cultivars sourced from the UK’s National Fruit Collection comprising dessert, ornamental, cider and culinary apples. Furthermore, advanced Machine Learning methods were applied with the objective to identify whether the phenolic and sugar composition of an apple cultivar {{could be used as}} a biomarker fingerprint to differentiate between heritage and mainstream commercial cultivars as well as govern the separation among primary usage groups and harvest season. Prediction accuracy > 90 % was achieved with Random Forest for all three models. The results highlighted the extraordinary phytochemical potency and unique profile of some heritage, cider and <b>ornamental</b> <b>apple</b> cultivars, especially in comparison to more mainstream apple cultivars. Therefore, these findings could guide future cultivar selection on the basis of health-promoting phytochemical content...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} Plant pathogens adapt {{readily to}} new crop varieties in agrosystems, {{and it is}} crucial to understand the factors underlying the epidemic spread of new virulent strains if we are to develop more efficient strategies to control them. In this study we used multilocus microsatellite typing, molecular epidemiology tools and a large collection of isolates from cultivated, wild and <b>ornamental</b> <b>apples</b> to investigate the origin of new virulent populations of Venturia inaequalis, an ascomycete fungus causing apple scab on varieties carrying the Rvi 6 resistance gene. We demonstrated a common origin at the European scale of populations infecting apples (Malus × domestica) carrying the Rvi 6 resistance and Malus floribunda, the progenitor of the Rvi 6 resistance. Demographic modeling indicated that the Rvi 6 -virulent lineage separated several thousands of years ago from populations infecting non-Rvi 6 hosts, without detectable gene flow between the two lineages. These findings show that 'breakdowns' of plant resistance genes can be caused by the selection and migration of virulent genotypes from standing genetic variation maintained in environmental disease reservoirs, here ornamental crabapples. This work stresses the need to take better account of pathogen diversity in resistance screenings of breeding lines and in resistance deployment strategies, in order to enhance sustainable disease management. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aims Malus hupehensis var. pingyiensis {{with strong}} ability for apomixes {{is unique to}} China and is {{tolerant}} of waterlogged conditions and salt. There is little difference among its seedlings because of apomixes. Malus hupehensis var. pingyiensis is widely used as stocks of <b>apple</b> cultivars and <b>ornamental</b> <b>apples</b> and has important applied value in apple production and research. Our objective {{was to determine the}} response characteristic of cells andmitochondria in M. hupehensis var. pingyiensis roots under high saline conditions. Methods Pot seedlings with at least seven mature leaves were used in this experiment. In order to avoid irreversible damage to roots caused by sudden exposure to high level saline condition, we first used a weak saline solution (0. 051 mol·L– 1 NaCl) to water seedlings every two days, for a total of three times. Then strong saline solution (0. 085 mol·L– 1 NaCl) was used to water seedlings. Tap water was used for control seedlings. H 2 O 2 content, membrane potential of mitochondria (Δψm), ATP content, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) and caspase 3 / 7 activity were determined every two days from the third day of 0. 085 mol·L– 1 NaCl treatment, altogether five times. Important findings Δψm of roots declined slowly in the first six days of 0. 085 mol·L– 1 NaCl treatment and thereafter declined rapidly. The H 2 O 2 content in mitochondria decreased slowly in the first six days and then accumulated quickly. ATP content in roots remained constant during the treatment of 0. 085 mol·L– 1 NaCl, but waslow compared with that in control seedlings. The results of TUNEL assay showed that root paraffin slices displayed distinct positive-reaction spots that became more numerous in the root paraffin slice of the ninth day. Caspase 3 / 7 activity was examined with a detection kit; it remained at a low level for the first six days of 0. 085 mol·L– 1 NaCl treatment, and thereafter increased sharply. Results indicated that programmed cell death could be induced in roots of M. hupehensis var. pingyiensis by 0. 085 mol·L– 1 NaCl treatment, and this was closely related to the change of mitochondrial characteristics...|$|R
40|$|In {{the years}} 2007 - 2008, the {{flowering}} biology of Malus sargentii, an <b>ornamental</b> <b>apple</b> tree native to Japan, was {{studied in the}} conditions of Lublin (Poland). The daily rate of flower opening, flowering duration and flower visitation by insects were determined. The amount of nectar produced per flower and sugar content in the nectar were investigated. The size of nectaries and the micromorphology of their surface were examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. It {{was found that the}} greatest amount of flowers opened between 11. 00 and 13. 00. During this time, the largest number of insects was observed in the flowers. Bees (90 %) were predominant among the insects, with a much smaller number of bumblebees (6 %) and butterflies (4 %). The flower life span was 5 days. Over this period, the flower produced, on the average, 0. 71 mg of nectar with an average sugar content of 32 %. The nectaries of Malus sargentii are orange-yellow coloured and they represent the hypanthial type. Due to the protrusion of the nectariferous tissue, they are classified as automorphic nectaries. The surface of the epidermal cells of the nectary was distinguished by distinct cuticle folds. A small number of stomata were located only in the basal part of the nectary. At the beginning of flowering, all stomata were closed, but secretion traces were observed near well-developed outer cuticular ledges...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of testing new apple cultivars {{and the possibility}} to induce valuable traits is directly dependent {{on the availability of}} sufficient genetic diversity, while apple breeding has narrowed the genetic ground of commercial cultivars. Wild species were studied in regard to their influence upon progenies and their capacity to enlarge apple genetic diversity. The interspecific seedlings were framed in five biparental mating (paired crosses), in which Malus species were crossed with different cultivars, obtaining half-sib families. The number of F 1 progenies per combination varied from 31 (Cluj 218 / 2 × M. floribunda) up to 142 (Reinette Baumann × M. floribunda), with a total of 1650 hybrids F 1. The influences upon vigour and juvenile period and possible correlation among fruit size and taste were analyzed. Juvenile period varied from 6. 00 (M. zumi × Jonathan) to 9. 31 years (Cluj 218 / 2 × M. floribunda). Data based on correlation coefficient illustrated that the fructification year was not influenced by the vigour of trees. The highest value of correlation for fruit’s size and taste was obtained among M. coronaria hybrids. This result might suggest that once the fruit are larger, there is a high chance the taste is also more appreciative and fruit quality for mouth feels increase. Depending on the parental formula, additive effects may be inferior compared to genetic effects of dominance and epistasis. Although M. zumi and M. floribunda achieved the same genetic gain (0. 31), M. zumi had a higher expected selection response for fruit size. The difficulty of obtaining seedlings with tasty and large fruit when wild Malus species are used as genitors is resulting from the values of expected selection response data, but in the same time results confirm that wild Malus species are suitable resources for genetic variability, both for dessert and <b>ornamental</b> <b>apple</b> cultivars...|$|E

40|$|In <b>ornamental</b> <b>apple</b> {{breeding}} process, the vigour of {{the tree}} is an important characteristic, this trait being analyzed in selection of seminal descendants obtained by hybridization. The vigour of the apple trees was studied in 25 interspecific hybrids F 1 belonging to different Malus ornamental species, used as maternal or paternal genitors, crossed with several cultivars and selections. The seedling vigour was noted when hybrids were four to seven years old, in accordance with UPOV guideline standard: 3 - weak; 5 - medium; 7 - strong. The mean of marks for tree vigour of F 1 hybrids in the 25 combinations ranged between 4. 00 and 6. 13. Compared with the mean of experiment as control (5. 20), the most vigorous seedlings were obtained in the families ‘Cluj 218 / 2 ’ x M. niedzwetzkyana and ‘Reinette Baumann’ x M. prunifolia, both with significant differences of growth versus the mean growth of all combinations. The weakest growth was noted in progenies belonging to ‘Rosu de Cluj’ x M. coronaria, ‘Starkrimson’ x M. prunifolia, ‘Frumos de Voinesti’ x M. floribunda, ‘Cluj II- 1 - 2 ’ x M. floribunda, M. zumi x ‘Reinette Baumann’, M. coronaria x ‘Reinette Baumann’. No {{significant differences were found}} between the mean of marks for tree vigour in the group of combinations in which the Malus species were used as maternal genitors (5. 18) and paternal genitors (5. 20). The coefficient of variability ranged in the experiment between 2. 6 % and 27. 4 %; in ten families a lower variability for seedlings vigour (under 10 %) was identified, in 13 a medium one (between 10 - 20 %) and in two a large one (more than 20 %). Even if in some combinations the variability of tree vigour was not very large, there seems to be fair possibilities to identify by selection the seedlings with a desired vigour in each family...|$|E
40|$|Apple scab, {{caused by}} the ascomycete Venturia inaequalis (Cooke) G. Wint., is the most {{detrimental}} disease of cultivated apple (Malus x domestica) worldwide, causing severe reductions in fruit quality and yield. In case of insufficient control of apple scab, the economic losses can increase up to 70 % of the production value (Gupta, 1992). The main strategy used for scab control is still the frequent application of fungicides throughout the season. However, selection pressure {{has resulted in the}} evolution of fungicide-resistant strains of scab that represent a threat to the industry. Therefore, all major Western breeding programs currently view the selection of disease-resistant cultivars as a priority. Most of today's scab-resistant cultivars rely on the introduction of a single gene for scab resistance from the <b>ornamental</b> <b>apple</b> Malus floribunda 821, referred to as Rvi 6 (Vf) resistance. However, Rvi 6 resistance has been overcome by new pathotypes of V. inaequalis. This has aroused interest in other major resistance genes, in polygenically controlled resistance, effected by several minor resistance genes, and in pyramiding of different sources of resistance, to confer more durable resistance. However, there is still a lack of fundamental knowledge on the apple  V. inaequalis interaction with regard to the resistance mechanism. Even the mechanism of action of Rvi 6 resistance is still largely unknown. These insights are essential for the development and application of new markers in breeding programs, and thus for the development of new resistant cultivars and for attaining durable resistance. Therefore, the aim of the research presented in this thesis was to gain a better insight in these resistance and defense mechanisms of apple against V. inaequalis. To this end, a high-throughput proteomics technology, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE), was applied. First, we needed to fine-tune some experimental conditions and procedures. The scab infection procedure was optimized and a monogenic Rvi 6 /Vf-resistant cultivar (Topaz), a polygenic resistant cultivar (Discovery) and a scab race 1 susceptible cultivar (Golden Delicious) were chosen for further research. The 2 -DE conditions, including protein extraction, first and second dimension separation, and protein visualization, also needed optimization. To optimize the resolution of the protein separation, we decided to use 24 cm IPG strips of pH-range 4 - 7 for the first dimension separation of the proteins extracted from the complete cells of the apple leaves. To visualize the proteins, they were CyDyeTM labeled prior to a two-dimensional difference-in-gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) in most experiments. To study plant-fungus interactions for resistance breeding purposes, early and accurate detection and quantification of the plant pathogen is often required for proper evaluation of fungal virulence and host resistance. So far, the evaluation of scab resistance in apple was mainly based on artificial inoculation and a disease rating that takes into account foliar chlorosis, necrosis and sporulation symptoms (Chevalier et al., 1991). However, this method does not provide an accurate measurement of the degree of infection and cannot detect early fungal development in symptomless leaves. Therefore, we developed a real-time PCR assay that amplifies the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS 2) region of the 5. 8 S rRNA gene of Venturia spp. only. Results were compared with the classical phenotypic disease rating scores and the assay proved to be a fast, sensitive and objective method to monitor fungal growth and to evaluate host resistance. Further, we compared the proteomes of the V. inaequalis inoculated, mock-inoculated and control leaves of the Rvi 6 -resistant cultivar Topaz. At 2 and 3 days post-inoculation (dpi), differences appeared not to be present yet, were less distinct, or at most comparable to 5 dpi. At 5 dpi the V. inaequalis inoculated leaves showed an up-regulation of proteins mainly known to be involved in stress responses (34 %) and/or in catabolism (glycolysis and TCA pathway; 24 %). On the other hand, 60 % of the down-regulated proteins were involved in anabolic processes, i. e. in carbon fixation (both light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis and light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle; 40 %) and in gluconeogenesis (20 %). Besides, we detected different isoforms of proteins involved in some of these pathways that were differentially accumulated. In summary, the energy metabolism of the Rvi 6 -resistant Topaz leaves was altered upon infection. When comparing the protein profiles of Topaz and the susceptible cultivar Golden Delicious, we could identify the same (categories of) proteins that were differentially accumulated exsclusively after infection. The established response of Topaz seemed less explicit in Golden Delicious, which could explain the differences in susceptibility of both cultivars. Finally, the responses upon infection of the monogenic resistant cultivar Topaz with and without preceding treatment with fosetyl-Al (Aliette®) were compared. This preventative, systemic fungicide caused a reduction in foliar disease symptoms and in hyphal growth as measured by real-time PCR. The effect of Aliette® was more clear using the real-time PCR technique as compared to the phenotypic disease rating score. When we analyzed the 2 -DE protein profiles of Aliette®-treated Topaz leaves, we could verify that fosetyl-Al intensifies the apple response upon scab infection that was already observed in the prior experiment (i. e. up- and down-regulation of the same (catgeories of) proteins in the Aliette®-treated leaves compared to the non-treated leaves). Interestingly, the observed Aliette®-induced reduction in degree of infection was notably less distinct in the scab-susceptible cultivar Golden Delicious (~ 20 % compared to ~ 60 % in Topaz). This suggests that, for cultivating purposes, it seems useful to combine the use of (monogenic) resistance sources with the application of systemic fungicides such as Aliette®. In summary, we can state that the use of the 2 D-DIGE technology and our developed Venturia specific real-time PCR protocol delivered some interesting insights in the response of apple upon V. inaequalis infection and allowed us to formulate several new working hypotheses, such as:· the infection-induced up-regulation of proteins involved in catabolic pathways such as glycolysis and TCA cycle in order to provide an extra energy supply necessary for stress response;· the infection-induced down-regulation of proteins involved in the anabolic carbon fixation pathways, i. e. photosynthesis and Calvin cycle;· the infection-induced down-regulation of ROS scavenging mechanisms in a monogenic resistant cultivar compared to a susceptible cultivar;· the similarity in cellular responses to different stresses, including abiotic stresses (such as mock-infection) and biotic stresses (such as fungal infection), and the hypothesis that plant acclimation to different stresses is controlled by sophisticated quantitative rather than qualitative effects;· the hypothesis that the differences in the changes in accumulation of proteins (involved in primary metabolism as well as defense response) between compatible and incompatible interactions are rather quantitative than qualitative. Further research is needed to validate these hypotheses and to determine whether interfering with the involved proteins and pathways could represent a strategy for developing new resistant cultivars and for attaining durable resistance. status: publishe...|$|E
