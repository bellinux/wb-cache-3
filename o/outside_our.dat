5|$|In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, the {{prevailing}} view still {{was that the}} Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked eye}} from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E

25|$|PSR B1257+12 was {{discovered}} by the Polish astronomer Aleksander Wolszczan on 9 February 1990 using the Arecibo radio telescope. It is a millisecond pulsar, a kind of neutron star, with a rotation period of 6.22 milliseconds (9,650rpm), and {{was found to have}} anomalies in the pulsation period, which led to investigations as to the cause of the irregular pulses. In 1992 Wolszczan and Dale Frail published a famous paper on the first confirmed discovery of planets <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> solar system. Using refined methods one more planet was found orbiting this pulsar in 1994.|$|E
25|$|When Penzias and Wilson {{reduced their}} data {{they found a}} low, steady, mysterious noise that persisted in their receiver. This {{residual}} noise was 100 times more intense than they had expected, was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. They were certain that the radiation they detected on a wavelength of 7.35 centimeters {{did not come from}} the Earth, the Sun, or our galaxy. After thoroughly checking their equipment, removing some pigeons nesting in the antenna and cleaning out the accumulated droppings, the noise remained. Both concluded that this noise was coming from <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> own galaxy—although they were not aware of any radio source that would account for it.|$|E

Direct contact with reality cannot be made <b>outside</b> of <b>our</b> own minds; therefore, we cannot be sure reality even exists. This means that we are each limited to our own perceptual world and views. Solipsism is an extension of this which assumes that only one's own mind is sure to exist.|$|R

25|$|As we now know, {{the fixed}} stars are not fixed. Those that {{reside in the}} Milky Way turn with the galaxy, exhibiting proper motions. Those that are <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> galaxy (such as nebulae once mistaken to be stars) {{participate}} in their own motion as well, partly due to expansion of the universe, and partly due to peculiar velocities. The Andromeda galaxy is on collision course with the Milky Way at a speed of 117km/s. The concept of inertial frames of reference is no longer tied to either the fixed stars or to absolute space. Rather, the identification of an inertial frame {{is based upon the}} simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame. In particular, the absence of fictitious forces is their identifying property.|$|E
25|$|Recently, NASA has {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} 7 earth-like planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star 40 light-years away from our solar system. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has revealed the first known system of seven Earth-size planets around a single star. Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, {{the area around the}} parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to {{life as we know it}} – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.|$|E
25|$|The Earth and {{all living}} things on it are {{constantly}} bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an air shower of secondary radiation, including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies {{in different parts of}} the world based largely on the geomagnetic field and altitude. For example, the city of Denver in the United States (at 1650 meters elevation) receives a cosmic ray dose roughly twice that of a location at sea level. This radiation is much more intense in the upper troposphere, around 10km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for airline crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. During their flights airline crews typically get an extra dose on the order of 2.2mSv (220 mrem) per year.|$|E

25|$|Max Heindel {{divided the}} subtle body into: Vital Body made of Ether, our {{instrument}} for specializing the vital {{energy of the}} sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about {{an inch and a}} half outside the body; the Desire body, which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16inches <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> visible body, related to the Desire World; and the Mental body, which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold Soul. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.|$|E
25|$|More {{powerful}} {{gamma rays}} from very distant quasars and closer active galaxies {{are thought to}} have a gamma ray production source similar to a particle accelerator. High energy electrons produced by the quasar, and subjected to inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron radiation, or bremsstrahlung, are the likely source of the gamma rays from those objects. It is thought that as a supermassive black hole at the center of such galaxies provide the power source that intermittently destroys stars and focuses the resulting charged particles into beams that emerge from their rotational poles. When those beams interact with gas, dust, and lower energy photons they produce X-rays and gamma rays. These sources are known to fluctuate with durations of a few weeks, suggesting their relatively small size (less than a few light-weeks across). Such sources of gamma and X-rays are the most commonly visible high intensity sources <b>outside</b> <b>our</b> galaxy. They shine not in bursts (see illustration), but relatively continuously when viewed with gamma ray telescopes. The power of a typical quasar is about 1040 watts, a small fraction of which is gamma radiation. Much of the rest is emitted as electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including radio waves.|$|E
