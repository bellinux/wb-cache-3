5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast <b>of</b> <b>tone</b> on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation <b>of</b> <b>tone.</b> All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E

40|$|Social affects play an {{important}} role in the face-to-face interaction and are implied in the realization of speech acts. The prosody is a main vector of social affects and its crosslanguage variability is a challenge for language description as well as for foreign language teaching. The present paper aims at examining the influences <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> on the perception of 19 prosodic social affects of Mandarin Chinese by French and Vietnamese subjects. A corpus of attitudinal speech was designed with a variation <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> values and location. The test results show that most social affects were globally recognized over chance by the two groups of foreign-language subjects. For French subjects, “contempt”, “irony ” and “confidence”, and “irony ” for Vietnamese, were not identified – independently <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> distribution. A significant effect <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> for the two groups was found, with a higher magnitude for French than for Vietnamese.

5|$|Lilias Eveline Armstrong (29 September 1882– 9 December 1937) was an English phonetician. She {{worked at}} University College London, where she {{attained}} {{the rank of}} reader. Armstrong is most known for her work on English intonation {{as well as the}} phonetics and tone of Somali and Kikuyu. Her book on English intonation, written with Ida C. Ward, was in print for fifty years. Armstrong also provided some of the first detailed descriptions <b>of</b> <b>tone</b> in Somali and Kikuyu.|$|E
5|$|These symbols {{describe}} {{the features of}} a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of {{the sounds of a}} language, as well as the rhythm and intonation of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures <b>of</b> <b>tone</b> letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E

5|$|As Farmer's {{reputation}} grew, he {{expanded from}} bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He {{went on to}} join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing {{is known for its}} individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth <b>of</b> <b>tone</b> and sensitivity.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use <b>of</b> <b>tone.</b> This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's {{official}} romanization system. GR {{was used}} to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from {{a small number of}} trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to Pinyin and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern <b>of</b> <b>tone</b> spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of Shaanxi (shǎnxī, 陝西), which cannot be distinguished from Shanxi (shānxī, 山西) when written in pinyin without diacritics.|$|E

5|$|Shostakovich's {{works are}} broadly tonal {{and in the}} Romantic tradition, but with {{elements}} of atonality and chromaticism. In some of his later works (e.g., the Twelfth Quartet), he made use <b>of</b> <b>tone</b> rows. His output is dominated by his cycles of symphonies and string quartets, each totaling fifteen works. The symphonies are distributed fairly evenly throughout his career, while the quartets are concentrated towards the latter part. Among the most popular are the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies and the Eighth and Fifteenth Quartets. Other works include the operas Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, The Nose and the unfinished The Gamblers based on the comedy of Nikolai Gogol; six concertos (two each for piano, violin and cello); two piano trios; and a large quantity of film music.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} work to {{represent}} this new orthography was Elihu Doty's Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect, published in 1853. The manual {{can therefore be}} regarded as the first presentation of a pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details. From this point on various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system <b>of</b> <b>tone</b> marks from Doty's Manual survives intact in modern POJ. John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although it now seems that he was an early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.|$|E

40|$|The {{auditory}} system {{appears to}} begin listening to an input with a bias toward hearing the input {{as a single}} stream, but it gradually accumulates evidence {{over a period of}} seconds which may lead to the input's being split into sub-streams. Several seconds of silence or of unpatterned noise slowly remove the bias of the mechanism in favor of these streams. These effects were demonstrated in experiments in which young adult listeners sped up sequences <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> until they split. The sequences varied in the number <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> pack-aged between recurrent "separators " (periods of silence or of white noise) and in the lengths of these separators. If a sequence <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> different pitches is played rapidly enough, it seems to split perceptually into two or more concurrent substreams.

40|$|To date, the {{underlying}} cognitive and neural mechanisms of absolute pitch (AP) have remained elusive. In the present fMRI study, we investigated verbal and tonal perception and working memory in musicians {{with and without}} absolute pitch. Stimuli were sine wave tones and syllables (names <b>of</b> the scale <b>tones)</b> presented simultaneously. Participants listened to sequences of five stimuli, and then rehearsed internally either the syllables or the tones. Finally participants indicated whether a test stimulus had been presented during the sequence. For an auditory stroop task, half of the tonal sequences were congruent (frequencies <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> corresponded to syllables which were the names <b>of</b> the scale <b>tones)</b> and half were incongruent (frequencies <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> did not correspond to syllables). Results indicate that first, verbal and tonal perception overlap strongly in the left superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (STG/STS) in AP musicians only. Second, AP {{is associated with the}} categorical perception <b>of</b> <b>tones.</b> Third, the left STG/STS is activated in AP musicians only for the detection of verbal-tonal incongruencies in the auditory stroop task. Finally, verbal labelling <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> in AP musicians seems to be automatic. Overall, a unique feature of AP appears to be the similarity between verbal and tonal perception...|$|R
