5|$|It is {{considered}} that <b>overeating</b> {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E

500|$|Consequently, it {{is likely}} that Lambert's weight gain was caused not by a {{physical}} disorder but by a combination of <b>overeating</b> and a lack of exercise.

A biography of Lambert published during his lifetime recounted that [...] "it was within a year of this appointment that his bulk received the greatest and most rapid encrease".

For women, the average increase was [...] per day ( [...] in 1971 and [...] in 2004), while for men the average increase was [...] per day ( [...] in 1971 and [...] in 2004). Most of this extra food energy came from an increase in carbohydrate consumption rather than fat consumption. [...] The primary sources of these extra carbohydrates are sweetened beverages, which now account for almost 25 percent of daily food energy in young adults in America, and potato chips. [...] Consumption of sweetened drinks such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, iced tea, and energy and vitamin water drinks is believed to be contributing to the rising rates of obesity and to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency is related to diseases associated with obesity.|$|E

500|$|K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow state: [...] "An {{important}} vulnerability factor, therefore, for {{the abuse}} of psychiatry, is the subjective nature of the observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends." [...] The concerns about political abuse of psychiatry as a tactic of controlling dissent have been regularly voiced by American psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, and he mentioned that these authors, who correctly emphasized the value-laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and the subjective character of psychiatric classifications, failed to accept the role of psychiatric power. Musicologists, drama critics, art historians, and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications; however, lacking state-legitimated power over persons, their classifications do not lead to anyone's being deprived of property, liberty, or life. For instance, plastic surgeon's classification of beauty is subjective, but the plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without the patient's consent, therefore, there cannot be any political abuse of plastic surgery. The bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment. What transforms coercion into therapy are physicians diagnosing the person's condition a [...] "illness," [...] declaring the intervention they impose on the victim a [...] "treatment," [...] and legislators and judges legitimating these categorizations as [...] "illnesses" [...] and [...] "treatments." [...] In the same way, physician-eugenicists advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons {{as a form of}} treatment for both society and patient long before the Nazis came to power. Szasz argued that the spectacle of the Western psychiatrists loudly condemning Soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy. Psychiatric abuse, such as people usually associated with practices in the former USSR, was connected not with the misuse of psychiatric diagnoses, but with the political power built into the social role of the psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike. Psychiatrically and legally fit subjects for involuntary mental hospitalization had always been [...] "dissidents." [...] It is the contents and contours of dissent that has changed. Before the American Civil War, dissent was constituted by being a Negro and wanting to escape from slavery. In Soviet Russia, dissent was constituted by wanting to [...] "reform" [...] Marxism or emigrate to escape from it. As Szasz put it, [...] "the classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as Negroes was scientific, in the sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks. But that did not prevent the [...] "abuse" [...] of such racial classification, because (what we call) its abuse was, in fact, its use." [...] The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the [...] "Therapeutic State", a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed ("cured") through pseudomedical interventions. Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, <b>overeating,</b> smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.|$|E
