5|$|Unlike other railway companies, {{which were}} {{required}} to dispose <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> land, the Met was in a privileged position with clauses in its acts allowing it to retain such land that it believed was necessary for future railway use. Initially, the surplus land was managed by the Land Committee, made up of Met directors. In the 1880s, {{at the same time}} as the railway was extending beyond Swiss Cottage and building the workers' estate at Neasden, roads and sewers were built at Willesden Park Estate and the land was sold to builders. Similar developments followed at Cecil Park, near Pinner and, after the failure of the tower at Wembley, plots were sold at Wembley Park.|$|E
5|$|Between the Acts of Union in the mid-16th {{century and}} the English Civil War in the mid-17th century, a period of great {{rebuilding}} {{took place in the}} Kingdom of England, of which Wales was now annexed, and this is reflected in the structures that were built within the Rhondda Valley. The fluctuating economic state of the late Tudor period resulted in farmers taking in more land, creating higher levels <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> goods and therefore producing higher profits. This profit was reflected in the new farm houses built in the Rhondda {{and for the first time}} an emphasis on domestic comfort became apparent in the design of the dwellings. Many of the new farm buildings were simple structures consisting of two or three small rooms, though of a much sturdier and permanent quality than the Medieval platform houses. A popular style of building was the long-house, a building which combined the house and cowshed into a single building. By 1840, at least 160 farms existed in the Rhondda, but most were destroyed with the growth of the mining industry. Of the few surviving buildings, those of note include Tynewydd ('New House') in Blaenrhondda, a 17th-century house thought to have given its name to the neighbouring village of Tynewydd and Tyntyle in Ystrad dated around 1600.|$|E
5|$|From the 1880s the LNC began a more {{aggressive}} programme to maximise its income. The process for the sale <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> land was improved, resulting in increased income. The LNC redeveloped its lands at Hook Heath, Woking into housing and a golf course, creating a new suburb of Woking and providing a steady income from rentals. After an 1884 ruling that cremation was lawful in England the LNC also took advantage of its proximity to Woking Crematorium by providing transport for bodies and mourners on its railway line and after 1910 by interring ashes in a dedicated columbarium. The LNC also provided the land {{for a number of}} significant military cemeteries and memorials at Brookwood after both of the World Wars. In 1941 London Necropolis railway station, the LNC's London railway terminus, was badly damaged by bombing, and the London Necropolis Railway was abandoned.|$|E

30|$|Because {{the water}} {{flows into the}} upper reservoirs, there is less space to store the {{surpluses}} that arise on the German side of the system, which increases the number <b>of</b> <b>surpluses</b> in the inflow-scenarios. This indicates a potential conflict of electricity storage versus the storage of natural inflow. When all plants serve in peak load, this leads to an increase of 0.1 – 0.2 TWh <b>of</b> <b>surpluses</b> that remain within the German system on an annual basis. However, when the large upper reservoir of Veytaux serves in middle load (PPM-scenarios), the number <b>of</b> <b>surpluses</b> that remain un-stored increase stronger in the solar-scenario {{compared to the other}} IRES-scenarios (0.6 TWh versus 0). Thus, the conflict between pumping and natural inflow happens most often in the PPM+solar-scenario. This {{is the result of the}} increased pumping potential (allowed by lower water levels as explained in Section  3.1) combined with the clustering of both the surplus- as well as the inflow peak during the summer months.|$|R
5|$|Many of Gibraltar's fortifications {{were already}} {{redundant}} {{well before the}} British garrison was withdrawn from the territory in the 1990s, and the rapid military rundown in the 1980s and the 1990s left the civilian authorities with a large amount <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> military property. Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; {{all three of the}} 5.25-inch guns at Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it {{the only place in the}} world where a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch guns at Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917. At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction with the Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|No.5 SFTS {{reached a}} {{strength}} of some 2,000 personnel during the war, and graduated 1,515 pilots. The rate of flying {{conducted at the}} school declined during 1945 and, by November, its aircraft were being readied for storage. In February 1946, No.5 SFTS was disbanded and its staff and equipment used to re-establish No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS), which had operated during the war as No.1 Service Flying Training School prior to disbanding in 1944. No.1 FTS was allocated 55 Wirraways, two de Havilland Tiger Moths, and one Avro Anson, though in the event it undertook little flying before relocating to Point Cook in August 1947. Post-war demobilisation saw the establishment of several RAAF Care and Maintenance Units (CMU), which {{were responsible for the}} upkeep <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> equipment prior to disposal. No.5 SFTS spawned Care and Maintenance Unit Uranquinty to look after aircraft stored at the base. These were auctioned off in November 1948, and CMU Uranquinty was dissolved the next month.|$|E
5|$|No.1 EFTS {{relocated}} to Tamworth, New South Wales, during 17–28May 1944, reportedly {{to allow for}} the expansion of civil aviation at Parafield. Training units in New South Wales came under the control of No.2 (Training) Group. On 10September, a student was killed when his Tiger Moth crashed south of Tamworth aerodrome. All flying training at No.1 EFTS came to an end on 15September, by which time a total of 1,991 students had passed through the school. Pilots still undergoing instruction were posted to No.8 Elementary Flying School at Narrendera, New South Wales, and No.11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla, Victoria. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe. Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been built up in the UK early in 1944 prior to the invasion of Normandy, but lower-than-anticipated casualties had resulted in an over-supply that by 30June numbered 3,000 Australians. No.1 EFTS was officially disbanded on 12December 1944. Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Tamworth was formed the same day, utilising some of No.1 EFTS's staff. It was one of many CMUs that the RAAF raised for the storage and upkeep <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> aircraft prior to their disposal after the war. CMU Tamworth was disbanded on 5July 1947.|$|E

5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> American agricultural products to France.|$|E

We will first perform an empirical analysis on a large sample of U. S. companies between 2005 and 2010. This analysis compares the performance in terms of valuation errors of different accounting-based valuation methods (RIVM, AEGM and P/E) between two groups, with low and high level <b>of</b> dirty <b>surplus</b> flows. The study will show that P/E as the best accounting-based valuation method and it is independent <b>of</b> dirty <b>surplus</b> flows presence, while, RIVM was the second-best valuation method, followed by AEGM. The influence <b>of</b> dirty <b>surplus</b> flows is found in both RIVM and AEGM models.
