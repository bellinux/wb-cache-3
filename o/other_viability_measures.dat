40|$|Marine sediments harbour {{vast and}} diverse prokaryotic communities. With ongoing burial and ageing of {{respective}} sediment layers, however, available organic matter becomes more recalcitrant. Thus, sedimentary microorganisms face starvation and ultimately death. Nonetheless, live and active cells {{are present in}} old and deeply buried sediments, up to 111 Ma (Roussel et al., 2008). During IODP Leg 307 an organic-matter poor, cold-water, buried coral carbonate mound was sampled. Nineteen isolates, mainly Proteobacteria, {{were obtained from the}} mound and surrounding sediments. Additionally, one putative new species belonging to the genus Ornithinimicrobium (Actinobacteria) was isolated. Strains were subsequently phylogenetically and phenotypically characterised. Selected isolates and other sedimentary bacteria were subsequently subjected to anaerobic starvation-survival experiments and their responses to substrate limitation were compared to those of near-surface relatives. All strains survived long periods of starvation (incubated up to 3 years). This was confirmed by constant total cell counts and only slowly increasing proportions of dead cells (20 % after one year). Culturability and FISH detectability decreased with time but radiotracer experiments conducted after starvation confirmed viability and potential metabolic activity of many strains. No significant correlations between FISH detectability and <b>other</b> <b>viability</b> <b>measures</b> occurred. Instead starvation time was significantly positively correlated with percentages of dead cells and inversely with culturability. Pure culture starvation experiments were complemented by a study on an estuarine, surface-sediment microbial community, which was stressed in sediment slurry sequential heating experiments. This mimicked burial and resulted in decreasing total counts, culturability, and FISH detcctability but these were still present even after heating to 90 °C. Temperatures above 42 °C were significantly correlated with the reduction of total cells and FISH detectability This project showed that marine sedimentary microbes maintain high levels of viability and culturability during long-term anaerobic starvation and during sequential heating to mimic burial {{this is consistent with the}} large cell population in sub-seafloor sediments.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years many {{waterborne}} outbreaks related to Cryptosporidium have been described. Current methods for detection of Cryptosporidium in water for the most part rely on viability assays which are not informative concerning the infectivity of oocysts. However, for estimation of the risk of infection with Cryptosporidium this information is required. For environmental samples the oocyst counts are often low, and the oocysts have been exposed to unfavorable conditions. Therefore, determination of the infectivity of environmental oocysts requires an assay {{with a high level of}} sensitivity. We evaluated the applicability of in vitro cell culture immunofluorescence assays with HCT- 8 and Caco- 2 cells for determination of oocyst infectivity in naturally contaminated water samples. Cell culture assays were compared with <b>other</b> <b>viability</b> and infectivity assays. Experiments with Cryptosporidium oocysts from different sources revealed that there was considerable variability in infectivity, which was illustrated by variable 50 % infective doses, which ranged from 40 to 614 oocysts, and the results indicated that not only relatively large numbers of fresh oocysts but also aged oocysts produced infection in cell cultures. Fifteen Dutch surface water samples were tested, and the cell culture immunofluorescence assays were not capable of determining the infectivity for the low numbers of naturally occurring Cryptosporidium oocysts present in the samples. A comparison with <b>other</b> <b>viability</b> assays, such as the vital dye exclusion assay, demonstrated that surrogate methods overestimate the number of infectious oocysts and therefore the risk of infection with Cryptosporidium.

The distribution of the percentage of live sperm showed considerable inter- and intraspecific variation, suggesting that, all else being equal, males will vary in their ability to fertilize ova on the basis of sperm viability alone.
