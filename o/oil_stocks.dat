2500|$|Germany lacked natural {{supplies}} of several key raw materials needed {{for economic and}} military operations. [...] German planners in mid-1939 determined that the nation possessed only two to three months' supply of rubber stocks and {{three to six months}} of <b>oil</b> <b>stocks.</b> They estimated that, after a planned German attack on Poland and the expected subsequent allied naval blockade, the Soviet Union would become the only potential supplier for many key raw materials needed for a war.|$|E
2500|$|In August, as Germany {{planned to}} invade Poland and {{prepared}} for an eventual war with France, German war planners estimated that, with an expected British naval blockade, if the Soviet Union became hostile, Germany would fall short of its war mobilization requirements by 9.9 million tons of oil and 260,000 tons of manganese. At that time, Germany possessed only {{two to three months}} of rubber stocks and three to six months of <b>oil</b> <b>stocks.</b> [...] Because of the expected naval blockade, the Soviet Union would become the only potential supplier for many items.|$|E
2500|$|The British Chiefs of Staff {{produced}} {{a report in}} September 1940 predicting a possible exhaustion of German <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> by June 1941. [...] They believed that Germany could only improve its position by defeating Britain or by driving the Royal Navy from the Eastern Mediterranean so that Germany could import Soviet and Romanian oil supplies by sea. [...] An American spy then viewed a December German report detailing {{the need for an}} invasion of the Soviet Union because of projected mid-1941 shortages of heavy metals and other supplies.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of German natural resources, [...] German {{planners}} in May 1939 feared that a cessation of Swedish trade would cut key iron ore supplies. [...] In addition, were Russian supplies cut off, German planners estimated that they would need to find substitutes for approximately 165,000 tons of manganese and almost 2 million tons of oil per year. [...] Germany already faced severe rubber shortages because of British and Dutch refusals to trade with Germany. On May 8, German officials produced new planning figures estimating that Germany possessed <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> totaling only 3.1 months of usage.|$|E
2500|$|In January, Germany became {{worried that}} combating a {{potential}} major French campaign in western Europe or a Soviet failure to deliver allotted good totals {{would result in}} German <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> evaporating in a few months. Grain reserves that had earlier appeared less tenuous now appeared more dicey, with Germany facing an estimated 1.6 million ton shortfall for 1940 even under optimal conditions. [...] A German foreign office report explained that Soviet raw material exports were [...] "simply irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "the breakdown of a German-Soviet agreement must be avoided at all costs." [...] The Soviets made clear in additional discussions with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that {{they were willing to}} make raw materials available on an accelerated basis in exchange for extended deliveries of war materiel.|$|E
2500|$|Without Soviet goods, from 1942 {{to the end}} of the war, German war {{efforts were}} {{severely}} hampered with Germany barely managing to scrape together enough reserves for a few more major offensives. [...] In terms of supplies, oil was the main obstacle, with shortages in some places by the end of 1941 and forcing Germany to turn south to attempt to invade the oil-rich Caucuses in 1942. The Reich was forced to exist on a hand-to-mouth basis for oil, and the almost non-existent <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> completely disappeared by mid-1944 with the Allied bombers concentration on German synthetic fuel plants. [...] For example, most German war aircraft sat idle, and air training for new pilots was cut to a mere one hour per week.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of the forces that drive <b>oil</b> <b>stock</b> prices is extremely important given {{the size of the}} Oil &Gas industry and its links with the energy sector and the environment. In the next decade oil companies {{will have to deal with}} international policies to contrast climate change. This issue is likely to affect companies shareholder values. In this paper we focus on the long-run financial determinants of the stock prices of six major oil companies (Bp, Chevron-Texaco, Eni, Exxon-Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total-Fina-Elf) using multivariate cointegration techniques and vector error correction models. Weekly <b>oil</b> <b>stock</b> prices are analyzed together with the relevant stock market indexes, exchange rates, spot and future oil prices over the period January 1998 April 2003. The empirical results confirm the statistical significance of the major financial variables in explaining the long-run dynamics of <b>oil</b> companies <b>stock</b> values...|$|R

40|$|We fully {{characterize}} the optimal time paths {{of production and}} water usage by an agricultural and an oil sector that share a limited water resource. We show that for any given water <b>stock,</b> if the <b>oil</b> <b>stock</b> is sufficiently large, it will become optimal to have a phase during which the agricultural sector is inactive, followed by a phase during which both sectors are active again. The agricultural sector will always be active in the end as the <b>oil</b> <b>stock</b> is depleted. If agriculture is not constrained by the given natural inflow of water, then oil extraction will always end with a phase during which oil production follows a pure Hotelling path. Otherwise, oil production never follows a pure Hotelling path, because its full marginal cost must always reflect not only the imputed rent on the finite <b>oil</b> <b>stock,</b> but also the positive opportunity cost of water usage. The case of oil and agriculture sharing a water resource is but one example. Our analysis provides a framework to generalize the Hotelling rule to other cases where the full marginal opportunity cost of extracting a nonrenewable resource depends on the endogenous activity of some other sector of the economy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.
