50|$|The {{most common}} {{biological}} control of codling moth is {{the application of}} codling moth granulosis virus (CMGV) in a water based formulation including the granulosis virus, <b>Occlusion</b> <b>Bodies</b> (<b>OBs).</b> CMGV occurs naturally in all major pome fruit growing regions around the world. CMGV is widely used in the commercial and organically grown orchards of Europe and North America. A widely used brand is Virosoft CP4. CP4 is the region of Quebec where the CP4 strain was originally isolated. The CMGV is applied at initiation of egg hatch. The codling moth larvae consume the OB. Next the OB is degraded by the alkaline gut of the codling moth larvae. Then the virus infests the gut membrane linings and reproduces within the larvae. The larvae then stop feeding and eventually die within 3-7 days.|$|E

The Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) occlusion-derived virus (ODV) protein P 74 {{is part of}} a complex of essential peroral infectivity factors (PIFs).

P 74 cleavage was not observed in OBs produced in three different insect cell lines, suggesting a larval host origin of the responsible protease. P 74 in OBs produced in larvae of two different host species was cleaved into fragments with the same apparent molecular mass, indicating that the virus incorporates a similar alkaline protease from different hosts. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the two P 74 subunit fragments remain associated with the recently discovered PIF complex.

Increasing <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> (<b>OB)</b> yields per cell in culture is the main challenge to enable commercialization of in vitro production of baculovirus pesticides. Isolating clones from a heterogeneous cell population may allow development of a high virus producing cell clone. To date, the selection of insect clones has been based mainly on laborious cell serial dilution methods which create few viable clones. This work used an automated robotic clone picking system to establish over 250 insect clones of a Helicoverpa zea cell population to be screened for virus production. However, the higher producing clones only produced 10 - 30 % higher OB yields than the original cell population. This study suggested that unless screening of thousands of clones is performed, obtaining a 2 -fold increase in OB/cell yield compared to the parent population is unlikely. Nevertheless, it creates pure clones for manufacturing. In addition, two clones that were at least 2 - 3 times different in OB yields were isolated. Hence, this method can create a high contrast system (OB/cell yield basis), for comparative studies using a systems biology approach, which should inform a more targeted approach to engineer genetically a production cell line.

In this thesis the protein structure of ODVs and their entry into microvillar cells were studied {{from the perspective of}} protein-protein interactions. A number a novel interactions were identified among ODV structural proteins shedding light on the spatial and temporal mechanism of ODV assembly. Furthermore, a group of highly conserved viral per os infectivity factors (PIF) was shown to form a complex on the ODV envelope. These PIF proteins are essential for oral infectivity of ODVs and the complex may play a pivotal role in binding and fusion of ODV with the microvillar membrane. It was further found that in the OB structure a host derived alkaline protease was tightly associated with ODVs and cleaved one of the PIF proteins (P 74). Proteolytic processing of PIF proteins may be necessary to trigger conformational changes in the complex to facilitate its function in binding and fusion with the host cell membrane.

By contrast, insects that consumed multiple OBs experienced higher mortality and infection frequencies did not differ significantly from those of the non-associated model. Inoculation with genotypically complex wild-type OBs indicated that genotypes tend to be transmitted in association, rather than as independent entities, irrespective of dose. To examine the hypothesis that virions may themselves be genotypically heterogeneous, cell culture plaques derived from individual virions were analysed to reveal that one-third of virions was of mixed genotype, irrespective of the genotypic composition of the OBs. We conclude that co-occlusion of genotypically distinct virions in each OB is an adaptive mechanism that favours the maintenance of virus diversity during insect-to-insect transmission...|$|E
40|$|Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) often play {{important}} roles in virus infection. To explore intracellular signaling pathways induced by baculovirus infection, we examined the involvement of MAPKs in Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection of BmN cells. We found that specific inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) significantly reduced <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> (<b>OB)</b> formation and budded virus (BV) production. Next, we quantified OB and BV production after applying the inhibitors at different times postinfection (p. i.). The inhibitors significantly reduced OB and BV production to various extents when applied at 12 h p. i., indicating that the reduction of BmNPV infectivity by these inhibitors occurs at the late stage of infection. Also, we observed that these inhibitors markedly repressed or deregulated the expression of delayed early, late, and very late gene products. Western blot analysis using phospho-MAPK-specific antibodies showed that ERK and JNK were activated at the late stage of BmNPV infection. In addition, the magnitude and pattern of MAPK activation were dependent on the multiplicity of infection. To verify {{the effects of the}} inhibitors on BmNPV infection, we also attempted to knock down the B. mori genes BmErk and BmJnk, which encode ERK and JNK, respectively. Knockdown of BmErk and BmJnk resulted in the reduced production of OBs and BVs, confirming that BmERK and BmJNK are involved in the BmNPV infection process. Taken together, these results indicate that the activation of MAPK signaling pathways is required for efficient infection by BmNPV...|$|R
40|$|Fast-acting {{recombinant}} baculoviruses {{have potential}} for improved insect pest suppression. However, the ecological impact of using such viruses {{must be given}} careful consideration. One strategy for mitigating risks might be simultaneous release of a wild-type baculovirus, so as to facilitate rapid displacement of the recombinant baculovirus by a wild-type. However, at what ratio must the two baculoviruses be released? An optimum release ratio must ensure both fast action, and the eventual competitive displacement of the recombinant virus and fixation of the wild-type baculovirus in the insect population. Here we challenged Trichoplusia ni larvae with different ratios of wild-type Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and a derived recombinant, vEGTDEL, which has the endogenous egt gene (coding for ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase) deleted. Time to death increased with the proportion wild-type virus in the inoculum mixture, although a 1 : 10 ratio (wild-type: recombinant) resulted in equally rapid insecticidal action as vEGTDEL alone. Five serial passages of three different <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> (<b>OB)</b> mixtures of the two viruses were also performed. OBs from 10 larval cadavers were pooled and used to initiate the following passage. Although the wild-type baculovirus was maintained over five passages, it {{did not go to}} fixation in most replicates of the serial passage experiment (SPE), and there was no good evidence for selection against the recombinant. Long-term maintenance of a recombinant in serial passage suggests an ecosystem safety risk. We conclude that for assessing ecological impact of recombinant viruses, SPEs in single and multiple larvae are relevant because of potential modulating effects at the between-host level...|$|R

When mixed with viral <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> (<b>OB)</b> 1 % Tinopal LPW significantly reduced the median lethal dose (LD 50) of the virus in all instars compared with insects treated with SeMNPV alone. Levels of enhancement, as determined by LD 50 values, ranged from 2. 6 - to 580 -fold, depending on the instar. The greatest enhancement occurred on the two later instars, L 4 (70 -fold) and L 5 (580 -fold), which show a much higher resistance to SeMNPV infection than earlier instars. The median time to death (MTD) values {{were not significantly different}} in any instar among larvae treated with SeMNPV + Tinopal LPW and those treated with SeMNPV alone. Larval development in SeMNPV + Tinopal LPW treated larvae was retarded, in second and fourth instars, compared with controls or larvae treated with SeMNPV alone. The OB yields from SeMNPV treated larvae were almost 1. 6 -fold greater in second instars (9. 3 x 10 (6) OBs/larvae), and 1. 9 -fold greater in fourth instars (1. 9 x 10 (8) OBs/larvae), than those obtained in larvae treated with SeMNPV + Tinopal LPW. The addition of 1 % Tinopal LPW to the virus suspension did not alter the genotypic composition of viral progeny during four successive passages of the viru...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Anticarsia gemmatalis is a pest in South America's soybean crops, {{which could}} be {{controlled}} by the Multinucleopolyhedrovirus of A. gemmatalis (AgMNPV). Currently, its commercial production is based on infected larvae. However, {{the possibility of using}} modified baculoviruses in Integrated Pest Management programs has stimulated an interest to develop alternative multiplication processes. This study evaluated the AgMNPV production in UFL-Ag- 286 cells previously deprived Fetal Bovine Serum. Results Culture media containing 1 % FBS during the previous 48 hours achieved a synchronized condition where 90 % of cells were found in G 0 /G 1 stage, showing the presence of non-filamentous actin. All characteristics were estimated from cellular viability tests, cell actin detection trials and flow cytometer cell cycle analysis. AgMNPV production was tested by transcript studies and budded viruses (BVs) and <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> (<b>OBs)</b> yield quantitation. Results showed that the productivity in FBS deprived cells was 9. 8 times more in BVs and 3. 8 times more in OBs with respect to non-treated cells. Conclusions UFL-Ag- 286 cells previously deprived in FBS shown to be a better host for AgMNPV propagation, increasing the useful for both in vitro bioinsecticide production and applications such as recombinant protein expression or gene delivery. </p...|$|E

The Sf 29 gene is a viral factor that determines the number of virions in <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> (<b>OBs).</b> The Sf 29 null bacmid virus was able to recover the Sf 29 gene during passage. After the third passage (P 3) of Sf 29 null bacmid OBs, the population was observed to reach an equilibrium involving a mixture of those with a kanamycin resistance cassette and those with the Sf 29 gene. The biological activity of Sf 29 null bacmid OBs at P 3 was similar to that of Sfbac OBs. The recovered gene in the Sf 29 null virus was 98 to 100 % homologous to the Sf 29 genes of different SfMNPV genotypes. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of uninoculated S. frugiperda larvae confirmed the expression of the SfMNPV ie- 0 and Sf 29 genes, indicating that the insect colony harbors a covert SfMNPV infection. Additionally, the nonessential bacterial artificial chromosome vector was spontaneously deleted from both viral genomes upon passage in insects...|$|E
40|$|The insecticidal {{characteristics}} of two Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) strains produced {{on two different}} S. exigua colonies were measured using the same two host colonies. These strains constitute the active ingredients of the biological insecticides Vir-ex and Spexit and were produced on insect colonies from Spain and Switzerland. Demographic {{characteristics of}} insects from each colony were examined before infection. Larval developmental time, larval survival, and adult sex ratio did not differ between the colonies, whereas mean pupal weight was significantly higher in the Spanish colony insects. After infection, susceptibility to virus <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> (<b>OBs),</b> time to death, larval weight at death, and total production of OBs/larva varied significantly depending on virus strain and the colony used. Vir-ex OBs produced in Spanish colony larvae had improved insecticidal characteristics in terms in lethal dose and speed of kill metrics than other strain-colony combinations. OB production was significantly higher in Spanish colony insects infected with Spexit compared with Vir-ex infected insects from the Swiss colony, with intermediate values for the other two strain-colony combinations. Virus strain and host colony origin were highly influential in determining the insecticidal characteristics of OBs and {{should be considered as}} key parameters that require optimization during the production of SeMNPV-based insecticides. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is {{an insect}} that causes damage {{in a wide}} range of crops in Spain. Seven {{isolates}} of H. armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearSNPV) from the Iberian Peninsula were subjected to molecular and biological characterization and compared with a Chinese genotype (HearSNPV-G 4). RESULTS: The estimated sizes of the Iberian genomes varied between 116. 2 and 132. 4 kb, compared to 131. 4 kb of the HearSNPV-G 4 reference genome. Phylogenetic analysis based on the lef- 8, lef- 9 and polh genes revealed that the Iberian strains were more closely related to one another than to other HearSNPV isolates. <b>Occlusion</b> <b>body</b> (<b>OB)</b> concentration-mortality responses (LC 50 values) did not differ significantly among Iberian isolates when tested against a Helicoverpa armigera colony from Oxford (UK). Despite being the fastest killing isolate, HearSNPV-SP 1 was as productive as isolates with lower virulence, with an average yield of 3. 1 ¿×¿ 109 OBs larva- 1. OBs of HearSNPV-SP 1 and HearSNPV-G 4 were similarly pathogenic against a recently established colony from southern Spain, although HearSNPV-SP 1 was faster killing than HearSNPV-G 4 against a range of instars. CONCLUSION: The insecticidal properties of HearSNPV-SP 1 mean that this strain is likely to prove useful as the basis for a biological insecticide for control of Helicoverpa armigera in Spain.

The Final Meeting of COST 862 Action: Bacterial Toxins for Insect Control. The {{prevalence}} of sublethal infections of Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) was quantified in natural populations of S. exigua in Almeria, Spain, during 2006 and 2007. Of 1045 adults collected, 16 % proved positive for viral polyhedrin gene transcripts by RT-PCR. The {{prevalence of}} covert infection varied significantly according to sex and sample date. Of 1660 progeny of field-collected insects, lethal disease {{was observed in}} 10 - 33 % of offspring of transcript-positive females and 9 - 49 % of offspring of transcript-negative females. Isolates associated with vertically-transmitted infections were characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis using BglII and compared with isolates believed to be horizontally-transmitted. Insects from a sublethally-infected Almerian colony were ~ 3. 4 -fold more susceptible to infection than healthy insects from a Swiss colony. Horizontally-transmitted isolates were significantly more pathogenic than vertically-transmitted isolates in insects from both colonies. Mean speed of kill varied between isolates by > 20 h, whereas mean <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> (<b>OB)</b> production varied by 3. 8 -fold among isolates. Intriguingly, all three horizontally transmitted isolates were very similar in speed of kill and OB production, whereas all three vertically transmitted isolates differed significantly from one another in both variables, and also differed significantly from the group of horizontally-transmitted isolates in one or both variables. We conclude that key pathogenicity and virulence traits of SeMNPV isolates vary according to their principal transmission strategy. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Lepidopteran nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) show {{distinct}} {{tissue tropism}} in host insect larvae. However, the molecular mecha-nism of this tropism is largely unknown. We quantitatively investigated NPV tissue tropism bymeasuring mRNA levels of viral genes in 16 tissues from Bombyx moriNPV (BmNPV) -infected B. mori larvae and found clear tissue tropism, i. e., BmNPV repli-cates poorly in the silk glands, midgut, andMalpighian tubule {{compared with other}} larval tissues. We next identified the viral genes determining tissue tropism in NPV infection by investigating the phenotypes of larvae infected with 44 BmNPVmutants in which one gene was functionally disrupted by a LacZ cassette insertion. We found that <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> (<b>OB)</b> production was markedly enhanced {{compared with that of}} the wild type in the middle silk glands (MSGs) of larvae infected with three mutants in which one of three tandemly arrayed genes (Bm 7, Bm 8, and Bm 9) was disrupted. We generated additional mutants in which one or two genes of this gene cluster were partially deleted and showed that Bm 8, also known as BV/ODV-E 26, was solely re-quired for the suppression of OB production in the MSGs of BmNPV-infected B. mori larvae. Western blotting showed that a LacZ cassette insertion in Bm 7 or Bm 9 resulted in aberrant expression of Bm 8, presumably leading to abnormal OB production in the MSGs. Larval bioassays also revealed that disruption of Bm 8 accelerated the death of B. mori larvae. These results suggest that the group I NPV-specific protein BV/ODV-E 26 determines tissue tropism and virulence in host lepidopteran insects.
