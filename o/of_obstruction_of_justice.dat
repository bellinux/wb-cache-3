5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty <b>of</b> <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> for {{shredding}} the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number}} of Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E

25|$|On July 2, 1871, a Hyōgo prefectural {{police officer}} brought a woman {{suspected}} of prostitution {{in to the}} station from within the foreign settlement. Once the investigation determined {{that she was a}} servant of the Englishman Mr. Walters, who lived within the settlement, she was released. However, Walters was angry over the affair, and on the next day, July 3, he trapped two police officers he believed to have been involved in her arrest within his estate. The case fell under consular jurisdiction and was judged by the English consul Abel Gower, who judged that the Japanese officers were unable to exercise police power in the settlement—not even to patrol it, let alone arrest anyone. Thus, Walters was not found guilty <b>of</b> <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> against the officers, but only of false imprisonment. This judgment clarified that only the settlement police, under the authority of the executive committee, was allowed to undertake police action in the settlement. Hyōgo Prefecture remained unable to exercise these powers in the settlement until its return in 1899.|$|E
