40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we present a}} {{solution}} for the problem of predicting the chemical and physical properties of paper from spectrometric data. We used a data set that consists of over 1000 samples of paper. For each sample 15 chemical and physical properties and its near-infrared spectra were measured. We used the following machine learning methods to predict the properties of paper: linear regression, pace regression, a nearest neighbor-based model, regression trees, a support vector machine, principal component regression, partial least squares regression, a multi-layer perceptron, and a radial basis function network. The prediction task {{turned out to be}} linear. Therefore, linear regression, principal component regression, and partial least squares regression gave the best results. Many outside factors affect the spectra and cause different types of interference. We used the following spectra preprocessing methods to remove the interference and improve the predictions: absorbance transformation, Kubelka-Munk transformation, multiplicative scatter correction, standard normal <b>variate</b> <b>transformation,</b> spectra derivation and orthogonal signal correction. We also investigated how preprocessing affects the machine learning methods. The results show that most preprocessing methods improve the models' predictions. The standard normal <b>variate</b> <b>transformation</b> and multiplicative scatter correction gave the best results. We tried to further improve the predictions with calibration. However, calibration did not improve the predictions...|$|R

The basic approach is due to Minh [13] who suggested a special sampling method for the gamma distribution. Its general objective is to rearrange the area below the density or histogram f(x) {{in the body of}} the distribution by certain point reflections such that variates may be generated efficiently within a large center interval. This is carried out via uniform hat functions combined with minorizing rectangles for immediate acceptance of one transformed uniform deviate.

Sequential images of the kidney are acquired using Dynamic ContrastEnhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging with contrast agent injection. A segmentation approach based upon principal component analysis (PCA) is used to separate out the cortex {{from the rest of}} the kidney including the medulla. the renal pelvic, and the background. Two classifiers (Soft independent Method of Class Analogy, SIMCA; Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, PLS-DA) are tested for various types of data pretreatment including segmentation, feature extraction, centering, autoscaling, standard normal <b>variate</b> <b>transformation,</b> Savitsky-Golay smoothing, and normalization. It is shown that (i) the renal cortex contains more discriminating information on kidney perfusion changes than the whole kidney, and (ii) the PLS-DA classifiers outperform the SIMCA classifiers.

40|$|The {{presence}} of polymeric packaging film in images of food products may modify spectra obtained in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) experiments, leading to undesirable image artefacts which may impede image classification.

The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the use of spectral pre-processing techniques to compensate for the presence of packaging film in hyperspectral images obtained in the visible–near infrared wavelength range (445 – 945 nm), with application in food quality assessment. A selection of commonly used pre-processing methods, used individually and in combination, were applied to hyperspectral images of flat homogeneous samples, imaged in the presence and absence of different packaging films (polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate). Effects of the selected pre-treatments on variation due to the film’s presence were examined in principal components score space. The results show that the combination of first derivative Savitzky–Golay followed by standard normal <b>variate</b> <b>transformation</b> was useful in reducing variations in spectral response caused by the presence of packaging film.

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare different discrimination and classification techniques to distinguish the two genera (. Mallotus and Phyllanthus) on the one hand, and the six species (. Mallotus apelta, Mallotus paniculatus, Phyllanthus emblica, Phyllanthus reticulatus, Phyllanthus urinaria L. and Phyllanthus amarus), on the other. Fingerprints of 36 samples from the 6 species were developed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (RP-HPLC-UV). After fingerprint data pretreatment, first an exploratory data analysis was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), revealing two outlying samples, which were excluded from the calibration set used to develop the discrimination and classification models. Models were built by means of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA). Application of the models on the total data set (outliers included) confirmed a possible labeling issue for the outliers. LDA, QDA and CART, independently of the pretreatment, or SIMCA after "normalization and column centering (N_CC) " or after "Standard Normal <b>Variate</b> <b>transformation</b> and column centering (SNV_CC) " were found best to discriminate the two genera, while LDA after column centering (CC), N_CC or SNV_CC; QDA after SNV_CC; and SIMCA after N_CC or after SNV_CC best distinguished between the 6 species.

The primary {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether bacterial phenotypic diversity could be characterized by FTIR spectroscopy analyses of cultures of S. aureus grown under variable sets of environmental conditions. Designing experiments with full factorial design has shown to be a powerful way to explore an expectedly large array of phenotypic diversity of S. aureus. Various combinations of environmental conditions caused the bacteria to adapt their phenotype, which was assessed via FTIR spectral fingerprinting. Transmission FTIR spectroscopy was found to be superior to other vibrational spectroscopy techniques for this purpose because of its high sensitivity, reproducibility, and rapidity of analysis. The sample preparation presented was fundamental for reproducible results. Different spectral preprocessing methods were compared in combination with scaling methods to obtain distinguishable phenotypes in principal component analysis (PCA) models. Spectral preprocessing with combined filters, including standard normal <b>variate</b> <b>transformation,</b> Savitzky-Golay smoothing, and use of the first derivative in a PCA model with unit variance scaling, gave the most optimal clustering for the data in this study. Spectra obtained from each treatment group were found to have a unique FTIR profile with good reproducibility, and thus PCA resulted in full separation between all groups on three principal components.

Purified egg white {{is an important}} ingredient {{in a number of}} baked and confectionary foods because of its foaming properties. However, yolk contamination in amounts as low as 0. 01 % can impede the foaming ability of egg white. In this study, we used Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the hypothesis that yolk contamination in egg white could be detected based on its molecular optical properties. Yolk contaminated egg white samples (n = 115) with contamination levels ranging from 0 % to 0. 25 % (on weight basis) were prepared. The samples were excited with a 785 nm laser and Raman spectra from 250 to 3, 200 cm(- 1) were recorded. The Raman spectra were baseline corrected using an optimized piecewise cubic interpolation on each spectrum and then normalized with a standard normal <b>variate</b> <b>transformation.</b> Samples were randomly divided into calibration (n = 77) and validation (n = 38) data sets. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was developed to predict yolk contamination levels, based on the Raman spectral fingerprint. Raman spectral peaks, in the spectral region of 1, 080 and 1, 666 cm(- 1), had the largest influence on detecting yolk contamination in egg white. The PLSR model was able to correctly predict yolk contamination levels with an R- 2 = 0. 90 in the validation data set.

Based on the different preprocessed spectral data, specific models {{for each type of}} plant feed material and a hybrid model for all the materials were built. Performances of specific model and hybrid model constructed with full spectrum (full spectrum model) and selected wavenumbers with VIP (variable importance in the projection) scores value bigger than 1. 00 (VIP scores model) were also compared. The best spectral preprocessing method for this study was found to be the standard normal <b>variate</b> <b>transformation</b> combined with the first derivative. For both full spectrum and VIP scores model, the prediction performance of the hybrid model was slightly worse than those of the specific models but was nevertheless satisfactory. Moreover, the VIP scores model obtained generally better performances than corresponding full spectrum model. Wavenumbers around 4500 cm- 1, 4664 cm- 1 and 4836 cm- 1 were found to be the key wavenumbers in modeling protein content in these plant feed materials. The values for the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and the relative prediction deviation (RPD) obtained with the VIP scores hybrid model were 1. 05 % and 2. 53 for corn DDGS, 0. 98 % and 4. 17 for corn germ meal, 0. 75 % and 6. 99 for corn gluten meal, 1. 54 % and 4. 59 for DDG, and 0. 90 % and 3. 33 for rapeseed meal, respectively.

The method given in [Atkinson, A. C., 1982. The simulation of generalized inverse Gaussian and hyperbolic random variables. SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing 3 (4), 502 - 515] is based on rejection method where some (uniform) random numbers from the sample are discarded. This feature makes it difficult {{to take advantage of the}} low discrepancy sequences which have important applications. In [Michael, J., Schucany, W., Haas, R., 1976. Generating random <b>variates</b> using <b>transformations</b> with multiple roots. The American Statistician 30 (2), 88 - 90], Michael etÂ al. give a method to generate random variables with inverse Gaussian distribution. In their method, two pseudorandom numbers uniformly distributed on (0, 1) are needed in order to generate one inverse Gaussian random variable. In this short paper, we present a new method, based on direct approximate inversion, to generate the inverse Gaussian random variables. In this method, only one pseudorandom number is needed in generating one inverse Gaussian random variate. This method enables us to make use of the better convergence of low discrepancy sequence than the pseudorandom sequence. Numerical results show the superiority of low discrepancy sequence than the pseudorandom sequence in simulating the mean of the inverse Gaussian distribution by using our sampling method. Further application of this method in exotic option pricing under the normal inverse Gaussian model is under investigation. ...|$|R
40|$|Pistacia atlantica {{belongs to}} the Anacardiaceae family, and {{originated}} from the Atlas mountains of north Africa, which has been employed in traditional medicine {{for the treatment of}} various diseases. There are many limitations regarding their activities. The bioactive compounds present in the extract of P. atlantica leaves are not well defined. For these identifications HPLC fingerprint methodology can be used. In the present study, 28 extracts were obtained from male and female leaves of P. atlantica, collected monthly during 6 months, in two different growing regions. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) values of P. atlantica extracts were determined using the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical method and the potassium ferricyanide (PFC) reduction method. The fingerprints were pre-treated using several techniques, such as column centering; normalization followed by column centering, and standard normal <b>variate</b> (SNV) <b>transformation</b> followed by column centering; each after initial alignment of the chromatographic profiles with Correlation Optimized Warping (COW). The multivariate calibration methods, Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures (O-PLS), were employed to model TAC. The regression coefficients of the best models were evaluated to indicate the peaks probably responsible for the antioxidant activity. The O-PLS model seems preferable because of its better predictive and describing abilities, and its good interpretability of the contribution of compound peaks to the TAC. Several peaks in the chromatograms were recognized as importantly contributing to the model due to their large regression coefficients. The structural elucidation of the relevant peaks was achieved by negative ionization LC-QTOF-MS. The phenolic compounds galloylquinic acid, quinic acid and gallic acid mainly seemed to be responsible for scavenging the DPPH radical, while glucogallin, trigalloylglucose, gallic acid and tetragalloylquinic acid were considered specifically important for the prediction of TAC determined by the PFC method.

40|$|Part One (Chapters 2 - 7) of {{the thesis}} {{illustrates}} mainly {{the use of}} auxiliary information in effecting certain transformations for improving the design/estimation strategies in sample surveys. A new product-type estimator which is complementary to the usual ratio estimator, in a certain sense, is proposed in Chapter 2. A transformation which permits {{the use of the}} product method in place of the more commonly used ratio method is discussed in the next chapter. One resulting convenience is that the bias and mean squared error of the estimator have closed form expressions, unlike that for the ratio estimator. Chapter 4 develops a change of origin for the study variate in order to improve the precision of the estimates under varying probability sampling. A change of origin under ratio method of estimation and a change of scale under the difference method are also examined. Raj (1965) has proposed a two-phase pps selection scheme in the absence of information on the auxiliary variate, but when information on some other variate is available. This also requires the knowledge of a certain parameter. Chapter 5 suggests an alternative two-phase procedure not requiring the knowledge of this parameter. Auxiliary variates in surveys are occasionally positive and negative valued. This introduces difficulties in ratio and product methods of estimation and in pps sampling. Chapter 6 outlines two simple methods of dealing with the situation: stratification by sign of the auxiliary <b>variate</b> and <b>transformation</b> by simple translation. For the purposes of illustration simple random sampling without replacement and probability proportional to size sampling with replacement are assumed. Finally, the scope for some future work is indicated in Chapter 7. Part Two (Chapters 8 - 9) of the thesis is a brief report on a sample survey conducted during 1980 - 81 to assess the transition of rural people to modern ways of life in the Karnataka State in South India.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} variations in bone density between 16 European populations, 13 of which were participants in the European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study (EVOS). Men and women aged 50 - 80 years were recruited randomly from local population registers, stratified in 5 -year age bands. The other three centres recruited similarly. Random samples of 20 - 100 % of EVOS subjects were invited for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) densitometry of the lumbar spine and/or proximal femur using Hologic, Lunar or Norland pencil beam machines or, in one centre, a Sopha fan-beam machine. Cross-calibration of the different machines was undertaken using the European Spine Phantom prototype (ESPp). Highly significant differences in mean bone density were demonstrated between centres, giving rise to between centre SDs in bone density that were about a quarter of a population SD. These differences persisted when centres using Hologic machines and centres using Lunar machines were considered separately. The centres were ranked differently according to whether male or female subjects were being considered and according to site of measurement (L 2 - 4, femoral neck or femoral trochanter). As expected, bone mineral density (BMD) had a curvilinear relationship with age, and apparent rates of decrease slowed as age advanced past 50 years in both sexes. In the spine, not only did male BMD usually appear to increase with age, but there was a highly significant difference between centres in the age effect in both sexes, suggesting a variability in the impact of osteoarthritis between centres. Weight was consistently positively associated with BMD, but the effects of height and armspan were less consistent. Logarithmic transformation was needed to normalize the regressions of BMD on the independent <b>variates,</b> and after <b>transformation,</b> all sites except the femoral neck in females showed significant increases in SD with age. Interestingly, the effect of increasing weight was to decrease dispersion in proximal femur measurements in both sexes, further accentuating the tendency in women for low body mass index to be associated with osteoporosis as defined by densitometry. It is concluded that there are major differences between BMD values in European population samples which, with variations in anthropometric variables, have the potential to contribute substantially to variations in rates of osteoporotic fracture risk in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Muscle {{foods such}} as meat are a perishable, nutritious, {{relatively}} expensive food commodity, {{a great source of}} human nutrition and are {{a large part of the}} New Zealand economy, as well as overseas. Currently, New Zealand’s meat producing companies measure meat quality attributes by using a different technology for every trait, with no overarching way to combine them, with many of the technologies requiring collection and destruction of the product. There is a desire by the meat industry to find a single way to measure and compare meat quality parameters in a single process or technology. The development of an in-line (within the normal production line of an abattoir or meat processor), real time, non-destructive quality control system could help define multiple meat traits in a way that can guarantee the product in terms of composition, safety and consistency. These guarantees not only help the producer to ask a higher premium for their product, but also give assurances to the consumer that they are getting exactly what they are expecting and paying for. This thesis focussed on determining whether the spectral imaging technologies of near infrared and hyperspectral imaging, and relevant pre-processing and modelling techniques were suitable for use in an in-plant situation for the prediction of lamb meat quality attributes. Data was collected on 2511 lambs from 10 separate kills. The lambs were slaughtered through three abattoirs owned by Alliance Group Limited with near infrared and hyperspectral imaging of intact M. Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle surface collected at 24 hours post-mortem. Traditional meat quality measurements were also collected; tenderness using a MIRINZ tenderometer, CIELab colour using a CR- 400 colour meter, ultimate pH using an Eutech Cyberscan pH 300 meter, marbling using subjective scoring by trained personnel and intramuscular fat content using gas chromatography – flame ionisation detector. The resulting data were split and used to generate calibration and validation data sets. The calibration data was used together with the spectral data that was processed using a variety of chemometric techniques including partial least squares, variable selection and neural networks to generate predictive models. The accuracy of the predictive models was then tested using the validation data set. 6 This work found that not all meat quality traits were able to be predicted accurately and certain techniques worked better for differing traits. The best predictive models for ultimate pH using the near infrared and hyperspectral data achieved R 2 values (a measure of goodness of fit) from the validation data sets of 0. 63 and 0. 48 respectively. For near infrared the best predictive models were achieved using partial least squares with pre-processing (standard normal <b>variate,</b> <b>orthogonal</b> signal correction and mean centring) applied, while for hyperspectral imaging neural networks provided the best model using a decay of 0. 00004 and a node size of 2. The best predictive models for intramuscular fat using the near infrared and hyperspectral data achieved R 2 values from the validation data sets of 0. 56 and 0. 75 respectively. For near infrared this was achieved using partial least squares with pre-processing (normalisation, multiplicative scatter correction and mean centring) applied, while for hyperspectral imaging neural networks provided the best model using a decay of 0. 0009 and a node size of 4. This performance of these two traits in particular, shows that that the prediction abilities are of a quality that future work on implementing these into an in-line system at a pilot scale should be considered. Overall, the use of novel modelling techniques such as neural networks showed potential to increase the predictive abilities of the resulting models, over more traditional modelling techniques. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the number of predictors needed to create a calibration model could be reduced, increasing the speed of analysis with only minimal loss in the accuracy of the resulting model. Results obtained during this study suggest that the calibration models are not abattoir dependent and the transfer of one calibration model to multiple abattoirs could decrease the costs and allow for faster development and implementation of an in-line, in-plant system...|$|R
