5|$|The first bus {{terminus}} {{built in}} Lam Tin {{was then called}} Lam Tin Bus Terminus, which is today's Tak Tin Bus Terminus. It is built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> of Lam Tin Hill, in the north part of Lam Tin Estate, to serve the neighbourhood's residents. Buses ran from Kwun Tong to the bus terminus through Lei Yue Mun Road, then turned left and ascended the hill along Kai Tin Road, Ping Tin Street, On Tin Street and Tak Tin Street.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} KPA defense {{halted the}} Marines who responded with artillery, raking Cloverleaf Hill. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided them so much success up to this point, failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority.|$|E

5|$|Many first-year {{students}} {{live in the}} Bishop Mountain Residences ("Upper Rez"), {{a series}} of concrete dormitories <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> of Mount Royal, consisting of McConnell Hall, Molson Hall, Gardner Hall, and Douglas Hall. McGill's largest residence is New Residence Hall ("New Rez"), a converted four-star hotel located a few blocks east of campus at Park Avenue and Prince Arthur. Solin Hall, located near Lionel-Groulx station, is McGill's second largest residence, housing roughly 300 students. Carrefour Sherbrooke Residence Hall was opened in 2009 on 475 Sherbrooke Street West, previously the Four Points Sheraton Hotel. In 2012, McGill opened La Citadelle, a converted hotel residence housing 286 students located on Sherbrooke Street West {{at the corner of}} Hutchinson.|$|E
5|$|On {{the crest}} of Sibidang-san, an antipersonnel {{minefield}} stopped the first North Korean infantry assault. More attacks followed in quick succession, {{all of which were}} repulsed by the US troops' superior firepower. By 02:30 the B Company riflemen were so depleted of ammunition that they began stripping machine-gun bullets from the ammunition belts and using them in their rifles. The 1st Platoon of C Company, {{at the base of the}} mountain behind B Company, climbed Sibidang-san in 45 minutes with an ammunition resupply for the company. Just before dawn the North Korean attack subsided. Daylight revealed a vast amount of abandoned North Korean equipment scattered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> just below the crest, including 33 machine-guns. Among the North Korean dead was the commanding officer of the NK 13th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The entire Lam Tin area {{is served}} by both tap water and {{flushing}} sea water supplies. The tap water is piped either from surface water or Dongjiang River into two service reservoirs and then pumped to individual households. The two service reservoirs that serve Lam Tin are Lam Tin Low Level Fresh Water Service Reservoir and Lam Tin High Level Service Reservoir. Built together with Lam Tin Estate, the low level reservoir {{is covered with a}} concrete-surfaced football field. The reservoir is now located between Kai Tin Estate and Tak Tin Estate. The high level reservoir, on the other hand, is farther away from residential estates. It is located near Lam Tin Park, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> of Black Hill.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientist}} Tolley {{aimed to}} establish the manpower needed to haul the vessels over the isthmus ridge. Assuming that a trireme soaked with water weighed 38 tons including its trolley, and that a man can exert a force of 300N {{over an extended period}} of time, the pulling teams—depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> and the surface of the cart track—must have numbered between 112 and 142 people, with a combined exertion of force of 33 to 42kN, or around 3.8 tons weight. Bringing the trolley up to speed may have required as many as 180 men. Assuming a speed of 2km per hour over an estimated length of 6kilometres, the transfer from sea to sea would have taken three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|By {{taking this}} new role, Rainilaiarivony {{became the first}} Hova to {{concurrently}} serve as both Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The sociopolitical transformation that had been triggered by the strangling of RadamaII reached its zenith with Rainilaiarivony's consolidation of administrative power. Rasoherina and her successors remained the figureheads of traditional authority, participated in political councils and provided official approval for policies. The Prime Minister issued new policies and laws in the Queen's name. However, the day-to-day governance, security and diplomatic activities of the kingdom principally originated with, and were managed by, Rainilaiarivony and his counselors. This new level of authority enabled the Prime Minister to amass a vast personal fortune, whether through inheritance, gifts or purchase, including 57 houses, large plantations and rice paddies, numerous cattle and thousands of slaves. The most prominent of Rainilaiarivony's properties was the Andafiavaratra Palace, constructed for him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> just below the royal Rova compound by English architect William Pool in 1873.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the 48th Battalion was the 47th Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Imlay, with its forward companies also strung out along the railway line. The total frontage of the 47th Battalion was , which meant that the 180–200 men of the forward companies were positioned in widely spaced posts. Between the two forward companies was a section of embankment near a level crossing which was not garrisoned, but was covered from a shallow cutting to the south and a low embankment to the north. The 47th Battalion's support line was also located on the hill some distance to the rear. The 12th Machine Gun Company was deployed with eight of its Vickers machine guns in each battalion area, mainly sited along the railway line. Leane and Imlay had their headquarters co-located on the summit next to the Albert–Amiens road. Of the two remaining battalions of the 12th Brigade, the 45th Battalion was deployed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> behind the 106th Brigade of the 35th Division, and the 46th Battalion was held in reserve near the village of Millencourt.|$|E

5|$|The city {{is built}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> {{surrounding}} the citadel, {{located on a}} dominating plateau. Although the city's walls {{were built in the}} third century and the city itself was first mentioned in the 12th century, the majority of the existing buildings date from 17th and 18th centuries. Typical houses consist of a tall stone block structure which can be up to five stories high. There are external and internal staircases that surround the house. It is thought that such design stems from fortified country houses typical in southern Albania. The lower storey of the building contains a cistern and the stable. The upper storey is composed of a guest room and a family room containing a fireplace. Further upper stories are to accommodate extended families and are connected by internal stairs. Since Gjirokastër's membership to UNESCO, a number of houses have been restored, though others continue to degrade.|$|E
