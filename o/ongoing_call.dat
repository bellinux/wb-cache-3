5000|$|It is also {{possible}} for a single handset/phone to be simultaneously connected to multiple radio access networks. Handsets capable of this are sometimes called dual-mode handsets.

50|$|Different {{systems have}} {{different}} methods for handling and managing handoff request. Some systems handle handoff in {{same way as}} they handle new originating call. In such system {{the probability that the}} handoff will not be served is equal to blocking probability of new originating call. But if the call is terminated abruptly in the middle of conversation then it is more annoying than the new originating call being blocked. So in order to avoid this abrupt termination of <b>ongoing</b> <b>call</b> handoff request should be given priority to new call this is called as handoff prioritization.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-—One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in the cellular networks is to guarantee the quality of service of the <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls</b> by prioritizing them over the new calls. An operative approach to prioritize the hand off calls over the new calls is by reserving bandwidth for the <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls</b> of mobile stations in the potential next cell that they may visit. Improving the prediction of potential next cell that a mobile station may visit will cause better bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose weekly prediction based bandwidth reservation scheme. The proposed scheme, WPBR, improves prediction by means of storing weekly movement probabilities of mobile station based on Markov modeling techniques. In order to decreasing the storage space that is needed for storing the mobile station’s movement probabilities, we adopted a dynamic hashing approach. Simulation {{results show that the}} weekly prediction in the proposed scheme, significantly improves bandwidth utilization, and the adopted dynamic hashing approach caused the overhead of storage space to be acceptable...|$|R
50|$|There is {{a special}} service called {{mobility}} management which provides this application. Terminals can move {{from one place to}} another during the call and therefore is not simple to continue the <b>ongoing</b> <b>call</b> from one channel to another which causes Handover. Call should not be dropped during the handover and changing from one service provider to another service. Soft handover uses same frequency channel rather than having quickly switch to an entirely different communication channel when communicating between different channels or base stations. The same terminals can operate in the same area covered by different service provider and is known as Roaming.|$|E

40|$|In many recent low {{earth orbit}} (LEO) {{satellite}} networks, line-of-sight (LOS) wireless links, called intersatellite links (ISL's), are used to enhance the capability of the networks. These ISL's are continuously deleted and established since the visibility between satellites changes over time. When such topological change occurs, calls that have been serviced by deleted links need to be rerouted. In this paper, we propose a call admission control scheme that aims {{to reduce the number}} blocked <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls</b> that occur {{at the time of the}} topological change. To estimate the number of blocked <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls,</b> which is needed to control the admission of new calls, the proposed scheme uses two techniques: traffic recasting and traffic projection. The traffic recasting maps the current traffic onto the network after the topological change whereas the traffic projection projects the recast traffic from the current time to the time of the topological change.

40|$|In {{the third}} {{generation}} cellular networks and beyond, {{a wide variety of}} different services are/will be provided by the operators. Out of QoS reasons, it is preferable to give higher priority to certain connection types. These include calls carrying delay-sensitive services and already <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls.</b> In this paper, a prioritization method combining bandwidth borrowing and reservation, called BBR, is introduced. BBR monitors the rate-adaptiveness of the <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls</b> in a cell. Simultaneously, advanced movement predictions are applied to estimate the arrival rate to each cell. If it is determined that the use of bandwidth borrowing (temporarily reducing the data rate of other calls in the same cell) is not sufficient to support the high priority calls that are expected to arrive, a portion of the assigned bandwidth to the cell is exclusively reserved for these calls to prevent call dropping. The scheme enables the operator to increase the average user satisfaction in the network. This is achieved by defining appropriate penalty functions for blocking, dropping and bandwidth reduction of a call...|$|R
30|$|When an <b>ongoing</b> <b>call</b> completes, {{a channel}} is released. However, the channel {{that was used}} by the just-completed call {{does not have to be}} released. If other calls are ongoing in the same cell, then an in-use channel whose release will make more {{unavailable}} channels become available can be released and the channel that {{was used by the}} just-completed call can be assigned to that <b>ongoing</b> <b>call.</b> As described in Section 2.2. 3, the state of the released channel then changes from ‘ 1 ’ to ‘ 0 ’, and the values of the states of the channels in the interference region of the released channel will be increased by 1. The change of state of a channel from ‘− 1 ’ to ‘ 0 ’ means that the channel, previously unavailable, has become available. Therefore, to identify the best in-use channel to release, the criteria for reassigning a channel upon the completion of an <b>ongoing</b> <b>call</b> are as stated below. The priority of an in-use channel is determined from the number of ‘− 1 ’s within its interference region: the priority increases with the number of ‘− 1 ’s. Therefore, the in-use channel with the highest priority is the one whose release will cause the most unavailable channels to become available.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} preemptive channel allocations (PCA) for multiple-sector cellular networks, where directional antennas {{are used}} to divide the coverage of a cell {{into a number of}} same-sized sectors. When traffic in a sector unexpectedly increases, call blocking probability will increase accordingly. To remedy channel insufficient problem in a single sector, two aspects of channel preemptions are utilized. First, to reduce the blocking probability of new calls, the proposed PCA allows a new call to preempt an <b>ongoing</b> <b>call</b> when the <b>ongoing</b> <b>call</b> is located in the overlapping regions of two adjacent sectors or two neighboring cells. Second, the reserved channels not only can be used by the handoff calls, but also by the preempted calls. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we build an analytical model with four-tuple Markov chains. Numerical results show that the proposed PCA scheme improve the system performance in terms of the blocking and preemption probabilities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalized channel preemption model (GCPM) for multiclass traffic in mobile wireless networks. In the proposed model, a mobile call is identified by four parameters-call type, traffic class, channel requirement, and preemption ratio-in which different classes of traffic can have different priority levels. To effectively reduce dropping probability, high-priority handoff calls {{are allowed to}} fully or partially preempt low-priority <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls</b> when the mobile network becomes congested. A fully preempted call can be completely disconnected, whereas a partially preempted call can still communicate with certain degree of quality-of-service degradation. We introduce an analytical model With multidimensional Markov chains. In the model, a cost function, which is expressed as a weighted sum of the <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls</b> to be preempted and the bandwidth reduction rate in the preempted calls, is defined to select candidate calls from a certain traffic class. The statistical result from the model allows us to tune {{the parameters of the}} GCPM to support high-priority handoff calls and therefore offers new insights in understanding the tradeoffs in supporting multiclass traffic...|$|R
40|$|WCDMA is an {{interference}} limited {{multiple access}} technique. It {{is widely used}} in the 3 rd generation mobile networks like UMTS. When a new call arrives in the system to get admission, it checks whether the call is admitted or not based on some parameters like signal to interference ratio (SIR), transmission power of the Node B and the air interface load. If the call is accepted this will increase some interference to the <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls.</b> This new interference would degrade the <b>ongoing</b> <b>calls</b> and this will also add some extra load which may also lead to the exceeding capacity. So that the system has to decide this admission policy in a systematic way that all the users should maintain their communication with guaranteed quality of service.

A handover algorithm is a handover decision-making process which triggers handover if certain conditions specified are satisfied. An efficient handover algorithm should make handover decision at the right time in case of keeping the communication with the source base station of poor quality or it would frequently trigger unnecessary handovers causing the ping-pong effect. The conditions for handover could vary over time due to the mobility of UE. Therefore, parameter optimization is of great significance to ensure efficiency and reliability of a handover algorithm.|$|E
