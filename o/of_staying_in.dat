30|$|The {{coefficient}} <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> {{a community}} was significant at 1 % level and {{positively related to}} loan repayment.

This parallels a priori expectations and conforms to Afolabi’s (2010) results, which reveal that the length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> a community/experience positively relates to loan repayment. The author further stresses that, the length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> a community determines social cohesion and group membership trust, which is vital for loan repayment.

There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born {{when it was time to}} leave. Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> their colony.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{how social}} support and coping style affect the {{relationship}} between a traumatic chronic stressor and health status. A population of 88 Namibian refugees living in an equatorial region of Africa participated in the study. The central hypothesis was that {{social support and}} coping style moderate the relationship between length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> exile (a proxy measure of chronic stress) and health status (symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders, self-reported physical health status and length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> hospital). The results show that when social support is high the relationship between length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> exile and all three health outcomes is substantially reduced. When social support is low, the relation between stress and poor health outcomes is high. Coping style moderates the relationship between length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> exile and period of hospitalization but has no effect on level of anxiety or perceived health status. When both social support and coping style are simultaneously considered, the best results emerge. stress social support coping refugee health...|$|R

Objective To determine if systemic inflammatory response syndrome scores are predictive <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the inten-sive care unit in patients with acute, life-threatening injuries. Methods Retrospective chart reviews were completed on patients with acute, life-threatening injuries admitted to {{the intensive care}} unit at a level I trauma center in the southeast-ern United States. All 246 eligible charts from the trauma reg-istry database from 1998 to 2007 were included.

Data on race, sex, age, smoking status, and injury sever-ity score also were collected. Univariate and multivariate regression modeling was used to analyze data. Results Severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome scores on admission to the intensive care unit were predictive <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the unit (F= 15. 83; P<. 001), as was white race (F= 9. 7; P =. 002), and injury severity score (F= 20. 23; P<. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background The length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> asylum centres is {{generally}} {{mentioned as a}} possible health risk to asylum seekers. Medical staff working with asylum seekers has claimed that long lengths <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> asylum centres might cause or aggravate mental disorders. We used records from a large, multiethnic group of asylum seekers to study if the incidence of mental disorders increased with length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Methods The study population was asylum seekers in Danish asylum centres run by the Danish Red Cross. General medical care was provided by Red Cross staff who could refer selected cases to medical specialists. If an asylum seeker needed more than three specialist consultations for mental illness or five consultations for physical illness the referrals had {{to be approved by}} The Danish Immigration Service. Between July 2001 – December 2002 the Red Cross prospectively registered health related data on all new applications (n = 4516) to the Immigration Service regarding referrals to medical specialists. We used these records to analyse the association between length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the asylum centres and overall rate of referral for mental disorders. Data was analysed using weighted linear regression. Results We found that referrals for mental disorders increased with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> asylum centres in a large, multiethnic population of asylum seekers. The association was found in all the categories of psychiatric illness studied and for a majority of the nationality groups studied. Conclusion Length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> asylum centres was associated with an increase in referrals for mental disorders in a large, multiethnic group of asylum seekers. The present study supports the view that prolonged length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> an asylum centre is a risk factor for mental health. The risk of psychiatric illness among asylum seekers should be addressed by political and humanitarian means, giving prevention of illness the highest priority. </p...|$|R
