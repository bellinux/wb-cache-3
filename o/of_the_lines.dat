5|$|The {{commuter}} rail operates mainly within Greater Oslo and two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> only provide services within the urban area. Six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> span beyond the urban area, reaching {{the counties of}} Østfold, Hedmark, Oppland and Buskerud. The system is also an airport rail link to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. West of Oslo, the system uses the Drammen, Asker, Spikkestad and Sørland lines, north of Oslo it uses the Gjøvik Line, east of Oslo it uses the Trunk, Gardermoen and Kongsvinger lines and south of Oslo it follows the Østfold and Eastern Østfold lines.|$|E

5|$|There is an {{extensive}} bus network {{that covers the}} entire city by three bus services, but no tram or subway exists. The three bus operators are partially owned by the city (KPKM, KPK and KZK) and each shares approximately a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> and the bus fleet.|$|E
5|$|A limerick is a {{poem that}} {{consists}} of five lines and is often humorous. Rhythm {{is very important in}} limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables. However, the third and fourth lines only need five to seven. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> must rhyme and have the same rhythm.|$|E
5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west. The 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment were {{driven out of}} Shilta, but infantry from the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{in the process of}} being relieved, returned to the front, closed the gap, and pushed the Ottoman soldiers back out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of communication.|$|E

5|$|Atomic sodium has a {{very strong}} {{spectral}} line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights). This appears as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> in the solar spectrum, now known as the Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely-spaced lines split by fine and hyperfine structure.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{the need}} to build an {{underground}} transportation system in Buenos Aires began in the late nineteenth century, alongside the tramway system, {{which was one of the}} most extensive in the world at the time. The first trams appeared in 1870, and by about 1900 the system was in a crisis exacerbated by the monopolisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> which had concentrated under the ownership of fewer companies during the electrification of the system.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room {{for a more detailed}} and characterised narrative.|$|E

5|$|Histological {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of arrested growth {{within the}} tibiae {{from the various}} ontogenetic stages of Limusaurus indicates that the animal was skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the outermost lines of arrested growth are very close together (forming {{what is known as}} the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{frequently}} used imitation, especially paired imitation, in writing his motets, with sections akin to fugal expositions occurring on successive {{lines of the}} text he was setting. An example is his setting of Dominus regnavit (Psalm 93), for four voices; each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of the psalm begins with a voice singing a new tune alone, quickly followed by entries of other three voices in imitation.|$|E
5|$|Lemoine {{also proved}} that if lines are drawn through the Lemoine point {{parallel}} {{to the sides of}} the triangle, then the six points of intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> and the sides of the triangle are concyclic, or that they lie on a circle. This circle is now known as the first Lemoine circle, or simply the Lemoine circle.|$|E
5000|$|An {{equilateral}} triangle is easily constructed using a compass and straightedge, as 3 is a Fermat prime.

5|$|MRT lines {{operate from}} 5:30am to before 1:00am daily, with the {{exception}} of selected periods such as New Year's Eve, Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya, Christmas, eves of public holidays, and special occasions such as the state funeral of Lee Kuan Yew (2015), when most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> stay open throughout the night or extended till later. MRT serves as an essential purpose of transport owing to the support from various organisations and being a car-lite society.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is flat, with a {{slope of}} 0 to 3 percent. There {{are two major}} lines of hills in the watershed, {{one of which is}} in the northern part and the other of which is in {{the central part of the}} watershed. These lines of hills have a slope of 3 to 8 percent. In both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of hills, there are patches where the slope is 8 to 15 percent and in the northern line of hills, there is an area with a slope of over 15 percent.|$|E
5|$|On opening, the Metropolitan Railway's trains were {{provided}} by the Great Western Railway, but these were withdrawn in August 1863. After a period hiring trains from the Great Northern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway introduced its own, Fowler designed, 4-4-0 tank engines in 1864. The design, known as the A class and, with minor updates, the B class, was so successful that the Metropolitan and District Railways eventually had 120 of the engines in use and they remained in operation until electrification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> in the 1900s.|$|E

5|$|Research by Michael D'Emic et al {{indicates}} that it was among the slowest-growing theropods. Based on studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of arrested growth in several bones, {{it was found that}} Majungasaurus took twenty years to reach maturity, which may have been a result of the harsh environment in which it lived. However, other abelisaurids have also been found to have comparably slow growth rates.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of this failure, D. Luis de Haro, invaded Portugal and besieged Elvas, the main defensive system of Portugal - where the Portuguese army that had besieged Badajoz took refuge and was suffering a second catastrophic plague. A small relief army was improvised by the Portuguese which inflicted a crushing defeat to the Spanish army at the decisive battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> of Elvas (14 January 1659). This way, the Portuguese independence was granted while the Spanish reached military advantage in the secondary front of war, Minho and Galicia.|$|E
