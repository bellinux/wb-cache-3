5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, {{only a tiny fraction of}} these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.|$|E

5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere with}} the body's uptake <b>of</b> <b>copper,</b> producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{after the}} start of the Great Depression, the price <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> fell to 14cents a pound. In response, United Verde began {{reducing}} its work force; UVX operated at a loss, and the third big mine, Verde Central, closed completely. The price <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> fell further in 1932 to 5 cents a pound, leading to layoffs, temporary shut-downs, and wage reductions in the Verde District. In 1935, the Clark family sold United Verde to Phelps Dodge, and in 1938 UVX went out of business.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{copper alloys}} have been formulated, many with {{important}} uses. Brass is an alloy <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but {{can refer to}} any alloy <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> such as aluminium bronze. Copper {{is one of the}} most important constituents of silver and carat gold and carat solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> and other metals.|$|E

50|$|Revere Copper Products, Inc., {{founded in}} Rome between 1928 and 1929, {{is one of}} the oldest {{manufacturing}} companies in the United States. It developed from a series of mergers between several companies, including Revere Copper Company located in Canton, Massachusetts. The first president <b>of</b> Revere <b>Copper</b> Products, Inc, George H. Allen, was formerly the president <b>of</b> Michigan <b>Copper</b> and Brass Company, which was one of the companies included in the merger. The early history <b>of</b> Revere <b>Copper</b> Products, Inc is detailed in the book Copper Heritage: The Story <b>of</b> Revere <b>Copper</b> and Brass, Inc. by Isaac F. Marcosson. At one time, 10 percent <b>of</b> all <b>copper</b> products used in the United States were manufactured in Rome.|$|R
5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} <b>of</b> <b>copper,</b> nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, {{a process that is}} no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E

50|$|The US Geological Survey {{estimated}} that, as of 2013, there remained 3.5 billion {{metric tons}} <b>of</b> undiscovered <b>copper</b> resources worldwide in porphyry and sediment-hosted type deposits, two types which currently provide 80% <b>of</b> mined <b>copper</b> production. This was {{in addition to}} 2.1 billion metric tons of identified resources. Combined identified and estimated undiscovered copper resources were 5.6 billion metric tons, 306 times the 2013 global production <b>of</b> newly mined <b>copper</b> <b>of</b> 18.3 million metric tons.|$|R
50|$|Two {{developments}} in the copper sector were noteworthy. First, in the 1987-91 period, there was {{a substantial increase in}} the output <b>of</b> refined <b>copper,</b> as well as a relative decline in the production <b>of</b> blister <b>copper.</b> Second, the state-owned Copper Corporation (Corporación del Cobre—Codelco), the world's largest copper producer, still had an overwhelmingly dominant role (accounting for 60 percent <b>of</b> Chile's <b>copper</b> output in 1991).|$|R
5|$|The alloy <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> and nickel, called cupronickel, {{is used in}} low-denomination coins, {{often for}} the outer cladding. The US 5-cent coin (currently called a nickel) {{consists}} of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries. Alloys <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations. Shakudō is a Japanese decorative alloy <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> containing a low percentage of gold, typically 4–10%, that can be patinated to a dark blue or black color.|$|E
5|$|The {{softness}} <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> partly explains {{its high}} electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E
5|$|There is no totally {{reliable}} {{test for}} Wilson's disease, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as {{well of the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression of the amount <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> in the body. The gold standard—or most ideal test—is a liver biopsy.|$|E
25|$|Copper has {{a higher}} {{ductility}} than alternate metal conductors {{with the exception of}} gold and silver. Because <b>of</b> <b>copper’s</b> high ductility, it is easy to draw down to diameters with very close tolerances.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} elements, the {{simplest}} compounds <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and halides. Both cuprous and cupric oxides are known. Among the numerous copper sulfides, important examples include copper(I) sulfide and copper(II) sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its role}} in facilitating iron uptake, copper {{deficiency}} can produce anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, Wilson's disease causes an accumulation <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> in body tissues.|$|E
