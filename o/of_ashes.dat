5|$|As it is near several film studios {{including}} those at Pinewood, the airfield {{has been used}} to represent outside locations in a number of feature films. Scenes of the James Bond films Goldfinger, Thunderball and Octopussy were all filmed at Northolt, and station personnel served as extras in the Octopussy hangar fly-through stunt scene. The mini-series The Winds of War and The Bill and the BBC shows Waking the Dead, Doctor Who and Red Dwarf have all used Northolt to represent various fictional airfields. In early 2010 the station was used for action scenes in the final episode of the BBC's final series <b>of</b> <b>Ashes</b> to Ashes.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap <b>of</b> <b>ashes</b> from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period. At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10-25 degrees south of the equator. The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone, laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago, were created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then were deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up <b>of</b> <b>ashes</b> and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite), {{but there is also a}} Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks. There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation.|$|E
40|$|The work {{describes}} {{the problem of}} impounding and storing ash and slag waste at coal thermal power plants in Russia. Recovery and recycling <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> and slag waste are analyzed. Activity of radionuclides, the chemical composition and particle sizes <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> and slag waste were determined; the acidity index, the basicity and the class of material were defined. The technology for making ceramic products with the addition <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> and slag waste was proposed. The dependencies relative to the percentage <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> and slag waste and the optimal parameters for baking were established. The obtained materials were tested for physical and mechanical properties, namely for water absorption, thermal conductivity and compression strength. Based on the findings, future prospects for use <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> and slag waste were identified...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> in chemical-looping combustion (CLC) {{has been}} studied in a lab-scale fluidized bed reactor. The oxygen carrier, ilmenite, was investigated with German lignite coal, Chinese bituminous coal, Mexican pet coke, wood char, and methane. Lignite ash and ash from gasified Chinese bituminous coal were compared in this study. Up to 50 [*]wt[*]% and 33. 3 [*]wt[*]% loadings <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> from the combustion <b>of</b> lignite and <b>ash</b> from the gasification of coal were added. The gas conversion was clearly affected by the addition <b>of</b> <b>ash,</b> and very similar results were seen both for methane conversion and for CO conversion in the solid fuel tests. Thus, both ashes showed initial decrease in gas conversion with the addition <b>of</b> some <b>ash</b> due {{to the presence of}} inert/deactivating material in the ashes. At higher ash loading, a beneficial effect <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> could be seen. Furthermore, no negative effect <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> addition on the fluidizability of the bed material could be seen...|$|R
5|$|The video shifts {{again to}} Björk {{buried in the}} sand under the rain <b>of</b> <b>ashes.</b> The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Björk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the {{floating}} rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During {{this part of the}} video, images of Björk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Björk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped like two opposite Björk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in an explosion of magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s, the Mount Vernon complex, {{which was}} {{initially}} intended for the storage <b>of</b> <b>ashes</b> from recent deaths, could no longer cope with the scale of exhumation projects fuelling the demand for columbarium niches. Another crematorium and columbarium complex was built at Mandai, and this commenced operations in 1982, equipped with eight small and four medium-sized cremators and a total of 64,370 niches for the storage of cremated remains. Chinese voluntary associations such as Pek San Theng were allowed to build columbaria to house the remains of those exhumed from clan-owned cemeteries, and temples and churches were allowed to accommodate cremated remains. Mount Vernon Crematorium ceased operations on 30 June 2004.|$|E
5|$|For {{four to five}} years, Baba {{lived under}} a neem tree and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. His manner {{was said to be}} {{withdrawn}} and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of meditation. He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms, and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash ('Udi') to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application <b>of</b> <b>ashes.</b> Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayan and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and Qur'an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God's name (dhikr, and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of parables, symbols and allegories.|$|E

5|$|When Nick, Jordan, and Tom {{drive through}} the valley <b>of</b> <b>ashes</b> on their way home, they {{discover}} that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car {{at the time of}} the accident but Gatsby took the blame. Myrtle's husband, George, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he recently began suspecting she has, and sets out on foot to find him. After finding out the yellow car is Gatsby's, he arrives at Gatsby's mansion where he fatally shoots Gatsby and then himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby in which none of Gatsby's associates or partygoers attend. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that Gatsby was Myrtle's secret lover and that Gatsby had killed her, then gave Gatsby's address to George. Nick breaks up with Jordan, and, disillusioned with the East, moves back to the Midwest.|$|E

25|$|Robin Knowles Wallace {{states that}} the {{traditional}} Ash Wednesday church service includes Psalm 51 (the Miserere), prayers of confession and the sign <b>of</b> <b>ashes.</b> No single one of the traditional services contains all of these elements. The Anglican Church's traditional Ash Wednesday service, titled A Commination, contains the first two elements, but not the third. On the other hand, the Catholic Church's traditional service has the blessing and distribution <b>of</b> <b>ashes</b> but, while prayers of confession and recitation of Psalm 51 (the first psalm at Lauds on all penitential days, including Ash Wednesday) {{are a part of}} its general traditional Ash Wednesday liturgy, they are not associated specifically with the rite of blessing the ashes. The rite of blessing has acquired an untraditional weak association with that particular psalm only since 1970, when it was inserted into the celebration of Mass, at which a few verses of Psalm 51 are used as a responsorial psalm. Coincidentally, it was only about the same time that in some areas Anglicanism resumed the rite <b>of</b> <b>ashes.</b>|$|E
