25|$|By {{upgrading}} from OpenSolaris snv_134 to both OpenIndiana and Solaris 11 Express, {{one also}} {{has the ability to}} upgrade and separately boot Solaris 11 Express on the same ZFS pool, but <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> install Solaris 11 Express first because of ZFS incompatibilities introduced by Oracle past ZFS version 28.|$|E

25|$|Gagné {{acknowledged}} {{that he has been}} looked to as a role model, and called himself an example of what <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> do. On the other hand, when asked whether he had given an honest performance to Dodgers fans, he maintained that he had always worked hard to do so.|$|E
25|$|If one dines {{just before}} the end of Shabbat, one should wait until after having said the blessing for fire (part of the Havdalah ceremony) before saying the Birkat Hamazon. <b>One</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> say the Havdalah blessing until the flame is large enough that the person can see {{reasonably}} well by its light.|$|E
25|$|The author {{says it is}} puzzling {{that we live in}} what he {{considers}} a male-dominated society, and yet very little work has been done to understand the archetypal basis of masculinity. He suggests that {{this may be due to}} a societal assumption of male superiority, founded on the belief that <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> question that which is deemed to be right and superior.|$|E
50|$|Politically, {{the phrase}} {{has come to}} mean that methods of {{administration}} or political beliefs in <b>one</b> country <b>should</b> <b>not</b> necessarily be applied to another.|$|R

5|$|There is {{some concern}} that {{areas of the}} Moss have been damaged or partly {{destroyed}} {{as a result of}} agricultural activity, including the digging of drainage ditches. Natural England, the agency responsible for the management of SSSIs in England, has suggested that no further irrigation channels should be dug, existing <b>ones</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be deepened, and that the area <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be exposed to fertilisers or surface water run-off. Natural England further notes that the site's continued status as an SSSI depends on maintaining a high water table.|$|R
25|$|Cat owners {{should be}} aware that {{domestic}} cats are introduced predators, and usually kill all chameleons in the immediate area. Consequently, <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> bring chameleons into a garden frequented by cats. It also is important to be cautious of the activity of shrikes, in particular the southern fiscal, which, if they get into the chameleon-hunting habit, will rapidly strip a garden.|$|E
25|$|Controlled {{tests have}} not shown {{breathing}} nitrox {{to reduce the}} effects of nitrogen narcosis, as oxygen seems to have similarly narcotic properties under pressure to nitrogen; thus <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> expect a reduction in narcotic effects due only {{to the use of}} nitrox. Nonetheless, {{there are people in the}} diving community who insist that they feel reduced narcotic effects at depths breathing nitrox.|$|E
25|$|The {{exception}} {{is for those}} holding EEA driving licences issued {{in exchange for a}} non‑EEA licence. When holding a converted licence, <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> assume the licence can be exchanged when moving to another EEA country. This only applies when permanently relocating to a different EEA country, as a tourist, an EEA-licence issued in exchange of a non-EEA licence is recognised throughout the EEA.|$|E
25|$|When taking {{food from}} a {{communal}} serving dish, <b>one's</b> chopsticks <b>should</b> <b>not</b> pass over someone else's chopsticks, hand, or arm; the diner should either take {{food to the}} side or wait.|$|R

25|$|In New Zealand and Japan, {{the local}} Saturday is Shabbat {{according}} to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since {{according to the}} minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning tefillin during morning prayers.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though there}} does not exist strong {{evidence}} that any particular abstinence program is effective at delaying sex or reducing sexual behavior, <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> conclude that all abstinence programs are ineffective. After all, programs are diverse, fewer than 10 rigorous studies of these programs have been carried out, and studies of two programs have provided modestly encouraging results. In sum, studies of abstinence programs have not produced sufficient evidence to justify their widespread dissemination.|$|E
25|$|Alongside the {{prominent}} poet George Topîrceanu, a poet of an equal importance was Tudor Arghezi {{who was the}} first to revolutionize the poetry in the last 50 years. <b>One</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> neglect the poems of George Bacovia a symbolist poet of neurosis and despair and those of Ion Barbu a brilliant mathematician who wrote a series of very successful cryptic poems. Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco, founders of the Dadaist movement, were also of Romanian origin.|$|E

60|$|This was {{a cheery}} voice, {{and as it}} spoke the four blue eyes turned toward the chest under the window, and the kind moon {{did her best to}} light up the tiny tree {{standing}} there. A very pitiful little tree it was--only a branch of hemlock in an old flower-pot, propped up with bits of coal, and hung with a few penny toys earned by the patient fingers of the elder sisters, that the little <b>ones</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be disappointed.|$|R

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the Torah defines no minimum or maximum for the {{donation}} {{of the corners}} of one’s field to the poor. But the Mishnah also taught that <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> make the amount left to the poor less than one-sixtieth of the entire crop. And even though no definite amount is given, the amount given should accord {{with the size of}} the field, the number of poor people, and the extent of the yield.|$|E
25|$|The terms Spain and the Spains {{were not}} interchangeable. Spain was a {{geographic}} territory, home to several kingdoms (Christian and Muslim), with separate governments, laws, languages, religions, and customs, {{and was the}} historical remnant of the Hispano-Gothic unity. Spain was not a political entity until much later, and when referring to the Middle Ages, <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be confounded with the nation-state of today. The term The Spains referred specifically to a collective of juridico-political units, first the Christian kingdoms, and then the different kingdoms ruled by the same king.|$|E
25|$|Care for {{telescopic}} {{fishing rods}} {{is much the}} same as other rods. The only difference being that <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> open the telescopic rod in manner that whips a closed rod into the open position rapidly. Whipping or flinging a telescopic fishing rod open may and likely will cause it to be difficult to close. When closing the rods make a slight twisting motion while pushing the sections together. Often the rods come with tip covers to protect the tip and guides. Additionally, extra care must be taken not to get dirt or sand in the joints; due to their design this can easily damage this style of rod.|$|E

50|$|A tree {{produces}} between 1000 and 4000 seeds per year. The main harvesting time in Java {{is around}} July - August, the aftercrop in December - February. Usually Djenkol {{is sold in}} the markets by number of seeds. For transport, seeds, in particular young <b>ones,</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> {{be removed from the}} pods to avoid desiccation. One way to store the seeds is by processing it into chips (emping). Another possibility however could be its procession to flour. To date, due to the high moisture content, this is hardly done.|$|R
25|$|The {{second major}} {{problem was the}} method of struggle. Ahmadzadeh {{believed}} that {{the only means of}} battle is a military one and had a strategic role in their fight. Jazani believed in the current situation <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> limit their means to one method but we should prepare the people in a political sense from all sides. With this effort one can fight against injustice and dictatorship for a better life for all people. This will first fix the problem with communication between people and second the social injustices develop a populous sense against the Shah in Iran and the world, and a dictator regime would fall.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, it {{was argued}} by Chiam See Tong, the Leader of the Opposition, that since Singapore {{practices}} representative democracy, NMPs are useless {{to the people}} as, being unelected, they have no incentive to present their views to Parliament. In other words, <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> enjoy the privilege of representing views without bearing the responsibility of serving those whom one represents. The Opposition perceived the scheme as a plan {{to make it look}} unnecessary. A similar point has been made by an academic, Chua Beng Huat, who has argued that the NMP scheme co-opts more moderate dissenting voices and is thus an attempt to de-legitimize the need for more aggressive opposition.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch {{stressed}} {{the idea of}} an active mind even in otium (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's Vetus Itala in De otio religioso where in Christianity it was associated with contemplation and vacatio (vacate—be still). He points out that this is associated with videre (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of otium as vacate et videte (be still and see—a form of meditation, contemplation). Petrarch points out that <b>one</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.|$|E

50|$|A common {{objection}} to software patents {{is that they}} relate to trivial inventions. A patent on an invention that many people would easily develop independently of <b>one</b> another <b>should</b> <b>not,</b> it is argued, be granted since this impedes development.|$|R
