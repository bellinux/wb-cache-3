5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable tubes, {{are reserved for}} when <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> fail {{because of the potential}} for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|A phase-to-amplitude {{converter}} (PAC), {{which uses}} the phase accumulator output word (phase word) usually as an index into a waveform look-up table (LUT) {{to provide a}} corresponding amplitude sample. Sometimes interpolation is used with the look-up table to provide better accuracy and reduce phase error noise. <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as power series can be used, particularly in a software NCO.|$|E
5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or <b>other</b> <b>methods.</b> However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E

5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to the herd, {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; it is impossible to kill them by drowning, so <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is {{more abundant}} in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications {{and the lack}} of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E

Research is often carried out on an animal model, the Ts65Dn mouse.|$|E
5|$|From their {{discovery}} by numismatists, 1804 dollars have commanded high prices. Auction prices reached $1,000 by 1885, {{and in the}} mid-twentieth century, {{the coins}} realized over $30,000. In 1999, a Class I example sold for $4.14 million, then the highest price paid for any coin. Their high value has caused 1804 dollars to be a frequent target of counterfeiting and <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> of deception.|$|E

5|$|Methods {{to infer}} process-based {{convergence}} fit models of selection to a phylogeny and continuous trait data {{to determine whether}} the same selective forces have acted upon lineages.

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> {{also exist}} for {{describing}} polygonal tilings.

The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 44. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 63.|$|E
5|$|Termites rely {{on alarm}} {{communication}} {{to defend a}} colony. Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{doctrine}} of military deception has evolved with time, and it encompasses {{a number of}} meanings. The Russian term маскировка (maskirovka) literally means masking. An early military meaning was camouflage, soon extended to battlefield masking using smoke and <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> of screening. From there it came to have the broader meaning of military deception, widening to include denial and deception.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of scientific jury selection {{has also been}} comparison tested against <b>other</b> <b>methods,</b> such as attorney folklore and intuition. For trial attorneys, justifying the expense of SJS is contingent upon an improvement of their own jury selection abilities. Several empirical studies of traditional jury selection (by attorneys acting alone) have indicated that it and SJS are about equally effective.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by <b>other</b> <b>methods,</b> such as by using a highly irregular outline.
