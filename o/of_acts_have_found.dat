50|$|The 1972 Broadway musical hit, Pippin, by Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson, is {{loosely based}} on the Pippin the Hunchback of history. In this work, Pippin, {{who is not a}} hunchback, has {{graduated}} from university and is trying to decide what his life should be about. He eventually decides to go off to war in his father's army, but quickly changes his mind. By the end <b>of</b> the first <b>act,</b> <b>having</b> <b>found</b> no meaning in women and sex, Pippin decides to revolt. In a glaring breach with history, the revolt succeeds, Charles is assassinated, and Pippin finds himself king. But again, he finds no meaning in this calling and so, through magic and song, resurrects Charles. He toys with suicide, but ultimately chooses the love of a woman over killing himself. The musical was well-received; its original New York production running for almost five years and winning multiple Tony awards: Best Direction of a Musical (Bob Fosse), Best Choreography (Bob Fosse), Best Leading Actor in a Musical (Ben Vereen), among others. In 2013, it returned to Broadway in a major well-acclaimed revival, which also won many Tonys, including Best Revival of a Musical, Best Direction of a Musical (Diane Paulus), Best Performance by a Leading Actress (Patina Miller, playing the role previously played by Tony-award winner Ben Vereen) and Best Performance by a Featured Actress (Andrea Martin).|$|R
