I don't know what he would have answered. I don't know Vazgen's answers to very few questions. Unfortunately, <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> relatives are not always the way we want them to be.

500|$|... "The Love Club" [...] is a electropop song. It {{addresses}} the befriending of [...] "a bad crowd." [...] Lorde explained the song's lyrical meaning to New York magazine, [...] "'The Love Club' {{is about an}} experience I had {{about a year ago}} where I met all these new friends and I fell in with them. It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> our situation. Then I started to maybe realise that group wasn't so good for me, and that my old friends and my family are the people I should be with. It's about being drawn into this crazy world, and you’re all in love".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the assassins}} {{had belonged to}} the Trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters, only to find their support for him eroded by the state's crimes against its people. Imbert, one of the assassins, sums up this {{realization}} in a comment prompted by {{the murder of the}} Mirabal sisters: [...] "They kill our fathers, our brothers, <b>our</b> <b>friends.</b> <b>And</b> now they're killing our women. And here we sit, resigned, waiting our turn." [...] In an interview, Vargas Llosa describes the corruption and brutality of Trujillo's regime: [...] "He had more or less all the common traits of a Latin American dictator, but pushed to the extreme. In cruelty, I think he went far far away from the restand in corruption, too." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{because of}} the devastation caused in Haiti, these plans were postponed. Phillips said that Jones had called Lionel and said, [...] "this is what this song is written for, as a {{fundraising}} vehicle for causes, tragedies, catastrophes like this. Why don't we take over the process, call <b>our</b> <b>friends,</b> <b>and</b> actually do this?" [...] Lionel understood the urgency of Haiti, and in January 2010, {{it was agreed that}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] would be re-recorded to help benefit Haiti, similar to how the original recording helped famine relief in Africa. Richie commented, [...] "Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a hit record to make someone decide to save a life. I want this song to be the battle cry again. Every once in a while, you have to wake the world up. We slept right through Katrina. If we are not a socially aware culture, we're going to fail." ...|$|E

500|$|How I Met Your Mother was {{inspired}} by creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas's idea to [...] "write about <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> the stupid stuff we did in New York," [...] where they previously worked as writers for Late Show with David Letterman. The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife. Thomas's wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed {{if they could get}} Hannigan to play her. Radnor and Segel were relative unknowns, but Smulders, another relatively little-known actress, was cast as Robin after [...] Jennifer Love Hewitt turned down the role in favor of Ghost Whisperer. Bays and Thomas commented on her casting by saying, [...] "thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted’s seeing {{her for the first time}}, America’s seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive".|$|E
500|$|The Senate {{vetoed the}} text {{submitted}} by the Congress. The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held {{the majority of the}} seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 [...] "yes" [...] and 119 [...] "no" [...] votes and 2 abstentions. As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005, it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 [...] "yes" [...] votes (including a member of the People's Party, Celia Villalobos), 147 [...] "no" [...] votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of Parliament to speak in its support, saying We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of our neighbors, our colleagues, <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> our relatives. At the same time, we are building a more decent society. Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address Parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his last}} {{years in the}} House, Hill earned a 70 percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign, a GLBT rights {{advocacy}} group. [...] Hill supported the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2010, and opposed a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Hill did not campaign for same-sex marriage, however, and did not cosponsor legislation brought by 121 Democrats to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage. As public attitudes changed, Hill's position shifted, and in 2015, while running for Senate, Hill said: [...] "Marriage equality is especially close to my own heart. I’m proud of Hoosiers who are fighting to make sure <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> neighbors are guaranteed equal rights." ...|$|E

2500|$|The central {{message of}} the book is that gay men must accept {{responsibility}} for their lives, and that those who are still living must give back to their community by fighting for People With AIDS (PWA's) and LGBT rights, for, as Kramer states, [...] "I must put back something into this world for my own life, which is worth a tremendous amount. [...] By not putting back, you are saying that your lives are worth shit, and that we deserve to die, and that the deaths of all <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> lovers have amounted to nothing.

5000|$|The opera {{contains}} obvious symbolism in {{the triumph}} of the helpless and needy children over the tyrannical organ grinder, but has no overt references to the conditions under which it was written and performed. However, certain phrases were to the audience clearly anti-Nazi. Though Hoffmeister wrote the libretto before Hitler's invasion, at least one line was changed by poet Emil Saudek at Terezin, to emphasize the anti-Nazi message. [...] "While the original said,'He who loves so much his mother and father and his native land is <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> he can play with us,' Saudek's version reads: 'He who loves justice and will abide by it, and who is not afraid, is <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> can play with us.'"(Karas, p. 103).|$|R
