The river was dammed (the dam is just upstream from the mill building) in 1872, and the mill building, designed by Maine native Charles F. Douglas, was completed in 1873. It was named for the company's directing agent, C. I. Barker. The mill produced shirting, sheeting, and <b>other</b> <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> for many years.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study and hyperelastic modelling of orthotropic mechanical behavior of <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> fabric. The strain energy {{function of the}} hyperelastic model {{is a combination of}} the warp extension, weft extension, and shear angle between warp and weft directions. The experimental and fitting analysis of the anisotropy is realized using off-axis tensile tests for five <b>textile</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics. Orthotropic hyperelastic modelling highlights the anisotropy tensile property of <b>textile</b> <b>woven</b> fabric compared to orthotropic linear elastic modelling. Particular attention is given to the influence of weave structure on fabric anisotropy...|$|R

Textile work is still passed on from generation to generation in indigenous communities in the state and is an important source of income for these families.In Michoacán, women weave on back strap looms {{as they did in the}} pre-Hispanic period with most weaving on pedal looms done by men. Sheep are generally shorn twice a year, spring and fall, with the wool obtained in each season requiring different handling because of the types of impurities found. Most wool is white but brown and black is found as well. Wool textile products include sarapes, wrap belts, rebozos, rugs and blankets. Cotton is spun and woven mostly to create clothing and linens—including dresses, shirts, blouses, jackets, tablecloths, table runners, napkins, and bedspreads. The most representative work in cotton comes from Patzcuaro and Uruapan, as well as Zacán and Tócuaro. [...] Other notable cotton work is that of the Nahuas in the coastal areas. These textiles tend to be the most traditional, as they are made for self-consumption, with the pieces created from the growing of the cotton to weaving the cloth to sewing and embroidering the garment. The two towns best known for this work are Cachán and Maruata.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In the {{northern}} area of Amhara, weavers produce a garment worn by many, {{made from a}} pure white, transparent woven material. Many weavers across Africa, including those in northern Ethiopia, are men. They are both full-time and migrant, the latter coming from the countryside during the slack farming season. Moreover, in Bahir Dar, the capital of Amhara, many prisoners <b>weave</b> the <b>textile,</b> in conformance with {{the division of labor}} system to receive an income during the terms of their sentences. Therefore, <b>textile</b> <b>weaving</b> in this area is not limited to skilled craftsmen (full-time weavers); even the unskilled such as prisoners and migrants have the opportunity to <b>weave.</b> However, Amhara’s <b>textile</b> <b>weaving</b> industry is male-dominated; women are only involved in spinning the cotton thread in preparation for the weaving. This paper focuses on the weaving techniques and features of Amhara’s textiles. Additionally, it investigates whether women’s involvement in <b>textile</b> <b>weaving</b> can be expanded.
