60|$|Lord Lambeth {{came the}} next day with his trap, when the two ladies, {{attended}} by Willie Woodley, placed themselves under his guidance and were conveyed eastward, through some of the most fascinating, as Bessie called them, even though the duskiest districts, to the great turreted donjon that overlooks the London shipping. They alighted together to enter the famous fortress, where they secured the services of a venerable beef-eater, who, ignoring the presence of <b>other</b> <b>dependants</b> on his leisure, made a fine exclusive party of them and marched them through courts and corridors, through armouries and prisons. He delivered his usual peripatetic discourse, and they stopped and stared and peeped and stooped according as he marshalled and directed them. Bessie appealed to this worthy—even on more heads than he seemed aware of; she overtaxed, in her earnestness, his learnt lesson and found the place, as she more than once mentioned to him, quite delirious. Lord Lambeth was in high good-humour; his delirium at least was gay and he betrayed afresh that aptitude for the simpler forms of ironic comment that the girl had noted in him. Willie Woodley kept looking at the ceilings and tapping the walls with the knuckle of a pearl-grey glove; and Mrs. Westgate, asking at frequent intervals to be allowed to sit down and wait till they came back, was as frequently informed that they would never do anything so weak. When it befell that Bessie’s glowing appeals, chiefly on collateral points of English history, but left the warder gaping she resorted straight to Lord Lambeth. His lordship then pleaded gross incompetence, declaring he knew nothing about that sort of thing and greatly diverted, to all appearance, at being treated as an authority.|$|E

40|$|Abstract –Private fee {{for service}} {{is the only}} {{mechanism}} of payment for dental care {{in most of the}} developing countries including India. The major disadvantage of fee for service is that many patients are unable to receive any care. Developing countries have an unequal income distribution and in a market based delivery system socio economic factors {{play a major role in}} use of health care services. Dental diseases affect activities in school, work, and home and often significantly diminish the quality of life for many children and adults, especially those who belong to low-income group or uninsured population group. Disparities also exist in health status including oral health between urban and rural population in developing countries. Poor and marginalized population form majority of the population in developing countries. This underserved population typically defined by their low incomes has poor oral health status and most of the times are unable to afford basic and emergency health care services. We suggest that developing countries like India with sufficient dental manpower resources urgently need to include dental safety net in public health services. This safety net should target population from low socio economic status, children and <b>other</b> <b>dependant</b> groups...|$|R
40|$|Industrial robots are {{the most}} widely {{manufactured}} and utilized type of robots in industries. Improving the design process of industrial robots would lead to further developments in robotics industries. Consequently, <b>other</b> <b>dependant</b> industries would be benefited. Therefore, there {{is an effort to}} make the design process more and more efficient and reliable. The design of industrial robots requires studies in various fields. Engineering softwares are the tools which facilitate and accelerate the robot design processes such as dynamic simulation, structural analysis, optimization, control and so forth. Therefore, designing a framework to automate the robot design process such that different tools interact automatically would be beneficial. In this thesis, the goal is to investigate the feasibility of integrating tools from different domains such as geometry modeling, dynamic simulation, finite element analysis and optimization in order to obtain an industrial robot design and optimization framework. Meanwhile, Meta modeling is used to replace the time consuming design steps. In the optimization step, various optimization algorithms are compared based on their performance and the best suited algorithm is selected. As a result, it is shown that the objectives are achievable in a sense that finite element analysis can be efficiently integrated with the other tools and the results can be optimized during the design process. A holistic framework which can be used for design of robots with several degrees of freedom is introduced at the end...|$|R
5000|$|The {{founding}} of the Carnegie Hero Fund Trust was announced in September 1908 with a bold statement from its benefactor, Andrew Carnegie, [...] "Gentlemen…we live in a heroic age. Not seldom are we thrilled by acts of heroism where men or women are injured or lose their lives in attempting to preserve or rescue their fellows; such are the heroes of civilisation". Carnegie provided $1.25 million in bonds, yielding an annual income of £12,500, {{as a means to}} supporting the Trust’s work. Such an amount, Carnegie believed, would be sufficient to [...] "meet the cost of maintaining injured heroes and their families during the disability of the heroes and the widows and children of heroes who may lose their lives".

5000|$|Jonson's use of witches in the anti-masque is an {{interesting}} commentary on the witch craze of the era. More generally, {{the invention of the}} anti-masque shaped the art form of the masque for the remainder of its life. Some modern critics, approaching the masque from a more skeptical if not jaundiced perspective than that of its creators and participants, see the anti-masque as a subversion of the surface intent of the performance. ("But this antimasque quite eclipses its masque. The queens are mere wax-works after the witches" [...] - [...] the verdict of The Cambridge History of English and American Literature.) In the end, the disorderly and disruptive forces of the anti-masque are always driven off by a re-established order (which is always [...] "the established order"); but that order is presented in a hyper-idealized style that contrasts sharply with the flawed and limited humans who are enacting the parts (and the courtiers and <b>other</b> <b>dependants</b> in the audience know those flaws and limits all too well). In this interpretation, the anti-masque undermines the intention of the performance, giving it an effect opposite to the one intended. In the anti-masque, the Stuarts are, perhaps, unwittingly subverting their authority.|$|E

The two funds were amalgamated in July 1935, under the provision of a trust deed to form the Gresford Colliery Disaster Relief Fund, with three trustees: the Lord Mayor of London, the Governor of the Bank of England and the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire.

The spatial distribution characteristics of wetland vegetation in the arid region of the Alborz and the main factors affecting their distributional patterns were studied. A classification of vegetation and ecological characteristics were carried out using data extracted from 430 relevés in 90 wetland sites. The {{data were analyzed using}} Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The wetland vegetation of Alborz Mountain was classified into four large groups. The first vegetation group was calcareous rich vegetation, mainly distributed in the river banks and characterized by helophytes such as Bolboschoenus affinis as indicator species. The second group was saline transitional vegetation, distributed in the ecotone areas and dominated by Phragmites australis. The third vegetation group is wet meadow vegetation which mainly consists of geophytes, endemic and Irano-Turanian species, distributed in the higher altitudes. This vegetation is mainly characterized by indicator species such as Carex orbicularis, high level concentration of Fe 2 + and percentage of organic matter in the soil. The fourth vegetation group is aquatic vegetation, distributed in the lakeshores. The aquatic group species are mainly hydrophytic such as Batrachium trichophyllum. The TWINSPAN vegetation groups could be also recognized in the DCA graphs and ecologically differentiated by ANOVA of studied variables. Four vegetation groups can be differentiated on two first axes of indirect ordination. There is a gradient of pH, EC and organic matter associated with altitude on the DCA diagram. Correlation analysis between the axes of DCA and environmental factors shows that altitude, soil texture and <b>other</b> <b>dependant</b> environmental variables (e. g. pH) are the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of wetland vegetation groups...|$|R
40|$|Deaths, {{disasters}} and atrocities in touristic form are becoming an increasingly pervasive feature within the contemporary tourism landscape, and as such, are ever more providing potential spiritual journeys for the tourist {{who wishes to}} gaze upon real and recreated death. As a result, the rather emotive label of 2 ̆ 7 dark tourism 2 ̆ 7 has entered academic discourse and media parlance, and consequently has generated {{a significant amount of}} research interest. However, despite this increasing attention the dark tourism literature remains both eclectic and theoretically fragile. That is, a number of fundamental issues remain, not least whether it is actually possible or justifiable to collectively categorise a diverse range of sites, attractions and exhibitions that are associated with death and the macabre as 2 ̆ 7 dark tourism 2 ̆ 7, or whether identifiable degrees or 2 ̆ 7 shades 2 ̆ 7 of darkness can be attributed to a particular type of dark tourism supplier. This paper argues that certain suppliers may indeed, conceptually at least, share particular product features, perceptions and characteristics, which can then be loosely translated into various 2 ̆ 7 shades of darkness 2 ̆ 7. As a result, dark tourism products may lie along a rather 2 ̆ 7 fluid and dynamic spectrum of intensity 2 ̆ 7, whereby particular sites may be conceivably 2 ̆ 7 darker 2 ̆ 7 than <b>others,</b> <b>dependant</b> upon various defining characteristics, perceptions and product traits. It is proposed that construction of a firm and comprehensive typological foundation will lead not only {{to a better understanding of}} dark tourism supply, but also, and perhaps more importantly, lead to a better understanding of where to locate and explore consumer demand, motivations and experiences...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of a 12 -week cool pool exercise program on gait outcomes in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis. Spatiotemporal and kinematic gait variables will be compared between one group that participates in an aquatic exercise program in the cool pool and one group that participates in a home-based exercise program. The study findings will help to provide more effective and scientific therapeutic exercise programs for gait restoration in individuals with MS. Methods: 22 individuals with MS were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups. The aquatic group (n=l 1) participated in a 50 -minute cool pool exercise program (82 - 84 ??? F) 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The home-based exercise group was recommended to exercise at home with specific guidelines. Gait variables included spatiotemporal data, peak joint angles and joint excursions in the lower extremities. All participants walked on a 10 -meter walkway at their maximum speed for 3 trials with 30 -second rest in between. The Vicon Motion Analysis system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) was used to capture and process gait data, applying the Plug-in-Gait model. Results: A multivariate analysis of variance showed greater increases in ankle peak plantarflexion and ankle excursion on the less affected limb in the aquatic group as compared to the home-based group. There were no significant between-group differences found in gait speed, stride length, cadence and hip and knee kinematics. Both groups showed a positive trend of maintaining or improving their gait efficiency in all <b>other</b> <b>dependant</b> variables. Conclusions: The findings suggest that structured cool pool exercise can be more effective improving ankle gait kinematics as compared to a comparable home-based program. In addition, both aquatic and home-based exercise programs can be helpful to maintain gait patterns and prevent any loss of mobility...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedRheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{an inflammatory}} and disabling joint disease affecting approximately 2. 5 {{million people in}} the United States. Although it has been classified as an autoimmune disorder its etiology remains unknown. Due to the complex nature of the disease a proper treatment have been difficult to find. There are several clinically available gold(I) salts as drugs to treat RA. However, to date, an understanding of the chemistry behind it's therapeutic effect is not available. Gold is known to be thiophilic and found to undergo facile ligand exhange reactions with biological thiolates like cysteines, especially those with low pKa values. The cathepsin family of lysosomal cysteine proteases are likely targets of gold because they are implicated in RA, found to localized in arthritic joints, and are cysteine dependant. In order to investigate the cathepsin inhibition as a biological relevant chemistry of gold, a series of linear two coordinated gold(I) complex analogs of auranofin have been synthesized, characterized and their effect on human cathepsin B activity tested. The role of steric and electronic effects of the phosphine ligands on these complexes was investigated. Molecular modeling studies were performed to understand the gold(I) -biomolecule interaction in depth. Selectivity of these complexes for cathepsin B over <b>other</b> cysteine <b>dependant</b> enzymes tested. The complexes were found to inhibit human cathepsin B competitively and reversibly with IC 50 values ranging from nanomolar to micromolar. Computational and experimental results suggested that favorable interactions of the inhibitor and the enezyme are critical to the efficiency of the inhibitor. Both electronic and steric effects of the phosphine ligand were found to play crucial roles in the potency of inhibitors. Highly potent gold(I) inhibitors of cathepsin B show selectivity towards it over <b>other</b> cysteine <b>dependant</b> enzymes...|$|R

Annual Reports on gender equality and documents connected to the European Employment Strategy are specifically analysed. Even though the "reconciliation policies are part of equality policies" argumentation is often stressed, the expressed goals are usually connected to the goals of employment policies and economic policies, with economic growth being behind this argumentation.

40|$|This {{paper has}} a twofold purpose. It argues firstly, that {{analysis}} of income distribution {{should be a}} part of the capability approach. Secondly, it argues that the capability approach is a good theoretical foundation for analysis of income distribution. The capability approach to human advantage has not hitherto been applied in mainstream analysis of income and wealth. The paper argues, on the one hand, that the capability approach needs to include a measure of access to economic goods; on the other hand that a capabilitydefinition of income avoids some problems inherent in the traditional, welfarist approach. A modified full income is proposed as a measure of income capability. Modified full income is Beckerian full income corrected for interalia constraints on time. Time needed to care for children (and <b>other</b> <b>dependants)</b> is a constraint on available time. The capability approach will seek to compute the cost of children (and other special needs) by identifying moral and legal constraints on time and other resources through open democratic discussion rather than econometric estimation.
