40|$|This article {{examines}} the 2002 by-election in the Australian federal seat of Cunningham, in which the Australian Greens secured their first and {{only member of the}} House of Representatives. This case study <b>of</b> <b>Greens</b> voting suggests that the electoral support base <b>of</b> the <b>Greens</b> in Cunningham was consistent with what is known about the support base <b>of</b> the <b>Greens</b> elsewhere in Australia. At the same time, it makes the case that local factors were at least as important as national issues in explaining the high Greens vote in Cunningham. A suburb-by-suburb analysis <b>of</b> <b>Greens</b> voting in the 2002 by-election suggests that traditional markers <b>of</b> <b>Greens</b> voting, such as higher than average incomes and educational qualifications, were a necessary, but not a sufficient, explanation <b>of</b> <b>Greens</b> voting in the case of Cunningham...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{involves}} {{a study of}} the English village green from the viewpoint of historical geography on aspects <b>of</b> <b>greens</b> as rural settlement. The presence <b>of</b> village <b>greens</b> in the landscape poses three categories of questions; concerning their origins, their present status and their future. With these categories of questions in mind, the research focuses pricipally on three main areas, law and regulation - including common rights and registration, inclosure and disputes. These subjects are covered under the themes of nation and local (manorial) law with a historic aspect throughout the study. types <b>of</b> village <b>green</b> - an examination of the wide variety of physical forms and origins covers greens which have been planned partially planned or formed from the residuum of some other landscape feature. distribution - a national database <b>of</b> village <b>greens</b> has made possible the production of national ma ps of these different types <b>of</b> <b>greens</b> together with surviving common rights and greens sorted on ownership types. The principal original contributions {{take the form of a}} collation of the law concerning village greens from diverse sources, a classification of their various types and numerous national and regional distribution maps of the location and types <b>of</b> <b>greens</b> and common rights and classes of owners <b>of</b> the <b>greens</b> resulting from the compilation of a national database <b>of</b> registerd <b>greens...</b>|$|R
