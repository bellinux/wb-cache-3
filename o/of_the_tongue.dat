5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the plica mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> and is part of the lingual septum (septum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue).</b> The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> {{while the majority of}} its length adheres to the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E

5|$|The {{single tooth}} of Trapalcotherium is {{identified}} as a lower molar because it has two longitudinal rows of cusps; as a first molar because it is longer than wide; and as a left tooth because the left side (interpreted as labial, {{in the direction of}} the lips) bears more cusps than the right side (lingual, the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue).</b> The tooth is 2.48mm long and 2.07mm wide.

5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue).</b> Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease.

5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
