5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. One example is in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (<b>One</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not injure others with words, thoughts or acts is named Adrohi).|$|E
5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some of these terms are still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous to the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> it is a larper.|$|E

5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E

25|$|In 1553 Michael Servetus {{published}} {{yet another}} religious work with further anti-trinitarian views. It was entitled Christianismi Restitutio (The Restoration of Christianity), {{a work that}} sharply rejected the idea of predestination as the idea that God condemned souls to Hell regardless of worth or merit. God, insisted Servetus, condemns no <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not condemn himself through thought, word or deed. This work also includes the first published description of the pulmonary circulation.|$|E
25|$|The vǫlur {{were known}} for their art of seduction, {{which was one of}} the reasons why they were {{considered}} dangerous. One of the stanzas in Hávamál warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill. Freyja, who is the mistress of seiðr, has a free sexual life that gives her a bad reputation in certain myths.|$|E
25|$|This thought {{experiment}} has two purposes. First, it {{is intended}} to show that qualia exist. If one agrees with the thought experiment, we believe that Mary gains something after she leaves the room—that she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before. That knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the quale that corresponds to the experience of seeing red, and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties, since {{there is a difference between}} a person who has access to a particular quale and <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} must {{fit their}} context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education {{contributed to their}} calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with {{the rhythm of the}} phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. <b>One</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.|$|E
25|$|But by {{your hard}} and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for {{yourself}} {{on the day of}} wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality.|$|E

For the moksha of all the sons of Sagar, Anshuman(nephew of those 60,000 son) started to pray Brahma to bring Ganga to the earth {{till the end of}} his life, but was not successful. Then his son Dilip did the same but did not succeed. When Bhagiratha (Means, <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> great hard work- he got his name from his great hard work for {{bringing}} Ganga to earth), one of the descendants of Sagara, son of Dilip, learnt of this fate, he vowed to bring Ganga down to Earth so that her waters could cleanse their souls and release them to heaven.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{forgiveness}} is further refined in Hinduism by rhetorically contrasting it in feminine and masculine form. In feminine form, {{one form of}} forgiveness is explained through Lakshmi (called Goddess Sri {{in some parts of}} India); the other form is explained in the masculine form through her husband Vishnu. Feminine Lakshmi forgives even when the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> wrong does not repent. Masculine Vishnu, on the other hand, forgives only when the wrong doer repents. In Hinduism, the feminine forgiveness granted without repentance by Laskmi is higher and more noble than the masculine forgiveness granted only after there is repentance. In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Sita - the wife of King Rama - is symbolically eulogized for forgiving a crow even as it harms her. Later in the epic Ramayana, she is eulogized again for forgiving those who harass her while she has been kidnapped in Lanka. Many other Hindu stories discuss forgiveness with or without repentance.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E
500|$|Approximately thirty parables form {{about one}} third of Jesus' {{recorded}} teachings. The parables appear within longer sermons and at {{other places in the}} narrative. They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the spiritual. Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression. Some of his parables, such as the Prodigal Son (...) , are relatively simple, while others, such as the Growing Seed (...) , are sophisticated, profound and abstruse. When asked by his disciples about why he speaks in parables to the people, Jesus replies that the chosen disciples have been given to [...] "know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven", unlike the rest of their people, [...] "For the one who has will be given more and he will have in abundance. But the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not have will be deprived even more.", going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown [...] "dull hearts" [...] and thus are unable to understand (...)

500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E
