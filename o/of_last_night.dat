500|$|English author Giles Foden in The Guardian called Last Night in Twisted River [...] "a very playful novel": it {{toyed with}} {{character}} and the [...] "fluidity of identity", suggesting that someone may [...] "perform [...] identity rather than be defined by it". Foden said that the whole novel {{could be seen as}} a performance of Irving's own literary identity. More of Irving's [...] "playfulness" [...] manifests itself {{at the end of the}} book when the first sentence of Danny's new book is the same as the first sentence <b>of</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> in Twisted River—Danny is writing the very book we have been reading. And the book cover of a wind-bent pine tree (photographed by Irving's son, Everett) is the same tree Danny and Irving see from the window of their writing shacks in Pointe au Baril Station in Ontario.|$|E
