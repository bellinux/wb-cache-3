500|$|Writing in A Moveable Feast, Hemingway remembered [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", recalling when he [...] "sat in {{a corner}} with the {{afternoon}} light coming in <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and wrote in the notebook.... When I stopped writing I {{did not want to}} leave the river where I could see the trout in the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge. The story was about coming back from the war but {{there was no mention of}} the war in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Akhtar {{is a first}} {{generation}} Pakistani-American born in New York City and raised in Milwaukee. He had previously written and starred in the 2005 film The War Within, in which he portrayed a Pakistani engineering student who became a terrorist. He has studied at Brown University and Columbia University. He had also written the 2012 novel American Dervish, which studies [...] "the Muslim religious experience in America". The son of two foreign-born doctors, he had spent a decade exploring dual identity before writing this play. In order to write this play, Akhtar decided to write from his own experiences. He stated that at a metaphorical level to write this play he had to [...] "turn and look <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> at what I was running away from. And at that moment {{there was an explosion}} of creativity." ...|$|E
500|$|Bennett {{had been}} at first {{slightly}} in awe of Mendelssohn, but no such formality ever attached to Bennett's friendship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night. Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication {{a few weeks later}} with his Fantasie, Op. 16. Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett's music; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, praising amongst other works Bennett's Op. 10 Musical Sketches for piano, [...] "three of Bennett's loveliest pictures". The essay ends: [...] "For some time now he has been peering <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and for the second time he has asked 'But what are you writing?' Dear friend, I shall write no more than: 'If only you knew!'" [...] Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann's music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought [...] "rather too eccentric".|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] I said, {{throwing}} a blanket <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{for the air}} was chilly, [...] "now let us talk," [...] and taking the lantern which Hans had thoughtfully lighted, I held it up and contemplated them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I did {{not think}} of that. My hair is long enough to come down <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> I was going to tell the barber to cut it short all over, but I will see now that he allows for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you no rope, Mr. Dutton, {{to throw}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> shoulders," [...] cried Wychecombe, {{suspending}} his exertions in pure exhaustion, still keeping {{all he had}} gained, with his head projecting outward, over the abyss beneath, and his face turned towards heaven. [...] "Throw a rope <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and drag <b>my</b> body in to the cliff." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cocker, {{alongside}} Jason Buckle, wrote, {{produced and}} sang backing vocals for the track [...] "Worship Me now" [...] on Marc Almond's album The Dancing Marquis (2014). [...] "Jarvis {{is in there}} whispering <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> like the Devil. It's very electro old school" [...] states Almond {{in an interview with}} the Liverpool Echo.|$|E
2500|$|She gave up {{her music}} career after an {{incident}} that occurred on a German television show. [...] "The host said to me, 'Tracey Ullman. Hello!' I said, 'Hello' and he went, 'Guffaw, guffaw. Crazy as ever!' Then I {{was standing in the}} background and he slung a rat <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> I thought, 'That's it, I don't want to do this anymore.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I don't mind {{some kinds}} of pick and shovel work," [...] he said to Percival Serle, [...] "but when I have to throw heavy stuff <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> it gives me rather a wrench." [...] He may have been {{referring}} to the time he spent in the Heyfield area, where he wrote several poems and helped {{in the construction of}} the Lake Glenmaggie weir wall.|$|E
6000|$|As I said this, and as {{the long}} ringlets of red hair fell <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> (contrasting strangely with my dyed face and beard), I formed {{one of the finest}} {{pictures}} that can possibly be conceived, and I recommend it as a subject to Mr. Heath, for the next [...] "Book of Beauty." ...|$|R
6000|$|Glenn showed remorse, {{and kissed}} her before Flo {{in a way that}} made some little amends. [...] "Maybe I overdid it," [...] he said. [...] "But I thought you'd have a {{momentary}} start, you know, enough to make you yell, and then you'd see through it. I only had a sheepskin <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> as I crawled on hands and knees." ...|$|R
60|$|When we came alongside, a low cry ran {{fore and}} aft the deck, and {{everybody}} gazed at us with inquiring eyes. And well they might. To {{say nothing of the}} savage boat's crew, panting with excitement, all gesture and vociferation, my own appearance was calculated to excite curiosity. A robe of the native cloth was thrown <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>my</b> hair and beard were uncut, and I betrayed other evidences of my recent adventure. Immediately on gaining the deck, they beset me on all sides with questions, the half of which I could not answer, so incessantly were they put.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2015, Green {{announced}} that he would be taking a break from social media in order to focus on writing his next book. In August 2016, Green stated that over the next ten months he would be limiting his public appearances in order to finish a draft of the new book. But on September 20, Green took to his YouTube channel that he may not publish another book, citing his current writing experience as [...] "this intense pressure, like people were watching <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> while I was writing".|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been when I was about 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, he {{and several}} other artists contributed to Stuart's [...] "Same Old Train," [...] a cut from the {{collaborative}} album Tribute to Tradition; this song charted at number 59 on Hot Country Songs and won Tritt his second Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. He also performed on Frank Wildhorn's concept album of the musical The Civil War, singing the song [...] "The Day the Sun Stood Still". By year's end, Tritt also released his final Warner Bros. album, No More Looking <b>over</b> <b>My</b> <b>Shoulder.</b> It was his first of four consecutive albums which he produced with Billy Joe Walker, Jr., who is a session guitarist, producer, and New Age musician. The album was led off by the ballad [...] "If I Lost You," [...] which peaked at number 29 on the country charts and number 86 on the Hot 100. Michael Peterson (who recorded for Warner Bros.' Reprise label at the time) co-wrote and sang backing vocals on the title track, which went to number 38 country in early 1999. The album's third and final single was a cover of Jude Cole's [...] "Start the Car" [...] (previously the B-side to [...] "If I Lost You"), which peaked at number 52.|$|E
6000|$|... “‘It {{was awful}} funny—they {{positively}} looked scared to death, {{and while they}} were talking to me they looked <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> as if on their guard against somebody. I asked them {{what they had been}} doing since they left Rockville, and they said not much of anything, just traveling around. They seemed to have plenty of money, for just as I went into the shop I saw Merwell pay for something from a big roll of greenbacks.|$|R
60|$|I rushed out; not {{a single}} man would follow. The bodies of the {{elephants}} that we had killed still {{lay on the ground}} where they had fallen, about four hundred yards from the fort. I descended calmly the hill, a very steep one, and coming to the spot, took my pick of the animals, choosing a tolerably small and plump one, of about thirteen feet high, which the vultures had respected. I threw this animal <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and made for the fort.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{heard this}} noise which I {{immediately}} {{took to be}} a rifle shot. I instinctively turned to my right because the sound appeared to come from <b>over</b> <b>my</b> right <b>shoulder,</b> so I turned to look back <b>over</b> <b>my</b> right <b>shoulder,</b> and I saw nothing unusual except, just people in the crowd, but I did not catch the President {{in the corner of}} my eye, and I was interested, because once I heard the shot in my own mind I identified it as a rifle shot, and I immediately, the only thought that crossed my mind was that this is an assassination attempt." ...|$|R
60|$|George {{came and}} bent <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> I {{could feel the}} heavy warmth of him.|$|E

60|$|Then I {{looked up}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{from the table}} at which I was sitting and I saw him.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} I was {{thoroughly}} awake and had arisen from my blankets. Throwing a kaross <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> I left the hut, made of boughs, in which I was sleeping and walked {{a few paces}} to {{the crest of a}} rocky ridge, whence I could see the dry vlei below. Here the mists of dawn still clung, but from it rose sounds of grunts, bellows and tramplings which I, an old hunter, could not mistake. Evidently a herd of buffalo, one or two hundred of them, had established themselves in those reeds.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a sad}} change when, {{leaving the}} {{brilliant}} reading room where my mind had {{been in contact with}} these masters of scientific world, I crept back to my minute den, there to sit humped and shivering (<b>my</b> overcoat thrown <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders)</b> confronting with scared resentment the sure wasting of my little store of dollars. In spite of all my care, the pennies departed from my pockets like grains of sand from an hour-glass and most disheartening of all I was making no apparent gain toward fitting myself for employment in the west.|$|R
6000|$|The boy obeyed. [...] "I {{was looking}} at the new moon, mother. I saw it <b>over</b> <b>my</b> right <b>shoulder.</b> Did you hear--hear him," [...] he asked, in a broken and husky voice,--"hear how he praised my poetry, mother?" ...|$|R
60|$|The man {{pointed out}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> into the darkness, and far {{on the horizon}} I {{perceived}} three little twinkling lights.|$|E
60|$|I drew {{it from my}} pocket. Guest {{came and}} looked <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Half-way down the list {{he pointed to a}} name.|$|E
60|$|I looked <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Archie's wish {{to get up}} became irresistible, and my {{resolve to}} go on with him {{vanished}} altogether.|$|E
6000|$|... "He rested pretty quiet till {{it might}} want {{a few minutes}} of five, and then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here she is! She's got the shroud again. She's {{unfolding}} it. She's coming out of the corner. She's coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you--one of each side--don't let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time. Don't let her throw it <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Don't let her lift me up to get it round me. She's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he lifted himself up hard, and was dead.|$|R
60|$|My {{hands had}} been dressed twice or thrice in the night, {{and again in}} the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It was bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a cloak, loose <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> and {{fastened}} at the neck. My hair had been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hopped along {{home with}} my ears well back <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> so I could hear if anybody was after me, and was {{thinking}} what a nice time I'd have with some of Mr. Man's carrots that I'd brought in the day before, when what should I stumble over but {{a place on the}} moss which looked as if there'd been mischief of some kind done there lately. I had an idea I could smell blood ever so faintly, but even then I didn't suspect anything was wrong at home till I crept in through the hallway, and there was poor little Sonny Bunny all curled up as if he'd been tied in a knot, while his mother was washing the blood spots off his coat.|$|R
60|$|She did not answer. One of her arms, {{which was}} hanging <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> stole round my neck, and clasped it gently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be silent, donkey. Can I shoot an {{elephant}} backwards <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{with a rifle}} meant for springbuck? Hit the camel! Hit it hard!" ...|$|E
60|$|So we march {{upstairs and}} make tea {{to fill the}} thermos flask. Then, with sack <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> I make {{my way out of}} the Risveglio.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then Lundie goes ahead. [...] "I stooped, {{and caught}} the man round the ankles," [...] he says.

5000|$|The gangs {{agree that}} the day would still be divided between them as it had always been. Kilkijan said: [...] "You will {{recognize}} me by two rays of dawn sunlight: one <b>over</b> <b>my</b> right <b>shoulder,</b> the other in front of me". The gangs continued to roam the countryside until they both ended up in Point Prison in Durban.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was in {{the middle}} of the night when he returned. Midnight had come and gone, and every one in the monastery was asleep, when the hoarse, clanging bell down in the yard rang slightly, as though pulled by feeble fingers. I threw <b>my</b> cloak <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and descended to admit him. When the last of the huge bolts had been withdrawn, and I threw the door open, I found him leaning against the wall, with his fingers {{clutched}} together in agony, and his bloodless features convulsed with pain. The moonlight was falling right across his face, pale and ghastly with pain, and by its light I seemed to see something dark dropping from him on the white flags. I leaned forward, horror-stricken, and I saw that it was blood." ...|$|R
