5|$|Despite Kabuto {{claiming}} that the technique is flawless, it does have several flaws, including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to willingly drift back to the afterlife. Those who are paralyzed, sealed, <b>or</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> certain genjutsu, such as Komo Amatsukami: Koto, cannot take further action to free themselves until the technique is canceled. Also, the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so they will remain among the living even after the jutsu is canceled, as shown by Madara Uchiha. Furthermore, if such a ninja who lost a body part while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu, the living equivalent of that ninja's body part is absent.|$|E
5|$|After the {{breakdown}} of the Bohemian Revolt the residents of Silesia, including the Polish gentry in Upper Silesia, were subjected to severe repressions and Counter-Reformational activities, including forced expulsions of thousands of Silesians, many of whom ended up in Poland. Later during the war years the province was repeatedly ravaged in the course of military campaigns crossing its territory, and at one point a Protestant leader, Piast Duke John Christian of Brieg, appealed to Władysław IV Vasa for assuming supremacy over Silesia. King Władysław, although a tolerant ruler including in matters of religion, was like his father disinclined to involve the Commonwealth in the Thirty Years' War. He ended up getting as fiefs from the Emperor the duchies of Opole and Racibórz in 1646, twenty years later reclaimed by the Empire. The Peace of Westphalia allowed the Habsburgs to do as they pleased in Silesia, already completely ruined by the war, which had resulted in intense persecution of Protestants, including the Polish Lower Silesia communities, forced to emigrate <b>or</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> Germanization.|$|E

25|$|An {{economic}} depression {{that began in}} 1972 was exacerbated by capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward. Joint public-private public works projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was nationalized. Many enterprises within the copper, coal, iron, nitrate, and steel industries were expropriated, nationalized, <b>or</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.|$|E

25|$|It can be {{inferred}} from the report of Aristoxenus about Plato's lecture 'On the Good,' that {{a discussion of the}} nature of numbers occupied an important part of Plato's argument.

Plato distinguished between the numbers used in mathematics and the metaphysical Forms of numbers.

Like other hot-bloods, Arabians' sensitivity and intelligence enable quick learning and greater communication with their riders; however, their intelligence also allows them to learn bad habits as quickly as good ones, {{and they do not}} tolerate inept or abusive training practices. Some sources claim that it is more difficult to train a [...] "hot-blooded" [...] horse. Though most Arabians have a natural tendency to cooperate with humans, when treated badly, like any horse, they can become excessively nervous or anxious, but seldom become vicious unless seriously spoiled <b>or</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> extreme abuse.

2500|$|The {{most common}} imaging mode {{collects}} low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are {{ejected from the}} k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few nanometers from the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, <b>or</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons [...] "escape" [...] from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the [...] "escape" [...] distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons image resolution less than 0.5nbsp&nm is possible.|$|E
