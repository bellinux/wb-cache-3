25|$|The use of raptors in {{the hunting}} of wolves is {{primarily}} practised in Central Asia. The Kyrgyz people have traditionally used golden eagles, known as berkut, to hunt wolves. In the past, wolf pelts provided material for clothes {{crucial for the}} survival of the nomadic people in the severe colds. The eagles are used to immobilize the wolves by placing one foot {{at the back of the}} neck and another at the flank closer to the heart and lungs. Hunters usually only use eagles against pups, as an adult wolf can cripple in combat even a highly experienced eagle. Losing even one toe or talon will significantly lower the eagle's ability to tackle prey. Only a minor injury to the sinew of a foot may leave the eagle incapable of further hunting. As a wolf is capable of resisting even the best-trained bird, the falconer always keeps near, ready at the first <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the eagle. This is done carefully, as the wolf, sensing human presence, fights desperately to tear loose from the bird's talons, and the eagle can be severely injured. Because of the violent nature of their work, eagles trained to hunt wolves have shorter life spans.|$|E
25|$|Things {{started to}} look up for the Dutch in the naval war also. Both {{countries}} had {{each other in a}} strategic death-grip. The English might be stronger in their home waters, but as in the first Anglo-Dutch conflict, the Dutch were able to close down English communications farther afield. This time also, the Danes joined the war on the Dutch side, shored up by a Dutch fleet, and closed the Sound to English shipping and trade. The Hanseatics, on the other hand, ostensibly neutral, helped the Dutch circumvent any English blockades. In the Mediterranean the parties made trade impossible for each other. In the East Indies the VOC swept the EIC from the seas and took this <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> itself to the last remaining English toeholds in the Indonesian archipelago. In other words, English trade was devastated, with predictable results for the economy, and for Charles' finances. This was the crucial factor. The English might arguably win a few more naval battles, and even inflict appreciable damage, as in the raid by admiral Holmes in August, 1666, but the end was never in doubt. The strangulating grip of the Dutch blockade got worse by the day, even preventing coal from Newcastle reaching cold Londoners during the winter of 1666.|$|E

500|$|Honeychile Rider is one {{of three}} women in the Bond canon who have been scarred by rape. This follows a pattern where the women Bond comes across are somehow {{different}} to the norm, although Black points out that this gives Bond an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> and save both Rider and the others. Other female characters in the Bond series have flaws, and Rider has a broken nose—the result of the rape she suffered. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett, in their analysis of the roles of women in the Bond novels, consider that Rider is [...] "not archetypically feminine", but is [...] "constructed according to the formula 'equal but yet subordinate'." [...] Rider is described in the book as having buttocks like a boy, which brought a response from Fleming's friend Noël Coward that [...] "I was also slightly shocked by the lascivious announcement that Honeychile's bottom was like a boy's. I know that we are all becoming more broadminded nowadays, but really old chap what could you have been thinking of?" ...|$|E
500|$|They {{believed}} in empowering children by {{practices such as}} greeting their audience members with [...] "Hello, everyone", instead of [...] "Hello, boys and girls" [...] because as Paul Field has explained, the second greeting [...] "unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension". Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to [...] "Wake Up Jeff" [...] when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was [...] "very much {{in keeping with the}} way they work with children". [...] Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives. [...] Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that [...] "it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything". [...] Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles' audience felt [...] "great excitement" [...] and were disappointed if not given the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Jeff in this way. [...] Anthony Field, who called it [...] "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done {{since the start of the}} group", claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. [...] The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because [...] "it was a perfect fit". [...] When Fatt retired, Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} several live {{televised}} performances, Carey included [...] "Hero" [...] on the set-lists {{on all of}} her tours, usually serving {{as one of the}} closing numbers. In an interview, Carey said that although it is not one of her favorite songs, she tries to perform it on each of her shows due to its powerful message, fearing that if she doesn't, she might miss out on the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> someone. She first performed the song in concert during her stateside Music Box Tour. During the song's recital, Carey donned a black gown and matching sandals, while sporting her signature golden locks of the time. During her performances at the Tokyo Dome on her Daydream World Tour (1996), Carey performed the song as one of the closing numbers. Prior to the song, Carey introduced Afanasieff, who played the organ throughout the tour. Carey appeared on stage with a straightened hairstyle, and a long black evening gown. On her Butterfly World Tour in 1998, Carey performed [...] "Hero" [...] as the eighth song on the set-list. Unlike her previous tour, Afanasieff was not present, due to the pair's continued personal dispute. During the song, Carey was backed up by three vocalists, and wore a long sequined black gown. In 2000, during her Rainbow World Tour, Carey used [...] "Hero" [...] as the tour's closing number, leaving the stage to meet and greet fans during the song's performance. Similarly, [...] "Hero" [...] served as the closing number on her Charmbracelet World Tour (2002–03), where she wore a long beige gown and feathered frock tail. In 2006, during The Adventures of Mimi Tour, Carey performed [...] "Hero" [...] as the penultimate song on the set-list. She wore a blue floor-length mid-bearing gown, and received vocal back up from four background singers. Following the release of her twelfth studio effort, Carey embarked on the Angels Advocate Tour. After performing the regular set-list, Carey exited the arena, only to make one re-entry for [...] "Hero" [...] as the encore performance. She also performed the song regularly as a part of her 2014 The Elusive Chanteuse Show world tour, and her first annual Christmas show at New York City's Beacon Theater, entitled All I Want For Christmas Is You, A Night of Joy & Festivity. In addition, she included the song in her 2015 Las Vegas residency, Mariah Carey Number 1's, a chronicle of her 18 US number 1 hits. The song was performed 8th in her setlist. She sang on a circular platform on the stage, donning a short white dress.|$|E

Since Pope Benedict XV and the Russian Revolution of 1917, which crushed the Russian Orthodox Church and was regarded by Catholics as a historical <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Russian Christians with aid [...] "and conversion", Rome was anxious about ending the thousand-year East-West Schism that separated Christianity.|$|E
