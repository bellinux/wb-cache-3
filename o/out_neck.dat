6000|$|The {{crunch of}} the brougham brought his ceaseless march over the carpet to an end. He {{went out into}} the hall and looked into the doctor's face--he had {{forgotten}} that this old fellow knew nothing of his special reason for deadly fear. Then he turned back into his study. The wild south wind brought wet drift-leaves whirling against the panes. It was here that he had stood looking out into the dark, when Fiorsen came down to ask for Gyp a year ago. Why had he not bundled the fellow <b>out</b> <b>neck</b> and crop, and taken her away?--India, Japan--anywhere would have done! She had not loved that fiddler, never really loved him. Monstrous--monstrous! The full bitterness of having missed right action swept over Winton, and he positively groaned aloud. He moved from the window and went over to the bookcase; there in one row were the few books he ever read, and he took one out. [...] "Life of General Lee." [...] He put it back and took another, a novel of Whyte Melville's: [...] "Good for Nothing." [...] Sad book--sad ending! The book dropped from his hand and fell with a flump on the floor. In a sort of icy discovery, he had seen his life as it would be if for a second time he had to bear such loss. She must not--could not die! If she did--then, for him--! In old times they buried a man with his horse and his dog, as if {{at the end of a}} good run. There was always that! The extremity of this thought brought relief. He sat down, and, for a long time, stayed staring into the fire in a sort of coma. Then his feverish fears began again. Why the devil didn't they come and tell him something, anything--rather than this silence, this deadly solitude and waiting? What was that? The front door shutting. Wheels? Had that hell-hound of an old doctor sneaked off? He started up. There at the door was Markey, holding in his hand some cards. Winton scanned them.|$|E
50|$|Poor posture is {{the result}} of {{musculoskeletal}} distortion in the neck, and lower and upper back. Most people think of poor posture as simply slumping over, but that is not necessarily the case. Due to the variety of body types, incorrect posture differs from person to person. One person's proper posture can be incorrect posture for someone else and vice versa. Nevertheless, there are ways to determine poor posture. Some of the classic signs of poor posture include having a pot belly, rounded shoulders, and a jutted <b>out</b> <b>neck</b> and chin. Pot bellies result when the lower back experiences an exaggerated curve, thus pushing the internal organs, in the abdominal region of the body, toward the anterior of the body. Rounded shoulders and postural neck problems result from the excessive anterior curve of the cervical and thoracic spine.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vallecular cysts are {{an unusual}} cause of {{congenital}} stridor. OBJECTIVE: To describe the imaging findings in five patients, {{with emphasis on}} the usefulness of sonographic studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 2007, five patients with a cystic lesion situated in the anterior neck, at the vallecular space, were seen in our institution. Clinical records and imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: All patients presented with persistent inspiratory stridor that was present from {{the first week of}} life. Neck US was performed as part of the investigations in four and showed a vallecular cyst. The diagnosis was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy in four infants and CT in one; all were resected. Pathology showed a multilayered epithelial border with normal thickness and differentiation; there were no signs of malignancy. CONCLUSION: Although vallecular cysts are very rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital stridor. When the commonest causes have been ruled <b>out,</b> <b>neck</b> US may be diagnostic. The diagnosis can be confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy or further imaging such as CT or MRI. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hip {{fracture}} is {{a severe}} health burden {{in the elderly}} population. In order to prevent, it is to evaluate the bone strength by establishing the relation between bone mineral density (BMD), neck strength, and geometry. Materials and Methods: The subjects under study were 100 postmenopausal women who visited bone clinic of Bharat Scan Centre. After recording general profile such as age, body mass index (BMI), geometric measures such as hip axis length (HAL), neck shaft angle (NSA), and neck width (NW) were measured from digital X-ray. For the same individuals, BMD was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. From the DXA print <b>out</b> <b>neck</b> strength was calculated using the formula = sectional modulus/HAL. Results: The correlation test was analyzed among BMD, neck strength, anthropometric, and geometric factors using Statistical packages for social services (SPSS) software. BMD is inversely related with age and positively correlated with height, weight, and BMI. HAL, NSA, and NW had a weaker association with BMD. Age, BMD, and NSA had a negative relation with neck strength. HAL and NW had a positive relation with neck strength. Conclusion: Noninvasive means of associating neck strength with BMD and geometry will provide improved estimates for fracture risk beyond any other invasive method of assessing bone mineral properties...|$|E
40|$|Harvey Brough - MUSIC ON THE MIND - Research Output Libretto by Justin Butcher, {{commissioned}} by Vox Holloway, London MUSIC ON THE MIND has been performed twice, once in London in November 2015 {{and once in}} Southampton, December 2016. Both performances featured the Britten Sinfonia, professional soloists Clara Sanabras and Nicholas Garrett, directed by the composer In London these forces were joined by the 110 strong Vox Holloway Community Choir and the 20 singers of the Mind and Soul choir (based at the Maudesley Hospital and consisting of service users, staff and their families). In Southampton, {{they were joined by}} the University of Southampton Voices (the university community choir) and a specially formed group of local service users, health workers and their familes and friends) - Mind and Soul II choir, which had 20 members. The London performance raised funds for two charities - Islington Mind and the Soundwell Music therapy charity. The Southampton concert raised funds for Mind Southampton. Equally important though is the impact of the piece in encouraging openness and discussion about mental health issues, a subject that is still considered difficult or even taboo. “The phrase 'mental health' is such a tricky one to hear or to use without feeling somehow downcast. Why? We're perfectly happy to bang on about our sore backs or our stressed <b>out</b> <b>neck</b> and shoulder areas. We all have physical health and we all have mental health. Sometimes they're in good nick and sometimes they're not. It's fantastically refreshing to have visionaries like Harvey Brough and Justin Butcher commit their art to an examination of one of our most precious possessions. Our minds. ” Emma Thompson, Vox Holloway patron The piece consists of two halves - the first section being new settings of poetry from across the ages, about madness - or poetry by people who were thought to be mad in their time. For instance: Tom o’ Bedlam (medieval - anonymous) about a famished madman from the Bedlam asylum wandering the streets begging for food and clothing I am - John Clare’s wonderful poem touching on existential identity Kubla Khan - Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s opium fuelled masterpiece Mad Girl’s Love Song - Sylvia Plath’s bleakly humorous look at reality Much madness is divinest sense - Emily Dickinson’s short poem is woven in as a refrain through the first half The second half is based on Kay Redfield Jamison’s influential book AN UNQUIET MIND, which tells the story of her journey through bipolar disorder (or manic depression, the term she still prefers). Rendered into blank verse by Justin Butcher, this is a roller coaster composition - at times hilariously funny, the next moment shockingly harrowing. The piece is scored for Mezzo Solo, Baritone solo, chamber ensemble - Cb, Vln, Piano, Harp, Percussion and Trumpet, + two Choirs (Unison and SATB...|$|E
