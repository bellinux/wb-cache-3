5|$|On 11 September 1944, the USAAF {{released}} General <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirements</b> {{for a day}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of 600mph (521kn, 966km/h), combat radius of 705miles (612nmi, 1,135km), and armament of either six 0.50in (12.7mm) or four 0.60in (15.2mm) machine guns. In addition, the new aircraft had to use the General Electric TG-180 axial turbojet which entered production as the Allison J35.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirements</b> Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based ballistic missiles, which became the focus of the committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} {{gradually}} superseded on top link expresses during the 1940s by {{growing numbers of}} Bulleid Pacifics, although throughout the 1950s they were frequently called upon during peak periods or to deputise for failures. The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson surplus to <b>operational</b> <b>requirements,</b> and they were gradually phased out of service. The entire class was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, Raw was {{appointed}} Director of <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirements</b> at the Department of Air. In 1969 he headed an evaluation team tasked with selecting a heavy lift helicopter for the RAAF. The team {{was faced with a}} choice between the Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion, and Raw's final report recommended acquiring CH-53s. The RAAF's governing Air Board and senior Army officers rejected this recommendation, and CH-47s were purchased instead after Air Vice Marshal Charles Read also reviewed the performance of the two helicopters and concluded that the Chinook better met Australia's needs. Raw remained the Director of <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirements</b> until 1970 when he became the commandant of the RAAF Staff College. In 1972 he was promoted to air commodore and assumed command of RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. Raw held this position until 1976 when he returned to Australia and became the senior training and staff officer in the headquarters of RAAF Support Command. This was his final military posting; he retired from the Air Force on 28 February 1978.|$|E
5|$|As group captain, Read {{commanded}} No. 82 Wing at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, from February 1957 to July 1960, flying English Electric Canberra jet bombers. He {{was awarded}} the Air Force Cross in the 1960 New Year Honours. Read then served as Director of <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirements</b> at the Department of Air in Canberra. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1964 New Year Honours for his work introducing aircraft and weapons systems into the Air Force, including two overseas missions for aircraft and equipment selection. In December 1964 {{he was promoted to}} air commodore, and the following year attended the Imperial Defence College in London. Read was made Officer Commanding RAAF Base Point Cook in January 1966, simultaneously holding the appointment of Commandant of RAAF Academy. He then served as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Richmond from March 1968 to July 1969.|$|E
5|$|By late 1961, Hawker {{had been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, official support emerged {{in the form of the}} <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirements</b> branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} World War II, Eaton led No.81 Wing in Japan, and No.78 Wing in Malta. He commanded RAAF Base Williamtown from 1957 to 1959, {{after which he}} was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. As Director-General of <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirements</b> in 1965, Eaton argued for increased RAAF co-operation with the Australian Army in light of growing involvement in the Vietnam War. He was promoted to air vice marshal the next year, and became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. Posted to Singapore as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) No.224 Group RAF in 1967, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his work {{as chief of staff}} at Headquarters RAF Far East Air Force in 1969. He then served as Air Member for Personnel, before being selected as AOC Operational Command in 1973. Eaton retired from the RAAF in December that year, and became an executive for Rolls-Royce in Canberra. He died in 1992 at the age of 75.|$|E
5|$|Military {{ambulances}} {{have historically}} included vehicles based on civilian designs {{and at times}} also included armored, but unarmed, vehicles ambulances based upon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). In the Second World War vehicles such as the Hanomag Sd Kfz 251 halftrack were pressed into service as ad hoc ambulances, and in more recent times purpose built AFVs such as the U.S. M1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle serve the exclusive purpose of armored medical vehicles. Civilian based designs may be painted in appropriate colours, depending on the <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> (i.e. camouflage for field use, white for United Nations peacekeeping, etc.). For example, the British Royal Army Medical Corps has a fleet of white ambulances, based on production trucks. Military helicopters have also served both as ad hoc and purpose-built air ambulances, since they are extremely useful for MEDEVAC.|$|E
5|$|OR229 was {{approved}} by the <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirements</b> Committee on 17 December 1946, and the Ministry of Supply sent out letters inviting tenders on 8 January 1947. Three bombers resulted from OR229: the Vickers Valiant, Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, known as the V bombers. The high priority accorded to the atomic bomb programme was not shared by the V bomber programme. Vickers was given the first production order for 25 Valiants on 9 February 1951, and they were delivered on 8 February 1955. The Vulcan and Victor followed, entering service in 1956 and 1957 respectively. Thus, when the first Blue Danube atomic bombs were delivered to the Bomber Command Armaments School at RAF Wittering on 7 and 11 November 1953, the RAF had no bombers capable of carrying them. For the time being, the United Kingdom remained dependent on the American nuclear umbrella.|$|E

5|$|Raised {{to acting}} {{squadron}} leader, Steege was given {{command of the}} newly arrived No.450 Squadron at Rayak, Lebanon, on 31May 1941. The assignment was a challenging one, as the <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> of existing forces, and the RAAF Air Board's insistence on staffing ArticleXV squadrons such as No.450 with Australian Empire Air Training Scheme aircrew rather than Permanent Air Force members, meant that the unit was short of experienced pilots. Steege was mentioned in despatches on 24September 1941 for his leadership of the squadron. By December, it was at nominal strength and equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks; it commenced combat operations out of Gambut and ElAdem, Libya, and began registering victories in February 1942. Steege himself scored a confirmed victory over a Messerschmitt Bf109 on 28March. His final tally in the Middle Eastern theatre was eight enemy aircraft destroyed, two probables and five damaged. He returned to Australia a temporary wing commander in December 1942.|$|E
5|$|The United States Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM, NAVSOC, or NSWC) was {{commissioned}} April 16, 1987, at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in San Diego as the Naval component to the United States Special Operations Command. Naval Special Warfare Command provides vision, leadership, doctrinal guidance, resources and oversight to ensure component {{special operations forces}} are ready to meet the <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> of combatant commanders. Today, SEAL Teams and Special Boat Teams comprise the elite combat units of Naval Special Warfare. These teams are organized, trained, and equipped to conduct a variety of missions to include direct action, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, foreign internal defense, unconventional warfare and support psychological and civil affairs operations. Their highly trained operators are deployed worldwide in support of National Command Authority objectives, conducting operations with other conventional and special operations forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{was accepted by}} the defence <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> committee in August 1978, and the project was given the procurement designation of SEA 1114. Approval for the development phase {{of the project was}} given in the 1981–82 federal budget. The RAN had four main requirements: that the submarines were tailored to operating conditions in the Australasian region, that they be equipped with a combat system advanced enough to promote a long service life, that appropriate and sustainable infrastructure be established in Australia to construct the boats, then provide maintenance and technical support for their operational lifespan, and that the submarines were capable of peacetime and emergency operations in addition to their hunter-killer role. Ten submarines were envisioned, a number which was revised to between four and eight boats by the start of 1983, and later settled on the acquisition of six submarines, with the option to order two more.|$|E

5|$|The {{units of}} the field armies, {{including}} palatini, comitatenses, and sometimes pseudocomitatenses, were based in cities when not on campaign, and could be based in temporary camps when on campaign. But it seems that did not usually occupy purpose-built accommodation like the city-based limitanei. From the legal evidence, it seems they were normally compulsorily billeted in private houses (hospitalitas). This is because they often wintered in different provinces. The comitatus praesentales accompanied their respective emperors on campaign, while even the regional comitatus would change their winter quarters according to <b>operational</b> <b>requirements.</b> However, in the 5th century, emperors rarely campaigned in person, so the praesentales became more static in their winter bases. The Western comitatus praesentalis normally was based in and around Mediolanum (Milan) and the two Eastern comitatus {{in the vicinity of}} Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|While {{financial}} backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support {{development of the}} Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding. While HSA chose {{to go ahead with}} the P.1127 as a private venture, the Air Staff disagreed heavily over what requirements should be set out for a future RAF VTOL aircraft; some officers, such as the Chief of the Air Staff Sir Thomas Pike, advocated simplicity while others, such as the RAF <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> division, sought various performance demands of such an aircraft, particularly the capacity for supersonic flight. HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of a more sophisticated development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be more attractive to customers, there being a general perception at the time that supersonic aircraft held significantly more value their subsonic counterparts.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} find a {{replacement}} for the 2 BAe 146s, Drukair management fielded submissions from Airbus, Boeing and Embraer to determine their products' suitability to meet Drukair's stringent <b>operational</b> <b>requirements.</b> Bombardier was also invited by management to demonstrate the CRJ900 regional jet, however, the airline was advised by Bombardier the aircraft would be unsuited for operations at Paro. In February 2002, the Airbus A319 became the largest aircraft to ever land at Paro Airport, when Airbus demonstrated the aircraft to the airline. By October, Boeing had withdrawn from the competition due to {{not being able to}} source an aircraft to demonstrate to the airline. With the Embraer E-190 yet to fly, it was expected that Drukair would order the A319. However, the government had concerns regarding financing for the purchase, and in October the final decision was delayed. After a short period of time, the government instructed management to begin evaluations once again, and a Boeing 737–700 conducted eleven test flights at Paro Airport in February 2003, in which it was demonstrated it met the requirements of the airline for operation into Paro.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{temporal}} object-oriented data models {{deal with the}} problem of preserving the history of changes. In practice, an application may not want to preserve the changes made to all time-varying objects. In this paper we present a model to identify the history requirements during an object-oriented analysis. The difficulty of modelling history requirements comes from the number of objects of the application that might be connected to a given object, at a given time, either by method calls or associations. Rather than preserving the histories of all time-varying objects, this model proposes that objects are selected on the ground of <b>operational</b> <b>requirement.</b> A taxonomy of four types of <b>operational</b> <b>requirement</b> is proposed. Once the <b>operational</b> <b>requirement</b> has been identified, the type of association or method call that exist between the objects is used to select the time-varying objects which are candidates for having their history preserved.
