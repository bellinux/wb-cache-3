5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have cracks in <b>outer</b> <b>wing</b> ribs and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
5|$|Fuel {{was carried}} in 14 bag tanks, {{four in the}} centre {{fuselage}} above and {{to the rear of}} the nosewheel bay and five in each <b>outer</b> <b>wing.</b> The tanks were split into four groups of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine though cross-feeding was possible. The centre of gravity was automatically maintained by electric timers which sequenced the booster pumps on the tanks. B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb-bay.|$|E
5|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was lost}} in a crash at NAS China Lake on 13 October 1944. Investigation showed that the wing structure was {{not strong enough to}} resist compressibility effects. This was cured by doubling the number of rivets in the <b>outer</b> <b>wing</b> panels. The second prototype crashed on 25 March 1945 when the pilot failed to recover from a dive from , probably also due to compressibility effects. The third prototype crashed on 5 April when the canopy blew off during a high-speed pass over Lindbergh Field.|$|E

5|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} a spar on the front left of the wing separated, quickly followed by the lower rear spar and the connections which attached the <b>outer</b> <b>wing</b> to the center section. The loss of the left wing caused the aircraft to roll left, whereupon the fuselage and the right horizontal stabilizer collided with the separated wing. The initial separation was caused either by a wind gust in excess of operating velocity, or a similar lower-velocity gust after the material had become fatigued.|$|E
5|$|Like Conrad von Soest, Lochner often applied black {{cross-hatching}} on gold, {{usually to}} render metallic {{objects such as}} brooches, crowns or buckles, in imitation of goldsmiths work on precious objects such as reliquaries and chalices. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, {{and it has been}} suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith. Evidence of his imitation of elements of their craft is apparent even in his underdrawings. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement, and Gabriel's clasp on the <b>outer</b> <b>wing</b> of the Dombild altarpiece.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} {{can usually be}} distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the <b>outer</b> <b>wing.</b> The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuselage}} is a monocoque design. The <b>outer</b> <b>wings</b> are detachable {{to facilitate}} transportation to an airport. To simplify construction, each wing rib {{is a single}} piece and slides onto the main spar. This technique helps in rib alignment. The main spar utilizes a special channel that allows the <b>outer</b> <b>wings</b> to flex and minimizes the amount of material required to brace the wings. Additionally, the airplane is not equipped with flaps. The tail features an all flying tailplane, or stabilator.|$|R
5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the <b>outer</b> <b>wing</b> guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Korean houses can be {{structured}} into an inner wing (안채, anchae) and an <b>outer</b> <b>wing</b> (사랑채, sarangchae). The individual layout largely {{depends on the}} region and the wealth of the family. Whereas aristocrats used the <b>outer</b> <b>wing</b> for receptions, poorer people kept cattle in the sarangchae. The wealthier a family, the larger the house. However, it was forbidden to any family except for the king to have a residence of more than 99 kan. A kan is the distance between two pillars used in traditional houses.|$|E

5000|$|The master {{acquired}} his pseudonym {{from the}} panels he painted for the <b>outer</b> <b>wings</b> {{of the altar}} to Mary in the brick gothic cathedral of Saint John in Malchin. These paintings are similar in style to works by Master Francke, and were at first associated with the <b>outer</b> <b>wings</b> of the altar of Saint George in Wismar, [...] and also with fragments of a crucifixion altar from St. Mary's Church in Rostock. However, {{the wings of the}} Three Kings altar in St. John's Church, Rostock, are now attributed to a different artist.|$|R
25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion to the fuselage, the wings were made up of three large units: centre section, port <b>outer</b> <b>wing</b> and {{starboard}} <b>outer</b> <b>wing,</b> which were in turn subdivided. Each section was built up around a main girder spar, leading edge section and trailing edge section. The wing made use of wingtip slots and hydraulically-actuated trailing edge flaps; both the flaps and ailerons incorporated stress-bearing D-spars. According to Moyes, {{the configuration of the}} wing was a key feature of Hampden, being highly tapered and designed to exert low levels of drag; these attributes were responsible for the aircraft's high top speed for the era of 265 MPH while retaining a reasonably low landing speed of 73 MPH.|$|E
25|$|The C.180 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} undercarriage.

50|$|The {{annunciation}} dominates {{any other}} theme on the <b>outer</b> <b>wings</b> of Northern 15th-century polyptychs. The tradition originates from Byzantine art, with van Eyck {{largely responsible for}} re-popularising the practice. Along with his Ghent Altarpiece, the Dresden Triptych {{is one of the}} earliest surviving examples of the technique, and on this basis he is usually credited as the innovator of a motif that became almost standard from the mid-15th century. As the annunciation marks the incarnation of Christ, its representation on the <b>outer</b> <b>wings</b> gives symmetry to the scenes of his life typically detailed on the inner panels.|$|R
