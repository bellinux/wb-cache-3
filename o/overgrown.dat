5|$|Janáček is {{the central}} {{character}} in David Herter's First Republic trilogy, comprising the novels On the <b>Overgrown</b> Path, The Luminous Depths and One Who Disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Extra seating was {{provided}} in 2006 following {{action by the}} Severnside Community Rail Partnership, and in 2008 <b>overgrown</b> foliage was cleared from the car park to improve sightlines and help with security. The station was repainted at the same time, and decorated with silhouettes of students from Backwell School. The embankment suffered subsidence in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Structure A-14 {{is covered}} by the forest that has <b>overgrown</b> the {{northern}} part of the Central Plaza. It is a range structure running north-south and once had a hieroglyphic stairway detailing Seibal's defeat by Dos Pilas, although the inscriptions have now been removed to the old project camp. The structure was found to contain an elite female burial, labelled as Burial1.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} on an east-west alignment, curving towards the north. There is a single -long {{platform}} which serves trains in both directions, situated {{on the north side}} of the track. The station's southern platform was abandoned in 1970 and is <b>overgrown.</b> The station is only accessible via a footpath from the car park on Station Road, which is just off the A4 Portway.|$|E
5|$|American {{explorer}} John Lloyd Stephens and English architect Frederick Catherwood {{visited the}} site in 1840, at which {{time it was a}} confused jumble of <b>overgrown</b> ruins. Stephens published a description of the archaeological remains a year later. Catherwood did not draw any of the structures due to the poor state of the remains. The two excavated one of the mounds and recovered some ceramic vessels, which Catherwood drew.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 2010 Buckton Castle was {{investigated}} by archaeologists, first the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford's Centre for Applied Archaeology {{as part of}} the Tameside Archaeology Survey. More than 60 volunteers were involved in the project. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and close to the Buckton Vale Quarry. The castle is <b>overgrown</b> with heather and peat, and there are no above-ground ruins.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{adapt to}} various {{habitats}}. Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, <b>overgrown</b> farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees, and parks. It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|E
5|$|In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster {{bought the}} castle. For over a century, Bodiam Castle and its {{associated}} manor descended through the Webster family. It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin <b>overgrown</b> with ivy. Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hosting photosynthesizing endosymbionts, sponges are noted for their {{wide range of}} collaborations with other organisms. The relatively large encrusting sponge Lissodendoryx colombiensis is most common on rocky surfaces, but has extended its range into seagrass meadows by letting itself be surrounded or <b>overgrown</b> by seagrass sponges, which are distasteful to the local starfish and therefore protect Lissodendoryx against them; in return the seagrass sponges get higher positions away from the sea-floor sediment.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an <b>overgrown</b> pond.|$|E
5|$|Land {{immediately}} {{south of}} the priory {{was used by the}} Chaloners for formal gardens attached to Old Gisborough Hall. In the early 18th century they planted an oval-shaped double avenue of trees, the Monks' Walk, where stonework recovered from mid-19th century excavations was deposited. In between the trees was a manicured lawn used to hold musical and theatrical productions. The Monks' Walk fell into disuse and became <b>overgrown</b> but is under restoration by the Gisborough Priory Project.|$|E
5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force {{caught sight of the}} raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into an <b>overgrown</b> swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E
5|$|The Great Southern Group {{dismantled}} much of {{what remained}} of the company. Frederick W. Paine was detached from the LNC, along with the specialist division overseeing the exhumation and relocation of existing burial grounds to allow property development on formerly consecrated sites. All that remained of the LNC was Brookwood Cemetery itself, by this time moribund and becoming heavily <b>overgrown.</b> Considered virtually worthless, Great Southern sold the LNC to property speculators Maximillian Investments in July 1973 for £400,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the line, between Llangefni and Amlwch, looks set to be preserved as a heritage railway, with Network Rail giving licence to Anglesey Central Railway Limited to begin clearing the <b>overgrown</b> line north of Llangefni. ACR started to clear vegetation from the line in Llangefni before Christmas 2012. ACR Limited's support group, Lein Amlwch, have also opened a small shop, cafe and heritage centre in Llanerchymedd's station building, which will be open during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} on an {{alignment}} of approximately 160 degrees, curving towards the south. There is a single -long platform which serves trains in both directions, situated {{on the east side}} of the track. The station's western platform was abandoned in 1970 and is <b>overgrown.</b> A user-worked level crossing at the north end of the station allows vehicles and pedestrians to cross the railway, alternatively pedestrians may cross the line using a footpath which goes under the bridge over the River Trym.|$|E
5|$|After Margaret's death, {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be owned by the Dacre family until the death of Randal Dacre in 1634, when it passed briefly to the Crown. By 1675 the castle had become derelict and was restored by the then Lord Dacre, Thomas Lennard. A new entrance to the castle was constructed and square, 17th-century windows installed. After Thomas's death in 1715 the castle was sold to Edward Hassell. The condition of the castle deteriorated again in the 18th century, becoming <b>overgrown</b> and dilapidated, and by the 19th century the Hassell family were {{using it as a}} farmhouse.|$|E
5|$|Although sea lochs are the boobries' natural {{home they}} will shelter on land in <b>overgrown</b> heather. Accounts are {{inconsistent}} {{as to the}} extent of the boobrie's habitat. Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Anderitum {{fell into}} ruin {{following}} {{the end of}} the Roman occupation but was reoccupied in 1066 by the Normans, for whom it became a key strategic bulwark. A stone keep and fortification was built within the Roman walls and faced several sieges. Although its garrison was twice starved into surrender, it was never successfully stormed. The castle was occupied more or less continuously until the 16th century, apart from a possible break in the early 13th century when it was slighted. It had been abandoned again by the late 16th century and remained a crumbling, partly <b>overgrown</b> ruin until it was acquired by the state in 1925.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and <b>overgrown</b> with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E
5|$|Duxford {{was officially}} {{returned}} to the RAF on 1 December 1945. It remained a fighter station but by 1958 changing defence priorities saw the RAF's fighter force move to more northerly bases. Duxford's last operational flight was made in July 1961. No longer operational, the site gradually became increasingly derelict and <b>overgrown.</b> In 1968 the American film studio United Artists obtained {{permission to use the}} site for the filming of Battle of Britain. During the shoot a single bay hangar, which had been built during the First World War, was demolished to simulate an air raid. After the Ministry of Defence announced its intention to dispose of Duxford plans were drawn up for various developments including two Young Offenders Institutes but were not implemented.|$|E
5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} {{has been}} converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become an <b>overgrown</b> forestry road. From Eikeland to Tveite, the line {{has been converted}} to a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was {{in the way of a}} new road.|$|E
5|$|It {{was still}} garrisoned in the mid-1620s and was {{probably}} still in active {{service at the}} start of the English Civil War between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament in 1642. Captain Swaley, a Parliamentary naval commander, seized Netley at the end of that year and decommissioned it as a fortification. During the Interregnum, the castle was restored to use, due to concerns about a potential Royalist invasion, but was abandoned as obsolete after the restoration of Charles II to the throne. By the time that Alexander Pope visited in 1734, the castle was <b>overgrown</b> and in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a corner}} of the Jydegaard Formation is exposed today; the {{remainder}} is <b>overgrown.</b> Jydegaard is part of the Nyker Group, which includes three formations (Rabekke, Robbedale and Jydegaard) ranging from the Berriasian to the Valanginian ages of the Early Cretaceous. Jydegaard consists of sediments deposited in a fresh-to-brackish lagoon facing a coastal strip. In addition to Dromaeosauroides and a possible titanosaur, remains of hybodont sharks, fish such as Lepidotes and Pleuropholis, turtles, lizards, the crocodile Pholidosaurus and thin bone fragments from birds or pterosaurs have been found in the deposit. The bivalve Neomiodon is found in abundance in the sediments below (the Neomiodon Bed), indicating mass mortality, perhaps due to dinoflagellate toxins.|$|E
5|$|Original to the house, and occupying its {{northwest}} terrace {{against its}} service wing, was an Italian garden with vine-clad pergolas on each side, symmetrical gravel paths, marble benches, and long stone balustrades, giving it {{characteristics of a}} hanging garden. The garden was below the house's first floor, and was built against the hillside, occupying {{a portion of the}} slope that falls far below it. The lower walls of the house were screened with a row of large cedars planted on the highest part of the garden. The garden formed an immense rectangular space, and on the four sides of the terrace there were pergolas thickly <b>overgrown</b> with vines. In the center was a pool and a carved stone fountain imported from Rome. Walks and beds of flowers and shrubbery occupied the rest, visible from the west-facing windows of the house.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two centuries, the castle was {{involved}} in many conflicts. It was attacked and burnt, probably in the Welsh uprising of 1151, and was captured {{by the forces of}} Llywelyn the Great in 1215. John de Braose acquired the castle in 1220 and repaired it, constructing a stone curtain wall to replace the older defences. Attacked again in 1251, the castle was reinforced with a stone tower {{in the second half of}} the 13th century. It declined in importance during the late-medieval period, and by the 19th century, the castle was ruinous and <b>overgrown</b> with ivy.|$|E
5|$|The Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975 {{authorised}} the cemetery's owners (at {{that time}} Maximilian Investments) to sell surplus land within the cemetery's boundaries, {{leading to the}} construction of a major office development {{on the site of the}} former Superintendent's office, near the former level crossing between the northern and southern cemeteries. The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s, and were then converted into office buildings and named Stonemason's Court. In March 1985 the cemetery was bought by Ramadan Güney, whose family still owns the cemetery as of 2011. The Guney family embarked on a programme of encouraging new burials in the cemetery, and of slowly clearing the <b>overgrown</b> sections of the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The species grows only on {{slightly}} to heavily rotten and barkless deadwood in coniferous forests in cool, moist areas. The wood is about 40 to 100% <b>overgrown</b> with Marchantiophyta, {{especially of the}} genera Nowellia or Cephalozia. B.minutissima has been found growing on the liverwort Lepidozia reptans, although Nowellia curvifolia is the main indicator for the slime mould. In addition to liverworts, Barbeyella is found socialised with monocellular algae. It is assumed that the protoplasmodium phagocytises either the algae or the bacteria on their surface. Other Myxogastria species are often found together with Barbeyella, especially Lepidoderma tigrinum, Lamproderma columbinum and Colloderma oculatum. Aphanocladium album is a myxomyceticolous fungus (i.e., living on or within the fruit bodies of myxomycetes) that has been reported growing on specimens of B.minutissima collected from North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The tentacle-covered leaves {{can capture}} large prey, such as beetles, moths, and butterflies. The tentacles of all Drosera species have {{specialised}} stalked glands on the leaf's upper surface that produce a sticky mucilage. The leaves are considered active flypaper traps that respond to captured prey by bending to surround it. In its native fynbos habitat, the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs. Of the two known populations of D.regia, the higher altitude site {{appears to be}} <b>overgrown</b> and is essentially extirpated. The lower altitude site is estimated to have about 50 mature plants, making it the most endangered Drosera species, since it is threatened with extinction in the wild. It is often cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts, and a single cultivar has been registered.|$|E
5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, {{the reputation of}} the models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models and the park fell into disrepair as the years went by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by <b>overgrown</b> foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near the fireplace, and a wind {{came down the}} chimney. Her body {{disappeared}} amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is <b>overgrown.</b> The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of owner Charles van Raalte in 1907, his wife Florence stayed on Brownsea until 1925. Mary Bonham-Christie bought the island at an auction in 1927. In 1932, Bonham-Christie allowed 500 Scouts to camp there to {{celebrate}} the Silver Jubilee of Scouting, but shortly afterwards she closed the island {{to the public and}} it became very <b>overgrown.</b> In 1934, some Sea Scouts were camping on the island when a fire broke out. Mrs. Bonham-Christie blamed the Sea Scouts, although the fire did not start where the Sea Scouts were camping. The fire engulfed most of the island, burning west to east. The eastern buildings were only saved by a subsequent change in wind direction. Although it was not known how the fire started, Scouts were not allowed to camp on the island again until after Bonham-Christie's death in 1961. Her family becoming liable for inheritance tax on her estate, they put the island up for sale. Interested citizens who feared that the island would be bought by developers helped raise an endowment, and in 1962 the government allowed the National Trust to take over management of the island in lieu of the death duties.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the <b>overgrown</b> remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|Caudy {{never learned}} to write in English; he signed his last will and {{testament}} with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him. Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the <b>overgrown</b> shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13.|$|E
5|$|In March 1985 {{the company}} was bought by Ramadan Güney, whose family owned the {{cemetery}} until it was purchased by Woking Borough Council in December 2014. The Guney family embarked on a programme of building links with London's mosques to encourage new burials in the cemetery. Guney began a slow programme of clearing the <b>overgrown</b> sections of the cemetery and restoring significant memorials. The Guney family's efforts to attract new custom have been successful, {{to the extent that}} some of the lands sold off in the 1970s have now been repurchased by the cemetery. In June 1989 the cemetery was designated a Conservation Area, and was subsequently declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest. In 1992 the Brookwood Cemetery Society was formed to improve awareness of the cemetery; the Society holds open days, guided walks and other events, restores damaged memorials, and maintains and improves the signage within the cemetery.It is with these intentions that Woking Borough Council agreed at a Special Council Meeting on 24 November 2014 that it should secure the Cemetery by establishing Woking Necropolis and Mausoleum Limited, as a subsidiary within its Thameswey Group of companies.|$|E
5|$|Netley Castle is {{a former}} {{artillery}} fort constructed in either 1542 or 1544 by Henry VIII {{in the village of}} Netley, Hampshire. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and it defended Southampton Water near the Solent. The castle included a central, stone keep with two flanking gun platforms and was garrisoned by ten men. It was decommissioned during the English Civil War and by 1743 it was <b>overgrown</b> and in ruins. In the 19th century the property was gradually converted into a private house, being extended in a Gothic style, complete with octagonal towers. Between 1939 and 1998 it was used as a nursing home, until the high costs of maintenance led to its closure. Following an archaeological survey, it was then converted into nine residential flats. It is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, the London {{terminus}} was badly damaged in an air raid and rendered unusable. Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery, the London Necropolis Railway was never used again. Soon {{after the end of}} the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space, and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed. The part of the London building which housed the LNC's offices survives today. The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished. The site of the northern station, serving the Nonconformist cemetery, is now heavily <b>overgrown.</b> The site of the southern, Anglican, station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a shrine to King Edward the Martyr, which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels.|$|E
