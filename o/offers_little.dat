5|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection {{between himself and the}} other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques. In The Perpetual Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.|$|E
5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction {{in the range of}} movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Rain World {{setting is}} {{destroyed}} by ecological catastrophe and illustrated in pixel art. Its story is communicated through {{details in the}} environment, images during hibernation, and holograms from a worm that monitors the Slugcat. The game <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> to guide the player, apart from the worm, who gives some hints about where to go and what to collect towards {{the beginning of the}} game. The player can view a map to check their progress through the large in-game world, and this can help to reach the game's multiple endings.|$|E

25|$|The Cr-48's {{hardware}} design broke convention by replacing certain keys with shortcut keys, {{such as the}} function keys, and replacing the caps lock key with a dedicated search key, which can be changed back to caps lock in the OS's keyboard settings. Google addressed complaints that the operating system <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> functionality when the host device is not connected to the Internet, demonstrated an offline version of Google Docs, and announced a 3G plan that would give users 100MB of free data each month, with additional paid plans available from Verizon.|$|E
25|$|Another change {{affected}} the stroke, also a technique from the Arab, {{where it had}} been responsible for the engine's failure. A multi-cylinder V engine <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> length for connecting rods. Coatalen's usual solution was to use articulated connecting rods, where one rod runs on the crankshaft journal, but the other acts indirectly, through a journal on the other rod. The difficulty is that this gives a slightly different piston stroke for each bank, leading to unbalance and possible vibration problems, as for the Arab. Stroke was thus 135mm on one bank and 142mm on the other.|$|E

25|$|The profuse binding of ricin {{to surface}} {{membranes}} allows internalization with {{all types of}} membrane invaginations. The holotoxin can be taken up by clathrin-coated pits, {{as well as by}} clathrin-independent pathways including caveolae and macropinocytosis. Intracellular vesicles shuttle ricin to endosomes that are delivered to the Golgi apparatus. The active acidification of endosomes is thought to have little effect on the functional properties of ricin. Because ricin is stable over a wide pH range, degradation in endosomes or lysosomes <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> or no protection against ricin. Ricin molecules are thought to follow retrograde transport via early endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and the Golgi to enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).|$|E
25|$|Midna has {{received}} mostly positive reception {{from both the}} video game press and the public {{for her role in}} Twilight Princess. Game Informer editor Andrew Reiner stated that she, along with Link's wolf transformation, had incredible effects on Twilight Princess gameplay. Fellow Game Informer editor Billy Berghammer stated that he loved Midna, describing her as a cool character due to how she messed with Link throughout the game. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that the supporting characters of Twilight Princess make up for Link's laconic nature, Midna more so than others. He described her as being acerbic and thoughtful, as well as an intricate character who moves the plot forward for her own means. While America's Intelligence Wire editor Dave Arey described her as intriguing, he felt that she could have been more so if Nintendo had developed her further. GamesRadar listed her as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that before Midna, the only characters they could relate to were Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon. RPGamer editor Matthew Rickert stated that he found nothing intriguing or likable about her, complaining about how much more plot time she receives in spite of this, arguing that she <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> help to Link and that it felt like she had replaced Zelda in Twilight Princess.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 45% based on 151 reviews, {{with an average}} rating of 5.1/10.

500|$|Verdi was {{similarly}} never explicit about his religious beliefs. Anti-clerical by nature {{in his early}} years, he nonetheless built a chapel at Sant'Agata, but is rarely recorded as going to church. Strepponi wrote in 1871 [...] "I won't say [...] is an atheist, {{but he is not}} much of a believer." [...] Rosselli comments that in the Requiem [...] "The prospect of Hell appears to rule... is troubled to the end," [...] and <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> consolation.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} {{is set in a}} slow, country-waltz time {{signature}} with, as Leng observes, melody and lyrics working [...] "in tandem". Within each couplet, a rising musical figure presents the [...] "problem" [...] ("Why are you still crying?"), while the second line consists of a [...] "falling melodic consolation" [...] ("Your pain is now through"). In his 1980 autobiography, Harrison <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> comment about [...] "Behind That Locked Door", aside from identifying the inspiration behind the song and admitting: [...] "It was a good excuse to do a country tune with pedal steel guitar." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] is {{the second}} episode of The Simpsons fourth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 1, 1992. In the episode, Marge wins the role of Blanche DuBois in a {{community}} theatre musical version of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Homer <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> support for his wife's acting pursuits, and Marge begins to see parallels between him and Stanley Kowalski, the play's boorish lead male character. The episode contains a subplot in which Maggie Simpson attempts to retrieve her pacifier from a strict daycare owner.|$|E

500|$|Despite Diary of a Campers {{importance}} in establishing machinima, commentators {{have criticized the}} film's actual content. Marino called the plot [...] "simple"; likewise, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd believed that [...] "it wasn't much of a story", and Lowood wrote that [...] "the plot <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> more than a brief sequence of inside jokes". Among major Quake movie review sites, Roger Matthews of the Quake Movie Library called the film [...] "not {{much more than a}} deathmatch with a camera". On Psyk's Popcorn Jungle, Paul Coates wrote, [...] "This movie is dull. It is not very interesting." [...] Stephen Lum of The Cineplex criticized the film for its [...] "weird humour".|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall called Ron [...] "easily the show's best {{creation}} so far," [...] {{and during the}} third season he wrote, [...] "Ron being both awesome and hilarious is something Nick Offerman and these writers can do in their sleep by now." [...] Sal Basile of UGO Networks wrote, [...] "How anyone can make Ron Swanson of Parks and Recreation likable is beyond us, but Offerman does it effortlessly. Before we knew it we couldn't wait to see Swanson's reactions to the slightest of problems." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN was critical of Ron {{at the start of}} the show, and called him [...] "a bit of the dud (who) <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> to the show, and almost just stand to sour the whole thing." [...] However, by the second season, Fowler said the character had improved and became [...] "an absolute stand-out in the series." [...] Several reviewers have praised the platonic relationship between Ron and Leslie, which has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} both praise and criticism for its multiple-genre format. It was reviewed by {{four people in}} a 1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly shortly {{after the release of}} the game in 1989. Steve Harris said that the game does more than most shoot 'em ups and that it's a [...] "good follow-up for Zanac fans". He added that the multiple-genre format [...] "helps elevate the whole title to a much higher level". Ed Semrad called the game a Blaster Master clone and [...] "only average at best", and he echoed Harris' opinion that those who enjoyed Zanac would enjoy The Guardian Legend. Donn Nauert said that the game is repetitive and <b>offers</b> <b>little</b> challenge and {{that it would have been}} better as a pure shoot 'em up; he pointed to a special password ("TGL") in which players can enter to bypass all of the Labyrinth portions. Jim Allee also compared the game to Zanac and repeated what Nauert said about the lack of difficulty except in the boss battles; he overall praised the game for successfully bringing together two distinct themes.|$|E
