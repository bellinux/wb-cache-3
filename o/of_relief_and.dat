25|$|Pope Leo XII {{appointed}} Father Mastai-Ferretti Archbishop of Spoleto in 1827 {{at the age}} of 35. In 1831, the abortive {{revolution that}} had begun in Parma and Modena spread to Spoleto; the Archbishop obtained a general pardon after it was suppressed, gaining him a reputation for being liberal. During an earthquake, he made a reputation as an efficient organizer <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> <b>and</b> great charity. The following year he was moved to the more prestigious diocese of Imola, was made a cardinal in pectore in 1839, and in 1840 was publicly announced as Cardinal-Priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro. As in Spoleto, his episcopal priorities were the formation of priests through improved education and charities. He became known for visiting prisoners in jail, and for programs for street children. According to historians, Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti was considered a liberal during his episcopate in Spoleto and Imola because he supported administrative changes in the Papal States and sympathized with the nationalist movement in Italy.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 Harvey {{enrolled}} as {{an assistant}} at the British Museum, where he worked until 1904. However, he was also deeply interested in social reform and welfare, especially the alleviation of poverty, educational and prison reform issues. He chose to pursue this work through the settlement movement, and was a resident of Toynbee Hall from 1900, Deputy Warden from July 1904 and became Warden of Toynbee Hall, 1906–1911. From 1906 to 1910 {{he was a member}} of the Central (Unemployed) Body for London, the organisation responsible for registering those unemployed men applying for unemployment relief and finding work for them. From 1920 to 1921 he was Warden of Swarthmore Settlement in Leeds. Harvey was among a number of reformers, including R. H. Tawney and Harvey's predecessor as Warden of Toynbee Hall, Canon Samuel Augustus Barnett, who recognised that the emphasis of settlement work needed to be moved away from the simple provision <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> <b>and</b> help and towards a wider agenda based upon social investigation, the raising of public awareness of social problems and broader political legislation.|$|E
25|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 24 April the Glosters, with C Troop 170th Mortar Battery now fighting alongside as infantry, {{had been reduced to}} an effective fighting force of 400–450 men and were low on ammunition, though in their favour the guns of 45 Field Regiment provided excellent support. Estimates of the opposing force range from a regiment (three battalions) to a division (three regiments). The Glosters fought through the night of 24–25 April. The peak was briefly occupied by the Chinese, thus threatening the Glosters' whole position on the hill, but was retaken by a counter-attack led by the adjutant, Captain Anthony Farrar-Hockley. The Chinese attempted to take it again, launching seven attacks in one hour, without success, and their assault on the hill was finally broken up after sunrise by airstrikes. That morning, with Chinese forces infiltrating miles behind the lines, UN forces began to withdraw to Line Delta. On Hill 235 the Glosters had very little ammunition, no hope <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> <b>and,</b> with 45 Field Regiment on the move, no artillery support, and at 06:05 Lt-Col Carne received permission to attempt a breakout. He {{had no choice but to}} leave the wounded, estimated at some 100, and the survivors split into small groups and attempted to evade the Chinese surrounding them to reach friendly lines. Just 63 men made it.|$|E

While acknowledging the generous principle behind Jarvis's scheme, Betty Vernon (biographer of Jarrow politician Ellen Wilkinson) describes it as ultimately superficial, offering little more than patchwork assistance. Blythe observes: [...] "This excellent man failed, as anyone must fail who tries to play the good squire to a town of nearly forty thousand people".|$|E
500|$|With some {{residents}} forced to seek refuge in caves, the Government of Vanuatu asked the Australian, New Zealand and American governments for emergency food supplies and other assistance. In accordance, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) dispatched two Hercules transport planes {{to help with}} recovery efforts.

The other plane was used to transport more than [...] of fuel and relief supplies including food and shelter provisions. The Royal New Zealand Air Force also provided a plane, which transported relief supplies from Espiritu Santo to the northern islands up to three times daily, with the bulk of supplies donated by Australia.
