While the heavens were variously described as being like an umbrella covering the earth (the Kai Tian theory), <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sphere surrounding it (the Hun Tian theory), or as being without substance while the heavenly bodies float freely (the Hsüan yeh theory), the earth was at all times flat, although perhaps bulging up slightly.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the decline}} of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, {{performance}} art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.|$|E

He {{said that it is}} unmistakably the work of Abo, but {{improved}} over his previous soundtracks, and having [...] "enough layers of experimentation to showcase musical growth" [...] for it to not feel formulaic <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rehash. He felt that the change in the series' setting was also reflected in the music, with the music's rhythm section being more noticeable and making the music feel more grounded, and with more use of [...] "earthy sonic textures" [...] compared to previous Infinity soundtracks' [...] "watery" [...] ones.|$|E

It is non-migratory. It is the largest subspecies, and it looks like an oversized and darker tundrius <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> strongly barred and large anatum. The bill is very wide.

500|$|Piper cubeba, cubeb or tailed pepper is a {{plant in}} genus Piper, {{cultivated}} for its fruit and essential oil. It is mostly grown in Java and Sumatra, hence sometimes called Java pepper. The fruits are gathered before they are ripe, and carefully dried. Commercial cubebs consist of the dried berries, similar in appearance to black pepper, but with stalks attached [...] the [...] "tails" [...] in [...] "tailed pepper". [...] The dried pericarp is wrinkled, and its color ranges from grayish brown to black. The seed is hard, white and oily. The odor of cubebs is described as agreeable and aromatic and the taste as pungent, acrid, slightly bitter and persistent. [...] It {{has been described as}} tasting like allspice, <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cross between allspice and black pepper.|$|E

500|$|Due to OutKast's newfound {{commercial}} success and higher {{budget for the}} album, the group enjoyed a more relaxed schedule and [...] "could really just live" [...] at the studio. The duo and studio musicians {{lived and worked in}} the studio for weeks straight, with Big Boi noting, [...] "It usually takes us two to three years to make a record because we take our time; we ain't giving you that fast food, trying to meet a deadline. It ain't done until it's done sonically." [...] For Aquemini, the duo used live instrumentation and improvisation, bringing a baby grand piano into the studio and hiring musicians who played [...] "everything from stoner funk to prog rock". Producer Neal H. Pogue recalled, [...] "That was the beauty of making all those records – having musicians come in and out. It was almost like a Motown, that's what we had. <b>Or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Stax Records thing. That's what I loved about it. It brought back that whole feeling of making records. It was organic." [...] Much of the music on Aquemini was formulated during jam sessions, in which one musician would begin with creating a chord pattern and the rest would incorporate their instruments following that sequence. While recording Aquemini, André 3000 drew influence from reggae music and listened to Bob Marley constantly during the sessions. After the musical aspects of a song were developed, André 3000 and Big Boi would then create lyrics that they felt would fit with the tone of the song.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Jeannette Catsoulis praised it {{for avoiding}} the dichotomy of [...] "corporate greed versus environmental well-being", adding {{that instead of}} being an exposé, [...] "Under the gentle, humane investigations of its director, what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that ought to make us more nauseated than elated over those $20 jeans". Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will [...] "do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often [...] "untouched by major news organizations". He said the film was [...] "more despair-inducing than instructive", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a [...] "vitally important documentary" [...] that contains scenes that [...] "are {{enough to make you}} never want to go shopping again". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is [...] "hard to swallow but never feels preach-y <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> barrage of depressive factoids" [...] and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by [...] "the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette Week that it is a [...] "compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter".|$|E

50|$|Perhaps strangely, {{there is}} a {{connection}} between 'metaphor', metaphoric criticism, or conceptual metaphor and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say <b>an</b> organisation is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> machine, with cogs, <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what {{has been written about the}} usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.|$|R
2500|$|Rigpa (Sk: Vidya, [...] "{{knowledge}}") is {{a central}} concept in Dzogchen which means [...] "unconfused knowledge of the basis that is its own state". It is [...] "reflexively self-aware primordial wisdom," [...] which is self-reflexively aware of itself as unbounded wholeness. The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's true nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections; <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crystal ball that takes on the colour of the material on which it is placed without itself being changed. The knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity (which cannot be found by searching nor identified) is called rigpa.|$|E

Another variation features one main fountainhead and two or more subsidiary ones, such that when the main one ejects a single jet, the subsidiaries eject shields, with the two alternating.|$|E

[...] Decida choreographed it and Nils Ljunggren served as the producer. Visually, Vitali wanted the video to be simple; it was made to resemble Robyn's live performances and her then-upcoming tour. In a behind-the-scenes video, Robyn said, [...] "It's {{going to be looking}} a little bit like what I'm going to bring on tour. So it's a performance video but it's also going to be in I guess something like a rave <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> club or somewhere where people are dancing."

2500|$|The term “open” in open theism {{involves}} {{two important}} ideas: (1) God {{is open to}} what creatures do (God is affected by creatures) and (2) the future is open in that there are multiple possible futures (the branching tree model of the future <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> create your own story book). [...] Because God is open to us, God enters into genuine give-and-receive relations with creatures. For example, God truly responds to our prayers. God responds to {{what we do and}} adjusts the divine plans, if necessary. For Sanders, God has flexible strategies for accomplish divine goals (there is more than one route to the destination). There is not a blueprint which God is following for the construction of the kingdom. Rather, it “is a lot like jazz, a melody with a good deal of improvisation.” Open theists are clear to affirm with other freewill theists, however, that even though God has changing emotions, plans, and actions, the divine nature does not change. God’s love, wisdom, power, faithfulness, etc. are unchangeable.|$|E

As the Vietnam War escalated, Taylor received a psychological rejection from Selective Service System when he appeared before them with two white-suited McLean assistants and was uncommunicative. Taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospital's associated Arlington School. He would later view his nine-month stay at McLean as [...] "a lifesaver... like a pardon <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> reprieve," [...] and both his brother Livingston and sister Kate would later be patients and students there as well.
