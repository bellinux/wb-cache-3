5|$|The highest {{religious}} and political offices in Jerusalem were usually held by Europeans who had arrived on pilgrimage or crusade.

5|$|As a builder, Hugh {{built the}} New Bridge, now Elvet Bridge, in Durham, the second stone {{bridge in the}} town. Hugh also oversaw work on Durham Cathedral, decorating the inside with marble, {{installing}} stained glass windows, putting in a shrine for the bones of Bede, and building the Galilee Chapel on the west end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathedral.</b> Originally, Puiset had planned {{to put in a}} Lady Chapel on the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathedral,</b> but the ground was unsuitable, and instead work began on the Galilee Chapel on the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathedral.</b> The Galilee Chapel is unusual in that it has five aisles, and quatrefoil, or four lobed, piers. A model for the chapel may have been the work being done on York Minster in rebuilding the choir. The current Norman doorway and the gallery that is above the doorway in Durham Castle were also the work of Hugh, which was part of a hall built in the bailey of the castle. Along with the king of Scots, he built the first bridge over the River Tweed at Berwick. He also rebuilt Norham Castle, replacing the previous buildings built by Ranulf Flambard, an earlier bishop, with a stone castle.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond granted Apamea to the Knights Hospitaller in 1168. An {{earthquake}} destroyed most {{towns of}} northern Syria on 29June 1170. The Greek Patriarch, Athanasius, died when the edifice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cathedral</b> of St.Peter collapsed on {{him during the}} Mass. Bohemond went to Qosair (present-day Al-Qusayr, Syria) and persuaded the exiled Latin Patriarch {{to return to his}} see.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized the books <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathedral</b> library, {{taking them to}} Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on that cold winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, {{who claimed to be}} a practising Puritan, appropriated portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathedral</b> for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part of it as a stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E

Archaeological excavations were held in 1955–56 and in 1959; the cathedral underwent a major renovation during this period. Wealthy diaspora benefactors, such as Calouste Gulbenkian and Alex Manoogian, financially assisted the renovation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathedral.</b> Gulbenkian alone provided $400,000.|$|E
