5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they {{unveiled}} a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> {{the feasibility}} of an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E

The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb. Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E

5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> {{evolutionary}} lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods {{to be used in}} interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 Allison {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in 1942, and the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor of Physics in 1959. He studied the Compton effect and the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction. At the time x-rays were an important means <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> atomic structures, but the concept that light had both wave and particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted. William Duane from Harvard spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong, and Allison became part of this effort. Duane carried {{out a series of}} meticulous experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found overwhelming evidence that Compton was correct. To his credit, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E

He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This work {{contains}} {{a detailed description}} of the kinetics of phase transformations during tempering of new hot working steel. Moreover, the differences in microstructure of samples <b>of</b> the <b>investigated</b> steel in relationship to the heat treatment were evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: CHT diagram, illustrating the kinetics of phase transformations during continuous heating (tempering) from as-quenched state <b>of</b> <b>investigated</b> steel, was elaborated using a DT 1000 dilatometer of a French company Adamel. In the case of investigations of the microstructural changes, quenched samples were heated with a heating rate of 0. 05 °C/s to the temperatures of 210, 320 and 420 °C. The microstructure <b>of</b> <b>investigated</b> steel were examined using transmission JEM 200 CX microscope. Findings: Heating <b>of</b> the <b>investigated</b> steel from the as-quenched state resulted in the occurrence of 4 primary transformations: precipitation of ε carbide, M 3 C precipitation, transformation of retained austenite and precipitation of alloy carbides of MC and M 2 C type, nucleating independently. TEM investigations focused on determination of a degree of phase transformations during continuous tempering, showed compatibility of the microstructure with CHT diagram for tested steel. Research limitations/implications: The new CHT diagram <b>of</b> <b>investigated</b> steel was determined. Practical implications: The obtained CHT diagram may be used to design new technologies of tempering of this steel. Originality/value: The new CHT diagram, characterization of tempering new hot working steel...|$|R
40|$|Transparent thermal insulations are new {{materials}} in the solar energy conversion systems area. They offer optical and thermal properties, which allow increase in solar conversion efficiency and solar gains. This work is focused on theoretical and experimental research of optical and thermal properties of different transparent insulation types and on their application potential for cover glazings in solar active thermal technology (flat-plate liquid solar collectors). For theoretical determination of optical properties, a ray-tracing method was suggested and calculation algorithm was derived for general orthogonal geometrical structures. Analysis of geometrical and material parameters influence on optical properties <b>of</b> <b>investigated</b> TI structures was performed. A testing apparatus for experimental determination of inhomogeneous sheet materials solar transmittance has been designed and set up.
