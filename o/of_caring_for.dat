5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> them are high. Direct and indirect costs <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of federal {{authorities}} before sentencing, Vick agreed to deposit nearly $1 million in an escrow account with attorneys to reimburse others for the costs <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> the confiscated dogs, {{most of which were}} being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court-appointed specialist. Experts said some of the animals would require special care {{for the rest of their}} lives. During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.|$|E
5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds, and was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E

5|$|In Western societies, the {{domestic}} guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate responsiveness to handling and feeding; {{and the relative}} ease <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> them, continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.|$|E
5|$|Born in Brooklyn, New York {{and raised}} in East Orange, New Jersey, Beebe left college before obtaining a degree {{in order to work}} at the then newly opened New York Zoological Park, where he was given the duty <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> the zoo's birds. He quickly {{distinguished}} himself in his work for the zoo, first with his skill in designing habitats for its bird population, and soon also with a series of research expeditions of increasing length, including an expedition around the world to document the world's pheasants. These expeditions formed the basis for a large quantity of writing for both popular and academic audiences, including an account of his pheasant expedition titled A Monograph of the Pheasants and published in four volumes from 1918 to 1922. In recognition of the research conducted on his expeditions, he was granted honorary doctorates from Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{occurs in}} 4.6â€“8.0 per 1000 {{people with diabetes}} annually. Rates among those with type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E
