5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, {{and later in the}} year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu-Si-hung, visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December while she was in Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> her arrival in small boats and others who watched her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay.|$|E
5|$|A {{short while}} later a German {{armoured}} column was seen advancing from Oudna, and Frost decided {{to set an}} ambush to try to destroy it; the leading elements of the column, however, surprised a group of paratroopers filling water bottles at a nearby well, the ambush was sprung too early, inflicting only a single casualty. The battalion was understrength, having taken casualties at Oudna, and was running low on ammunition, but it managed to drive off the column with mortar fire; however, this was only a brief respite. Two armoured cars and a tank was seen to be moving towards the battalion from a different direction, reportedly sporting recognition signals of British First Army; Frost sent a party <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> the vehicles, only {{for them to be}} taken prisoner and it to be revealed that the vehicles were German with captured equipment. The German commander sent one of the captured paratroopers with a message demanding Frost surrender, but he refused to comply; instead he ordered that the radios and mortars were to be destroyed and the battalion would evacuate westwards towards Allied lines, approximately fifty miles away. The battalion managed to withdraw to higher ground, but suffered a number of casualties from the German armour as it did so. Now positioned on the high ground, which consisted of a ridge crowned by two small hills, the paratroopers were attacked by tanks and infantry supported by heavy mortar fire. The battalion suffered a number of casualties but was saved by the unexpected intervention of German aircraft; mistaking their troops for the paratroopers, they knocked out several tanks and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E
25|$|In {{the closing}} moments, the series comes full circle back to Life on Mars as another officer {{from the future}} appears {{wondering}}, like Alex and Sam, who has changed his office, and wondering where his iPhone is, and Gene Hunt ventures <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> him in his usual fashion - using exactly the same words he used to greet Sam Tyler in his first ever scene in Life on Mars.|$|E

25|$|Coincidentally {{there was}} a circus in Charlottetown during the conference, and {{it was much more}} {{interesting}} to the majority of the population. There was no one working at the public wharf at the foot of Great George Street when the Canadian delegates arrived on the steamship SS Victoria, so Prince Edward Island representative William Henry Pope had to handle receptions by himself, including rowing <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> the new arrivals. The Canadian delegates stayed each night on board the SS Queen Victoria, as circus-goers and the Maritime delegates had taken up the accommodations in town.|$|E
25|$|McMahon {{began his}} {{off-screen}} {{career as a}} referee named Shane Stevens in 1989 at the Survivor Series {{and was the first}} performer to walk <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> the audience at WrestleMania VI. He also refereed during the 1991 Royal Rumble match. McMahon soon left behind his refereeing duties and took on the role of a backstage official at WrestleMania VIII in an attempt to break up a storyline brawl between Randy Savage and Ric Flair. McMahon would then mainly work behind the scenes and launching WWF.com in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The Mustangs were a surf music instrumental/dance band {{formed in}} Adelaide in 1964 with Mick Bower on rhythm guitar, Rick Morrison on lead guitar, Brian Vaughton on drums and Gavin Webb on bass guitar. Initially they played covers of The Shadows and The Ventures songs. The band's output was profoundly {{influenced}} by the Australian tour of The Beatles in June 1964, which had a particular impact in Adelaide, due to recent migrants from United Kingdom (UK). When The Beatles arrived in Adelaide they were greeted by the largest crowd ever seen in their touring career—estimates as high as 300,000 while Adelaide's population being less than 1 million—one-third of the city had turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> them (see The Beatles' influence on popular culture). Following The Beatles' chart breakthrough and tour, {{it was obvious that}} the surf/instrumental style was passé. The Mustangs changed style and took on a lead singer, Scottish immigrant, Jim Keays. The Mustangs rehearsed regularly in a shed behind a hotel owned by Vaughton's family. Their original manager, Graham Longley, made a tape recording of a rehearsal; it was rediscovered and released on CD in 2004 as Mustangs to Masters... First Year Apprentices. After Keays joined on lead vocals, the band produced more original songs in the beat style.|$|E

2500|$|Upon Xu Huang's return, Cao Cao went seven li <b>out</b> of Xuchang <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> him, {{giving him}} full credit for {{securing}} Fan and Xiangyang.

Seeing this, Cao Cao lauded, [...] "General Xu has truly inherited the style of Zhou Yafu." ...|$|R
500|$|The day of {{the race}} was cold, windy and wet, but the Marshall turf course was firm. Despite the weather, some 35,000 people turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> Secretariat in a [...] "virtual hysteria" [...] that Secretariat seemed not to notice. His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road, who he had already beaten in the Marlboro Cup, and Big Spruce, who had {{finished}} third in the Man o' War. Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead. [...] "Snorting steam in the raw twilight", he rounded the far turn with a 12-length lead before gearing down in the final furlong, ultimately winning by [...] lengths. Once again, many winning tickets went uncashed by souvenir hunters.|$|E
500|$|From 1864 onwards, the Hurva Synagogue was {{considered}} the most beautiful and most important synagogue in the Land of Israel. It was described as [...] "the glory of the Old City" [...] and the [...] "most striking edifice in all of Palestine". It also housed part of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, the largest yeshiva in Jerusalem. It was a focal point of Jewish spiritual life {{in the city and}} was the site of the installation of the Ashkenazic chief rabbis of both Palestine and Jerusalem. On his visit to Jerusalem in 1866, Moses Montefiore went to the synagogue, placing a silver breastplate on one of the Torah scrolls. When he visited again in 1875, a crowd of 3,000 Jews turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> him. On February 3, 1901 a memorial service for Queen Victoria took place inside the synagogue in gratitude for the protection afforded to the Jews of Jerusalem by Britain. The service was presided over by the Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, Shmuel Salant. According to a report in The Jewish Chronicle, the large building was [...] "filled to its utmost capacity and policemen had to keep off the crowds, who vainly sought admission, by force". In around 1919, Benjamin Lee Gordon wrote that the [...] "synagogue presented a very pleasant and dignified appearance. It was well illuminated with artistic lamps presented by a certain Mr. Lichtenstein, of Philadelphia". In 1921 Abraham Isaac Kook was appointed first Chief Rabbi of Palestine at the synagogue. The synagogue also hosted Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel, who was honoured with reciting a portion of the Torah. In 1923 Yosef Shalom Eliashiv's bar mitzvah was held at the synagogue. [...] In the 1930s and possibly earlier, the synagogue housed the Chayei Olam Cheider, where indigent students form the Old City received their Torah education.|$|E
2500|$|No steamer {{had called}} at Jefferson since the Calliope, several years before.

While Schroeder and cameraman Nestor Almendros were given unprecedented access to Amin's daily life, the documentary makes it plain {{that many of the}} events (including the residents of a garrison town turning <b>out</b> en masse <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> Amin) were staged for their benefit. In several sequences, Amin actively directs the cameraman to particular points of interest, at one point shouting to [...] "film that helicopter!" ...|$|R

Barnes was aware that the Colonel had the news. [...] "I was going to--to write to you this morning, with--with some intelligence that I am--very--very sorry to give." ...|$|R
50|$|When the Chinese monk Faxian {{traveled}} through Khotan, he recorded that everyone there was Buddhist. According to his accounts, there were fourteen main monasteries, and he {{stayed at the}} most important of these, the monastery of Gomatī, which housed 3000 Mahāyāna monks. When Xuanzang was later traveling through Khotan in the 7th century, he wrote that the king came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> personally <b>greet</b> him at the border of Khotan. He was escorted to the capital, and lodged at a monastery of the Sarvāstivāda sect. Xuanzang records there being about 100 monasteries in Khotan, housing a total of 5000 monastics who all studied the Mahāyāna.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{instance of}} human sacrifice {{mentioned in the}} Bible is the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatsoever comes to greet {{him at the door}} when he returns home if he is victorious. The vow is stated in the Book of Judges, 11:31: [...] "Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer Him a burnt offering." [...] When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> him.

[...] According to some commentators of rabbinic literature, Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1944 the two {{boarded the}} Orient Express to Istanbul. After {{crossing}} the Bosphorus straits by ferry, they {{were subject to}} a vigorous search and debriefing by the British secret service as [...] "aliens" [...] from Nazi-occupied territory. The Rebbe, who generally weighed each question before answering it, exasperated the interrogator, who ordered the Rebbe and his brother arrested and held {{in the basement of}} the Syrian police house, together with another fifteen Jewish fugitives from Nazi Europe. Israel Chief Rabbi Chaim Herzog, who had planned to be in Turkey with a mission of rescue activists so he could greet the Rebbe upon his arrival, interceded with the British general, who agreed to release the weak and fragile Rebbe. Rabbi Mordechai was released later that evening, and the pair took the first train to Tripoli the next morning. On the outskirts of Beirut, they were greeted by a crowd of 200 Sephardim and 20 Israeli businessmen and hosted to a reception by local rabbis and dignitaries. They arrived at the old border station near Naqoura, Lebanon, on 3 February 1944 (9 Shevat 5704 – a date celebrated by Belzer Hasidim). Upon crossing the border into Israel, the Rebbe tore kriah. Thousands came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> them at each of their stops in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

50|$|In port after port, {{citizens}} in the thousands turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see and <b>greet</b> the fleet. In 1908, the Great White Fleet visited Monterey, California, from 1-4 May.

2500|$|When Mr Gladstone {{visited the}} North, you well {{remember}} when word {{passed from the}} newspaper to the workman that it circulated through mines and mills, factories and workshops, and they came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> the only British minister who ever gave the English people a right {{because it was just}} they should have it ... and when he went down the Tyne, all the country heard how twenty miles of banks were lined with people who came to greet him. Men stood in the blaze of chimneys; the roofs of factories were crowded; colliers came up from the mines; women held up their children on the banks that it might be said in after life that they had seen the Chancellor of the People go by. The river was covered like the land. Every man who could ply an oar pulled up to give Mr Gladstone a cheer. When Lord Palmerston went to Bradford the streets were still, and working men imposed silence upon themselves. When Mr Gladstone appeared on the Tyne he heard cheer no other English minister ever heard ... the people were grateful to him, and rough pitmen who never approached a public man before, pressed round his carriage by thousands ... and thousands of arms were stretched out at once, to shake hands with Mr Gladstone as one of themselves.|$|E

[...] However, Yang, in fear of the consequences, fled and stated, [...] "You, Uncle, take care of yourself! [...] I know nothing about this."

According to legend, this rivalry eventually led to dueling. The university administration eventually intervened and changed the societies' official rules, making membership based upon geography with the Phi members coming from the eastern part of the state and the Di members from the western part (see below for a detailed description of this arrangement). Now together in a Joint Senate, the societies still maintain the rivalry in a more congenial way.|$|R
