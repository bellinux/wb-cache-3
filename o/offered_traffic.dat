25|$|With Gardermoen {{having been}} {{selected}} as the new main airport and the decision being made to close down Fornebu, a political debate arose in the early 1990s of where the general aviation airport for Eastern Norway should be located. The government proposed in 1994 that three airports share this role, Kjeller, Eggemoen and Rygge. Within two years Eggemoen was proposed as the main general aviation airport for Eastern Norway. State funding of NOK50 million was <b>offered.</b> <b>Traffic</b> was estimated to increase from 6,000 aircraft movements per year to 40,000 in 1999 and 51,000 in 2010. A unanimous Jevnaker Municipal Council opposed the plans, as they would receive most of the noise pollution. With a vote 22 against 21, Ringerike Municipal Council {{voted in favor of}} a referendum concerning the airport. Held on 6 March 1996, tt had a turnout of 36 percent, of which 66.2 percent voted against the proposal for Eggemoen. This was confirmed in Ringerike Municipal Council, where with one decisive vote the approval was discarded.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} did not <b>offer</b> <b>trafficking</b> victims access to shelters or other services during the reporting period. The government lacked formal procedures to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, such as undocumented migrants and those persons detained for prostitution offenses. As a result, persons whose trafficking victim status was not recognized by Tunisian authorities were vulnerable to imprisonment and deportation if caught engaging in illegal activities under Tunisian law. The government neither undertook efforts to identify trafficking victims among the undocumented migrants in its detention centers, nor did it allow outside parties to screen these detained migrants to determine if any were victims of abuse. The government’s social workers provided direct assistance to abused migrant women and children - including possible trafficking victims - in two shelters operated by a local NGO. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs, Family, Children, and Elderly Persons continued to assign a child protection delegate to each of Tunisia’s 24 districts to intervene in cases of sexual, economic, or criminal exploitation of children; these delegates ensured that child sex abuse victims received adequate medical care and counseling. The government does not <b>offer</b> <b>trafficking</b> victims legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution.|$|R

50|$|Where the {{existing}} busy-hour carried traffic, Ec, is measured on an already-overloaded system, {{with a significant}} level of blocking, {{it is necessary to}} take account of the blocked calls in estimating the busy-hour <b>offered</b> <b>traffic</b> Eo (which is the traffic value {{to be used in the}} Erlang formula). The <b>offered</b> <b>traffic</b> can be estimated by Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb). For this purpose, where the system includes a means of counting blocked calls and successful calls, Pb can be estimated directly from the proportion of calls that are blocked. Failing that, Pb can be estimated by using Ec in place of Eo in the Erlang formula and the resulting estimate of Pb can then be used in Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb) to estimate Eo. Another method of estimating Eo in an overloaded system is to measure the busy-hour call arrival rate, λ (counting successful calls and blocked calls), and the average call-holding time (for successful calls), h, and then estimate Eo using the formula E = λh.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{situation}} where the traffic to be handled is completely new traffic, the only choice is to try to model expected user behavior, estimating active user population, N, expected level of use, U (number of calls/transactions per user per day), busy-hour concentration factor, C (proportion of daily activity that will fall in the busy hour), and average holding time/service time, h (expressed in minutes). A projection of busy-hour <b>offered</b> <b>traffic</b> would then be Eo = (NUC/60)h erlangs. (The division by 60 translates the busy-hour call/transaction arrival rate into a per-minute value, to match the units in which h is expressed.) ...|$|E
50|$|In general, {{grade of}} service (GoS) is {{measured}} by looking at traffic carried, traffic offered and calculating the traffic blocked and lost. The proportion of lost calls is the measure of GoS. For cellular circuit groups an acceptable GoS is 0.02. This means that two users of the circuit group out of a hundred will encounter a call refusal during the busy hour {{at the end of}} the planning period. The grade of service standard is thus the acceptable level of traffic that the network can lose. GoS is calculated from the Erlang-B formula, as a function of the number of channels required for the <b>offered</b> <b>traffic</b> intensity.|$|E

5000|$|The Erlang C formula {{expresses the}} {{probability}} that an arriving customer will need to queue (as opposed to immediately being served). Just as the Erlang B formula, Erlang C assumes an infinite population of sources, which jointly offer traffic of A erlangs to N servers. However, if all the servers are busy when a request arrives from a source, the request is queued. An unlimited number of requests may {{be held in the}} queue in this way simultaneously. This formula calculates the probability of queuing <b>offered</b> <b>traffic,</b> assuming that blocked calls stay in the system until they can be handled. This formula is used to determine the number of agents or customer service representatives needed to staff a call centre, for a specified desired probability of queuing. However, the Erlang C formula assumes that callers never hang up while in queue, which makes the formula predict that more agents should be used than are really needed to maintain a desired service level.) ...|$|E
