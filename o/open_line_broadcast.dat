40|$|AbstractBroadcasting is {{the process}} of {{transmitting}} information from an originating node (processor) in a network to all other nodes in the network. A local broadcast scheme only allows a node to send information along single communication links to adjacent nodes, while a <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme allows nodes to use paths of several communication links to call distant nodes. The minimum time possible for broadcasting in a network of n nodes when no node is involved in more than one communication at any given time is ⌊ log n⌋ phases. Local broadcasting is not sufficient, in general, for broadcasting to be completed in minimum time; line broadcasting is always sufficient. An optimal <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> is a minimum-time broadcast that uses the smallest possible total number of communication links. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of optimal line broadcasting in cycles, and we develop efficient methods for constructing optimal <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> schemes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnder {{the line}} {{communication}} protocol, calls {{can be placed}} between pairs of non-adjacent sites over a path of lines connecting them; only one call can utilize a line at any time. This paper addresses questions regarding the cumulative cost, i. e., sum of lengths of calls, of broadcasting under the line protocol in path networks. Let Pn be the path with n vertices, and Cn be {{the cost of an}} optimal, <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme from a terminal vertex in path Pn. We show that a minimum-cost <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme from any source vertex in Pn has cost no more than Cn and no less than Cn − n + 2 for any n ⩾ 2 and any time t > [log 2 n]. We derive a closed-form expression for the minimum cost of a minimum-time <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> from a terminal vertex in certain paths and relate this to costs from nearby sources...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages [97]- 100. The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare the {{marketing}} campaigns of two teleconferencing programs — British Telecom's Talkabout versus Pacific Northwest Bell's <b>Open</b> <b>Line.</b> Talkabout is the original public entertainment-related teleconferencing service offered to teens in the United Kingdom. It is the program on which many other countries, including the United States, have based their programs. <b>Open</b> <b>Line,</b> Pacific Northwest Bell's party line program was introduced to adults and teens in the Spokane, Washington area in 1984. Through a marketing effort managed by Kobs & Brady Advertising, <b>Open</b> <b>Line</b> was offered free for two weeks to promote the service. A stimulation program was then implemented after the trial to retain callers. Chapter 1 of this thesis discusses the Talkabout service explaining the program's operation, markets and promotional and advertising efforts. Chapter 2 details Kobs & Brady's marketing campaign for <b>Open</b> <b>Line</b> from {{the inception of the}} trial program. Finally, Chapter 3 is an analysis of why Talkabout remains successful after 5 years of service. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
