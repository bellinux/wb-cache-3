40|$|This paper {{studies the}} quality of Hong Kong listed banks’ market risk Value-at-Risk (VaR) disclosure; of which the Hong Kong stock market {{contains}} the diversity of Chinese state-owned banks, international banks with English history, and some Hong Kong local banks. Therefore, focusing on the Hong Kong stock market allows the comparison on the disclosure quality between the three. While the banks usually do not provide the disclosed VaRs with details on their internal estimation model and the actual accuracy of the estimation; this paper aims to (1) replicate the banks’ Value-at-Risk and apply the backtesting on the estimated VaR; and (2) compare the estimated VaR under the selected model with the VaR disclosed in banks’ publicly disclosed information. In {{the first part of}} the research, twelve models are estimated with the variation of their volatility adjustment model, width of data rolling window, and simulation approaches. There are two ways of historical volatility forecast models applied, namely, the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (1, 1) (or GARCH(1, 1)); together with the case of no adjustment, they make up three different specification. 250 and 500 previous trading days are the two elected width of time window; and the Historical Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation are the two simulation methods that are tested. These variations generate the twelve estimation approaches. These methods are then tested with the Christoffersen’s (1998) three tests of conditional coverage, independence and unconditional coverage. Furthermore, the GMM based duration test suggested by Candelon (2011) is also applied to the VaR data. The results concluded that the EWMA model with a 250 days of rolling window is the best perform model under the Christoffersen’s (1998) tests. In the second part of the research, the estimated VaR from the best perform model is compared with the disclosed values. Four types of disclosed VaR are included in the comparison, they are the trading book year-end and year average VaRs, and the trading and <b>non-trading</b> <b>book</b> year-end and year average VaRs. The results suggest that the year average forms of VaRs can better reflect the risk and the trading and <b>non-trading</b> <b>book</b> VaR is better than the trading book ones.

A standard small open economy model suggests that low-skilled immigration should reduce the relative price of non-traded goods by decreasing the wages of low-skilled workers. Treating U. S. cities as small open economies and using confidential price data on goods and services to estimate reduced-form price effects, I find that, at current immigration levels, a 10 {{percent increase in the}} share of low-skilled immigrants in the labor force decreases the price of immigrant-intensive services, such as housekeeping and gardening, by 2. 1 percent and of <b>other</b> <b>non-traded</b> goods by 0. 7 percent.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} {{of human rights}} clauses in EU international agreements {{has long been a}} traditional feature of human rights protection in EU external relations. In current practice, EU agreements containing human rights clauses follow a standard model. First, there is a reference in the preamble of the agreement to the ‘strong attachment’ of the contracting parties to non-trade values, such as democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law. Second, {{in the first part of}} the agreement there is a provision that defines the respect for human rights and <b>other</b> <b>non-trade</b> values as ‘essential element’ of the agreement. Third, a non-execution clause is included in the final part of most EU agreements, which stipulates how the EU is supposed react if an essential element of the agreement is violated. It is often observed that the violations of the values mentioned in the essential element clause have only triggered the application of the clause in a limited number of cases, all involving very serious violations of democratic principles and human rights. This infrequent application might thus call into question the real impact of the clause on the human rights situations of EU partner countries. However, the usefulness of the clause as a tool for the protection of human rights in EU external relations cannot be judged with exclusive reference to its enforcement record. On the one hand, the essential element clause and the non-execution clause establish a ‘self-contained regime’ allowing for the adoption of ‘appropriate measures’ to compel compliance. On the other hand, the essential element clause should also be evaluated per se, that is as an autonomous rule which can play a constructive role as a basis for political dialogue and for the adoption of positive measures. This paper examines the added value of the clause following this interpretative approach and contributes to the discussion of some problematic issues related to the clauses and to their enforcement...|$|R

The findings reveal, despite the undertaken integration and trade liberalisation processes, a persisting and significant trade resistance for the CEECs' agri-food exports to the EU market, even just prior their accession in 2004.

40|$|Written {{prior to}} the WTO conference in Seattle, this paper {{identifies}} negotiating strategies and areas of benefits from a new multilateral round of trade negotiations for developing countries. Although the attempts to launch a round at Seattle failed, the strategy outlined in the paper remains relevant, should fresh efforts be made to launch a round. From the viewpoint of overall strategy, developing countries should limit the agenda for anew round to the built-in Uruguay Round (UR), agenda plus trade liberalization in industrial goods. From the long-run perspective, they need to commit substantial human and financial resources {{to the creation of}} native research and negotiating capacity on WTO-related issues. The areas covered in the paper include trade liberalization, multilateral agreement on investment, dispute settlement, anti-dumping, and labour and environmental standards. Expected benefits from liberalization in industrial products to developing countries justify their inclusion in the new round, even though they are {{not a part of the}} UR built-in agenda. In agriculture, developing countries must watch out against the proliferation of sanitary and phytosanitary(SPS) measures, which threaten to turn into the most important barrier against their agricultural exports as this sector is liberalized. On electronic commerce, a key objective should be to classify it as trade in services. Developing countries should then seek the liberalization of services by developed countries in sectors in which they can export services electronically. There is an acute need to improve the access of developing countries to the legal and professional services necessary to get a fair hearing in the Dispute Settlement Body. Developed countries have substantial in-house resource to devote to disputes which developing countries lack. In the short run, this asymmetry must be corrected by the provision of resources that allow developing countries to hire private legal experts. In the long run, developing countries must develop their own in-house expertise. Time is not yet ripe for a multilateral agreement on investment. Should developed countries nevertheless insist upon it, its scope should be limited to direct foreign investment. Even then, developing countries should insist on a parallel agreement on the movement of natural persons. On <b>other</b> <b>non-trade</b> agenda issues, labour standards should be taken out of the WTO and delegated to the International Labour Organization. Likewise, most of the environmental agenda should be delegated to the United Nations Environmental Protection Agency. ...|$|R
40|$|Positive {{integration}} among states, {{defined as}} the correction of negative externalities from liberalisation, is generally assumed {{to be very difficult}} to achieve on the European level, let alone on the international or global level. The political transaction costs of achieving positive integration legislation indeed seem daunting in an organisation such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which operates under conditions of unanimity and has a membership of over 140 sovereign states. Yet, member states seem to have crossed the Rubicon: They have concluded a number of agreements that impose positive obligations to adopt new policy measures in fields traditionally restricted to the sovereign nation-state. There has been consistent political pressure to graft <b>other,</b> <b>non-trade</b> issues onto the WTO framework, i. e. to enlarge an organisation that formerly dealt exclusively with trade into a governance structure that also has regulatory competences in other areas of public policy. WTO member states have indeed introduced the obligation to protect intellectual property rights internationally, and they have concluded agreements on health, on technical barriers to trade, and on investment - each of these being fields of public policy for which more specialised agencies within the United Nations system would seem to have been the more natural locus for such agreements. Further, there have been - hitherto unsuccessful - calls to bring labour rights, environmental standards, or competition policy under the jurisdiction of the WTO. This raises the question: why and under which conditions is positive integration possible in the WTO? The present paper seeks to formulate theoretically embedded hypotheses that answer this question. I argue that judicialisation - the presence of binding third party enforcement - makes every single WTO commitment more credible. Because judicialisation facilitates enforcement, it exerts force on political actors in the legislative arm of the organisation to bring positive integration issues under the jurisdiction of the WTO. The aim of this paper is to explore the explanatory force of this general hypothesis in empirical cases of positive integration (intellectual property, health, technical barriers to trade, and investment) and to come to new theoretical and empirical insights about the sources of and conditions for international cooperation.
