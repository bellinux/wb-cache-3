5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil <b>or</b> <b>rock,</b> has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion of clay minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as diarrhoea. Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus {{began his}} {{expedition}} from Uppsala on May 12, 1732, {{just before he}} turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted {{on the way to}} examine a flower <b>or</b> <b>rock</b> and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.|$|E
5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, faeces, and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by urination stand less than a metre away from a tree <b>or</b> <b>rock</b> surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome. Another major reason for fights is to acquire dominance in the breeding season. These can even involve cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, <b>or</b> <b>rock</b> {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|Stone wool <b>or</b> <b>rock</b> wool is a spun {{mineral fibre}} {{used as an}} {{insulation}} product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a blast furnace fed with diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted by-product and run to waste.|$|E
5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz <b>or</b> <b>rock</b> music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had {{a higher rate of}} gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 Kelly {{formed the}} band Professor Ratbaggy with Hadley (bass guitar, backing vocals), Haymes (keyboards, organ, backing vocals) and Luscombe (drums). Kelly {{provided}} guitars and vocals for their debut album, Professor Ratbaggy, on EMI Records. Songs were written jointly by all group {{members and their}} work was a more groove-oriented style compared to Kelly's usual folk <b>or</b> <b>rock</b> formula, using samples, synthesiser and percussion. Kelly's second anthology of lyrics entitled Don't Start Me Talking {{was first published in}} 1999, with subsequent songs appended in the 2004 edition. This second edition was added to the Victorian Certificate of Education English reading list for Year 12 (final year of secondary schooling) in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river <b>or</b> <b>Rock</b> Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E
5|$|Many Wielbark graves were flat, but kurgans {{are also}} {{characteristic}} and common. In {{the case of}} kurgans the grave was covered with stones, which were surrounded by a circle made of larger stones. More earth material was piled to cover all that, with a solitary stone, or stela often put on top. Such a kurgan could include one or several individual burials, have a diameter of up to {{a dozen or so}} meters and be up to one meter high. On some burial grounds large stone circles are found. These consist of massive boulders <b>or</b> <b>rock</b> pieces, up to 1.7 meters high, separated by several meters wide spaces, sometimes connected by smaller stones, the whole structure having a 10 to 40 meter diameter. In the middle of the circles one to four stelae were placed, and sometimes a single grave. The stone circles are believed to be the locations of meetings of Scandinavian (see below) tings - assemblies or courts. The single graves inside the circles are probably of people sacrificed and buried there - human offerings to the gods, to assure their support for the deliberations. A stone kurgans cemetery was found in Węsiory, Kartuzy County; another burial site with ten large stone circles was discovered in Odry, Chojnice County, both dated 2nd century AD.|$|E

25|$|Rock {{balancing}} or stone balancing (stone <b>or</b> <b>rock</b> stacking) is an art, discipline, or hobby {{in which}} rocks are naturally balanced {{on top of}} one another in various positions without the use of adhesives, wires, supports, rings or any other contraptions which would help maintain the construction's balance.|$|E

They argue instead that art is much older than previously thought and that the canvas was initially the human body. The earliest art, according to FCC, consisted of predominantly blood-red designs produced on the body for purposes of cosmetic display.|$|E
25|$|Many ballads {{were written}} and sold as single sheet broadsides. The form was often used by poets and composers from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads.

25|$|To be effective, {{lightning}} protection systems generally maximize {{the surface area}} contact between the conductors and the earth through a ground grid of varying designs. To supplement grounding grids in low-conductivity earth, such as sand <b>or</b> <b>rock,</b> long, hollow copper tubes filled with metallic salts are available. These salts leach through holes in the tube, making the surrounding soil more conductive as well as increasing the overall surface area which decreases effective resistance.|$|E
