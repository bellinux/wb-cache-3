500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} fourth victory {{of the season in}} front of 110,000 people who attended the race. Johnson also earned $276,076 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I woke up (on Sunday) morning very optimistic. By about lap two or three I knew we had a very balanced car and we'd be competitive all day long, get a solid finish.", he continued, [...] "I see guys get so worried about what other people think, what other people say and {{spend a lot of time}} in those areas. That's not what works for me. (I) don't watch television; don't watch or read any of the trade papers or magazines. Just ignore, ignore, ignore and focus on my world and what's going <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> race car. That's what I'll do through the rest of the Chase." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965 season Tauranac {{was losing}} {{interest}} in this arrangement, reasoning that [...] "it {{was just a matter of}} a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't get to go racing very much" [...] and [...] "I might as well get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> main line business, which was selling production cars." [...] Although Brabham investigated using chassis from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO. This agreement was not reached until November 1965. Repco delivered the first example of the new engine to the team's headquarters in the United Kingdom in late 1965, just weeks before the first Formula One race to the new regulations, the non-championship South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1966. Rather than build a new car in the limited time available, BRO pressed chassis number F1-1-1965, the sole and unused BT19, into service.|$|E

500|$|On January 25, 1994, the Chandlers' {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court with $15,331,250 to be held in a trust fund for Jordan, $1.5 million for each of his parents and the family's lawyer slated to receive $5 million for a total of {{approximately}} $23 million (although another source showed Feldman was to receive $3 million based on a September 1993 retainer, for a total of $21 million). According to a motion passed to Judge Melville in 2004, leading up to the 2005 trial, Evan Chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with Jackson's insurer. [...] Jackson's insurance company [...] "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of Mr. Jackson and his personal legal counsel" [...] and was [...] "the source of the settlement amounts"; as noted in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson. It also noted [...] "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of precedents in California. Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court) or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case. That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case. In 2004, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau in People v. Jackson said [...] "People who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits. Michael Jackson now regrets making these payments. These settlements were entered into with one primary condition – that condition was that Mr. Jackson never admitted any wrongdoing. Mr. Jackson always denied doing anything wrong...Mr. Jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong." [...] Jackson explained why had he tried to settle: [...] "I wanted to go <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> life. Too many people had already been hurt. I want to make records. I want to sing. I want to perform again...It's my talent. My hard work. My life. My decision." [...] He also wanted to avoid a [...] "media circus".|$|E

Haye has had a long-standing plan to retire early. After the Harrison fight Haye said his plans to retire before he is 31 had not altered: [...] "I will have achieved what I wanted to achieve – undisputed cruiserweight champion, unify the heavyweight division and then call it a day." [...] In December 2010, during the negotiations to fight Wladimir Klitschko, Haye said if the fight did not happen, [...] "I'll just have to accept that becoming the WBA champion was enough and move <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> life. That'll be 20 years of getting punched in the face, which is a long enough time. I set my goals and achieved them so unifying the titles is the cherry on the cake but if it doesn't happen it wasn't meant to be and I've just got to get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> life".|$|E

On the ground, Fromme said, [...] "It didn't go off. Can you believe it? It didn't go off". One of the Secret Service agents shouted [...] "get down, let's go".

[...] Ford continued his walk to the California state house, entered, and then met with California governor Jerry Brown at 10:06a.m. for 30minutes without mentioning the assassination attempt until they were through talking business.

[...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease.

She labored for 13 hours and decided to give a painful birth, without anaesthesia, to feel the sacrifices of being a mother.

[...] She added that she is not hooked in social media and she often just post pictures to promote her shows.

[...] and this is often accompanied by a rousing rendition of [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again", and always by rousing cheers from the audience.
