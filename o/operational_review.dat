2500|$|In 2014 the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) {{released}} Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National <b>Operational</b> <b>Review.</b> This publication {{documents the}} official {{findings of this}} demographic as well as advises for future change. It finds that there are 164 Aboriginal women still missing and 1,017 murdered, making {{for a total of}} 1,181. [...] "There are 225 unsolved cases of either missing or murdered Aboriginal females: 105 missing for more than 30 days as of November 4, 2013, whose cause of disappearance was categorized as 'unknown' or 'foul play suspected' and 120 unsolved homicides between 1980 and 2012." [...] Indigenous women in Canada are overrepresented among the missing and murdered females in Canada. Additionally, there are shared characteristics among these cases, most of the murders were committed by men and were someone the victim knew, either a partner or an acquaintance. [...] "Aboriginal {{women between the ages of}} 25 and 44 are 5 times more likely than other women of the same age to die as a result of violence" [...] These statistics portray the severity and prevalence of violence against indigenous women in Canada.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the McMahon Line became {{a source of}} tension between China and India. China contends that Tibet was never an {{independent}} state and so it could not sign a treaty on behalf of China to delineate an international frontier. China and India fought the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which nevertheless preserved the status quo ante bellum. Australian journalist and historian Neville Maxwell exposed a top-secret Indian war report that harshly criticised the highest echelons of power in India at the time for pursuing a flawed strategy of provoking China into the war without the means to handle a backlash. The so-called Henderson Brooks-Bhagat Report was an <b>operational</b> <b>review</b> of India's military debacle commissioned by New Delhi that Maxwell managed to obtain. Compiled by Lieutenant-General Henderson Brooks and Brigadier Premindra Singh Bhagat in 1963, it has been kept secret by the Indian government despite repeated appeals that it be declassified.|$|E

5000|$|On 1 January 2017, Azaria's {{defense team}} {{wrote a letter}} to Lieberman in which it asked for a state {{investigation}} into the trial, claiming that due process had been compromised. They cited public comments made after the shooting by IDF Chief of Staff Eizenkot, the IDF Spokesperson's Unit and then-Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, as well as the fact that Azaria was not present for the preliminary <b>operational</b> <b>review</b> following the incident. They also claimed that an unnamed senior military official who was quoted by Channel 10 News as saying that Azaria would be convicted, was the Military Advocate General who was trying to influence the decision of the judges. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit rejected these accusations as baseless and incorrect while military officials stated that the Military Advocate General Sharon Afek had never made any such comments. Human Rights Watch blamed Israeli officials for the incident on 2 January, stating that they encouraged soldiers and police officers to kill Palestinians they suspect of attacking Israelis even when they aren't a threat any longer. On 3 January, Eizenkot criticized those depicting the shooter as a [...] "confused little kid" [...] demeaned the army's character. Former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz as well as 53 reserve battalion commander supported his statements.|$|E
40|$|National Centre for Nano-Structured Materials (NCNSM), {{one of the}} National Department of Science and Technology’s nanotech {{innovation}} centres {{houses a}} characterisation facility which provides {{a wide array of}} high-tech materials characterization techniques used in nanotechnology research, to any researchers from any part of South Africa, whether from higher education institutions, government institutions or private firms. In this study the <b>operational</b> <b>review</b> was conducted to identify if the NCNSM Characterisation Facility is delivering on its implementation intent. With <b>operational</b> <b>review</b> organisations are able to explore their internal operations and seek recommendations as to how they can manage and operate more economically, efficiently and effectively. Given that they perform appropriately, allocating their resources properly, and performing within time frame set and using cost-effective measures. BPR was used as a framework to conduct the <b>operational</b> <b>review.</b> BPR is a framework for analysis and design of workflows and process within an organisation. It is an improvement initiative that provides radical change of the business processes in an organizational process. The findings of this study indicated that the NCNSM-CF did not entirely meet its implementation intent but it is striving towards the intention. One of the main reasons for the facility not to meet its intended implementation was the difficulty of the researchers/clients to get access to the facility. The current booking system process contributed significantly to the access problem...|$|E

In particular, since the preparation activities for the LHC start, the Networks have constantly been of paramount importance for the execution of CMS workflows, exceeding the original expectations - as from the MONARC model - in terms of performance, stability and reliability. The low-latency transfers of PetaBytes of CMS data among dozens of WLCG Tiers worldwide using the PhEDEx dataset replication system {{is an example of}} the importance of reliable Networks.
