500|$|In the 1950 and 1951 general elections, Roberts was the Conservative {{candidate}} for the safe Labour seat of Dartford. The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; prospective candidate Bill Deedes recalled that [...] "Once she <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{the rest of us}} began to look rather second-rate". She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate. She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds, but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951. Denis funded his wife's studies for the bar; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation. Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section.|$|E
500|$|Melody Makers Richard Williams {{summed up}} the {{surprise}} many felt at Harrison's apparent transformation: All Things Must Pass, he said, provided [...] "the rock equivalent of the shock felt by pre-war moviegoers when Garbo first <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> in a talkie: Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!" [...] In another review, for The Times, Williams opined that, of all the Beatles' solo releases thus far, Harrison's album [...] "makes {{far and away the}} best listening, perhaps because it is the one which most nearly continues the tradition they began eight years ago". William Bender of Time magazine described it as an [...] "expressive, classically executed personal statement... one of the outstanding rock albums in years", while Don Heckman wrote in The New York Times: [...] "If anyone had any doubts that George Harrison was a major talent, they can relax... This is a release that shouldn't be missed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{spent most}} of his early career at Universal Studios until The Thing, after which he left for Lucasfilm to work on Return of the Jedi at the {{invitation}} of Howard Kazanjian. From that point on, Brown's career has taken on a freelance aspect that has allowed him to work on an eclectic list of films and with some of the top actors in the business including Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kevin Bacon. During the filming of a scene with Barbra Streisand on All Night Long in which Streisand was playing a character who could not sing, Brown remembered, [...] "...when we started to film that scene, she <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and this incredible voice came out. And everybody on the set just stood there with their mouths open listening to this. Then she stopped because {{she was supposed to be}} singing badly....It was astounding being in the room with her." ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Crowder <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> as if {{she would}} gasp for breath, {{but she did not}} say anything.|$|E
6000|$|She rode forward, flushing. What dared she say? Could she {{speak of}} her wedding, and betray Miltoun's presence? Could she <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> at all without rousing painful feeling of some sort? Then, {{impatient}} of indecision, she began: ...|$|R
30|$|The {{father is}} playing with dummy and then takes it out from Silvana’s mouth. The father opens his mouth and {{suddenly}} Silvana imitates her father which is also opening and closing his <b>mouth.</b> Silvana <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> when the dummy is placed closer to <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> They are intensively looking at each other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you heard}} the Venusina?" [...] said Lady Corisande, with animation; [...] "I know nothing that I look forward to with more interest. But I was told she was not to <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> until she {{appeared}} at the opera. Where did you hear her?" ...|$|R

5000|$|The second {{manner in}} which the {{familiar}} spirit commonly appeared to magical practitioners in Britain was that they would be given to a person by a pre-existing individual, who was sometimes a family member and at other times a more powerful spirit. For instance, the alleged witch Margaret Ley from Liverpool claimed, in 1667, that she had been given her familiar spirit by her mother when she died, while the Leicestershire cunning-woman Joan Willimot related, in 1618, that a mysterious figure whom she only referred to as her [...] "master", [...] "willed <b>her</b> to <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and he would blow into her a fairy which should do her good. And that she <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and that presently after blowing, there came out of <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> a spirit which stood upon the ground in the shape and form of a woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do I know if she's an artist? She won't <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to me; {{what she}} wants is to make me say things to her. She does make me--I don't know how--and she sits there gaping at me with her big eyes. They look like open pockets!" ...|$|R

25|$|Courtship {{involves}} small, quick head twitches by the male, who exhibits brighter courtship colours. If {{the female}} rejects the male's advances, she assumes a much darker colour, sway {{from side to}} side, and often <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> threateningly. Darker colours are often associated with stress, and lighter colours with relaxation or sleep.|$|R
