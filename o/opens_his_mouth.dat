500|$|Keshi {{assumes the}} form of a huge horse, who gallops at the speed of thoughts, wears the earth with his hooves and {{scatters}} celestial vehicles and clouds in the sky with his mane. His neighing terrifies the people. Krishna challenges Keshi to a duel, as the horse is creating havoc around Gokula. Keshi roars like a lion and charges towards Krishna, striking him with his hooves. Krishna catches hold of Keshi's two legs and tosses him to a great distance. Recovering from the fall, the agitated Keshi <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and attacks Krishna. As soon as Krishna thrusts his left arm into Keshi's mouth, all of Keshi's teeth fall. [...] Krishna's arm expands, and Keshi chokes to death, as sweat flows from his body, his eyes roll and he struggles kicking his feet. As Keshi falls lifeless on the ground, assuming his true demon form, the gods and Narada extol Krishna. Narada in his panegyric thanks Krishna for easily slaying the horse-demon, whose neighing alone was driving the gods to abandon heaven. He further prophesies the great deeds that Krishna will perform later, including the killing of Kamsa.|$|E

50|$|The demon Dantavakra is {{not able}} to <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> to release the Chakra; because if he <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and loosen the Chakra, the {{rotating}} chakra will cut <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> So he keep on stand for a long time with tightly bitten Chakra by his big teeth. Though this inactive state/pose of demon is advantage to Lord Krishna to kill him easily, But Lord Krishna wished and make a trick-plan to <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Neither Lord Krishna wishes to Touch him nor to harm with his hand. Lord Krishna wishes that the demon killed only with his Chakra.|$|R

However Liz Davies wrote that on the Labour National Executive Committee Prescott [...] "spoke in clear, concise sentences and his point was always understandable. Contrary to his television and parliamentary image, he appears to choose his words with care." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{began as}} soon as the band entered Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles on March 6, 2002. Much of Sea Change was {{recorded}} live, with extra effects (including bells and strings) added later. In order to capture the immediacy of the material, the artists worked quickly and spontaneously, frequently laying second takes of songs to disc. During production, Beck realized his singing voice had gotten significantly deeper. [...] "Before we recorded," [...] said Godrich, [...] "We listened to Mutations, and his voice sounded like Mickey Mouse. His range has dropped. Now when he <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> a canyonesque vibration comes out. It's quite remarkable. He has amazing tone." ...|$|E
