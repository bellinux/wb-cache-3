6000|$|In short, Darwin {{maintains}} that the <b>origination</b> <b>of</b> a species, no {{less than that of}} an individual, is natural; the reviewer, that the natural <b>origination</b> <b>of</b> an individual, no less than the <b>origination</b> <b>of</b> a species, requires and presupposes Divine power. A fortiori, then, the <b>origination</b> <b>of</b> a variety requires and presupposes Divine power. And so between the scientific hypothesis of the one and the philosophical conception of the other no contrariety remains. And so, concludes the North American reviewer, [...] "a proper view of the nature of causation places the vital doctrine of the being and the providence of a God on ground that can never be shaken."[III-16] A worthy conclusion, and a sufficient answer to the denunciations and arguments {{of the rest of the}} article, so far as philosophy and natural theology are concerned. If a writer must needs use his own favorite dogma as a weapon with which to give coup de grace to a pernicious theory, he should be careful to seize his edge-tool by the handle, and not by the blade.|$|R
