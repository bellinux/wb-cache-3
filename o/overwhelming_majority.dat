It is shown that a voting rule must be a scoring rule if it satisfies three basic axioms: reinforcement, <b>overwhelming</b> <b>majorities,</b> and neutrality. Other range and nonreversal axioms are also discussed. ...|$|R

2500|$|One {{exceptional}} {{example of}} [...] "states rights" [...] persuading <b>overwhelming</b> <b>majorities</b> {{in a democratic}} and sustained way, and so transforming the nation came in the John Adams administration.

But the Federalist-sponsored Alien and Sedition Acts meant to preempt the danger led to suppression of opposition press. The political reaction in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions sparked public opposition against the Federalist policy and led to twenty-four years of Constitutionally elected Democratic-Republican Party rule through six administrations of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe.|$|R
