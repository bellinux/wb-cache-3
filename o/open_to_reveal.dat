5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and runs down the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E
25|$|This story {{tells the}} classic tale of Aladdin (Jason Scott Lee), a Chinese thief {{living in the}} {{caliphate}} of Samarkand. While fleeing authorities for pick-pocketing, he sees a carriage and blocks its path. The carriage windows <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the Princess Zubaïda (Vanessa-Mae). The two see each other and fall in love.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} doors <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the private apartments of Harrison Hightower, the idol {{sitting on a}} table in the center. Hightower, under a ghostly form, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out to touch it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open {{elevator doors}} {{at the opposite end of}} the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft, which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close.|$|E

25|$|Ixerba brexioides, {{the sole}} {{species in the}} genus Ixerba, is a bushy tree with thick, narrow, serrated, dark green leaves and panicles of white flowers with a green hart. The fruit is a green capsule that splits <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the black seeds partly covered with a fleshy scarlet aril against the white inside of the fruit. Ixerba is an endemic of the {{northern}} half of the North Island of New Zealand. Common names used in New Zealand are tāwari for the tree and whakou when in flower. It is assigned to the family Strasburgeriaceae.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a {{few seconds}} before coming to its first stop. The doors <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window {{at the opposite end of}} the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the crew}} make a last stand against the Reavers to buy Mal time to {{broadcast}} the recording. Through a message recorded by Mr. Universe into his sex robot before his death, Mal learns of a backup transmitter. Sustaining heavy injuries, the crew retreats behind a set of blast doors that fail to properly close. A Reaver shoots through the opening and severely wounds Simon, prompting River to dive through the doors and close them as the Reavers drag her away. At the backup transmitter, Mal incapacitates the Operative and forces him to watch the broadcast recording. Mal returns to the crew, and the blast doors <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> that River has killed all the Reavers. Alliance troops arrive, but the Operative orders them to stand down.|$|E

25|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of naturalism and {{the depiction of}} realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is {{a photograph of a}} crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.|$|E
25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. The bedroom door is then blown <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E
500|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop; these are [...] long, which somewhat resemble a boat in shape. These ripen the following May to September, and split <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> (and spill) 10–16seeds. Arranged in two columns, the winged, flat brown seeds are around [...] long with a roughly rectangular wing [...] long. New shoots often grow through flowerheads.|$|E

500|$|Walls <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> an {{audience}} applauding; Jem, Damien, and the hunters are {{shown to be}} actors. The woman is strapped to a chair, and Baxter appears and explains the facade. Her name is Victoria Skillane, and {{the girl in the}} photo is a six-year-old girl named Jemima Sykes. Victoria and her fiancé, Iain Rannoch, abducted the girl a few miles from her home. Iain tortured and killed the girl before burning her body, while Victoria recorded his actions on her mobile phone. The [...] "White Bear", originally the victim's teddy bear, became a symbol of the nationwide search and the murder investigation. The symbol on the television was identical to the tattoo that identified Iain, who committed suicide in his cell before the trial. Having tearfully pleaded guilty, insisting she was [...] "under Iain's spell", Victoria was sentenced to undergo the daily punishment she has just experienced.|$|E
500|$|The Matterhorn is a {{subwoofer}} model {{completed in}} March 2007 by Danley Sound Labs in Gainesville, Georgia after a U.S. military {{request for a}} loudspeaker that could project infrasonic waves over a distance. The Matterhorn was designed to reproduce a continuous sine wave from 15 to 20Hz, and generate 94dB {{at a distance of}} , and more than 140dB for music playback measured at the horn mouth. It can generate a constant 15Hz sine wave tone at 140dB for 24 hours a day, seven days a week with extremely low harmonic distortion. The subwoofer has a flat frequency response from 15 to 80Hz, and is down 3dB at 12Hz. It was built within an intermodal container [...] long and [...] square. The container doors swing <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a tapped horn driven by 40 long-throw 15-inch (40cm) MTX speaker drivers each powered by its own 1000-watt amplifier. The manufacturer claims that 53 13-ply 18mm [...] sheets of plywood were used in its construction, though one of the fabricators wrote that double-thickness 26-ply sheets were used for convenience.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a gothic cathedral setting, which was {{developed}} by Tait Towers, a production management company. They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant thurible back and forth, as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a giant confessional, covered by a scrim at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra peeking out from the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008). Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot at the crowd, giving way to the second performance of the show, [...] "Revolver". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E

2500|$|Beverly {{has been}} {{featured}} in many films and TV shows, either {{as part of the}} plot or a filming location. [...] Many movies, including Clueless, Real Women Have Curves, Whatever It Takes, [...] The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, and It's a Wonderful Life, featured a scene in Beverly's unique [...] "Swim Gym," [...] perhaps the only gymnasium that has a basketball court that can split <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a recreational-sized, [...] swimming pool. The gym in Beverly Hills High was used in the video for boy band NLT's That Girl.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first act}} Xlectro Static act opens {{the show with}} a futuristic video showing the outline of Minogue's face {{polarized}} in neon colours. The massive video curtains slide <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Minogue perched in a giant hoop dressed in a 'spiderwoman' gown (the dress, however, was changed as the tour reached South America). On technically limited shows, the giant stereo speakers (and other related props) moved rapidly to reveal Minogue. She performed her worldwide hit [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] as well as [...] "In Your Eyes" [...] and an unreleased track entitled [...] "Ruffle My Feathers".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the last}} word of Serling's narration, the {{elevator}} starts its drop sequence. Rather than a simple gravity-powered drop, however, the elevator is pulled downwards, causing most riders to rise off their seats, held down by a seat belt. At least once during the drop sequence, wide elevator doors {{in front of the}} riders <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a view of the park from a height of , however the drop is only , the height of a 13-story building. The elevator drops at a top speed of [...] In the Hollywood Studios version, the back of the [...] "Hollywood Tower Hotel" [...] sign partially obstructs the view (the on-ride camera is located here, recording the ride for video or a photograph to be purchased later).|$|E
