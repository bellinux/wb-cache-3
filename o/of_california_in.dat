5|$|Just 23 {{days after}} his death, the Regents of the University of California voted to rename two of the university's nuclear {{research}} sites after Lawrence: the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award was established in his memory in 1959. Chemical element number 103, discovered at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1961, was named lawrencium after him. In 1968 the Lawrence Hall of Science public science education center was established in his honor. His papers are in the Bancroft Library at the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{was hired}} as an {{associate}} professor of physics at the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1928, and two years later became a full professor, becoming the university's youngest professor. Robert Gordon Sproul, who became university president the day after Lawrence became a professor, {{was a member of the}} Bohemian Club, and he sponsored Lawrence's membership in 1932. Through this club, Lawrence met William Henry Crocker, Edwin Pauley, and John Francis Neylan. They were influential men who helped him obtain money for his energetic nuclear particle investigations. There was great hope for medical uses to come from the development of particle physics, and this led to much of the early funding for advances Lawrence was able to obtain.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence went on {{to build}} a series of ever larger and more {{expensive}} cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition {{to the use of}} the cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During World War II, Lawrence developed electromagnetic isotope separation at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which came to be called Y-12. The process was inefficient, but it worked.|$|E
