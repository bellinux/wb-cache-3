The UNIVAC I was designed with parallel computation circuits and result comparison. In practice, only failing components yielded comparison faults as their circuit designs were very reliable. Tricks were used to manage the reliability of tubes. Prior {{to use in the}} machine, large lots of the predominant tube type 25L6 were burned in and carefully tested. Often half of a production lot would be thrown away. Technicians installed a tested and burned in tube in an easily diagnosed location such as the memory recirculate amplifiers. Then when aged further, this [...] "golden" [...] tube was sent to stock to be used in a difficult to diagnose logic position. It took about 30 minutes to turn on the computer as all filament power supplies were stepped up to <b>operating</b> <b>value</b> over that time, to reduce in-rush current and thermal stress on the tubes. As a result, uptimes (MTBF) of many days to weeks were obtained on the processor. The UNISERVO did not have vacuum columns, rather had springs and strings to buffer tape from the reels to the capstan. These were a frequent source of failures.|$|E

We consider spatial multiplexing transmission with linear maximum ratio combining and zero forcing receivers, as well as orthogonal space time block coded transmission. New closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probability, throughput and transmission capacity. Our results demonstrate that both the best performing scheme and the optimum number of transmit antennas depend on different network parameters, such as the node intensity and the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio <b>operating</b> <b>value.</b> We then compare the performance to a network consisting of single-antenna devices and an idealized fully centrally coordinated MAC. These results show that multi-antenna schemes with a simple decentralized slotted ALOHA MAC can outperform even idealized single-antenna networks in various practical scenarios.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results obtained}} in the experimental measurement of the reactor heat extracted by the coolant during two different scrams of the DR Reactor. These tests were conducted with the reactor flow carefully controlled to establish different reactor coolant temperatures following the scram. During normal reactor scrams, which {{have been used in}} the past to measure the reactor heat output, a high coolant flow was maintained. Consequently, the coolant outlet temperature dropped very quickly from an <b>operating</b> <b>value</b> of 90 to 95 C down to 20 to 30 C following the scram. Under emergency conditions, however, with only the last ditch emergency flow available, the coolant outlet temperature could remain as high as 80 to 90 C. This condition could prevail because of the small amount of last ditch flow available, and could last for 5 to as long as 70 minutes after the reactor scram...|$|E
40|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{is used to}} produce molten iron from iron oxides, coke, and flux.

When this situation arises, manual corrective actions {{must be taken to}} restore the iron temperature to its proper operating range. The corrective actions usually lead to a decrease in the production rate of molten iron. Furthermore, the lower iron temperatures usually indicate a reduction in iron quality because the trace element chemistry in the iron changes. The combination of these two factors means that iron-making companies seek to avoid chilled hearth conditions because they are economically ex [...] ...|$|E

Steady-state and transient data were recorded and are presented with a description of the four control loops being used in the system. Results of this investigation indicated that single-lever control operation was satisfactory under conditions of test. Transient data presented showed that turbine-outlet temperature did overshoot maximum <b>operating</b> <b>value</b> on acceleration but that the time duration of overshoot did not exceed approximately 1 second.

Number of techniques have been attempted to maintain the temperature of photovoltaic cells close to their nominal <b>operating</b> <b>value.</b> In the present review various cooling techniques such as natural and forced air cooling, hydraulic cooling, heat pipe cooling, cooling with phase change materials and thermoelectric cooling of PV panels are discussed at length.

Most network regulators require a dropping probability of equal to or less than 3 % and blocking probability of equal to or less than 5 %, to ensure QoS performance. However, a 7 [*]×[*] 7 parallelogram-shaped CMS with a 7 -cell reuse cluster is considered herein and three EMC constraints are simultaneously imposed under a high traffic load. Clearly, a larger channel reuse distance causes fewer channels to be reused throughout the service area. Section 4.2 investigated the effect of the three EMC constraints on the blocking probability and the dropping probability and presented that these three EMC constraints greatly worsen the performance of channel assignment methods. When the increase in traffic load exceeded 40 %, the blocking probability exceeded its recommended <b>operating</b> <b>value</b> of 5 %. Finally, high traffic loads were used to test the robustness of the proposed method. Under high traffic load, few resources are available and call requests tend to be blocked or dropped. The blocking probability and dropping probability tend to increase significantly when the traffic overload is very large owing to the exhaustion of system resources.|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} is presented {{of the impact}} of recent magnetohydrodynamic research results on performance projections for reactor-scale tokamaks as exemplified by the ITER Final Design Report facility. For nominal ELMy H-mode operation, the presence and amplitude of neoclassical tearing modes governs the achievable b-value. Recent work finds that the scaling of b at which such modes onset agrees well with a polarization drift model, with the consequence that, with reasonable assumptions regarding seed-island width, the mode onset b will be lower in reactor-scale tokamaks than in contemporary devices. Confinement degradation by such modes, on the other hand, depends on relative saturated island size which is governed by principally by b and secondarily by n *-effects on bootstrap current density. Relative saturated island size should be comparable in present and reactor devices. DT ITER Demonstration Discharges in JET exhibited no confinement degradation at the planned ITER <b>operating</b> <b>value</b> of b N= 2. 2. Theory indicates that Electron Cyclotron Current Drive can either stabilize these modes or appreciably reduce saturated island size. Turning to operation in candidate steady-state, reverse-shear, high-bootstrap-fraction configurations, wall stabilization of external kink modes is effective while the plasma is rotating but (so far) rotation has not been maintained.
