5|$|East <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> {{there is}} a flying {{junction}} that connects to the Jamaica Yard via a wye that curves east from the yard towards Briarwood. A second side of the wye curves west to become {{a lower level of}} the subway just west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> The yard itself is situated just north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> in the southern portion of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, between the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway.|$|E
5|$|South <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> {{underneath}} 92nd Street, is {{a diamond}} crossover allowing northbound trains from track S2 to terminate on either track, then {{go into the}} storage tracks or proceed south on track S1. A section of tunnel north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> built in the 1970s between 99th and 105th Streets, was renovated. The tail tracks north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> which currently end at 99th Street, can store four trainsets, two on each track.|$|E

30|$|Comparing the {{hydrostatic}} mapping functions, {{differences were}} invariable at the tenths; differences at the 0.01 level (unitless) occurred at 3 ° elevation angle for 87 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stations.</b> <b>The</b> respective wet mapping function, however, reached twice that value—differences at 0.02 level—for 14 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> at <b>the</b> same elevation angle. Yet, {{owing to the}} ZWD being at least 10 times smaller than ZHD, the slant delay differences did not exceed 20  mm for 61 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
5|$|A small siding {{immediately}} west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> originally {{led to a}} stable, which {{housed the}} Tramway's horses. After the line's mechanisation in 1872 the stables were closed, and the siding served a small cattle pen.|$|E

50|$|Egis India was {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> such as floors and doors, and <b>the</b> Indian Institute <b>of</b> Architecture (Kochi Chapter) developed <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> roof and <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stations.</b> <b>The</b> IIA presented <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> 14 <b>stations</b> to <b>the</b> KMRL on 14-15 March 2014.|$|R
50|$|There are fifteen <b>stations</b> on <b>the</b> route.

5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on either ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> {{hall and the}} two escalator tunnels. On the side {{that leads to the}} exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, at the very end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time.

5|$|However, in 2007, {{construction}} resumed on the Second Avenue Subway, {{and as part}} of the line's construction, the BMT side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> {{would finally}} be used. The orange wall was removed and replaced by a temporary barrier. Beige-white wall tiles were installed on the station walls adjacent to the tracks. The never-opened entrance at Third Avenue was redesigned with multiple elevators, and the station's false ceiling was removed. Before Second Avenue Subway service began operating, the temporary walls were removed, revealing the BMT side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> On January 1, 2017, {{the first phase of the}} Second Avenue Subway opened, with Q trains, and limited rush hour N trains serving the BMT half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> Ridership has increased at the station with the opening of the Third Avenue exit and the introduction of Q service. Many passengers now take advantage of the cross-platform transfer available between the F and the Q.|$|E

5|$|In December 2016, Transport for London {{published}} outline proposals {{prepared by}} architects BuckleyGrayYeoman for a redevelopment {{of the buildings}} to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> arcade and in Thurloe Street and space to the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> cutting on Pelham Street. The proposal includes bringing the disused northern platform back into use for eastbound trains, a new entrance to Thurloe Street, a reconfigured ticket hall and provision of step-free access throughout the station.|$|E
5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily {{associated with the}} relocation of fiber optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove the tunnel and replace it with an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E
50|$|Others {{were named}} for <b>the</b> {{original}} formats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stations.</b> WLGH and WTLI were <b>The</b> Light.

All call letters beginning with WDT (WDTE, WDTP and WDTR) serve portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Detroit metropolitan area.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demerger, all <b>stations</b> were {{transferred}} to NSB, but the administration retained ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platforms. All <b>stations</b> opened after 1996 were owned by the administration; this has caused a complex ownership structure where sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> may have different owners. <b>The</b> operation <b>of</b> all <b>stations</b> was remained at the administration, while the NSB subsidiary Rom Eiendom is responsible for managing the railway unrelated sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stations,</b> for instance <b>the</b> shopping center in Oslo Central Station.|$|R

5|$|In October 2016, the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA) {{took over}} {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> from the MBTA under a lease agreement. The agreement relieves the MBTA from {{the cost of}} maintaining the station, while allowing the MWRTA to use parking revenue to construct bus shelters and additional parking areas.

5|$|In September 2017, TfL {{proposed}} various station improvements {{including a}} second entrance on Procter Street to the north-east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> lifts to provide step free access, and new tunnels {{to improve the}} interchange between the Central and Piccadilly lines.
