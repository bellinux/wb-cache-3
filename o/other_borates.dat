40|$|Abstract: Turkey has {{the largest}} borate {{reserves}} {{in the world and}} Argentina is in third place. Both countries have calcium and sodium borate deposits where colemanite, ulexite and borax are the principal minerals. We present here a comparison of the main borate deposits interlayered in continental Miocene volcaniclastic rocks of the Anatolian plateau (Turkey) and those of the Puna high plateau (Argentina). The main borate deposits of Turkey are at Emet, Bigadiç, Kestelek and K›rka. Emet is {{in the western part of}} the Kütahya province. In Emet, a sedimentary lacustrine sequence rich in tuffaceous materials hosts the colemanite section. There are limestones and marl layers at the base and top of the borate section. Arsenic minerals (realgar and orpiment) are very abundant and spatially related to the borates, indicating a common genetic origin. The principal borate mineral is colemanite with minor ulexite, hydroboracite, meyerhofferite, and rarer species such as veatchite-A, tunellite, teruggite and cahnite. Colemanite occurs as nodules of different sizes, agglomerated in thick beds. Bigadiç has borates interbedded with tuffs, clay and limestone layers. The borate minerals are formed in two distinct zones, lower and upper, separated by thick tuff beds. Colemanite and ulexite predominate in both borate zones. <b>Other</b> <b>borates</b> include howlite, probertite and hydroboracite in the lower zone, and inyoite, meyerhofferite, pandermite (priceite), terschite, hydroboracite, howlite, tunellite and rivadavite in the upper borate zone...|$|E
40|$|The Emet borate {{deposits}} {{are shown}} to be older and mineralogically more complex than previously thought. They are considered to have formed within the muds of separate or interconnected playa lakes, in areas of volcanic and seismic activity, fed partly by thermal springs and partly by streams draining the catchment areas, under arid or semi-arid climatic conditions during the Middle Oligocene. The borate minerals formed in two geochemically distinct sedimentary basins and are interbedded with limestone, marls, volcanic tuffs and clays, much of which {{appear to have been}} derived mostly from a volcanic terrain. The borates show mineralogical and geochemical features in the two basins which are sufficiently different to suggest that the chemical compositions of ground and surface waters in the two basins differed at least from time to time. Basement metamorphic rocks and Tertiary limestone might also have been exposed and erosion of these may have contributed Ca and Sr to the lake waters. Sediments in the borate lakes are cyclical with both lateral and vertical facies changes. The clastic sediments in both basins are similar but are very much thicker in the northern basin. The total Tertiary sedimentary thickness exceeds 750 metres. The borate zone varies in thickness between 0 - 100 metres and reaches its maximum thickness in the northern deposits. The Middle Oligocene sedimentary formations, including the borate zone, are far more faulted than previously thought. Thermal springs, which at present deposit travertine and sulphur, are active and widespread west of the Emet River. Colemanite predominates and occurs in many different forms. <b>Other</b> <b>borates</b> include meyerhofferite, ulexite, tunellite, teruggite, cahnite, hydroboracite and either veatchite or p-veatchite. Cahnite has not hitherto been identified from borate deposits. Calcite, gypsum, celestite, native sulphur, realgar and orpiment are the principal associated minerals. Montmorillonite and illite are the only clay mineral groups identified. Volcanic rocks, closely related to the Middle Oligocene lacustrine sediments, range from rhyolites to basalts and are very rich in potash relative to soda. A complete transition exists between tuffs and clays in the Emet borate zone sediments and is reflected in their geochemistry. All tuffs, clays and limestones are characterized by a relatively high concentration of B, As, S and Sr, and high Fe 203 :FeO ratios which indicate strongly oxidising conditions of sedimentation, with a very low rate of leaching. The deposits are characterized by high Ca borate (colemanite), very low Na, poor Cl and relatively high Mg, Sr, As and S concentrations compared with other borate deposits. Like the sediments, the borates are also characterized by a relatively high Fe 203 :FeO ratio, suggesting strongly oxidising conditions of precipitation. The geochemical investigations suggest that the most likely sources of B, As and S were from the Tertiary volcanic rocks and associated thermal springs. The major sources of Ca, Mg and Sr are considered to be due to leaching of underlying basement rocks and Tertiary limestone by thermal springs. Investigation of the genesis of colemanite reveals no field evidence to unambiguously support its formation by replacement of ulexite or dehydration of inyoite after burial. The early colemanite nodules were probably formed directly from brines, penecontemporaneously within the unconsolidated sediments below the sediment/water interface, and continued to grow as the sediments were compacted. Possibly the brines were never sufficiently concentrated to allow borate precipitation until the lakes were partially or wholly dried up. Later generations of colemanite occur in vughs, veins and as fibrous margins to colemanite nodules. Other diagenetic changes include the partial replacement of colemanite by hydroboracite, calcite, cahnite and a veatchite mineral. When weathered, colemanite is often almost completely replaced by calcite. Realgar, celestite and sulphur appear to have been deposited both during and after the formation of the borates. Quantitatively known reserves in the Emet district are more adequate but their quality is less assured. The presence of arsenic in both the sulphide and borate phases can present problems during mineral processing. However, the Emet borates are high-grade colemanite deposits and should supply a substantial quantity of the world's needs for many years...|$|E

An equilibrium {{is observed}} {{between the two}} diastereomeric complexes 3 and 4 formed by coordination to the boron center of either amino group of 2 e. At - 78 °C, this equilibrium is slow on the NMR timescale and a diastereomeric ratio of about 3 : 1 is observed. At room temperature, a rapid equilibration is observed resulting in two NMR resonances (both 1 H and 13 C) for the dimethylamino groups of 2 e in 3 / 4. Comparison with the NMR characteristics of the analogous borate complexes of 1 h and 1 j and of 2 c and 2 d shows that these resonances each correspond to both methyl groups of a single dimethylamino group. The chemical shift difference occurs solely from {{the difference between the}} time fractions that the dimethylamino groups are coordinated to the boron center, and forms, therefore, a direct measure of the ratio 3 / 4. This ratio amounts to 63 : 37 at room temperature, which was confirmed by a protonation titration experiment.

40|$|A {{limited number}} of {{lacustrine}} basins in western Turkey contain world class borate reserves, with mineralisation present as strata bound deposits in Neogene volcano-sedimentary successions. This study examined in detail the relationship between magmatism and borate mineralisation in two of these basins (Ernet and Kirka).;The magmatism comprised an Early Miocene K-rich acid phase, represented by granite, ignimbrite, rhyolite and dacite, and a more mafic K-rich, Middle - Late Miocene phase, represented by shoshonite and latite. Information from field observations, mineralogy, isotopic dates, immobile element concentrations and biotite compositions indicate that acid magmatism in Ernet and Kirka Basins was closely related in both space and time to the deposition of the borate-host sediments, whilst mafic volcanism occurred later.;The mineralogical and geochemical composition of the borate-host sediments was strongly influenced by the post-depositional modification of rhyolitic, ignimbritic and granitic-derived material in a saline, alkaline environment. The result {{of the interaction between}} saline, alkaline waters and dominantly acid igneous products, was the generation of an authigenic mineral assemblage comprising mainly calcite, dolomite, borate, trioctahedral smectite and K-feldspar. Trioctahedral smectite, dolomite and K-feldspar, together with elevated concentrations of As, Sr and Li, correlate particularly well with borate mineralisation.;The geochemistry of the Early Miocene acid igneous rocks suggests that acid magmatism represented a likely source for B and Li, and probably also for As and Sr. Possible mechanisms for the transfer of B and other elements from an igneous source to the basin sediments include; transfer by igneous-driven geothermal fluids, rich in B as a result of hydrothermal leaching and contributions from magmatic waters and gases, and the breakdown of igneous material in saline, alkaline lakes. Trace element and Nd and Sr isotropic data indicate that the ultimate source of the B was assimilated upper continental crust, perhaps with some component of melted lithospheric mantle.

40|$|Reactivity {{accident}} scenarios {{can occur}} originated by internal boron dilution {{in the primary}} system of a nuclear pressurized water reactor type (PWR or VVER). In essence the problem is caused by boron dilution following vaporization and condensation of the primary system coolant in case of decrease of primary system mass inventory, for example during a small-break {{loss of coolant accident}} (SB-LOCA) that may include boiling in the core with condensation of steam in the steam generators. When the liquid level in the reactor vessel decreases below the hot leg elevation, steam begins to flow to the steam generators and condenses there. This steam carries no boron and thus boron concentration in the cold leg loop seals begins to decrease. If for some reason this water plug with low boron concentration begins to flow towards the core and enters it without any major mixing with the borated coolant, the result is a positive reactivity insertion. The paper presents an analysis by RELAP 5 Mod 3. 3 code [1] of a small break LOCA of 20 cm 2 area in the lower plenum of a four-loop PWR nuclear reactor. The boundary conditions of the calculations consider the eight accumulator tanks available, two/four low pressure injection systems (LPIS) available, and two of the four high pressure injection systems (HPIS) available. Sensitivity calculations were performed, regarding among other things, the boron concentration in the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and reactor cooling system (RCS) from Design Basis Accident (DBA) to beyond DBA conditions. From the results obtained, in some calculations boron dilution is observed in more than one loop seal. The situation in which the plugs in the loop seals are transported to the core without mixing with <b>other</b> <b>borated</b> water led to a potentially hazardous situation for four calculations in which initial conditions were far from DBA.

Moreover, the halo-substituted borates show a large enhancement of conductivity in the low concentration range (10 (- 8) M), whereas that of tetraphenylborate is small and space charge is negligible.

Time-resolved photocurrents and voltages demonstrate that the translocation rate of the porphyrin cation is also enhanced 100 -fold by the Cl-borate anion but only 10 -fold by the H-borate anion. For these reasons the nonlinear gating effect cannot be explained by electrostatics alone, but requires an ion chain or ion aggregate mechanism.

Two publications have appeared in the literature based on work at this facility [1, 2], and other work has been presented at several conferences and is being prepared for publication. Significant findings are summarized below. Enhanced site resolution in 11 B MAS NMR. While differentiation between three- and four-coordinate borons in borates can generally be achieved at moderately high fields (e. g.,> 11. 7 T), the distinction between different three-coordinate borons requires very high fields. In the present case, 11 B MAS NMR of a lithium borate invert glass at 21. 1 T yielded unprecedented resolution of the various trigonal borons present and provided an opportunity to test speciation models in the high-alkali region. Surprisingly, these experiments also found significant differences between the network structure of lithium borates and those of the <b>other</b> alkali <b>borate</b> glasses, where lower-field NMR studies found none. Furthermore, the cation disorder and paramagnetic impurities often present in natural minerals can cause peak broadening which compromises site resolution and quantification in borosilicates. Using the ultrahigh-field NMR facility, well-resolved 11 B MAS NMR spectra could be obtained for tourmalines, allowing straightforward analysis of the total and fractional boron contents, quantities not easily accessible by conventional techniques such as x-ray diffraction and electron-microprobe analysis. Reduced quadrupolar broadening and amplified chemical shift dispersion at high field combine to produce excellent site resolution and quantification required to determine key aspects of short- and medium-range ordering in borates.

In this work, the reversible valence change for the Eun+ (n = 2 or 3) ions in the doped barium octaborate (BaB 8 O 13 :Eun+) materials, which are also well known to provide the strong blue band emission as mentioned above, 6 has been observed by crystallizing or vitrify-ing them even in air at 973 - 1273 K, and the redox mechanism has been proposed by {{taking into account the}} structural property for the crystalline and vitreous phases and applied to some host lattices in the <b>other</b> metal <b>borate</b> systems. Experimental Crystalline barium borates doped by 1 atom % of Eun+ ions, BaB 2 O 4 :Eun+, BaB 4 O 7 :Eun+, and BaB 8 O 13 :Eun+, were prepared by heating the intimate mixture pellets of BaCO 3 :Eu 3 + and H 3 BO 3 in air at 973 - 1273 K for 5 x 2 h (two times). The vitreous materials of BaB 4 O 7 :Eun+ and BaB 8 O 13 :Eun+ were produced by melting the as-heating the as-melted vitreous bulk samples at 1048 K for 30 h in Ar. While the color of both the crystalline and recrystallized materials was white, the vitreous samples prepared by melting the crystalline BaB 8 O 13 :Eu 2 + materials in air or Ar were colored light yellow and green, respectively. The barium carbonate, BaCO 3 :Eu 3 +, was copre-cipitated from a BaCl 2 aqueous solution containing 1 mol % of EuCl 3 by adding a NH 4 CO 3 saturated one and dried in vacuo at 373 K for 5 h. Structural and optical properties for the resulting barium borates doped by Eun+ ions were characterized by powder X-ray dif-fraction (XRD), infrared (IR), and photoluminescence (PL) spec-trum measurements made on their powders at room temperature.

40|$|International audienceThe crystal {{structures}} of {{two members of}} the Li 2 O−B 2 O 3 phase diagram, Li 6 B 4 O 9 and Li 3 B 11 O 18, have been solved from single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and their structure has been further confirmed by Rietveld refinement on powder samples. Li 6 B 4 O 9 crystallizes in the P 21 /n space group with a = 3. 31913 (15) Å, b = 23. 361 (2) Å, c = 9. 1582 (4) Å, and β = 92. 650 (4) °. It is the only lithium borate being built upon clusters made of four BO 3 triangular units linked by vertices.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 New {{chemical}} synthesis strategies {{have been investigated}} for the preparation of acceptor-type graphite intercalation compounds (GIC's) with fluoroanions {{in order to obtain}} new materials and to develop {{a better understanding of the}} synthetic approaches and properties of the products. New GIC's containing borate chelate anion such as bis(oxalato) borate, CxB[OC(O) C(O) O]₂•δF, are prepared by the chemical oxidation of graphite with fluorine gas in the presence of a solution containing the intercalate anion in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. Due to the chemical method employed (F₂/AHF as the oxidizing agent), fluoride co-intercalates are present in the galleries. The GIC's compositions are determined using a newly-developed digestion method with an ion-selective electrode and potentiometer. The composition parameters x and δ are obtained using both elemental and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Elemental analyses of B and F for a stage 1 GIC indicate x [approximately equal to] 41 and δ [approximately equal to] 4. Powder XRD data and the structural refinement of these GIC's show that the intercalate anions "stand up" in the galleries, with the longer anion dimension oriented perpendicular to the graphene sheets, leading to the relatively large gallery height of di [approximately equal to] 1. 42 nm. The same {{chemical synthesis}} strategy is also used for chemical preparations of <b>other</b> two <b>borate</b> chelate GIC's; bis(perfluoropinacolato) borate, CxB[OC(CF₃) ₂C(CF 3) ₂O]₂•δF, and bis(hexafluorohydroxyisobutyrato) borate, CxB[OC(CF₃) ₂C(O) O]₂•δF. Stage 1 GIC's of these anions are obtained with the gallery height, di, of 1. 43 - 1. 45 nm. The fluoride co-intercalate contents in these GIC samples are also determined. The composition parameters x and δ are obtained using elemental analyses for stage 1 CxB[OC(CF₃) ₂C(CF₃) ₂O] 2 •δF and for stage 1 CxB[OC(CF₃) ₂C(O) O]₂•δF. TGA cannot be used to confirm these compositions due to the incomplete degradation of intercalates. Most likely, anions and their degradation products are trapped in the bulk of the large flaky graphite particles. The detailed compositions of GIC's containing bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide, CxN(SO₂CF₃) ₂•δF, and perfluorooctanesulfonate, CxC₈F₁₇SO₃•δF and fluoride co-intercalates are determined for the first time. These GIC's are prepared in aqueous HF, using K₂MnF₆ as the oxidizing agent. The fluoride co-intercalate content is approximately equimolar to anion content in both GIC's. For CxN(SO₂CF₃) ₂•δF, the fluoride content increases steadily with reaction time while the anion content is relatively constant. In contrast, CxC₈F₁₇SO₃•δF shows little change in the fluoride content over time...|$|R
40|$|Global {{concerns}} for {{the environmental impact of}} pollutants from automotive sources require considerable reduction of phosphorus and sulphur-based antiwear additives in lubricating oils. One of such additives used as antiwear/extreme pressure (EP) additives in lubricating oils is Zinc Dialkyl DithioPhosphate (ZDDP). Potential replacements for ZDDP are antiwear/EP boron-based additives. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the tribological properties of model oils of different types of borate antiwear additives are considered for comparison to ZDDP on steel surfaces in tribo-contact. In this thesis, tribological experiments in pure sliding under boundary lubrication conditions were performed using pin-on-reciprocating plate test rig with variations of: additive concentrations in the oil, bulk-oil temperature, sliding process, dissolved, and free water contamination tests. The coefficient of friction response and antiwear performance of tribofilms were evaluated. Bulk oil analysis of the model oils were performed to evaluate their response to different thermal and oxidative conditions in comparison to ZDDP. In addition, chemical characterization of key crystalline boron compounds was done. The physical and chemical aspects of tribofilms generated during tribological tests were evaluated using surface analysis techniques such as: Optical white-light interferometry, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Nanoindentation. One of the key findings {{of this study is that}} tribofilms from hydrolytically unstable borates additives gave poor antiwear performance compared to ZDDP and <b>other</b> synthetic <b>borate</b> additives with better resistance to hydrolysis. This study has revealed that boric acid is not directly responsible for the poor antiwear performance as previously understood. Tribochemistry results by this thesis has shown that high atomic concentration of boron and particles such as; boron nitride and carbides acts as third body abrasives, are responsible for the poor antiwear performance. The established antiwear mechanism of borate tribofilms relies on the digestion of abrasive iron oxides by trigonal structural groups in boron oxide. Results at different test conditions from this research have indicated that boric acid, iron oxyhydroxide, and tetragonal structural units in boron oxide plays a major role in this process. The established friction reducing mechanism of boron-containing tribofilms relies on the weak van der Waal’s of boric acid and passivation of its high energy edge-sites by moisture. Another major finding of this PhD thesis is that decomposition and volatility of boric acid at certain temperatures affects the easy shear of the lamellar. An important finding from this study indicated that the abnormal behaviour of boron oxide effect in borosilicate glass manufacture could also affect the antiwear performance and durability of tribofilms containing nanoparticle alkali borate ester. In addition, the hardness of built-up tribofilms from oils containing hydrated potassium borate was found to be comparable to ZDDP, unlike organic borates which gave significantly higher hardness. Another major finding of this research is that in moisture-rich atmosphere, borate tribofilms formed on ferrous surfaces was more wear-resistant than ZDDP due to their different tribochemistry. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Borate {{deposits}} {{are often}} important constituents of economic non - marine evaporates. They produce under arid climatic conditions in playa lakes (Floyd et al., 1998). In the south – western {{parts of the}} Kerman province, such as the Khatoonabad area (east {{of the city of}} Shahr –e –Babak) and Robat – Marvast basin (west of Shahr – e – Babak), there are several borate deposits. They can be seen mainly in Sanandaj – Sirjan depressions and they occur as borate bearing nodules beneath a thin layer of soil. In general, boron considerably reduces the thermal expansion of glass, provides good resistance to vibration, high temperatures and thermal shock, and improves its toughness, strength, chemical resistance and durability. It also greatly reduces the viscosity of the glass melt. These features, and others, allow it to form superior glass for many industrial and specialty applications (Garrett, 1998). In the past, the ancient residents used them as co-melting matters. Ulexite which is frequently found in the Khatoonabad playa (at 30 km South East of Shahr Babak) have Jewel properties (Ghaedi et al., 2014). Materials and methods After reviewing and Library Studies, geological field studies on the borate deposits were carried out from Shahr – e – Babak Playa. In order to take better samples, several pits were excavated with a depth of 30 cm to 1 meter so that borate minerals became apparent. X-ray diffraction analysis (IMIDRO, Karaj), and ICP AES (ALS CHEMEX, Canada) methods were carried out on representative samples taken from the studied area. Discussion Field observations show that in the studied areas, borate bearing basins are fed by rivers which have originated from Sanandaj – Sirjan metamorphic rocks, Nain – Baft colored mélanges and igneous rocks of Urumieh – Dokhtar magmatic belt. Borate minerals also occur in fibrous aggregates and massive forms. Mineralogy XRD results show that the studied borate minerals mainly belong to the hydrated borates and contain ulexite, borax, gowerite, sassolite and inyoite. Geochemichal data indicate that the boron is the dominant constituent in the studied playa. Borate minerals are divided into two groups of hydrated and non-hydrated borate category (Palache et al., 1952.; Garrett, 1998). Both hydrated and non-hydrated borate minerals have been formed in the Shahr-e-Babak playa. Hydrated borate in the study areas: Hydrated borates are those borates in which water molecules are involved (Garrett, 1998). In the studied area, the hydrated borate minerals include: Borax, Ulexite, Inyoite, Gowerite. Non-hydrated borate in the study areas: In the Shahr-e-Babak playa, Sassolite non-hydrated borate minerals are abundant. According to the XRD analyses performed on samples from the study areas, the hydrated borate minerals are more important minerals. The main economic valuable minerals include: 1 - Ulexite (NaCaB 5 O 9. 8 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Triclinic. Point Group: 1 (Ghose et al., 1978). In the Shar – e - Babak playa, ulexite occurs as deposits with massive, cauliflower-like nodules and fibrous textures. 2 - Borax (Na 2 B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 • 8 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m. Crystals are commonly short to long prismatic [001] (Levy and Lisensky, 1978). In the studied borate samples, it can be found in association with the <b>other</b> <b>borate</b> minerals, and often occurs in the form of salt marsh. 3 - Gowerite (CaB 6 O 8 (OH) 4 • 3 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m (Erd et al., 1959). In the Khatoonabad samples, it was found as prismatic and spherical crystals along with ulexite. 4 - Inyoite (CaB 3 O 3 (OH) 5 • 4 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m (Christ, 1953). This mineral has been detected in the studied area by XRD. Sassolite (H 3 BO 3) : Crystal Data: Triclinic. Point Group: 1 and as scaly pseudohexagonal crystals (Allen and Kramer, 1957). This mineral is found frequently in the Marvast Playa. Geochemistry Geochemical data indicate that in the studied playa, boron is very abundant. Good correlation between the elements, such as B and Ca confirms the formation of Calcium bearing borate mineral in the studied areas. Origin Field observations show that in the studied areas, borate bearing basins are fed by rivers which have originated from the Sanandaj – Sirjan metamorphic rocks, Nain – Baft colored mélanges and igneous rocks of the Urumieh – Dokhtar magmatic belt. Result The XRD results show that the studied borate minerals mainly are hydrated ones and contain ulexite, borax, gowerite, sassolite and inyoite. Geochemichal data confirm the frequency of boron in the playa. Good correlation between the elements such as B and Ca verifies the formation of Calcium bearing borate mineral in the studied areas.
