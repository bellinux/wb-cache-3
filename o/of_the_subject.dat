40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} is more widespread {{than can be}} accounted for as being a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selection pressure caused by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> antibiotics alone. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a high mercury content in feces might select for mercury-resistant bacteria and thus for antimicrobial resistance linked to mercury resistance. Three subject groups with different exposures to dental amalgam fillings were compared. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> had taken antimicrobial agents during the three preceding months or longer. The group exposed to dental amalgam (n = 92) had 13 times more mercury in feces than the group {{that had never been}} exposed to amalgam (n = 43) and the group whose amalgam fillings had been removed (n = 56). No significant differences in either mercury resistance or antibiotic resistance in the fecal aerobic gram-negative flora of these subject groups were seen. The following antimicrobial resistance frequencies were detected with a replica plating method: > or = 1 % resistance was seen in 40 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> for ampicillin, 14 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> for cefuroxime, 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> for nalidixic acid, 14 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> for trimethoprim, 19 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> for sulfamethoxazole, and 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> for tetracycline. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> mercury in feces derived from amalgam was not selective for any resistance factors in aerobic gram-negative bacteria, but antimicrobial resistance was widespread even among healthy subjects with no recent exposure to antibiotics...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> with {{above-knee amputation}} is noticeably poorer than normal subjects. Various types of components {{have been designed}} to compensate their performance. Among various prosthetic components, the knee joint has great influence on the function. Two types of knee joints (3 R 15, 3 R 20) have been used broadly for above-knee prostheses. However, there is not enough research to highlight <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> these joints on <b>the</b> gait performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects.</b> Therefore, an aim of this research was to investigate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above-knee amputees while walking with 3 R 15 and 3 R 20 knee joints. Materials and Methods: 7 above-knee amputees were recruited in this research study. They were asked to walk with a comfortable speed to investigate <b>the</b> gait function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> with 3 cameras 3 D motion analysis system (Kinematrix system). The difference between <b>the</b> performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> with these joints was compared by use of paired t-test. Results: <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study showed that, <b>the</b> performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> with 3 R 20 were better than that with 3 R 15. <b>The</b> walking speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> with 3 R 20 was 66. 7 m/min compared to 30. 4 m/min (P-value = 0. 045). Moreover; <b>the</b> symmetry <b>of</b> walking with 3 R 20 was more than that with 3 R 15, based on the spatio- temporal gait parameters values (P-value < 0. 05). Conclusion: The difference between <b>the</b> performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> with 3 R 20 and 3 R 15 knee joints was related to the walking speed, which improved while walking with 3 R 20 joint...|$|R
