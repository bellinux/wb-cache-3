5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function. These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory underpinning, and the nature of the reprimand function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> and Futures Act, which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's financial sector. Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility}} <b>of</b> invoking <b>the</b> international responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council for its actions. <b>The</b> presumption <b>of</b> my thesis is that the UN with separate personality {{is responsible for the}} internationally wrongful acts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council, however, in certain circumstances <b>the</b> member states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council particularly, <b>the</b> decision makers could be held responsible. As many entities are dealing with <b>Security</b> Council, <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responsible entity becomes very difficult. This thesis has identified three important areas of tension in such responsibility. First, <b>the</b> legal status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council, relating to whether it is considered "above the law"; secondly, the more persistent tension concerning the relationship between member states of an International Organisation and the International Organisation itself in considering <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> member states. Last but not the least, the tension related to the scarcity, if not <b>the</b> lack, <b>of</b> recent practice concerning <b>the</b> international responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council as well as <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> rules that govern such a responsibility, will be discussed. This thesis is premised on the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council has recently extended powers and is getting involved in virtually every single matter at both international level and at the non-international level. This inevitably raises issues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council which have remained undeveloped, and which, accordingly, urges <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> establishing principles govern such international responsibility. Most notably, <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council has not been addressed in the Articles on Responsibility of States for international wrongful acts. Thus in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty and <b>the</b> rapid development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council, this thesis aims to fill the gaps as to <b>the</b> international responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council. ...|$|R

25|$|Using US definitions, {{a person}} who owns street name {{securities}} and {{who is not a}} member of an exchange, holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities.</b> They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities,</b> but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities.|$|E
