40|$|Disk Recording System (DRS) is a systems-integration {{computer}} {{program for a}} direct-to-disk (DTD) high-speed data acquisition system (HDAS) that records rocket-engine test data. The HDAS consists partly of equipment originally designed for recording the data on tapes. The tape recorders were replaced with hard-disk drives, necessitating the development of DRS to provide an operating environment that ties two computers, a set of five DTD recorders, and signal-processing circuits from the original tape-recording version of the HDAS into one working system. DRS includes three subsystems: (1) one that generates a graphical user interface (GUI), {{on one of the}} computers, that serves as a main control panel; (2) one that generates a GUI, on the other computer, that serves as a remote control panel; and (3) a data-processing subsystem that performs tasks on the DTD recorders according to instructions sent from the main control panel. The software affords capabilities for dynamic configuration to record single or multiple channels from a remote source, remote starting and stopping of the recorders, indexing to prevent <b>overwriting</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> and production of filtered frequency data from an original time-series data file...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Information {{security}} {{has become the}} area of concern {{as a result of}} widespread use of communication medium over the internet. This paper focuses on the data security approach when combined with encryption and steganographic techniques for secret communication by hiding it inside the multimedia files. The high results are achieved by providing the security to data before transmitting it over the internet. The files such as images, audio, video contains collection of bits that can be further translated into images, audio and video. The files composed of insignificant bits or unused areas which can be used for <b>overwriting</b> <b>of</b> other <b>data.</b> This paper explains the proposed algorithm using video steganography for enhancing data security...|$|R

50|$|Writing data to a tape, erasing, or {{formatting}} a tape {{is often}} a significantly time-consuming process and can take several hours on large tapes. With many data tape technologies {{it is not necessary}} to format the tape before over-writing new data to the tape. This is due to the inherently destructive nature <b>of</b> <b>overwriting</b> <b>data</b> on sequential media.|$|R
30|$|The kernel data {{structures}} {{are important for}} a full analysis in order to reconstruct the list of running processes and their memory mappings. In FROST, the full Linux kernel is booted and <b>overwrites</b> the <b>data</b> <b>of</b> the former running kernel. This causes a high amount of crucial information loss and results in non-reconstructible data.|$|R
5000|$|Reformatting is a {{high-level}} formatting performed on a functioning disk drive {{to free the}} medium of its contents. Reformatting is unique to each operating system because what actually is done to existing data varies by OS. The {{most important aspect of}} the process is that it frees disk space for use by other data. To actually [...] "erase" [...] everything requires <b>overwriting</b> each block <b>of</b> <b>data</b> on the medium; something that is not done by many high-level formatting utilities.|$|R
5000|$|Data erasure (sometimes {{referred}} to as data clearing or data wiping) is a software-based method <b>of</b> <b>overwriting</b> the <b>data</b> that aims to completely destroy all electronic data residing on a hard disk drive or other digital media by using zeros and ones to overwrite data onto all sectors of the device. By overwriting the data on the storage device, the data is rendered unrecoverable and achieves data sanitization.|$|R
50|$|IS5 sets a {{wide range}} of requirements—not just the {{technical}} detail <b>of</b> <b>overwriting</b> <b>data,</b> but also the policies and processes that organisations should have in place, to ensure that media are disposed of securely. IS5 also touches on risk management accreditation, because secure reuse and disposal of media is an important control for organisations handling high-impact data. It's not sufficient just to sanitise media; the sanitisation should also be auditable, and records must be kept.|$|R
50|$|Shoup {{was also}} {{able to use the}} SuperPaint framebuffer to create an early digital video-capture system. By {{synchronizing}} the output signal to the input signal, Shoup was able to <b>overwrite</b> each pixel <b>of</b> <b>data</b> as it shifted in. Shoup also experimented with modifying the output signal using color tables. These color tables allowed the SuperPaint system to produce a wide variety of colors outside the range of the limited 8-bit data it contained. This scheme would later become commonplace in computer framebuffers.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the fdisk {{programs}} for other operating systems, the fdisk {{programs for}} DOS and Windows 9x/Me not only alter {{data in the}} partition table, but will also <b>overwrite</b> many sectors <b>of</b> <b>data</b> in the partition itself. (However, to create an extended partition any partition editor must put extended boot records before each logical drive on the disk.) Users must be sure the correct disk/partition has been chosen before using a DOS/Windows fdisk for partitioning.

30|$|Care has to {{be taken}} {{considering}} the bootloader. Using the Samsung Galaxy S 4 device, the bootloader accepted a simply crafted boot image, but the requirements changed for the Nexus 5 bootloader. To figure out what the bootloader requires is not always obvious, but open source bootloader code helps to recognize such requirements [39]. Fortunately, most of the mobile device bootloaders work similarly. Nevertheless, it is possible that bootloaders are capable <b>of</b> <b>overwriting</b> volatile <b>data,</b> which would represent an inevitable problem.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Feenberg, an {{economist}} at the private National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that the chances <b>of</b> <b>overwritten</b> <b>data</b> being recovered from a modern hard drive amount to [...] "urban legend". He also points to the [...] "18½ minute gap" [...] Rose Mary Woods created on a tape of Richard Nixon discussing the Watergate break-in. Erased information in the gap has not been recovered, and Feenberg claims doing so would be an easy task compared to recovery of a modern high density digital signal.|$|R
5000|$|If {{data loss}} occurs, a {{successful}} recovery {{must ensure that}} the deleted data is not over-written. For this reason — one should avoid all write operations to the affected storage device. This includes not starting the system to which the affected device is connected. This is because many operating systems create temporary files in order to boot, and these may <b>overwrite</b> areas <b>of</b> lost <b>data</b> — rendering it unrecoverable. Viewing web pages has the same effect — potentially overwriting lost files with the temporary html and image files created when viewing a web page. File operations such as copying, editing, or deleting should also be avoided.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis explores the forensic opportunities afforded by flash memory. It {{starts with a}} discussion of flash storage starting with the physics of flash devices, the development of flash translation layers (which allow flash devices to be used with unmodified legacy operating systems), and flash file systems (which provide for better utilization of flash storage at a somewhat higher cost). Then this thesis provides a comprehension survey of the relevant academic literature and evaluates the work that others have done in the field <b>of</b> flash <b>data</b> recovery. It provides a theory of circumstances when residual data may exist on flash memory through the intentional deletion and <b>overwrite</b> <b>of</b> previously saved <b>data,</b> based upon a thorough patent review and freely available documentation. It clearly documents the steps of configuring a Linux kernel to use the YAFFS 2 (Yet Another Flash File System used in Android) and the JFFS 2 (the Journaling Flash File System used on the One Laptop per Child Program) flash file systems. It then conducts experiments to confirm or deny these theories, with a focus on the recovery <b>of</b> <b>data</b> and other evidence that overwritten and deleted data once existed. Finally, this thesis makes recommendations for further research. Outstanding ThesisUS Marine Corps (USMC) author...|$|R

5000|$|A {{third way}} is by declaring and {{defining}} a variable as being [...] "constant". A global or static variable can be declared (or a symbol defined in assembly) with a keyword qualifier such as , , or , meaning that its value {{will be set}} at compile time {{and should not be}} changeable at runtime. Compilers generally put static constants in the text section of an object file along with the code itself, as opposed to the data section where non-const initialized data is kept. Some compilers can produce a section specifically dedicated to constants. Memory protection can be applied to this area to prevent <b>overwriting</b> <b>of</b> such constants by errant pointers.|$|R
5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to tell an SSD which blocks <b>of</b> previously saved <b>data</b> are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an <b>overwrite</b> <b>of</b> a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file (not just remove parts of it), the file will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection.|$|R
