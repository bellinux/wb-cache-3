Examining <b>oral</b> <b>expressions</b> used by protagonists during their conversations I try to answer the following questions: Since when was telephone filmed as a medium of secondary orality?

This discussion is related to concerns about language acquisition and development within the various expressive possibilities. Researchers advise that starting intervention early through resources and procedures using augmentative and alternative communication does not impede speech acquisition and development. This paper aimed to describe oral expressive abilities during the implementation of augmentative and alternative communication with a student with cerebral palsy. An 11 -year-old student with cerebral palsy participated in the augmentative and alternative communication program for two years. Twelve sessions were selected {{during the first year}} of the intervention. The sessions were filmed and the augmentative and alternative communication resource procedures were transcribed.
