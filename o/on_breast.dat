In 2010, he {{took part in}} a charity event named Superstars Ka Jalwa, which helped generate money for the employees of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA). Also that year, he lent his support to the NGO Swayamsiddh, which helps children with special needs. The following year, he adopted three villages in support of NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support environmental consciousness and improve electricity supplies to rural areas. In 2012, Kapoor helped revive the Victory Arts Foundation NGO, founded by Shiamak Davar, which helps underprivileged children through dance therapy programs. Also that year, he appeared alongside other Bollywood celebrities in Because My World Is Not The Same, a short film by Zoya Akhtar, to generate awareness <b>on</b> <b>breast</b> cancer.

25|$|SERMs are a {{category}} of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are raloxifene and tamoxifen. Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity <b>on</b> <b>breast</b> and the endometrium. Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and {{reduces the risk of}} invasive breast cancer.|$|E

Consumption of 1,500–1,800 calories per day could coincide with a weight loss of 450grams (one pound) per week. While mothers in famine conditions can produce milk with highly nutritional content, a malnourished mother may produce milk with decreased levels of several micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. She may also have a lower supply than well-fed mothers.|$|E

25|$|Docetaxel {{exhibits}} cytotoxic activity <b>on</b> <b>breast,</b> colorectal, lung, ovarian, gastric, renal and {{prostate cancer}} cells. Docetaxel does not block disassembly of interphase microtubules {{and so does}} not prevent entry into the mitotic cycle, but does block mitosis by inhibiting mitotic spindle assembly. Resistance to paclitaxel or anthracycline doxorubicin does not necessarily indicate resistance to docetaxel. Microtubules formed {{in the presence of}} docetaxel are of a larger size than those formed in the presence of paclitaxel, which may result in improved cytotoxic efficacy. Abundant formation of microtubules and the prevention to replicate caused by the presence of docetaxel leads to apoptosis of tumour cells and is the basis of docetaxel use as a cancer treatment. It is unknown if pathophysiological interactions with docetaxel exist at this stage, however tumour type has been shown to have efficacy on cellular activity. Docetaxel activity is significantly greater in ovarian and breast tumours than for lung tumours.|$|E
25|$|A {{considerable}} part of {{the current}} knowledge <b>on</b> <b>breast</b> carcinomas is based on in vivo and in vitro studies performed with cell lines derived from breast cancers. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating stromal cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard media. The first breast cancer cell line described, BT-20, was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from pleural effusions. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells {{with little or no}} contamination by fibroblasts and other tumor stroma cells.|$|E

500|$|Around 1839, {{recognising}} Bird's {{abilities in}} chemistry, Astley Cooper {{asked him to}} contribute to his book <b>on</b> <b>breast</b> disease.

[...] Taking the view that existing texts were too mathematical for medical students, Bird avoided such material in favour of clear explanations.
