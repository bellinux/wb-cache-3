25|$|Travis Fickett on IGN gave a {{negative}} review of this episode, claiming 'it misses the mark {{in almost every}} way' and 'plays like the most outrageous of fan fictions.' He claimed the 2nd Doctor and Doctor-Donna 'stretch credulity so far that it becomes translucent', and that 'it's sort <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> to even bring Rose back when you've got the episode stuffed with almost every other character from the series'.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{impressions}} in 1959 and 1962. The story {{starts with a}} game <b>of</b> <b>Silly</b> Golf, {{which may have been}} informed by the crazy golf entertainment at Hampton-on-Sea near to Will Scott's home at Herne Bay. Happenings: Mr Wilks cries ‘Look!’; Mr. Nobody; Nothing but mysteries; The standstill race; The Society For Finding Things Out; Old sailor from over the water; Away they go; Smart work; The same-sounding words; The end if the trail.|$|E
25|$|The module {{subjects}} are distorted beyond recognition; for instance, germs {{are described as}} coming from Germany, and whisky {{is said to be}} made by combining water with nitrogen. The maths module features a distorted and inaccurate version of the ancient 'seven cats' puzzle by Ahmes. Additionally, {{subjects are}} mixed: for example, a chemistry experiment about eggs (In the episode Water) turns into a French language lesson. Each episode follows a general format, beginning with an introduction to the subject, followed by a series <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> experiments performed by the hapless (and normally mute) scientists, played by Popper, Serafinowicz and Edgar Wright, among others.|$|E

25|$|Following Billy Oskay's {{departure}} from Nightnoise in 1990, Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham, {{a former member}} <b>of</b> <b>Silly</b> Wizard who had played with Triona and Mícheál in the band Relativity, took over Oskay's duties. The band took on a much more Irish-centric sound, while still retaining their own signature style. The revamped Nightnoise went on to release the albums Shadow of Time (1994), A Different Shore (1995), and The White Horse Sessions (1997), an album featuring three live concert performances from Málaga, Spain in 1995, and in-studio live performances recorded in the White Horse Studies in Portland, with their Windham Hill colleagues as their audience.|$|E
25|$|Mickey's PhilharMagic (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland) is a 4D film which {{features}} Mickey {{in the familiar}} role of symphony conductor. At Main Street Cinema several of Mickey's short films are shown on a rotating basis; the sixth film is always Steamboat Willie. Mickey plays {{a central role in}} Fantasmic! (Disneyland Resort, Disney's Hollywood Studios) a live nighttime show which famously features Mickey in his role as the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Mickey was also a central character in the now-defunct Mickey Mouse Revue (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland) which was an indoor show featuring animatronic characters. Mickey's face currently graces the Mickey's Fun Wheel at Disney California Adventure Park, where a figure of him also stands on top <b>of</b> <b>Silly</b> Symphony Swings.|$|E
25|$|The sketch as {{originally}} {{depicted in the}} series begins with John Cleese playing a nameless civil servant who, after purchasing The Times from the newsagent in the previous sketch, walks {{through the streets of}} London (at the crossing of Thorpebank Road and Dunraven Road) in a very peculiar manner. He eventually arrives at his place of business: The Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Silly</b> Walks, on the northern end of Whitehall. In the hallway, he passes other employees all exhibiting their own silly walks before arriving at his office (the Hollywood Bowl performance omits this preamble). Once there, he finds Mr Putey (Michael Palin) waiting for him and apologizes for the delay, explaining that his walk has become particularly silly of late and it takes longer for him to reach his destination.|$|E

500|$|Scottish {{sculptor}} David Mach opined to Scotland on Sunday that [...] "They're {{just a bunch}} <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> buggers. It's good to see {{money going}} from a bunch <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> buggers to an artist {{who is going to}} make good use of it. What's that saying about a fool and his money...?" [...] John Bellany, on the other hand, said that [...] "The emotional, artistic side of [...] nature... admire the audacity and imagination, challenging art and the art manipulators. The rational side of me asks, is this the most expensive art publicity stunt this century, and for whom?" ...|$|E
500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated [...] "This film—this whole three-part, 15-year epic—about {{the adventures}} of a bunch <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy {{meditation}} on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love." ...|$|E
500|$|PETA's {{games have}} {{received}} mainly negative opinions from video game journalists.

500|$|For many of Azaria's {{character}}s, much {{of their}} humor is derived from a [...] "funny voice", such as The Birdcage and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. He stated that [...] "being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> or wacky persona that I try to fill in," [...] although he finds it [...] "much easier to be someone much closer to myself", as it requires [...] "less energy... than playing characters that are so out there and high strung".|$|E
500|$|Snow was {{tasked with}} {{composing}} the score for both The X-Files films. The films {{marked the first}} appearance of real instruments; previous music had been digitally crafted by Snow. Snow's soundtrack for the first film, , was released in 1998. For the second film, Snow recorded with the Hollywood Studio Symphony in May 2008 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City. UNKLE recorded {{a new version of}} the theme music for the end credits. Some of the unusual sounds were created by a variation <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> putty and dimes tucked into piano strings. Snow commented that the fast percussion featured in some tracks was inspired by the track [...] "Prospectors Quartet" [...] from the There Will Be Blood soundtrack. The soundtrack score, , was released in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict was {{positive}} on the season, but wrote [...] "I {{do not think}} that adults will be as entertained as in previous seasons. The comedy is more targeted at the kids than in the past." [...] In particular, Hrab cited the episode [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] as [...] "tiresome (for adults, anyway; kids will enjoy it)." [...] In conclusion, he said [...] "there's nothing new here and adults will be disappointed, but the latest installment of SpongeBob SquarePants delivers a lot <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> and good-natured fun for the kids and there's nothing wrong with that." [...] In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said [...] " [...] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement". He added [...] " [...] delivers more of what SpongeBob fans crave." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{found in}} many types of woodland, the pied currawong prefers to breed in mature forests. It builds a nest of thin sticks lined with grass and bark high in trees in spring; {{generally}} eucalypts are chosen and never isolated ones. It produces a clutch of three eggs; they are a light pinkish-brown colour (likened by one author to that <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> putty) with splotches of darker pink-brown and lavender. Tapered oval in shape, they measure about [...] The female broods alone. The incubation period is not well known, due {{to the difficulty of}} observing nests, but observations indicate around 30days from laying to hatching. Like all passerines, the chicks are born naked, and blind (altricial), and remain in the nest for an extended period (nidicolous) They quickly grow a layer of ashy-grey down. Both parents feed the young, although the male does not begin to feed them directly until a few days after birth.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{selected}} Michael Kaplan {{to design}} the costumes because {{he had not seen}} any of the films, meaning he would approach the costumes with a new angle. For the Starfleet uniforms, Kaplan followed the show's original color-coding, with dark gray (almost black) undershirts and pants and colored overshirts showing each crew member's position. Command officers wear gold shirts, science and medical officers wear blue, and operations (technicians, engineers, and security personnel) wear red. Kaplan wanted the shirts to be more sophisticated than the originals and selected to have the Starfleet symbol patterned on them. Kirk wears only the undershirt because he is a cadet. Kaplan modelled the uniforms on Kelvin on science fiction films of the 1940s and 1950s, to contrast with Enterprise-era uniforms based on the ones created in the 1960s. For Abrams, [...] "The costumes were a microcosm of the entire project, which was how to take something that's kind <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> and make it feel real. But how do you make legitimate those near-primary color costumes?" ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Beveridge from Mania.com {{praised the}} Cobra the Animation anime series and its visual design, {{comparing}} to The Psychogun ones, {{but said it}} is not for those who are unaware the original series. He said the anime has [...] "a healthy dose of action, the kind of sexuality that's a trademark of the series ... as well as a good bit <b>of</b> <b>silly</b> fun". In the second episode review, Beveridge said it [...] "seems to be following much the same kind of pace and structure" [...] as the OVAs. Its animation was compared with the Darkside Blues; [...] ANN's Erin Finnegan said it was a [...] "gritty" [...] animation, but that from episode five, the animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty. Beveridge said the anime's idea is simple, but added it is [...] "also not a show you see often since it doesn't center around teenagers, schools or the harem concept". He said it is not [...] "a great show", but that [...] "it gives us something different than the usual"the reason it is [...] "enjoyable".|$|E
