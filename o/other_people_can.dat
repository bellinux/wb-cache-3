500|$|Everyone has {{a natural}} set point {{for their ability}} to {{experience}} stress. For some people, this is a very high threshold, whereas <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> become overwhelmed very quickly. [...] Emotional pain activates the same regions of the brain as physical pain, so this can be a significantly intolerable state for some people. Some of this is environmental and some of this is due to physiological differences in responding. The autonomic nervous system is composed of two components: the sympathetic nervous system controls arousal and physical activation (e.g., the fight-or-flight response) and the parasympathetic nervous system controls physical processes that are automatic (e.g., saliva production). The sympathetic nervous system innervates (e.g., is physically connected to and regulates) many parts of the body involved in stress responses. Studies of adolescents have shown that adolescents who self-injure have greater physiological reactivity (e.g., skin conductance) to stress than adolescents who do not self-injure. This stress response persists over time, staying constant or even increasing in self-injuring adolescents, but gradually decreases in adolescents who do not self-injure.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the video, Roberts {{released}} still images to website 3am. These showed her in what was described as [...] "some sort of untidy, yet fashionable looking house", while one showed her with her legs above her head wearing [...] "Kandee's caramel kisses shoes" [...] and a third and final seeing her [...] "cosying up next to a handsome chap". [...] The same day, Roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website Digital Spy; in one image, she was smelling roses, while, in the second, she was [...] "playing with a pair of shoes". The video was released on 30 November 2011. After the official release, Nadia Mendoza of the Daily Mail stated the video was a departure from her previous two videos (for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] and [...] "Lucky Day"), saying that it [...] "looks and sounds a lot more grown up as she teases viewers by stripping to her bra and frolicking in the shower." [...] Mendoza found that Roberts was [...] "becoming quite the chameleon" [...] and had [...] "trampled all over her innocent charm to create a sex siren", referencing her transformation throughout her videos. Katherine St Asaph, of Pop Dust, found that the video's low budget had had a negative effect. She interpreted scenes with Roberts repeated changes clothing positively, noting [...] "t works because of the lyrics what, besides <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> <b>can</b> mess with your feelings more than trying on clothes?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season, however, {{was another}} championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per {{game in the}} regular season, and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth appearance in the event. In the playoffs, he led the Spurs to a 4–1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4–2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4–1 win against the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals, setting up {{a meeting with the}} Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4–0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth ever championship. Duncan proclaimed that that championship was [...] "the best" [...] of his four championships; however, he also acknowledged he played [...] "sub-par" [...] and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten. His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the [...] "Tim Duncan era", and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: [...] "Tim is the common denominator. He's [...] a different cast around him [...] '99, '03 and '05. He's welcomed them all. [...] But he is that easy to play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> fit in." [...] Then-NBA commissioner David Stern added: [...] " [...] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and Pete Sampras is one of the greats. OK, he wasn't Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. He just happens {{to be one of the}} greatest players of all time. You take great players as you find them." ...|$|E

A scene graphically depicts the rape of a woman; it is [...] "...filmed in real-time using a first-person subjective camera". Strange Days {{tells the story of}} Lenny Nero, who sells an illegal, futuristic technology that allows people to record their sensory experiences onto a minidisc, so that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> [...] "play back" [...] these sensory experiences and have them [...] "wired" [...] directly into their brain.|$|E

2500|$|The same year, Rollins {{recorded}} another landmark {{piece for}} saxophone, bass and drums trio: Freedom Suite.

[...] The title track is a nineteen-minute improvised bluesy suite; {{the other side of}} the album features hard bop workouts of popular show tunes. Oscar Pettiford and Max Roach provided bass and drums, respectively. The LP was available only briefly in its original form, before the record company repackaged it as Shadow Waltz, the title of another piece on the record.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} Stephen Huvane stated [...] "Personally, she’s {{not comfortable}} with being Janet in public [...] When she’s performing, that’s a different thing. We always planned that when the album came out, we would do the proper promotion." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam commented, [...] "Between albums she likes to go live life, recharge her batteries {{and be able to}} share her experiences. It not only raises her artistic level, she's able to talk about things she's going through -- and <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> relate. That's {{one of the things that}} allows her to connect truly with the fans." [...] Prior to promotion, Jackson performed a medley of [...] "All for You", [...] "Rhythm Nation", and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Surprise guest Justin Timberlake arrived to perform a duet version of [...] "Rock Your Body," [...] which ended in Jackson's breast being accidentally exposed. The incident resulted in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission enforcing massive fines on conglomerates involved with the broadcast, including CBS, Viacom, and MTV; who then blacklisted Jackson on many radio formats and music channels worldwide as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Kinney {{said that}} there are lyrics on the album that deal with {{original}} vocalist Layne Staley. He elaborated, [...] "There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. And there's a lot to address, with all of that stuff coming to the forefront. A lot has happened since 1995; a lot has happened in our lives and we've never talked about it or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but a lot has happened since the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> relate to.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking, {{primarily}} of tobacco, is {{an activity that}} is practiced by some 1.1billion people, and up to 1/3 of the adult population. The image of the smoker can vary considerably, but is very often associated, especially in fiction, with individuality and aloofness. Even so, smoking of both tobacco and cannabis can be a social activity {{which serves as a}} reinforcement of social structures and is part of the cultural rituals of many and diverse social and ethnic groups. Many smokers begin smoking in social settings and the offering and sharing of a cigarette is often an important rite of initiation or simply a good excuse to start a conversation with strangers in many settings; in bars, night clubs, at work or on the street. Lighting a cigarette is often seen as an effective way of avoiding the appearance of idleness or mere loitering. For adolescents, it can function as a first step out of childhood or as an act of rebellion against the adult world. Also, smoking {{can be seen as a}} sort of camaraderie. It has been shown that even opening a packet of cigarettes, or offering a cigarette to <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> <b>can</b> increase the level of dopamine (the [...] "happy feeling") in the brain, and it is doubtless that people who smoke form relationships with fellow smokers, in a way that only proliferates the habit, particularly in countries where smoking inside public places has been made illegal. Other than recreational drug use, it can be used to construct identity and a development of self-image by associating it with personal experiences connected with smoking. The rise of the modern anti-smoking movement in the late 19th century did more than create awareness of the hazards of smoking; it provoked reactions of smokers against what was, and often still is, perceived as an assault on personal freedom and has created an identity among smokers as rebels or outcasts, apart from non-smokers: ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{implications}} of Hegel’s Philosophy of World History with respect to colonialism. For Hegel, freedom can be recognized and practised only in classical, Christian and modern Europe; therefore, the world’s <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> acquire freedom only if Europeans impose their civilization upon them. Although this imposition denies freedom to colonized peoples, this denial is legitimate for Hegel {{because it is the}} sole condition on which these <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> gain freedom in the longer term. The article then considers whether Hegel’s basic account of freedom can be extricated from his Eurocentric and pro-colonialist interpretation of the course of history. The article argues that matters are more complicated because that interpretation has significant connections with Hegel’s conception of freedom as self-determination...|$|R
