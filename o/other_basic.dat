5|$|King {{organized}} and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> civil rights. Most of these rights were successfully enacted into {{the law of}} the United States {{with the passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{became a}} {{successful}} dry-goods merchant, traveling regularly to Alexandria, Damascus, and Beirut to buy flour and <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> foodstuffs {{to sell in}} Jerusalem. In 1927 one of Angel's customers, the Trachtenberg Bakery in Bayit VeGan, went bankrupt. Angel decided {{to pay off the}} bakery's debts and assume ownership, bringing in his father Avraham and three brothers as partners. A few years later, two of his brothers, Leon and Refael, left to open their own bakery in Haifa.|$|E

5|$|Indianapolis {{residents}} {{continued to}} assist those in need. Veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing, food, and <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> necessities. New orphanages and asylums joined the Indianapolis Orphans' Home, chartered in 1850, to aid women and children. The German Protestant Orphans' Association was organized in 1867. The Indianapolis Asylum for Friendless Colored Children, the state's only orphanage for African American children, {{was established in}} 1870. Other major charitable groups included the Indianapolis Benevolent Society and the Indianapolis Flower Mission, both organized in 1876.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the state's households, based on an average family size of four persons, contributed a family member to fight in the war, making the effects of the {{conflict}} widely felt throughout the state. More Hoosiers died in the Civil War than in any other conflict. Although twice as many Hoosiers served in World War II, almost twice as many died in the Civil War. After the war, veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing, food, and <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> needs. In addition, orphanages and asylums were established to assist women and children.|$|E
5|$|Noether's work Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern (Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields, 1927) {{characterized}} the rings {{in which the}} ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the Dedekind domains: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0 or 1-dimensional, and integrally closed in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> results on Noetherian and Artinian modules.|$|E
50|$|The «Wachtmeister» was {{responsible}} for providing support to the troop commander, which normally was Rittmeister (cavallry captain OF2-rank). To his duty responsibilities counted among <b>others</b> <b>basic</b> unit training, command task training, service support, and internal disposition.|$|R

5000|$|The {{result was}} that ABC 800's semi-compiling BASIC {{interpreter}} {{turned out to be}} faster than most <b>other</b> <b>BASICs</b> used in popular machines, especially when integer variables are used, the results for some well known computers were as follows (times in seconds): ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>basic</b> {{defensive}} measures {{included the}} removal of signposts, milestones (some had the carved details obscured with cement) and railway station signs making {{it more likely that}} an enemy would become confused. Petrol pumps were removed from service stations near the coast and there were careful preparations for the destruction of those that were left. Detailed plans were made for destroying anything that might prove useful to the invader such as port facilities, key roads and rolling stock. In certain areas non-essential citizens were evacuated. In the county of Kent, 40% of the population was relocated; in East Anglia, the figure was 50%.|$|E
5|$|Residents in some {{portions}} of the country became angry {{due to lack of}} assistance. In the town of Lazaro Cardenas in Tabasco, residents opened ditches to alleviate flooding on their streets, which flooding thousands of vehicles along a section of highway near the state's capital, Villahermosa. In the capital city, which remained submerged by floodwaters for a week, residents protested the sandbagging efforts after waters were redirected to some neighborhoods. Due to the protests, police officers beat and arrested 100people. The Federal Consumer Protection Agency issued warnings to businesses accused of price gouging for water and <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> products. Isolated villages experienced food shortages due to cut off roads.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{exploitation}} is {{an issue}} that is faced among many developing countries and is defined as “the sexual abuse of children and youth through the exchange of sex or sexual acts for drugs, food, shelter, protection, <b>other</b> <b>basics</b> of life, and/or money”.|$|R
40|$|An {{emerging}} trend of traditional reference service, the digital reference service is {{another type of}} library service. This handout describes the basic concepts, the elements of digital reference service, a brief history, definition, user's interaction, Aska, and some <b>other</b> <b>basics</b> issues on the administration of digital reference services...|$|R
50|$|Dog Star {{was written}} in the very limited TRS-80 Level I BASIC, so many of the {{techniques}} used in the game were easily adapted to <b>other</b> dialects of <b>BASIC.</b> The key concept is the way the game uses an array to describe the room layouts, with different numbers representing various objects or connections to other rooms. Since Model I BASIC had only a single array, storing all of the required data required some clever coding. In <b>other</b> <b>BASICs</b> with multiple arrays, this was much easier.|$|R
5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base than most <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> drugs {{with less than}} 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E
5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. <b>Other</b> <b>basic</b> immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E
50|$|In Chittagong, {{the second}} largest city of Bangladesh, German Doctors work since 2000 and {{performed}} over 270 medical deployments. The doors of the medical centre are always open for those in need. Regularly, the doctors also make home visits. Amongst <b>others,</b> <b>basic</b> healthcare, feeding programs for malnutritioned children and services for pregnant women and mothers are being offered.|$|R

5|$|The Battle for Middle-earth II {{introduces}} {{three new}} factions with unique units and heroes: Goblins, Dwarves, and Elves. Rohan and Gondor {{are combined into}} one faction called Men of the West. Along with Mordor and Isengard from , there are six playable factions. The troops of Gondor provide a solid offense and defense with standard infantry and archers, and the Rohirrim of Rohan act as elite cavalry. The Elven archers are effective at inflicting damage from a distance, and their support units, the Ents, can perform a combination of melee and siege attacks, they are often considered the strongest defensive faction due to their strong missile units and powerful 'silverthorn arrows'. Although slow and expensive, Dwarven infantry, pikemen, and axe-throwers are very powerful and well-armored allowing them to prevail in even the longest clashes with enemy troops. A collection of wild creatures and beasts of Middle-earth make up the Goblin faction, this includes goblins, trolls, spiders, and dragons, which are effective in large numbers. Their only advantage is that the goblin archer and soldier units are cheap to make at only 75 resources and build faster than <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> infantry. Isengard troops are highly trained Uruk-hai under Saruman's command. Berserkers are used by Isengard as one-man armies that move extremely fast and deal significant damage (particularly to enemy buildings and heroes). Additionally, Isengard is the only Evil faction that can build walls. Mordor forces are a mixture of Orcs, Men, Trolls, Mumakil, and Sauron's lieutenants. Mordor Orcs have tough armor, making them useful for absorbing enemy damage while stronger units attack enemies. Trolls contribute greatly to the Mordor offensives, having strong melee attacks {{and the ability to}} throw boulders or wield trees like swords.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E
25|$|Interval {{methods can}} {{also apply to}} {{functions}} that do not just use simple arithmetic, and we must also use <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> functions to redefine intervals, using already known monotonicity properties.|$|E
50|$|Running on {{original}} hardware, Atari BASIC is {{slower than}} <b>other</b> <b>BASICs</b> on contemporaneous {{equipment for the}} same home market, sometimes by a surprising amount, especially when one {{takes into account the}} fact that the Atari's CPU is clocked almost twice as fast as that of most other 6502-based computers of that era. Most of these problems stem from two issues.|$|R

50|$|A major {{topic in}} later years of the {{newsletter}} was the DBASIC interpreter. Hal produced a fast Basic interpreter for the Atari ST computer. It was written in hand-tuned assembly language, and ran very fast compared to <b>other</b> <b>basics.</b> But it was non-standard: it couldn't run Microsoft Basic programs, and it couldn't read or write MS-DOS format floppy disks. Unfortunately, as a result it was not very popular.|$|R
