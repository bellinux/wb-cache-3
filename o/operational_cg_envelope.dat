50|$|Here's {{an example}} of a Piper Mirage with too much weight {{in the back of the}} {{aircraft}} that results in the Takeoff CG within limits (the green reference point) but the Landing CG is aft of the <b>CG</b> <b>Envelope</b> limits (the blue reference point).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Operational</b> <b>CG</b> Range is {{utilized}} during {{take off}} and landing phases of flight and the Permissible CG Range is utilized during ground operations (i.e. while loading the aircraft with passengers, baggage and fuel).|$|R
50|$|For most helicopters, it {{is usually}} not {{necessary}} to determine the lateral CG for normal flight instruction and passenger flights. This is because helicopter cabins are relatively narrow and most optional equipment is located near the center line. However, some helicopter manuals specify the seat from which solo flight must be conducted. In addition, {{if there is an}} unusual situation, such as a heavy pilot and a full load of fuel {{on one side of the}} helicopter, which could affect the lateral CG, its position should be checked against the <b>CG</b> <b>envelope.</b> If carrying external loads in a position that requires large lateral cyclic control displacement to maintain level flight, fore and aft cyclic effectiveness could be dramatically limited.|$|R
50|$|First flown on 7 March 1953, {{flight tests}} {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The <b>operational</b> <b>CG</b> {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|R
40|$|With a {{constant}} {{increase in the}} demand for air transport and today’s high fuel price, the aerospace industry is actively searching for new operation methods and technologies to improve efficiency and to reduce the impact it has on the environment. Aircraft manufacturers are exploring {{many different ways of}} designing and building better airplanes. One of the considered methods is the use of unconventional aircraft configurations. The objective of this research is to study two configurations, the canard and three-surface, by applying them into a typical high-speed jet aircraft using the conceptual design tools for conventional aircraft available at Bombardier Aerospace (some of them have been modified and validated for the two configurations of interest). This included a weight estimation of the foreplane, an extensive validation of the aerodynamic tool, AVL, and a modification of a physics-based tail-sizing tool. The last tool was found necessary for an accurate foreplane/tailplane sizing, aircraft balancing, establishing the <b>CG</b> <b>envelope</b> and for the assessment of all stability and control requirements. Then, a canard aircraft comparable to the Bombardier research platform aircraft was designed. Final solutions were not obtained from a complete optimization because of some limitations in the design process. The preliminary results show an increase of fuel burn of 10...|$|R

Human listeners take advantage of differences between the sounds arriving at the two ears to determine the location of sound sources. For high-frequency components, interaural time differences (ITDs) carried in the envelopes together with inter aural level differences (ILDs) are primary cues for sound localization. These binaural cues are initially extracted in the superior olivary complex (SOC) of the brainstem, which consists of two major nuclei: the medial superior olive (MSO) and the lateral superior olive (LSO). Olivary neurons, like all neurons in the ascending auditory pathway, project to the inferior colliculus (IC), where binaural information is integrated and reorganized before reaching higher nuclei for further processing. In the present study, physiologically explicit models of high-frequency neurons in the MSO, the LSO, and the IC were developed to investigate underlying mechanisms behind several empirical observations of neural responses in these nuclei. These models were applied to reproduce neural responses to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) stimuli. Specifically, this thesis examined the following empirical observations: 1) many LSO neurons exhibit substantial decrease in discharge rate with increasing modulation frequency (fm) of monaural SAM tone stimuli; 2) some high-frequency IC neurons show dual types of envelope ITD sensitivity in response to binaural SAM tones, with peak-type responses for some modulation frequencies (fm) and trough-type responses for other frequencies; 3) some high-frequency IC neurons show dual types of envelope ITD sensitivity in response to binaural SAM noises. In this third case, the neurons exhibit one type of ITD sensitivity (either peak-type or trough-type) to cochlear-generated (<b>CG)</b> <b>envelopes</b> and the other type of ITD sensitivity to amplitude modulation (AM) envelopes. Results from the model developed in the present study show the following: 1) low threshold potassium channels, and in some cases background inhibition, may play the major role in the firing rate decrease with increasing modulation frequency in the LSO; 2) convergent inputs from the MSO and the LSO can account for the dual types of ITD sensitivity observed in some high-frequency IC neurons in response to binaural SAM tones, as long as the firing rates in the inputs from the MSO and the LSO are tuned to different fm; 3) the same neural connections (convergent inputs from MSO and LSO) can also explain the combination of peak-type and trough-type responses observed in the IC in response to SAM noises with correlated fine structures, in which case both <b>CG</b> and AM <b>envelope</b> ITDs are present. In addition to the simulation of empirical data, these models provide quantitative predictions which can be tested with future empirical experiments to further enrich our understanding of the neural basis of envelope processing...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} {{the variations in}} center of gravity (CG) during a simulation experience for student nurses using braces for imitating motor abilities in the elderly. Method: sixty-three students {{at the school of}} nursing were the subjects of this study. Each student performed 13 different daily activities wearing the simulation braces. The variations of CG for each subject were measured by stabilometer 4 times: before putting the braces on; before the performance of 13 daily activities wearing braces; after the performance of 13 daily activities wearing braces; immediately after the removal of the braces. Using a stabilometer, the following parameters were measured: (1) locus length of CG; sum of the length of <b>CG</b> mobility, (2) <b>envelope</b> area; internal area of CG motion, (3) mean of shift in the x-axis direction, (4) mean of shift in the y-axis direction. In addition, the subjects responded to questionnaires after the experiences. Results: (1) The motion which the students rated most difficult was "going down stairs. " (2) Locus length of CG with the braces was shorter than that without the braces. The envelope area with the braces was larger than that without the braces. Mean of shift in the y-axis direction with the braces was greater than that without the braces. Mean of shift in the x-axis direction with the braces was smaller than that without the braces. Conclusion: These findings show that the students experienced "lateral thrust" which is a symptom of knee osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|Theory is {{developed}} and utilized for {{the calculation of}} the separate transport of kinetic, gravity potential, and surface tension energies within sinusoidal surface waves in water of arbitrary depth. In Section 1 it is shown {{that each of these}} three types of energy constituting the wave travel at different speeds, and that the group velocity, cg, is the energy weighted average of these speeds, depth and time averaged {{in the case of the}} kinetic energy. It is shown that the time averaged kinetic energy travels at every depth horizontally either with (deep water), or faster than the wave itself, and that the propagation of a sinusoidal wave is made possible by the vertical transport of kinetic energy to the free surface, where it provides the oscillating balance in surface energy just necessary to allow the propagation of the wave. The propagation speed along the surface of the gravity potential energy is null, while the surface tension energy travels forward along the wave surface everywhere at twice the wave velocity, c. The flux of kinetic energy when viewed traveling with a wave provides a pattern of steady flux lines which originate and end on the free surface after making vertical excursions into the wave, even to the bottom, and these are calculated. The pictures produced in this way provide immediate insight into the basic mechanisms of wave motion. In Section 2 the modulated gravity wave is considered in deep water and the balance of terms involved in the propagation of the energy in the wave group is determined; it is shown again that vertical transport of kinetic energy to the surface is fundamental in allowing the propagation of the modulation, and in determining the well known speed of the modulation <b>envelope,</b> <b>cg.</b> Dedicated to Professor J.

In August of 1992, Andrew joined a long list of tropical storms that have caused considerable damage and loss of life as they made landfall near a populated area. However, Andrew was unique in the sense that no previous landfalling tropical storm in the United States has provided such an excellent opportunity to study the cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning associated with this type of storm. While numerous thunderstorm systems, particularly the severe storms of the Great Plains, have been studied for lightning characteristics, the ability to conduct similar studies on hurricanes has been limited due to the small number which have occurred since the relatively new National Lightning Detection Network has been <b>operational.</b> 17, 036 <b>CG</b> strikes over a 77 hour period were attributed to either the eyewall region or the primary spiral rainbands of Andrew. The overall distribution by polarity of the lightning was found to be 2. 1 % positive and 97. 9 % negative. As the storm was dissipating over land in Mississippi all lightning observed near the pressure center was positive. Throughout the lifetime of the storm, the negative first stroke peak current decreased while the positive first stroke peak current increased. The mean multiplicity of the negative flashes was 2. 6, while the positive lightning had a mean value of 1. 2. High-multiplicity flashes (negative CG flashes with 10 strokes or greater) tended to occur in four distinct groups and in time intervals of 19 to 23 hours apart in an area corresponding to the right-forward quadrant to right flank of the storm structure. Comparison of radar data to the lightning data shows that the deep convective regions of the outer rainbands were the areas with the most lightning. A lack of significant lightning observed in the eyewall region is consistent with previous research suggesting microphysical processes {{in this part of the}} storm are not favorable for charge separation...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: A instabilidade funcional (IF) é a complicação mais comum após o entorse de tornozelo; acomete até 52 % dos atletas com história de entorse. O entorse de tornozelo é uma das lesões esportivas mais comuns, {{inclusive}} no voleibol, em que 90 % dos entorses de tornozelo ocorrem durante a aterrissagem, após o movimento de bloqueio. A IF é definida por queixas de falseios e entorses recorrentes, sem que haja evidências clínicas de lesão ligamentar, sendo extremamente prejudicial para a prática do voleibol, pois interfere na realização dos fundamentos envolvidos na modalidade. OBJETIVOS: Comparar os padrões temporais e de magnitude da atividade eletromiográfica dos músculos tibial anterior (TA), fibular longo (FL) e gastrocnêmio lateral (GL) durante a aterrissagem do salto vertical após a execução da habilidade do bloqueio do voleibol entre jogadores com e sem IF de tornozelo. MÉTODOS: Foi adquirida a atividade EMG do tibial anterior, do fibular longo e do gastrocnêmio lateral em 21 atletas com IF (GI) e em 19 atletas controle (GC) - idade média de 20 ± 4 anos. Os envoltórios lineares foram calculados para cada um dos grupos no período de tempo entre 200 ms antes e 200 ms após o instante do impacto, determinados por meio da componente vertical da FRS. A magnitude e o instante do pico máximo de cada um dos músculos também foram determinados matematicamente. Os grupos foram comparados por meio do teste t (&# 945; = 0, 05). RESULTADOS: O grupo com instabilidade apresentou instante de pico do TA mais tardio ± (GC = - 107, 4 ± 29, 6 ms; GI = - 134, 0 ± 26, 0 ms) e FL (GC = - 11, 0 ± 55, 9 ms; GI = - 41, 7 ± 49, 8 ms) e menor pico de TA (GC = 68, 5 ± 17, 2 %; GI = 81, 2 ± 28, 8 %) e FL (GC = 72, 9 ± 27, 3 %; GI = 59, 1 ± 16, 0 %), CONCLUSÕES: Os resultados mostram um padrão de alteração mais tardio e com menor magnitude nos músculos de atletas com IF que podem predispô-los à condição de instabilidade, mesmo na ausência de lesão anatômica. INTRODUCTION: The ankle sprain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common injuries in athletes, including volleyball. 90 % of ankle injuries in volleyball occur during landing after a blocking maneuver. The most common complication following ankle sprains is functional instability (FI), a condition that affect about 52 % of the patients that suffered an ankle sprains. Functional ankle instability (FI) has been defined as a tendency for the foot to give way after an ankle sprain with no evidence of ligament injury. Hence, FI is an impairing condition for volleyball performance since it interferes in its basic skills. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to compare the EMG activation patterns of tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) in volleyball players with and without FI during landing after the blocking movement. METHODS: EMG activity was acquired for 21 subjects (mean age 20 ± 4 yrs) with FI (IG) and 19 control ones (<b>CG).</b> Linear <b>envelopes</b> were calculated for both groups for the time period between 200 ms before and 200 ms after the instant of impact, and time and magnitude of peak occurrence were extracted from the envelopes. Groups were compared using T test (&# 945; < 0. 05). RESULTS: IG subjects showed a later peak occurrence for TA (CG = - 107. 4 ± 29. 6 ms; IG = - 134. 0 ± 26. 0 ms) and PL (CG = - 11. 0 ± 55. 9 ms; IG = - 41. 7 ± 49. 8 ms) and a lower peak magnitude for TA (CG = 68. 5 ± 17. 2 %; FIG = 81. 2 ± 28. 8 %) and PL (CG = 72. 9 ± 27. 3 %; FIG = 59. 1 ± 16. 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals with FI present a later and lower activation pattern of muscular activity and different activation magnitudes that predispose them to ankle sprains, even in the absence of an anatomical damage...|$|R
