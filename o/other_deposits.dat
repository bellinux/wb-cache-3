5|$|As {{with most}} other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.Helens {{is a large}} eruptive cone {{consisting}} of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and <b>other</b> <b>deposits.</b> The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} certain mallards appear {{to be closer to}} their Indo-Pacific relatives while others are related to their American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and <b>other</b> <b>deposits</b> of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E

25|$|The first {{recognition}} of widespread sedimentary rock on Mars {{came from the}} Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally layered, light-toned rocks. Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found that some are rich in sulfate minerals, and that other layered rocks around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates. Both class of minerals are signatures of sedimentary rocks. CRISM has used its improved spatial resolution to look for <b>other</b> <b>deposits</b> of sedimentary rock on Mars' surface, and for layers of sedimentary rock buried between layers of volcanic rock in Mars' crust.|$|E
25|$|Partridge Island {{stands at}} the edge of the ancient rift valley known as the Fundy Basin that was created when the supercontinent Pangaea began to break up about 225 million years ago. As the {{continental}} plates moved apart, they ruptured, and blocks subsided along fault lines forming the rift valleys that became sedimentary basins. The Fundy Basin is the largest of these basins in Eastern North America. During the Triassic geological period between 208 and 220 million years ago, rivers swollen by intense rains carried coarse sediments (now sedimentary rocks) from nearby highlands into the Fundy Basin. <b>Other</b> <b>deposits</b> came from wind-blown sand dunes. Later, large lakes formed on the central part of the basin depositing finer sediments up to 1,000 metres thick and, as they dried up periodically, they left behind salt and gypsum deposits.|$|E

500|$|Subfossil {{sites in}} Madagascar have yielded {{the remains of}} more than just extinct lemurs. [...] Extant lemur remains have also been found, and {{radiocarbon}} dating has demonstrated that both types of lemur lived at the same time. [...] Furthermore, in some cases living species are locally extinct for {{the area in which}} their subfossil remains were found. [...] Because subfossil sites are found across most of the island, with the most notable exception being the eastern rainforest, both paleocommunity composition and paleodistributions can be determined. Geographic ranges have contracted for numerous species, including the indri, greater bamboo lemur, and ruffed lemurs. [...] For instance, subfossil remains of the indri have been found in marsh deposits near Ampasambazimba in the Central Highlands and in <b>other</b> <b>deposits</b> in both central and northern Madagascar, demonstrating a much larger range than the small region on the east coast that it currently occupies. Even the greater bamboo lemur, a critically endangered species restricted to {{a small portion of the}} south-central eastern rainforest, has undergone significant range contraction since the mid-Holocene, with subfossil remains from Ankarana Massif in the far north of Madagascar dating to 2565 BCE ± 70 years. [...] Combined with finds from other subfossil sites, data suggests that it used to range across the northern, northwestern, central, and eastern parts of the island. It is unclear whether these locations were wetter in the past or whether distinct subpopulations or subspecies occupied the drier forests, much like modern diversity of sifakas.|$|E
