5|$|In Tompkins County, {{the road}} was reconstructed {{as part of a}} project {{contracted}} out on August24, 1916. Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> was completed in the early-to-mid-1920s, and the improved road was added to the state highway system as SH1433. The Groton–Cortland state highway did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned a designation for the first time. SH446, SH996, and SH1433 were collectively designated as NY222, which continued east into downtown Cortland by way of locally maintained streets. The alignment of NY222 has not been changed since that time.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the route}} {{began in the}} 1950s, but the first segment between Wattle Grove and Cloverdale was not opened until 1980. Over the next five years, the highway was {{extended}} north to Great Eastern Highway and south to Albany Highway, and a discontinuous section was constructed north of the Swan River. In 1988 the Redcliffe Bridge linked these sections, and three years later, Reid Highway became the northern terminus. The next major works <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> between 2003 and 2005, extended the highway south to Thomas Road.|$|E

This shortcut allows that traffic to skip an often busy intersection and head out of the village on North Chestnut Street. Once past the village, the Ulster Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) building comes up on the west and the town hall along the east. NY32 then becomes mostly rural again.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} study {{resulted}} in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E

Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{estimate}} emissions of passenger cars traveled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> in Nakhon Ratchasima Municipality (NRM) based on recently developed driving cycles. A mobile phone application (SafeMate) {{was used to}} record speed-time of passenger car <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> both weekday and weekend. The {{results showed that the}} driving cycles of <b>the</b> passenger cars <b>on</b> <b>highway</b> 224 and 304 were quite different. More traffic congestion <b>on</b> <b>highway</b> 224 impacted <b>the</b> average speeds, ranging from 10 to 34 km/h with longer idling time. <b>The</b> average speeds <b>on</b> <b>highway</b> 304 ranged from 49 to 69 km/h with more cruise time. The combined driving cycles <b>on</b> both <b>highways</b> showed <b>the</b> average speeds of 20 - 40 km/h depending upon the time of days. <b>The</b> traffic density <b>on</b> weekday was higher than the weekend. Peak-hour weekday showed lower traffic flow than off-peak hour which was the opposite of <b>the</b> weekend. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> derived driving cycles, the passenger car traveled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> in NRM emitted CO, NOx and HC approximately 90. 7 - 129. 8, 25. 5 - 34. 5 and 6. 9 - 11. 7 tons/year, respectively.

5|$|But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the {{district}} highway engineer, stated {{that due to}} lower traffic on US 80, {{the completion of the}} freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971.

That year, work continued on the freeway, and in August, only one traffic signal was left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> west of El Cajon, at Ward Road. In August, Dekema announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month; once that was completed, the entire freeway west of El Cajon would be complete. Eastbound lanes between US 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23.|$|E
