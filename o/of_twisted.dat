40|$|OBJECTIVES: TWIST 1 is {{a member}} of the class B of basic helix-loop-helix {{transcription}} factors that regulates cell lineage determination and differentiation and has been implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Here, we aimed to investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 for the activation of resident fibroblasts in systemic sclerosis (SSc). METHODS: The expression <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 in fibroblasts was modulated by forced overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown. Interaction <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1, E 12 and inhibitor Of differentiation (Id) was analysed by co-immunoprecipitation. The role <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 in vivo was evaluated using inducible, conditional knockout mice with either ubiquitous or fibroblast-specific depletion <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1. Mice were either challenged with bleomycin or overexpressing a constitutively active transforming growth factor (TGF) β receptor I. RESULT: The expression <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 was increased in fibroblasts in fibrotic human and murine skin in a TGFβ/SMAD 3 -dependent manner. TWIST 1 in turn enhanced TGFβ-induced fibroblast activation in a p 38 -dependent manner. The stimulatory effects <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 on resident fibroblasts were mediated by TWIST 1 homodimers. TGFβ promotes the formation <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 homodimers by upregulation <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 and by induction of inhibitor of DNA-binding proteins, which have high affinity for E 12 /E 47 and compete against TWIST 1 for E 12 /E 47 binding. Mice with selective depletion <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 in fibroblasts are protected from experimental skin fibrosis in different murine models to a comparable degree as mice with ubiquitous depletion <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify TWIST 1 as a central pro-fibrotic factor in SSc, which facilitates fibroblast activation by amplifying TGFβ signalling. Targeting <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 may thus be a novel approach to normalise aberrant TGFβ signalling in SSc...|$|R

5|$|On July 22 the North Koreans attacked. The ROK troops {{resisted}} briefly, but {{withdrew from}} {{their positions on}} either side of F Company without communicating their intentions. The withdrawal had {{been a part of the}} plan for reorganizing the line to incorporate the US troops, but F Company expected them to send a message before doing so, and did not adjust their defenses to compensate. North Korean troops quickly flanked F Company and began attacking it from the rear. This precipitated an unorganized withdrawal. The swollen stream prevented F Company from crossing to the south side and the 2nd Battalion positions. Walking wounded crowded along the stream where an effort to get them across failed. Two officers and two noncommissioned officers tied a pair <b>of</b> <b>twisted</b> telephone wires about their bodies and tried to swim to the other bank and fasten a line, but each in turn was swept downstream where they floundered ashore on the same bank where they had started. Some men drowned trying to cross the swollen river. The covering fire of a platoon of tanks on the south side held off the North Koreans and allowed most of the survivors to eventually escape. F Company lost 37 men: 6 killed, 10 wounded, and 21 missing.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape <b>of</b> <b>twisted</b> trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
40|$|Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (BMSCs) are {{clinically}} promising to repair damaged articular cartilage. This study investigated TWIST 1, an important transcriptional regulator in mesenchymal lineages, in BMSC chondrogenesis. We hypothesized that downregulation <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 expression {{is required for}} in vitro chondrogenic differentiation. Indeed, significant downregulation <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 was observed in murine skeletal progenitor cells during limb development (N = 3 embryos), and during chondrogenic differentiation of culture-expanded human articular chondrocytes (N = 3 donors) and isolated adult human BMSCs (N = 7 donors), consistent with an inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 expression on chondrogenic differentiation. Silencing <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 expression in BMSCs by siRNA, however, did not improve chondrogenic differentiation potential. Interestingly, additional investigation revealed that downregulation <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 in chondrogenic BMSCs is preceded by an initial upregulation. Similar upregulation is observed in non-chondrogenic BMSCs (N = 5 donors); however, non-chondrogenic cells fail to downregulate TWIST 1 expression thereafter, preventing their chondrogenic differentiation. This study describes {{for the first time}} endogenous TWIST 1 expression during in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of human BMSCs, demonstrating dynamic regulation <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 expression whereby upregulation and then downregulation <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 expression are required for chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs.

40|$|Metastasis is {{the most}} common cause of disease failure and {{mortality}} for non-small cell lung cancer after surgical resection. Twist has been recently identified as a putative oncogene and a key regulator of carcinoma metastasis. N-cadherin is associated with a more aggressive behavior of cell lines and tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> and N-cadherin expression in NSCLC, and the effects <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 knockdown on lung cancer cells. We examined the expressions <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> and N-cadherin by immunohistochemistry in 120 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (including 68 cases with follow-up records). We also analyzed Twist 1 and N-cadherin mRNA expression in 30 non-small cell lung cancer tissues using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The functional roles <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 in lung cancer cell lines were evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the protein followed by analyses of cell apoptosis and invasion. In lung cancer tissues, the overexpression rate <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> was 38. 3 % in lung cancer tissues. Overexpression of N-cadherin was shown in 40. 83 % of primary tumors. Moreover, Twist 1 mRNA expression levels correlated with N-cadherin mRNA levels. Furthermore, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 or N-cadherin in primary non-small cell lung cancers was associated with a shorter overall survival (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 01, respectively). Depleting Twist expression inhibited cell invasion and increased apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. The overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> and N-cadherin could be considered as useful biomarkers for predicting the prognosis <b>of</b> NSCLC. <b>Twist</b> 1 could inhibit apoptosis and promote the invasion of lung cancer cells, and depletion <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 in lung cancer cells led to inhibition of N-cadherin expression...|$|R
50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>twists</b> per inch often. Because the amount <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> defines {{a lot about}} a yarn, the number <b>of</b> <b>twists</b> per inch is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number <b>of</b> <b>twists</b> per inch is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps per inch (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number <b>of</b> <b>twists</b> per inch while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists per inch tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists per inch, such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|R
25|$|Deformation: twisted pair's {{susceptibility}} to electromagnetic interference greatly {{depends on the}} pair twisting schemes (sometimes patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the expression level <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (BNHL) and its association with the clinicopathological characteristics of BNHL. Expression levels <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 were analyzed in patients with BNHL (n= 45) and lymphadenosis (n= 21) using immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression levels <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 in the peripheral blood were detected by fluorescent quantita-tive polymerase chain reaction. The positive rate <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 expression in the BNHL tissue was 82. 2 %, which was signifi-cantly higher compared with the lymphadenosis tissue (5 %; P< 0. 05). In addition, the protein expression level <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 in the BNHL tissue was higher compared with the lymphadenosis tissue. TWIST 1 expression was also higher in stage III/IV BNHL tissues than in stage I/II tissues (P< 0. 05). The tissues were staged following the Ann Arbor system. Furthermore, the mRNA expression level <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 in the peripheral blood of the BNHL tissue (3. 03 ± 0. 03) was higher compared with the lymphadenosis tissue, and the mRNA expression level <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 was higher in stage III/IV (4. 41 ± 0. 12) tissues than in stage I/II BNHL (2. 03 ± 0. 08) tissues. In conclusion, TWIST 1 expression was higher in the tissue and peripheral blood of patients with BNHL when compared with those with lymph-adenosis.

40|$|Twist 1 is {{a crucial}} {{transcription}} factor that regulates epithelial mesenchymal transition and involves in metastasis. Recent evidence suggests that Twist 1 plays important role in hypoxia-induced radioresistance, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we investigated the change <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 expression in human cervical squamous cancer cell line SiHa after hypoxia treatment. We also explored the role <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 in radioresistance by manipulating the expression level <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1. We observed that hypoxia treatment elevated the expression <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 in SiHa cells. Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 with siRNA increased the radiosensitivity of SiHa cells under hypoxia condition, accompanied by reduced levels of nuclear Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Conversely, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Twist</b> 1 led to increased radioresistance of SiHa cells, which in turn increased nuclear EGFR localisation and expression levels of nuclear DNA-PK. Moreover, concomitant high expression of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 ? (HIF- 1 ?) and Twist 1 in primary tumors of cervical cancer patients correlated with the worse prognosis after irradiation treatment. Taken together, these data provide new insights into molecular mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced radio resistance in cervical cancer cells, and suggest that Twist 1 is a promising molecular target to improve the efficacy of cancer radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Context: Anaplastic thyroid {{carcinoma}} (ATC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} aggressive human tumors; it is characterized by chemoresistance, local invasion, and distant metastases. ATC is invariably fatal. Objective: The aim was to study the role <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, in ATC. Design: Expression <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 was studied by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR in normal thyroids and well-differentiated, poorly differentiated, and ATC. The function <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 was studied by RNA interference in ATC cells and by ectopic expression in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma cells. Results: ATCs up-regulate TWIST 1 with respect to normal thyroids as well as to poorly and well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas. Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>TWIST</b> 1 by RNA interference in ATC cells reduced cell migration and invasion and increased sensitivity to apoptosis.
