She again returned for a single episode on 25 September 2014, and made a further appearance for EastEnders 30th anniversary on 17 February 2015. In February 2015, Windsor, alongside Pam St. Clement (Pat Butcher), took part in EastEnders: Back to <b>Ours</b> <b>to</b> celebrate 30 years of EastEnders. Windsor and Clement looked back on some of their characters' most dramatic moments.|$|E

Other {{large facilities}} were observed {{to be under}} construction elsewhere in the Pas-de-Calais. The purpose of the construction works was very unclear; Lord Cherwell, Winston Churchill's scientific adviser, {{admitted that he had}} little idea what [...] "these very large structures similar to gun emplacements" [...] were but he believed that [...] "if it is worth the enemy's while to go to all the trouble of building them it would seem worth <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> destroy them".|$|E

During the 2013 Soundwave Festival, Paramore held a listening party in Sydney, New South Wales on February 26, 2013, followed by Melbourne, Victoria two days later, run by Australian Music Channel, Channel V. Williams revealed a section of the lyrics for the song 'Part II' which the winners were able to hear at the listening parties on a LiveJournal post. Williams told fans that [...] "'Let The Flames Begin' has been a favorite of <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> play live, as well as being a favorite of most people who come out to our shows.... We wanted it to have a sequel. 'Part ll' it is!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Columnist Kyle Smith {{criticized the}} {{reaction}} to Griffin's actions, writing in National Review, [...] "I don’t want <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> be {{a country where the}} freedom to display bad taste, especially bad taste that involves satirizing powerful figures, gradually gets snuffed out by the timidity of the advertising business…I want America to be a place where rodeo clowns can make fun of President Obama and unfunny comediennes can pose for pictures with the fake bloody head of President Trump".|$|E
2500|$|People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA stylized PeTA) is an American {{animal rights}} {{organization}} based in Norfolk, Virginia, and led by Ingrid Newkirk, its international president. A nonprofit corporation with nearly 400 employees, it claims that it has 6.5 million members and supporters, in addition to claiming {{that it is the}} largest animal rights group in the world. Its slogan is [...] "Animals are not <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of an NDP logo for 1998, every NDP logo henceforth would be designed to suit the themes, in particular the foundation theme, of the parade. In addition, a tagline, which was previously known as a slogan, would {{be added to the}} logo design. For example, the tagline for NDP 2005 was [...] "The Future is <b>Ours</b> <b>to</b> Make". These taglines are usually taken from previous National Day Rallies for the purpose of rallying the nation together on 9 August to meet the challenges ahead. The tagline [...] "Together We Make The Difference" [...] was introduced in 1999 due to the launch of the Singapore 21 project, and was replaced by [...] "Together, A New Singapore" [...] in 2002 when then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong proposed the [...] "Remaking Singapore" [...] initiative in the National Day Rally 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Major Higginson claimed {{responsibility}} for the BSO's initial failure to play the anthem, with little effect on outraged press coverage. He visited the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Department of Justice where he received assurances that the government had no issue with any member of the orchestra. He tried to present the issue as one of artistic independence, saying he would rather disband the orchestra than allow anyone to dictate its programming. Muck took a similar tack with this statement: [...] "Art is a thing by itself, and not related to any particular nation or group. Therefore, it would be a gross mistake, a violation of artistic taste and principles for such an organization as <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> play patriotic airs. Does the public think that the Symphony Orchestra is a military band or a ballroom orchestra?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Union general William Tecumseh Sherman {{called him}} [...] "that devil Forrest" [...] during wartime {{communications}} with Ulysses S. Grant and considered him [...] "the most remarkable man our civil war produced on either side". He {{is considered one}} of the Civil War's most brilliant tacticians. Without military education or training, he became the scourge of Grant, Sherman, and almost every other Union general who fought in Tennessee, Alabama, or Kentucky. Forrest fought by simple rules: he maintained that [...] "war means fighting and fighting means killing" [...] and that the way to win was [...] "to get there first with the most men". His cavalry, which Sherman reported in disgust [...] "could travel one hundred miles in less time it takes <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> travel ten", secured more Union guns, horses, and supplies than any other single Confederate unit. He played pivotal roles at Fort Donelson, Shiloh, the capture of Murfreesboro, the Franklin-Nashville campaign, Brice's Cross Roads, and in pursuit and capture of Colonel Streight's Raiders.|$|E
2500|$|Super Mario Bros., the {{successor}} to the 1983 arcade title Mario Bros., was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, both of whom belonged to Nintendo's former Entertainment Analysis and Development division at the time. Though not originally using any particular character, the very deliberate creative process of what would become their next game was motivated by their technical knowledge from previous games like Excitebike and Kung Fu, {{by a desire to}} give the ROM cartridge format [...] "a final exclamation point" [...] in light of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System which was expected to become the dominant new game delivery medium, and by continuing their legacy of [...] "athletic games" [...] with a character running and jumping with many obstacles. Miyamoto explained, [...] "We felt strongly about how we were the first to come up with that genre, and it was a goal of <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> keep pushing it." [...] Development was aimed at simplicity, {{in order to have a}} new game available for the end-of-year shopping season.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 November, the {{government}} spokesman Khalid Naciri, after a Governing Council, {{stated that he}} hoped that the Spanish [...] "place their hand into <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> overcome the crisis and privileging our bilateral relationship. The Spanish-Moroccan relations have undergone a crisis." [...] Do not set a date {{for the return of}} the ambassador to Madrid, insist on the need for a dialogue between the parties {{about the future of the}} Spanish autonomous cities and it is expected for the future that [...] "our Spanish friends will consider our feelings, our sensitivity and our claims; the purpose is not to create difficulties but to preserve our relations." [...] However, on 16 November, the Government of Morocco suspended two high-level visits of Spanish authorities:that of the Minister of Public Works, Magdalena Álvarez, who had planned to deal with the Moroccan Minister of Equipment and Transport Karim Ghellab about the Gibraltar rail tunnel to link the two countries across the strait (an issue on which both are officially working since 2005 when Tangier was treated evolving the fixed links between Europe and Africa and Chief of Staff of the Army of Spain, Admiral Sebastian Zaragoza.|$|E
2500|$|Although PETA takes a gradualist {{approach}} to improving animal welfare, Newkirk {{remains committed to}} ending animal use and the idea that, as PETA's slogan says, [...] "animals are not <b>ours</b> <b>to</b> eat, wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment". Some animal rights abolitionists, most notably Gary Francione, have criticized PETA, calling it and other groups [...] "the new welfarists". Some members of the animal advocacy movement have responded that Francione's position is unnecessarily divisive. Newkirk has also been criticized for her support of actions {{carried out in the}} name of the Animal Liberation Front. Newkirk's position is that the animal rights movement is a revolutionary one and that [...] "hinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out". PETA itself, however, [...] "maintains a creed of nonviolence and does not advocate actions in which anyone, human or nonhuman, is injured". Newkirk and PETA have also been criticized for euthanizing many of the animals taken into PETA's shelters, and PETA has responded to this line of criticism. PETA has been on the news in the southern part of India for Banning of Jallikattu sport which is a cultural symbol of Tamils for thousands of years. The state is witnessing one of the biggest leaderless agitation using social media as a tool to organize these massive protests.|$|E
