40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Ceratomyxa shasta infects {{salmonids}} in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of North America, occasionally causing {{losses in}} wild and captive populations. Host-specific parasite genotypes (O, I, II, III) were previously characterized molecularly using markers in the ribosomal DNA and phenotypically by type host in the Klamath River, CA/OR. This thesis sough to re-examine {{the composition of}} the parasite population elsewhere in the PNW and to further evaluate the host specificity of each genotype. I surveyed salmonids native to the PNW primarily from the Fraser, the Columbia and the Sacramento River basins. I also conducted sentinel studies on the Willamette and Deschutes Rivers that exposed native and non-native salmonids to parasite populations above and below migration barriers. These studies expanded upon the known host range of each genotype: <b>O</b> <b>was</b> <b>specific</b> to rainbow/steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coastal cutthroat trout (<b>O.</b> clarkii); I <b>was</b> <b>specific</b> with Chinook salmon (<b>O.</b> tshawytscha); II <b>was</b> non-specific, being detected in six species, but predominating in coho (O. kitsuch), chum (O. keta), and pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon; and III was also non-specific infecting many native and non-native salmonids. Hosts infected with genotype III were considered “adequate” if myxospore development occurred, and included brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown (Salmo trutta), rainbow, cutthroat, and steelhead trout; but Chinook, kokanee/sockeye (O. nerka) and Atlantic salmon (Salmon salar) were less suitable. The distribution, life history, and phylogenetic traits of each salmonid host are factors that potentially explain the host specificity and the spatial and temporal patterns of each genotype. Data collected in this thesis provide evidence that host-specific C. shasta coevolved with Pacific salmonids, adapting unique host-parasite relationships over time...|$|R

The main objectives {{of this work}} were to identify which host plants O. humeralis selects {{in the field and}} which are the characteristics of the preferred plants. O. humeralis specifically used Melastomataceae as host plants, attacking only four of the 11 species present in the study area.

40|$|Cadherins {{constitute}} a multigene family of Ca ++-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules {{with more than}} 15 members (Magee and Buxton 1991; Takeichi 1991). A role {{of the members of}} this molecular family is to bind cells very tightly through homophilic interactions. If cadherins are absent, cells can disperse freely. Many members of the family preferentially interact with the same molecules. As a result, cells selectively adhere to those expressing identical cadherin types (Nose et al. 1988; Friedlander et al. 1989; Miyatani et al. 1989).

40|$|Liver {{methionine}} adenosyltransferase (MAT) plays {{a critical}} role in the metabolism of methionine converting this amino acid, in the presence of ATP, into S-adenosylmethionine. Here we report that hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), via generation of hydroxyl radical, inactivates liver MAT by reversibly and covalently oxidizing an enzyme site. In vitro studies using pure liver recombinant enzyme and mutants of MAT, where each of the 10 cysteine residues of the enzyme subunit were individually changed to serine by site-directed mutagenesis, identified cysteine 121 as the site of molecular interaction between H 2 O 2 and liver MAT. Cysteine 121 <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> to the hepatic enzyme and is localized at a "flexible loop" over the active site cleft of MAT. In vivo studies, using wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and CHO cells stably expressing liver MAT, demonstrate that the inactivation of MAT by H 2 <b>O</b> 2 <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> to the hepatic enzyme, resulting from the modification of the cysteine residue 121, and that this effect is mediated by the generation of the hydroxyl radical. Our results suggest that H 2 O 2 -induced MAT inactivation might be the cause of reduced MAT activity and abnormal methionine metabolism observed in patients with alcoholic liver disease...|$|R

We find that neat PPO near Tg has the lowest value of EV/EP) 0. 25 (0. 02 reported for any polymer, indicating volume-dominated dynamics. Addition of the lower Tg PS alleviates constraints on local motion, resulting in a weaker volume effect. The opposite situation prevails with PS/PVME blends. PS has a higher Tg, and in blends segmental relaxation of the PVME becomes more controlled by volume than for neat PVME. We also show herein that the relaxation times for the PVME/PS blends measured at various T and P superpose when plotted vs Tøç, where <b>ø</b> <b>is</b> the <b>specific</b> volume and ç is a material constant. This scaling, which has previously been demonstrated for various neat glass-formers and is reported herein for the first time for a blend, enables EV/EP to be determined at Tg in the absence of actual measurements near Tg...|$|R

Serotyping provides {{a basis for the}} categorization of bacterial strains and is an important tool for epidemiological and surveillance purposes. In this study, of the 135 Cronobacter strains tested initially, 119 were identified as C. sakazakii and used. A serotyping scheme for C. sakazakii that classifies strains based on their different <b>O</b> antigens <b>was</b> developed.

40|$|Oryctes agamemnon (Burmeister 1847) (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) was accidentally {{introduced}} in the southwestern oases of Tunisia (Tozeur) around 1980 and spread to the Rjim Maatoug region. In these areas <b>O.</b> agamemnon <b>was</b> <b>specific</b> to date palm trees causing severe damage that can result in potential danger due to collapse of the tree. This study was conducted from April 2004 to March 2006 in 4 sites {{in the region of}} Rjim Maatoug. Different levels of palm tree attack were determined, ovioposition sites were identified, and pest damage was described in detail to specify their relative importance and to indicate factors governing palm tree attack. Eggs were individually oviposited in the attacked parts. Dead parts of palm trees were the main target of O. agamemnon including the respiratory roots, tough, trunk bark, dry petiole and the periphery of the crown. The crown itself was not attacked. Feeding by larvae caused significant damage. The biggest danger occurred when heavy attacks of larvae invaded the respiratory roots {{at the level of the}} soil, and secondarily on the periphery of the crown, which can result in fungal diseases. Several cases of Deglet Nour date palm tree collapse were caused by this pest in Rjim Maatoug. Attacks on other parts of the tree were without danger for the palm tree. In the absence of pest management, application of a quarantine program combined with field cultivation techniques could help farmers significantly decrease attack of O. agamemnon on palm trees...|$|R
40|$|Secreted {{phospholipase}} B is {{a proven}} virulence {{factor for the}} pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans and exhibits three phospholipase activities in the one protein. These are phospholipase B (PLB), lysophospholipase (LPL), and lysophospholipase transacylase (LPTA). Our aim {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of using this enzyme as a target for antifungal therapy. We determined in C. neoformans var. grubii strain H 99 that 82 % of PLB activity was secreted but that 64 % of LPL activity and 70 % of LPTA activity were cell associated. Cell-associated activities (cytosolic and membrane) were further characterized, since it is likely that any fungicidal effect would depend on inhibition of these enzymes. Four commercially available compounds with structural similarities to phospholipid substrates were tested as inhibitors. These were alexidine dihydrochloride (compound A), dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (compound O), 1, 12 bis-(tributylphosphonium) dodecane dibromide (compound P), and decamethonium dibromide (compound D). The best phospholipase inhibitors (compounds A and P) were also the most potent antifungal agents by the standard broth microdilution test. Compound A was highly selective for secreted and cell-associated PLB activities and showed no inhibition of mammalian phospholipase A 2 at 0. 25 μM. Compound <b>O,</b> which <b>was</b> <b>specific</b> for secretory and cytosolic LPL and LPTA and membrane-associated PLB, was not antifungal. We conclude that inhibitors of cryptococcal phospholipases can be selective for fungal enzymes and intrinsically antifungal. They also provide tools for assessing the relative importance of the various enzyme activities in virulence. Our results enable further rational structure-function studies to validate the use of phospholipases as antifungal targets...|$|R
40|$|In Her. 12, 121 - 126 Medea deprecates {{that the}} ship Argo has not been shipwrecked at sea, {{punishing}} {{in this way the}} crew and herself, since she has committed fratricide; a parallel to this threnos can be found in Met. 7, 62 - 68, but as foresight. In Orph. Arg. 1159 - 1170 as Argo perceives that she has got lost, she announces it to the company spontaneously with words similar to those of Medea “herois” alleging the same cause for the anger of gods. She urges the Princes to expiate their very serious nefas by going to Circe, who will perform the necessary rites for their purification. This is found in Apoll. Arg. 4, 580 ff., where the ship speaks through the keel, which was before a sacred oak in Dodona: this explains why she disposes of prophetic faculties that are not unusual in the mythologic tradition for Argo herself and for the “divine” Medea, who becomes an “angel” of Gods, bringing messages of material or spiritual type: the warning and the wholesome advice are the same: to look for Circe, “priestess” of Hekate in order to get purified. It is clear that the texts are similar and that the intertextual convergence between Her. 121 and A. <b>O.</b> 1159 <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> and can <b>be</b> attributed to the elements suitable to prove that in the small poem persists an extra-Apollonian myth known to Ovid, Seneca and other Latin authors, that could help to solve some exegetic questions in the 12 th Herois and could also confirm the anthropologic and literary coherence to the Argonautic logos of Ovid, also thanks to its marked Orphic characters...|$|R
40|$|The {{balance of}} muscle protein {{synthesis}} and degradation determines skeletal muscle mass. We hypothesized that hypoxia-induced muscle atrophy and alterations {{in the regulation}} of muscle protein turnover include a hypoxia-specific component, {{in addition to the}} observed effects of reduction in food intake in response to hypoxia. Mice were subjected to normoxic, hypoxic (8 % oxygen), or pair-fed conditions for 2, 4, and 21 days. Cell-autonomous effects of hypoxia on skeletal muscle were also assessed in differentiated C 2 C 12 myotubes. Hypoxia induced an initial rapid loss of body and muscle weight, which remained decreased during chronic hypoxia and could only in part be explained by the hypoxia-induced reduction of food intake (semistarvation). Regulatory steps of protein synthesis (unfolded protein response and mammal target of rapamycin signaling) remained active in response to acute and sustained hypoxia but not to semistarvation. Activation of regulatory signals for protein degradation, including increased expression of Murf 1, Atrogin- 1, Bnip 3, and Map 1 lc 3 b mRNAs, was observed in response to acute hypoxia {{and to a lesser extent}} following semistarvation. Conversely, the sustained elevation of Atrogin- 1, Bnip 3, and Map 1 lc 3 b mRNAs and the increased activity of their upstream transcriptional regulator Forkhead box <b>O</b> 1 <b>were</b> <b>specific</b> to chronic hypoxia because they were not observed in response to reduced food intake. In conclusion, altered regulation of protein turnover during hypoxia-induced muscle atrophy resulted from an interaction of semistarvation and a hypoxia-specific component. The finding that food restriction but not hypoxia-induced semistarvation inhibited regulatory steps in protein synthesis suggests a hypoxia-specific impairment of the coordination between protein-synthesis signaling and protein-degradation signaling in skeletal muscl...|$|R

S. aureus factors or host-factors contributing to the different outcomes are not completely elucidated. This study aimed to the identification of staphylococcal immunoreactive proteins commonly or differentially produced during infections of variable severity. Methods. Experimental mastitis were induced on primiparous ewes using two S. aureus strains, isolated from gangrenous (strain O 11) or subclinical (strain O 46) mastitis. SERological Proteome Analysis (SERPA) was used to define core and accessory seroproteomes. Results. Strains induced drastically distinct clinical symptoms in ewe experimental mastitis. Notably, they reproduced mild (O 46) or severe (O 11) mastitis. SERPA allowed the identification of 89 immunoreactive proteins, of which only 52 (58. 4 %) were previously identified as immunogenic proteins in other staphylococcal infections.

The O 157 O antigen gene cluster is 14 kb in length, comprising 12 genes and a remnant H-repeat unit. Based on sequence similarity, we have identified all the necessary O antigen genes, including five sugar biosynthetic pathway genes, four transferase genes, the O unit flippase gene, and the O antigen polymerase gene.

From discussion forums on widely used APIs, {{it is clear that}} there are many instances where <b>o’s</b> invariant <b>is</b> violated by the programmer inadvertently changing the state of p when <b>o</b> <b>is</b> in a steady state. Typically, <b>o</b> and p <b>are</b> objects exposed by the API, and the programmer (who is the user of the API), unaware of the dependency between o and p, calls a method of p {{in such a way that}} <b>o’s</b> invariant <b>is</b> violated. The fact that the violation occurred is detected much later, when a method of <b>o</b> <b>is</b> called again, and it is difficult to determine exactly where such violations occur. We propose a runtime verification scheme which guarantees that when <b>o</b> <b>is</b> in a steady state, any violation of <b>o’s</b> invariant <b>is</b> detected exactly where it occurs. This is done by tracking dependencies automatically and validating whether a state change of an object p breaks the invariant of any object o that depends on p. We demonstrate that our tool InvCOP, which implements this scheme, can accurately pinpoint violations of invariants involving multiple objects that were reported in discussion forums on widely used APIs. ...|$|R

Symbol classes Hm and Hm 0 are introduced. It is shown that p. d. <b>o.</b> <b>′s</b> associated with symbols belonging to these classes are continuous linear mappings of the Zemanian space Hμ into itself. An integral representation of p. d. <b>o.</b> <b>′s</b> is obtained.
