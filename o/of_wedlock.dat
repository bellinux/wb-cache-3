5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious.

A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E

5|$|Harding's biographers, writing while Britton's {{allegations}} remained uncertain, differed {{on their}} truth; Russell believed them unquestioningly while Dean, having reviewed Britton's papers at UCLA, regarded them as unproven.

5|$|The Nazi regime {{promoted}} a liberal {{code of conduct}} regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women who bore children out <b>of</b> <b>wedlock.</b> Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously.

Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.|$|E

Two months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to the couple's first child, who had obviously been conceived out <b>of</b> <b>wedlock.</b> Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} data fits well against Eqs. 7 and 9 {{in a variety}} of populations and settings. It also helps clarify some of the key questions regarding the relationships between fertility, marriage, and marital birth ratios. First, it demonstrates the interrelationship and dual importance of both marital/nonmarital fertility and the proportion of women married. Either of these variables can be held constant, yet the other varied to produce an effect on the proportions <b>of</b> births in <b>wedlock.</b> Dropping either produces a decrease in the proportion <b>of</b> births in <b>wedlock</b> unless age-specific fertility decreases. However, Eqs. 7, 8, and 9 also allow us to analyze the effect of the changes in values of marital fertility and proportions married across different values of age-specific fertility.|$|R
