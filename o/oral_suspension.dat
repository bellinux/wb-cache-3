5|$|Clindamycin {{preparations}} for oral administration include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). <b>Oral</b> <b>suspension</b> is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, {{due to its}} extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{currently}} prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including Adderall, AdderallXR, Mydayis, , DyanavelXR, and Evekeo, {{the last}} of which contains racemic amphetamine sulfate. Amphetamine is also prescribed in enantiopure and prodrug form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. However, <b>oral</b> <b>suspension</b> and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the free base were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.|$|E

Title of diploma thesis: Development and {{validation}} of UHPLC method for determination of omeprazole in <b>oral</b> <b>suspensions</b> The {{aim of the}} diploma thesis was to find out suitable conditions for method which enables to determinate the concentration of omeprazole in <b>oral</b> <b>suspensions.</b> There was used the column Kinetex TM 1. 7 µm, C 18 100 A, 50 x 2. 1 mm, (Phenomenex, USA) for analysis. The mobile phase was 0. 025 mol/L phosphate buffer and acelonitrile in ratio 74 : 26. A suitable pH value of 7. 6 was chosen. The internal standard method of methylparaben was applied. The whole analysis was detected on the wavelength of 300 nm. After finding of optimal conditions, 6 different samples of <b>oral</b> omeprazole <b>suspensions</b> were measured. The solution of the mobile phase was used for dissolution of samples. The method was validated. Keywords: omeprazole, UHPLC, <b>oral</b> <b>suspensions...</b>|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, a common and widely prevalent gastro intestinal disease in US population. Lack of suitable liquid dosage forms, palatability and compliance issues are severe limitations for the effective use of omeprazole, an immediately release proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in pediatric patients, children and critically ill patients wit h GERD. This study was aimed to evaluate and compare four newly developed flavored omeprazole <b>oral</b> <b>suspensions</b> with two other commercially available formulations for their palatability and to understand the product characteristics of new formulations using sensory consumer and descriptive methods. A total of 54 supertasters who are genetically sensitive to bitterness, evaluated all the six flavored omeprazole <b>oral</b> <b>suspensions</b> for their acceptance and preference. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of acceptance data revealed significant differences among the six flavored suspensions. Consumer preference data ana lysis reveals no significant differences between Strawberry cream without omeprazole, Zegerid [trademark symbol TM] and Tutifruti products. Descriptive data analyses by multivariate statistical tools showed that "sweetness" and "aftertaste sweetness" have strong influence in the overall liking of the products and were strongly correlated with Strawberry cream without omeprazole and Tutifruti products...|$|R

40|$|Omeprazole is an {{antisecretory drug}} used against gastric ulcers. It quickly {{decomposes}} in an acid medium, however, therefore {{making it a}} matter {{of great interest to}} protect it in these conditions and determine the ideal adsorption conditions for this drug on latex particles for formulation designs — <b>oral</b> <b>suspensions</b> — containing polymers with the aim of delivering different drugs in a sustained and controlled action. Time, pH, and concentration of the active ingredient for which maximum adsorption occurs, were determined. The findings suggest that adsorption is evidently greatest at an acid pH 4 – 5, that the adsorption of Omeprazole rises concomitantly with the increase in latex particles, and the time is the least influential factor. © 2000 Elsevier Science S.
