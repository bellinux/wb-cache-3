5|$|Although {{not much}} {{is known about}} Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on {{ceramics}} and <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> sculpture. Usually, only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors {{are known to have}} recorded their names <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras. However, most works remained unsigned by their artists.|$|E
5|$|The {{pyramid of}} Userkaf was {{apparently}} {{the object of}} restoration work in antiquity under the impulse of Khaemweset (1280–1225 BC), fourth son of Ramses II. This is attested by inscriptions <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> cladding showing Khaemweset with offering bearers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} she was {{decommissioned}} in 1969, Tiptoe was the last active T-class submarine in the Royal Navy. As she arrived at Spithead for decommissioning on 29 August 1969, a 13-year-old ballet dancer named Judy Wright danced on her upper deck. She was sold in 1971 and scrapped at Portsmouth in 1975. Her anchor was saved, and was mounted <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> in 1979 in Blyth, Northumberland. The town was used as a training base for submarines during both World Wars.|$|E

5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made of cast iron <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> abutments, with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936 completely in stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some remain as private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{script was}} in use {{up to the}} arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period. In excess of 10,000 {{individual}} texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics. The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name amatl used to produce codices. The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, {{as a result of the}} impact of the conquest on Maya society.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje {{in the form}} of {{classical}} Chinese books likely written on paper and {{in the form of}} manuscript rolls (kansubon). This probably happened {{at the beginning of the}} 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century. According to legend the scholar Wani introduced the Chinese writing system as well as Confucianism to Japan. The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show a clear understanding of the concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> or metal.|$|E

The nymphs consumed the same sizes and types of food particles from deposits <b>on</b> <b>stones,</b> mostly {{in the form of}} detritus.

5|$|The west {{tower is}} surmounted with crenellations and pinnacles and is {{supported}} by stepped buttresses at each corner. The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces. They rest <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> plinths, each bearing carved shields, that on the north buttress with an inaccurate rendering of {{the arms of the}} see, and the other with a cross and a dolphin. The tower has three Perpendicular windows in the belfry and a large Perpendicular window in its western face, giving light to the west end of the nave.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
5|$|Few {{documents}} {{written in}} either the Khitan large or small script survive to this day. Most surviving specimens of both Khitan scripts are epitaph inscriptions <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> tablets, {{as well as a}} number of inscriptions on coins, mirrors and seals. Only a single manuscript text in the Khitan large script is known (Nova N 176), and no manuscripts in the Khitan small script are known. The Liao emperors could read Chinese, and while there were some Chinese works translated into Khitan during the Liao dynasty, the Confucian classics, which served as the core guide to the administration of government in China, are not known to have been translated into Khitan.|$|E

5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 {{a friend}} of Watts {{suggested}} to Henry Gamble, Vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate, that should the church manage to purchase the land owned by the CPF {{it would make a}} suitable site for Watts's memorial. Watts was approached, and agreed to the suggestion. On 13October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the proposal that if the remaining £3,000 were raised, Watts would design and build a covered way, which in due course would be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people. Watts planned to build a covered way around three sides of a quadrangle, with the roof supported <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> or timber columns.|$|E

5|$|Khaba is {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} built the Layer Pyramid, located at Zawyet el'Aryan, about 8km south-west of Giza. The pyramid's construction is typical of Third Dynasty masonry with mudbricks arranged in layers around a core made of rough blocks from the local bedrock. The pyramid was planned to be about 42 to 45 meters tall, but is now only 17 meters. It is unclear whether part of the pyramid has been eroded over time or its construction was never finished. While there are no inscriptions directly relating the pyramid to Khaba, his serekh appears <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> bowls that were discovered in a nearby mastaba, known as Mastaba Z500.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} utilised local building materials, including cruck constructed houses, turf walls and clay, {{with a heavy}} reliance <b>on</b> <b>stone.</b> Medieval parish church architecture was typically simpler than in England, but there were grander ecclesiastical buildings in the Romanesque and Gothic styles. From the early fifteenth century, the introduction of Renaissance styles included the selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture, as in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral. Castles arrived in Scotland {{with the introduction of}} feudalism in the twelfth century. Initially these were wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, but many were replaced by stone castles with a high curtain wall. In the late Middle Ages, new castles were built, some on a grander scale, and others, particularly in the borders, as simpler tower houses. Gunpowder weaponry led to the use of gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls adapted to resist bombardment. There was a phase of Renaissance palace building from the late fifteenth century, beginning at Linlithgow.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 1876, {{a bridge}} over Ohio's Ashtabula River collapsed. The bridge {{had been built}} from metal cast at one of Stone's mills, and was {{carrying}} a train {{owned and operated by}} Stone's Lake Shore and Michigan Railway. Ninety-two people died; it was the worst rail disaster in American history up to that point. Blame fell heavily <b>on</b> <b>Stone,</b> who departed for Europe to recuperate and left Hay in charge of his businesses. The summer of 1877 was marked by labor disputes; a strike over wage cuts on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad soon spread to the Lake Shore, much to Hay's outrage. He blamed foreign agitators for the dispute, and vented his anger over the strike in his only novel, The Bread-Winners (1883).|$|E

5|$|Punic, the Semitic {{language}} of the Carthaginians, continued {{to be used in}} North Africa during the Imperial period. Before the Roman conquest in 146 BC, nearly all Punic inscriptions had been votives to the deities Tanit and Ba'al or funerary commemorations, but during the Roman era a broader range of content is found in Neo-Punic, often appearing with parallel texts in Latin or Greek. A striking occurrence of Neo-Punic is found at the otherwise thoroughly Roman temple of Roma and Augustus, built 14–19 AD at Leptis Magna. One of the latest Neo-Punic inscriptions on a monument dates to the reign of Domitian (81–96 AD). No inscription in Punic script <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> can be dated later than the 2nd or 3rd century. Latin script was used to write Punic in the 4th and 5th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{takes the}} form of a marble column topped by a sculpture of Saint George slaying a dragon, an image Lutyens used on two other public war memorials. At the base of the column, the names of the village's war dead are inscribed <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> panels. The memorial is flanked by identical rubble walls in local stone, on top of which grows a yew hedge. Low stone benches protrude from the walls to allow wreaths to be laid. Additional panels were fixed to the wall after the Second World War to commemorate that conflict. The memorial was unveiled on 26 June 1921 by Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, whose brother is among those commemorated on it. It is a grade II* listed building and since 2015 has been part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.|$|E
5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest <b>on</b> <b>stone</b> bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E
