25|$|Bioremediation Accelerator: Oleophilic, {{hydrophobic}} chemical, containing no bacteria, which chemically {{and physically}} bonds to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The bioremediation accelerator {{acts as a}} herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules {{to the surface of}} the water, including solubles such as phenols and BTEX, forming gel-like agglomerations. Undetectable levels of hydrocarbons can be obtained in produced water and manageable water columns. By <b>overspraying</b> sheen with bioremediation accelerator, sheen is eliminated within minutes. Whether applied on land or on water, the nutrient-rich emulsion creates a bloom of local, indigenous, pre-existing, hydrocarbon-consuming bacteria. Those specific bacteria break down the hydrocarbons into water and carbon dioxide, with EPA tests showing 98% of alkanes biodegraded in 28 days; and aromatics being biodegraded 200 times faster than in nature they also sometimes use the hydrofireboom to clean the oil up by taking it away from most of the oil and burning it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{spray angle}} diverges or converges {{with respect to}} the {{vertical}} axis. As illustrated in the figure below, the spray angle tends to collapse or diverge with increasing distance from the orifice. Spray coverage varies with spray angle. The theoretical coverage, C, of spray patterns at various distances may be calculated with the equation below for spray angles less than 180 degrees. The spray angle is assumed to remain constant throughout the entire spray distance. Liquids more viscous than water form smaller spray angles, or solid streams, depending upon nozzle capacity, spray pressure, and viscosity. Liquids with surface tensions lower than water produce wider spray angles than those listed for water. Spray angles are typically measured using optical or mechanical methods. The optical methods include shadowgraphy, extinction tomography, and Mie Imaging. [...] Sprays angles are important in coating applications to prevent <b>overspraying</b> of the coated materials, in combustion engines to prevent wetting of the cylinder walls, and in fire sprinklers to provide adequate coverage of the protected property.|$|E
30|$|Many of the glyphosate-based {{herbicide}} formulations available {{have been}} shown to stress amphibians [8]. Acute toxic, chronic and delayed effects at environmentally relevant and sublethal concentrations {{have been shown}} [8]. All amphibian life stages can suffer from glyphosate-based herbicides, with direct <b>overspraying</b> of migrating or resting terrestrial life stages (i.e. adults and juveniles) being a major threat [5],[8]. Rapid mortal effects on aquatic larval stages have been demonstrated, mainly within the first 24  h after contamination [4]. Therefore, the relatively fast adsorption behaviour of glyphosate and its surfactants on soil and sediment, as well as the observed fast microbial degradation, cannot prevent acute toxic effects [4],[8]. We suggest that direct contact of individuals with formulations (e.g. <b>overspraying</b> of adults and juveniles; first peak concentrations in breeding sites, for instance, after the first heavy rainfalls) is most relevant.|$|E

30|$|The {{consequence}} is that amphibians can {{be exposed to}} glyphosate-based herbicides throughout much of their annual activity cycle. This can be manifested as follows: Adult breeding migration to ponds across fields in spring can coincide with <b>overspraying,</b> thus affecting the breeding population. Similarly, later in spring or summer, adults can be affected by applications when they cross field during the return from the pond to the summer habitats. Likewise, freshly metamorphosed juveniles often emerge in masses after summer rains and can be oversprayed during emigration [5]. Moreover, eggs and larval stages can be exposed to glyphosate-based herbicides due to surface water runoff and drift during larval development from early spring to summer [8],[12].|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{disadvantages}} to the gas atomisation spray forming process. The most significant disadvantage is the relatively low process yield with typical losses of ~30%. Losses occur because of <b>overspray</b> (droplets missing the emerging billet), splashing of material from the billet surface, and material ‘bouncing’ off the semi-solid top surface. Many operators of the spray forming process now use a particle injector system to re-inject the <b>overspray</b> powder, and thus recycle material {{that would otherwise be}} lost, or sell the <b>overspray</b> powder as a product in its own right. The second major disadvantage is one of process control. As it is essentially a free-forming process with many interdependent variables, it has proved difficult to predict the shape, porosity or deposition rate for a given alloy. Much of the control is based on operator experience and empirical relationships. It is partly the process complexity and lack of robust process control that has prevented the widespread commercialisation of this process. Some developments using feed-back control have proved successful in improving the variations in billet diameter and improving yield in specific systems but these have yet to find widespread implementation.|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{to catch}} paint <b>overspray</b> has been proposed. <b>Overspray</b> is an unavoidable parasitic component of spray that occurs because {{the flow of}} air or other gas in the spray must turn at the sprayed surface. Very small droplets are carried away in this turning flow, and some land on adjacent surfaces {{not meant to be}} painted. The basic principle of the paint-spray catcher is to divert the <b>overspray</b> into a suction system at the boundary of the area to be painted. The paint-spray catcher (see figure) would include a toroidal plenum connected through narrow throat to a nozzle that would face {{toward the center of the}} torus, which would be positioned over the center of the area to be spray-painted. The plenum would be supported by four tubes that would also serve as suction exhaust ducts. The downstream ends of the tubes (not shown in the figure) would be connected to a filter on a suction pump. The pump would be rated to provide a suction mass flow somewhat greater than that of the directed spray gas stream, so that the nozzle would take in a small excess of surrounding gas and catch nearly all of the <b>overspray.</b> A small raised lip at the bottom edge of the nozzle would catch paint that landed inside the nozzle. Even if the paint is directly piston pumped, the droplets entrain an air flow by time they approach the wall, so there is always a gas stream to carry the excess droplets to the side. For long-duration spraying operations, it could be desirable to include a suction-drain apparatus to prevent overflowing and dripping of paint from inside the lip. A version without an external contraction and with the throat angled downward would be a more compact version of catcher, although it might be slightly less efficient...|$|R

Furthermore, three turbine myths: that fogging/overspray increases the air density in the compressor, reduces the compressor power consumption, and noticeably enhances the gas turbine efficiency, are examined and discussed.

First, stresses along substrate edges make PZT substrates more susceptible to breakage if any sort of mechanical force is present. It was determined that these stresses were caused by differential strains due to incomplete metal layer coverage. Second, the electrical arcing that is frequently taking place during poling sends a mechanical shock wave through the substrate.
