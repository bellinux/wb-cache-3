5|$|Al-Maʿarri's {{fundamental}} pessimism {{is expressed}} in his anti-natalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.|$|E
5|$|Minh {{was said}} to have been deeply {{affected}} by the loss of his long-time aide, and it was reported that the general erected an altar dedicated to Nhung's memory in his office, with the major's portrait on it. Shortly after the coup, Khánh made Minh the figurehead head of state under American advice, hoping that the presence of the popular general would help to unify the armed forces, but Minh made little attempt to help Khánh, partly because of resentment <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his aide.|$|E

5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> shopowners' right of access to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be {{changed for the better}} when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E
5|$|In September 1660, Consort Donggo, the Shunzhi Emperor's {{favourite}} consort, suddenly died as {{a result}} of grief <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a child. Overwhelmed with grief, the emperor fell into dejection for months, until he contracted smallpox on 2 February 1661. On 4 February 1661, officials Wang Xi (王熙, 1628–1703; the emperor's confidant) and Margi (a Manchu) were called to the emperor's bedside to record his last will. On the same day, his seven-year-old third son Xuanye was chosen to be his successor, probably because he had already survived smallpox. The emperor died on 5 February 1661 in the Forbidden City at the age of twenty-two.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} Pyro, Lehnsherr {{recruits}} Callisto {{and several other}} mutants. They attack the mobile prison holding Mystique to free her, also freeing Juggernaut and Multiple Man. Mystique saves Lehnsherr by taking {{a shot of the}} mutant cure aimed at him, rendering Raven Darkhölme human. Hateful of humans, Lehnsherr abandons Darkhölme, much to her shock and disappointment. Meanwhile, Scott Summers, still distraught <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his fiancée, Jean Grey, drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Summers but, as the two kiss, Jean kills him. Sensing trouble, Xavier sends Logan and Storm to investigate. When they arrive, they find only telekinetically floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean.|$|E
5|$|After his return, Lad is bred {{with another}} prize-winning collie, Lady, {{and they have}} two male puppies which are named Little Lad and Wolf. Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they {{are old enough to}} leave their mother & she chooses Little Lad. However, Jackson White (Jack Daly), a poacher Lad fought and chased off the {{property}} before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and Little Lad is killed but not Wolf. Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> her puppy Little Lad, and refuses {{to have anything to do}} with Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog.|$|E
25|$|The {{tour of the}} UAE followed, where Bright captained the side. Australia only {{played one}} game, against Pakistan. Australia made 7–202, which Pakistan reached in 49 <b>overs</b> for <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> two wickets. Bright took 1–28.|$|R

5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself {{to be taken to}} St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive {{controversy}} erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> so many sailors, and over the failure to recover {{the bodies of the}} dead for burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.|$|E
5|$|Emily, {{disguised}} as her twin sister Katie, arrives at college to take Katie's history exam. In reality, Katie is at home, with nine stitches {{to the head}} after being hit with a rock by their friend Effy Stonem, who has disappeared. Katie is embarrassed about how her injuries look, and miserable <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> her boyfriend Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), who only dated her to spite Effy, his real love interest. She begins to take notice of all the hints in front of her, and realises that she can no longer hide from herself the fact that Emily is homosexual. At college, Naomi uncovers Emily's disguise (which had not fooled JJ or Freddie either) and tells her that she plans to spend the summer alone in Cyprus. When Emily tells Naomi that she will miss her, they kiss in an empty corridor and later find themselves at Naomi's house where they have sex. Afterward, Emily asks Naomi to the college ball, but Naomi, still crippled by insecurity over her sexuality, refuses, leaving Emily heartbroken. Emily leaves and {{at the bus stop}} meets Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba), who offers her his shoes and jacket and is unconcerned when she tells him that she is gay. He tries to comfort her but admits that he believes it impossible to stop loving somebody, referring to his ex-girlfriend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Emily returns home and comes out to her family, telling them that she has been having sex with a girl named Naomi. Her father, Rob (John Bishop), dismisses it as a joke and her mother, Jenna (Ronni Ancona), is speechless, while Katie tries to deny it. She and Emily have a heated argument, leaving Katie crying.|$|E
25|$|In {{their opening}} match of World Cup 2011 campaign, Kenya faced a mammoth defeat from New Zealand by 10 wickets, they were bowled out for 69 runs and New Zealand won the match in just 8 <b>overs</b> without <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a wicket.|$|R

5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At {{the beginning of the}} film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} had grown increasingly distressed over Mosaddegh's policies and were especially bitter <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> their {{control of the}} Iranian oil industry. Repeated attempts {{to reach a settlement}} had failed, and, in October 1952, Mosaddegh declared Britain an enemy and cut all diplomatic relations.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Han-Pashi was still distraught and suicidal <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his arm, and so joined ranks with those planning to assault Beslan, where he was armed with a pistol. It is claimed that Nur-Pashi tagged along to act as a bodyguard for his brother.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the fatal}} {{accident}} of Lorenzo Bandini a year earlier, the track was altered with the harbour chicane being tightened {{and the race}} shortened by 20 laps. Ferrari still chose not to attend the race since they felt the safety measures to be insufficient. While Graham Hill stated Lotus were still [...] "in despair" [...] <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> Jim Clark and Mike Spence, the team nevertheless introduced their new Lotus 49B for the race. The B specifications introduced a wedge shape and a front wing. 1968 {{would prove to be}} the season in which wings became a common place on Formula One cars. Jackie Stewart was still sidelined by his wrist injury and was replaced by Johnny Servoz-Gavin.|$|R
2500|$|In romantic relationships, {{thoughts}} and feelings of insecurity, fear, and anxiety <b>over</b> <b>the</b> anticipated <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a partner or of that partner's attention, affection, or time elicit both compersion and jealousy as natural reactions to perceived complexities of non-monogamy and [...] in polyamorous literature.|$|R
5000|$|Reception of the {{new model}} was {{generally}} lukewarm. The 75 had been conceived prior to Fiat's acquisition of the Alfa brand, so as [...] "the last real Alfa" [...] it cast rather a shadow <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 155; <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> rear-wheel drive was frequently cited as {{the main cause of}} the disappointment. Nevertheless, the 155 was entered in Touring Car racing and was successful in every major championship it entered, which gradually improved its image.|$|R
25|$|Desdemona is {{concerned}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the handkerchief but maintains that its loss will not cause Othello to grow angry. Emilia is more cynical, especially after Othello violently asks to see it. Desdemona is confused over her husband's behaviour, which culminates in his striking her {{in public and}} calling her a whore.|$|E
25|$|Zeus {{then gave}} her the ability to remove her eyes. The purpose of this ability is unclear in Diodorus, but other {{versions}} state Lamia's ability to remove her eyes came with the gift of prophecy. Zeus did this to appease Lamia in her grief <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> her children and to let her rest since she could not close her eyes.|$|E
25|$|The New York City Landmarks Law {{was signed}} into effect by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., in 1965. This {{law was passed}} after New York {{citizens}} grew concerned <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> culturally significant structures such as Pennsylvania Station, demolished in 1963. The Landmarks Law's purpose is to protect structures that are significant {{to the city and}} still retain their ability to be properly used.
