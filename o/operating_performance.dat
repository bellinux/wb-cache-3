5|$|Pillsbury's {{management}} {{made several}} attempts at reorganization or {{restructuring of the}} restaurant chain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a restructuring of corporate business practices {{at all levels of}} the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of the menu, and new store designs to standardize the look and feel of the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor <b>operating</b> <b>performance</b> and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E

Cross-sectional tests reveal that firms issuing convertible debt often suffer stock underperformance partly because of their deteriorating fundamentals subsequently to the issuance. Even when each convertible bond directly matches with a straight bond that has a similar offering date and issuer and bond charac-teristics, convertible debt issuers still significantly under-perform straight debt issuers, supporting that what matters for long-term equity and <b>operating</b> <b>performances</b> {{is the type of}} debt offering...|$|R
40|$|While {{previous}} {{studies have examined the}} equilibrium number of segments and the effects of diversification on market prices and <b>operating</b> <b>performances,</b> this paper aims to identify ex ante managerial incentives behind corporate diversification in a sample of non-monopolist firms. I try to use accounting data to measure those incentives. Generally speaking, for the non-monopolist sample, firms that undertake diversifying activities have smaller market power, lower leverage ratios, poorer <b>operating</b> <b>performances</b> (as measured by ROAs), smaller sizes, fewer growth opportunities and have experienced more rapid growth in sales in the past three years. Also, firms are more likely to diversify if they rely more heavily on accounting-based performance measures, as opposed to market-based measures, in determining management compensation...|$|R
25|$|In cooling mode, a heat pump's <b>operating</b> <b>performance</b> is {{described}} in the US as its energy efficiency ratio (EER) or {{seasonal energy efficiency ratio}} (SEER), and both measures have units of BTU/(h·W) (1 BTU/(h·W)= 0.293 W/W). A larger EER number indicates better performance. The manufacturer's literature should provide both a COP to describe performance in heating mode, and an EER or SEER to describe performance in cooling mode. Actual performance varies, however, and depends on many factors such as installation details, temperature differences, site elevation, and maintenance.|$|E

2500|$|Analysis of the {{economics}} of nuclear power {{must take into account}} who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies where many of the risks associated with construction costs, <b>operating</b> <b>performance,</b> fuel price, accident liability and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers.

40|$|Agency theory {{suggests}} that institutional stockholders are able to influence the dividend policies of listed firms with the underlying objective of reducing a firm’s agency costs. This study explores the causal effects of institutional ownership on dividend policies for the firms listed in China. Using various measures of institutional ownership and dividend policy, I find that mutual fund ownership in a firm causes it to pay out more cash dividends or to initiate cash dividends. These effects are mainly evident in the firms controlled {{by the state and}} regional governments and those with relatively high free cash flows. The effects are also shown to be stronger when the mutual fund investment horizon is longer. However, firms with existing high levels of cash dividends do not attract mutual fund investors. The results still hold when I use different methods to mitigate the endogeneity problem. Mutual fund ownership is also shown to reduce agency costs and improve the <b>operating</b> <b>performances</b> of the firms that they invest in. Other institutional investors, such as banks, insurance companies, and securities companies appear to have different influences from those of mutual funds on firms’ cash dividend payments, agency costs and <b>operating</b> <b>performances.</b> My results support the agency costs explanation of institutional ownership and dividend policy...|$|R
40|$|The use of task/ambient {{conditioning}} (TAC) {{systems can}} help improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality, {{and reduce the}} energy consumption in bedrooms in residences or guestrooms in hotels at night-time for sleeping. However, its operational and energy saving performances {{would be affected by}} a number of factors, such as supply air flow rate and temperature, and supply vane angles. This paper reports on optimizing numerically the <b>operating</b> <b>performances</b> of a novel bed-based TAC system. Firstly, the methods on a novel bed-based TAC system are introduced, including the experimental method and the computational method. Secondly, the numerical model is validated using the experimental results at the experimental operating conditions. Thirdly, the <b>operating</b> <b>performances</b> of the novel bed-based TAC systems at non-experimental operating conditions using the validated numerical model are optimized and the results reported. Finally, the conclusion and limitations of the study are given. The numerical study results showed that by suitably controlling its supply air flow velocity and temperature, and supply vane angle, the bed-based TAC system can be operated to maintain an acceptable level of thermal comfort without the cold draft in an occupied zone at a low energy consumption.
