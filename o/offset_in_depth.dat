40|$|Abstract: Systems {{that include}} {{multiple}} integrated displays {{distributed throughout the}} working environment are becoming prevalent. Compared to traditional desktop displays, information presented on such systems is typically separated at much wider visual angles. Additionally, since displays are often placed at different depths or are framed by physical bezels, they introduce physical discontinuities in the presentation of information. In this paper, we describe a study that utilizes a divided attention paradigm to explore the effects of visual separation and physical discontinuities when distributing information across multiple displays. Results show reliable, though small, detrimental effects when information is separated within the visual field, but only when coupled with an <b>offset</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> Surprisingly, physical discontinuities such as monitor bezels and even separation in depth alone {{do not seem to}} affect performance on the set of tasks tested. Following the findings, we provide recommendations for the design of hardware and software in multiple display environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: BIRPS has {{acquired}} two deep seismic reflection profiles across the Walls Boundary Fault, a major late Caledonian strike-slip fault {{that is probably}} the northern continuation of the Great Glen Fault of Scotland. Where crossed by the SHET deep seismic survey north of the Shetlands, the Walls Boundary Fault {{appears to be a}} narrow vertical structure which penetrates the entire crustal thickness and juxtaposes 'crusts of different thicknesses. The seismic data show a Moho offset in travel-time of 1. 0 - 1. 5 seconds and two high-amplitude diffractions originating at Moho travel-times. These diffractions are, as yet, unique among seismic data across strike-slip faults and can be used to argue that the Moho is <b>offset</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> by 2 - 3 km over a lateral distance of less than 6 km. Seismic modelling is used to constrain this interpretation. The preservation of this Moho topography suggests that the structure and rheology of the lower crust of the Shetland Platform was not significantly modified during post-Devonian extension of the North Sea and Atlantic margin. Deep seismic reflection profiling is increasingly being used to study the nature and geometry at depth of structures mapped at the surface. Of particular interest are the major strike-slip faults found on the continents. Several of thes...|$|E
40|$|Motion {{parallax}} {{is widely}} regarded as providing metric depth information that is equal or superior to that obtained from binocular stereopsis — in part because it is assumed to be fairly robust with viewing distance. But excellent depth-recovery from motion parallax may be limited to very near “personal” space, where most motion parallax experiments are done. For example, Ono et al. (1986) found that although motion parallax produced rigid depth percepts in very near space, simulated objects appeared to become non-rigid as viewing distance was increased past a meter or so. We sought to investigate the perception of empty intervals between objects. To ensure there were no artifacts of temporal lag, we created a “cloud chamber” in which fibrous clouds could be suspended on invisible wires in front of a back-lit matte blue screen. A volume of space 2 – 4 m from the observers was used — the near part of “action space” (Cutting 2 ̆ 6 Vishton, 1995). Naive subjects viewed pairs of clouds that were <b>offset</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> (and offset slightly horizontally, to avoid occlusion), and estimated the depth separation between them. Static binocular viewing was compared with dynamic monocular viewing where the extent of lateral head motion (12. 5 cm) was twice the typical interocular distance. Despite the theoretical advantages accorded by doubled parallax, the gain of perceived depth separations from motion parallax was only about half that from binocular stereopsis. This inferiority of motion parallax corresponds to our own subjective experiences: At these distances, monocular motion parallax from lateral sway produces the impression of relative motion, not depth, between objects. Whether object-directed action would show greater evidence of depth sensitivity remains to be seen...|$|E
30|$|I present {{two methods}} for {{constructing}} angle gathers in 3 -D seismic imaging by downward extrapolation. Angles in angle gathers {{refer to the}} scattering angle at the reflector and provide a natural access to analyzing migration velocity and amplitudes. In the first method, angle gathers are extracted at each downward-continuation step by mapping transformations in constant-depth frequency slices. In the second method, one extracts angle gathers after applying the imaging condition by transforming local <b>offset</b> gathers <b>in</b> the <b>depth</b> domain. The second approach generalizes previously published algorithms for angle-gather construction in 2 -D and common-azimuth imaging.|$|R
40|$|A {{composite}} section, which reconstructs {{a continuous}} stratigraphic record from cores of multiple nearby holes, {{and its associated}} composite depth scale are important tools for analyzing sediment recovered from a drilling site. However, the standard technique for creating composite depth scales on drilling cruises does not correct for depth distortion within each core. Additionally, the splicing technique used to create composite sections often results in a 10 - 15 % offset between composite depths and measured drill depths. We present a new automated compositing technique that better aligns stratigraphy across holes, corrects depth offsets, and could be performed aboard ship. By analyzing 618 cores from seven Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites, we estimate that ? 80 % of the <b>depth</b> <b>offset</b> <b>in</b> traditional composite <b>depth</b> scales results from core extension during drilling and extraction. Average rates of extension are 12. 4 ± 1. 5 % for calcareous and siliceous cores from ODP Leg 138 and 8. 1 ± 1. 1 % for calcareous and clay-rich cores from ODP Leg 154. Also, average extension decreases {{as a function of}} <b>depth</b> <b>in</b> the sediment column, suggesting that elastic rebound is not the dominant extension mechanism...|$|R

40|$|A “nested graben ” {{structural}} model, {{in which}} multiple faults successively displace rocks downward to the deepest {{part of the}} basin, is supported by recent field geologic analysis and correlation of results to geophysical data for Dixie Valley. Aerial photographic analysis and detailed field mapping provide strong evidence for a deep graben separated from the ranges {{to the east and}} west by multiple normal faults that affect the Tertiary/Quaternary basin-fill sediments. Correlation with seismic reflection and gravity surveys shows that some faults recognized by minor displacements at the surface produce significant stratigraphic <b>offsets</b> at <b>depth</b> <b>in</b> basin-fill sediments and help to explain gravity gradients displaced basin-ward from the range-front. The concept of a complex series of faults (both synthetic and antithetic) separating the Stillwater Range from Dixie Valley allows for the possibility that the geothermal circulation encompasses multiple faults both inboard and outboard of the range-front fault. This geometry increases the exploration potential of the area by providing additional possibilities for fault-controlled permeability and larger volumes of permeable rocks.

30|$|There are two {{possible}} approaches to angle-gather construction with wavefield continuation. In the first approach, one generates gathers at each depth level converting offset-space-frequency planes into angle-space planes simultaneously with applying the imaging condition. The <b>offset</b> <b>in</b> this case {{refers to the}} local offset between source and receiver parts of the downward continued prestack data. Such a construction was suggested, for example, by Prucha et al. (1999). This approach is attractive because of its localization <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> However, the method of Prucha et al. (1999) produces gathers <b>in</b> the <b>offset</b> ray parameter as opposed to angle. As a result, the angle-domain information becomes structure-dependent: the output depends {{not only on the}} scattering angle but also on the structural dip.|$|R

Faster convective stirring can also be maintained by maximum heating at the low section and maximum cooling at the top section, thus allowing the middle section to control the overall temperature in the water column. Further increase in pycnocline strength can be achieved by dissolving sea salt in the water.
