The lowest spectral intensity recordings were associated with scales which have the greatest level of micro-structuring. Our results indicate that scale appearance in B. arietans {{is a product of}} microstructure-mediated <b>optical</b> <b>effects.</b> The <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> {{may play a role in}} improving the ecological performance of the snake in its natural environment...|$|R

40|$|In normal materials, the {{nonlinear}} <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> {{arise from}} nonlinearities in the polarisabilities of the constituent atoms or molecules. On {{the other hand}} the nonlinear <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> in liquid crystals arise from totally different processes. Also they occur at relatively low laser intensities. In a laser field a liquid crystal exhibits many novel and interesting nonlinear <b>optical</b> <b>effects.</b> In addition we also find laser field induced effects that are peculiar to liquid crystals, like structural transformations, orientational transitions, modulated structures and phase transitions, to name a few. Here we dwell upon {{a few of these}} interesting and important nonlinear optical phenomena that exist in nematic liquid crystals...|$|R

2500|$|Blue {{is one of}} {{the three}} primary colours of {{pigments}} in painting and traditional colour theory, {{as well as in the}} RGB colour model. It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. [...] Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> known as Rayleigh scattering. [...] An <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> called atmospheric perspective.|$|R
50|$|The modern English word blue {{comes from}} Middle English bleu or blewe, from the Old French bleu, {{a word of}} Germanic origin related to Old Dutch, Old High German, Old Saxon blāo and Old Frisian blāw, blau. The clear sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> known as Rayleigh scattering. When {{sunlight}} passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. An <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> called Tyndall scattering, similar to Rayleigh scattering, explains blue eyes; there is no blue pigment in blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> called atmospheric perspective.|$|R
40|$|Many {{bright colors}} in nature are {{generated}} by the <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> of biological structures. These intricate structures, combined with the absorption and reflection effects of the chemical pigments within, provide the observed color with high visibility and some other startling optical properties. A prominent example comes from the iridescent colors observed on the wing scales of Morpho, a family of subtropical butterflies. Iridescent color refers to the color which changes with varying viewing angle. It is proposed that a layered structure alternating in refractive indices produces the observed colors on the butterfly wing scales, but this generalized idea does not explain some <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> observed {{through a variety of}} methods. This research suggests that the structures in the lower lamina also contributes to the macroscopic <b>optical</b> <b>effects.</b> The observation methods used in this research include optical microscopy, spectroscopy, integrating sphere analysis, and scatterometry. The scatterometry visualizes the far field <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> from all viewing angles simultaneously. Elementary explanations are proposed for the unexpected patterns observed in the experiments. Undergraduat...|$|R
