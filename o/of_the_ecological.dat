Some of these observations {{have been described}} as mimetic relationships, but the degree of resemblance is not so accurate as in other mimetic butterfly groups, there is no direct evidence of unpalatability of pronophiline butterflies, and no clear understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ecological</b> consequences of such resemblance.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{families}} which are widely {{distributed throughout the}} northern hemisphere which only inhabit far northern Australia. These are Microhylidae and the Ranidae. Two of the 59 genera of Microhylidae, and only one of approximately 750 species of Ranidae are native to Australia. Although both these families are widely distributed throughout the world, they have only recently reached Australia and New Guinea. This is because the Australian continent has remained isolated since its separation from Antarctica, and as it has drifted north towards Asia, many species {{have been able to}} cross into New Guinea, and eventually Australia. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ecological</b> niches filled by frogs had been filled before the ranids and microhylids reached Australia, so {{only a limited number of}} species have established.|$|E

25|$|The fauna of Australia {{consists}} of a huge variety of animals; some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 24% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians that inhabit the continent are endemic to Australia. This high level of endemism {{can be attributed to}} the continent's long geographic isolation, tectonic stability, and the effects of an unusual pattern of climate change on the soil and flora over geological time. A unique feature of Australia's fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals. Consequently, the marsupials — a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch, including the macropods, possums and dasyuromorphs — occupy many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ecological</b> niches placental animals occupy elsewhere in the world. Australia is home to two of the five known extant species of monotremes and has numerous venomous species, which include the platypus, spiders, scorpions, octopus, jellyfish, molluscs, stonefish, and stingrays. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of snakes.|$|E
25|$|Since the pre-Hispanic period, Xochimilco’s {{economy has}} {{traditionally}} been based on agriculture, mostly by supplying {{to the needs of}} Mexico City. This not only dominated the economy but also the area’s religious practices, some of which can still be seen to the present day. Agriculture still remains important in the borough, but most of the focus has shifted to flowers and ornamental plants. One major reason for this is the poor quality of the area’s water supply. Xochimilco has four major markets dedicated to the sale of plants and flowers: Cuemanco, Palacio de la Flor, Mercado de Madre Selva and the historic market at San Luis Tlaxialtemalco. Cuemanco is the largest in Xochimilco and the largest of its kind in Latin America, covering thirteen hectares, with its own cactus garden and forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ecological</b> preserve of Cuemanco. The borough produces 2.5 million poinsettias each year, accounting for most of the 3.5 million sold each year in Mexico City. This represents an income for the borough of about 25 to 30 million pesos annually, grown by about 10,000 growers.|$|E

According to Stümpke, the order's remarkable variety was the natural outcome of evolution acting {{over millions of years}} in the remote Hy-yi-yi islands. All the 14 families and 189 known snouter species descended from a small shrew-like animal, which gradually evolved and diversified to fill most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ecological</b> niches in the archipelago [...] from tiny worm-like beings to large herbivores and predators.|$|E
