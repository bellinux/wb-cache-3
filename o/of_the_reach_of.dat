5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she {{could be used in}} the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Washington {{endorsed}} 18 incumbent aldermen and 5 challengers, including Shiller. Washington {{appeared at}} a joint rally with Shiller at which she announced her candidacy. Kaszak {{was endorsed by}} the Chicago Sun-Times, the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO), the National Organization for Women (NOW), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), and former aldermen William Singer and Dick Simpson. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Orbach. Shiller charged that Orbach catered to developers, displacing people {{in the wake of}} rehabilitation that priced housing out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> many, and said she wanted community zoning boards, with their decisions binding on the alderman. Shiller charged that most of Orbach's campaign war chest was from developers and regular Democrats outside the ward.|$|E

This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> surface-hunting orcas.

5|$|In Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, {{with the}} Texas Rangers leading the game 7–5, and leading the series by 3 games to 2, Freese came to bat {{in the bottom}} of the ninth with two out and two men on base. With a count of one ball and two strikes, Freese hit a two-run triple off Neftalí Feliz just out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> Nelson Cruz to tie the game and send it to extra innings. In the 11th inning, again with two strikes, Freese hit a game-winning lead-off, walk-off, solo home-run to deep center field (420feet), to send the World Series to its first Game 7 since 2002. Freese joined Jim Edmonds, the man he was traded for, as the only players in Cardinals history to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run in the postseason. He joined Aaron Boone (2003), David Ortiz (2004) and Hall of Famers Carlton Fisk (1975) and Kirby Puckett (1991) as the only players to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run when their team was facing postseason elimination.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species {{spend more time on}} the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|E
5|$|The French {{would use}} the lessons learned at Muong Khoua {{and those of the}} 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and {{strangulation}} there. The importance of an air bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, their abilities to isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E

25|$|Rousseau {{writes that}} the theatre, at first glance, {{is a form of}} amusement. Amusements are {{acceptable}} in moderation, when they are necessary, but they become a burden if they consume the minds of men enough to waste their time. The principle of the theatre is to please, it is not, Rousseau argues, functional because the characters are always distant from man. If the play is a comedy, for example, the content is undermined, and if it is tragic, the heroic ideals are exaggerated and placed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> man. Even if the play happens to portray moral ideals well, the awareness of the audience that it is a fiction does not do the ideas justice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Buffy the Vampire Slayer drew a large {{mainstream}} audience into fandom; greater demand allowed (even obliged, {{for the sake}} of time management) Buffy actors to charge much higher appearance fees than the Star Trek actors had. This pushed appearances out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> some volunteer non-profit fan groups towards commercial event promoters. At the same time, a market for celebrity autographs emerged on eBay, which created a new source of income for actors, who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously been doing for free. This became significant enough that lesser-known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee, simply to be allowed to sell their own autographs (commonly on publicity photos). Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters, though a number of fan-run conventions still exist, such as Toronto Trek and Shore Leave.|$|E
