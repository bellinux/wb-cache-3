5|$|Stamata Revithi {{was born}} in Syros in 1866. Records of her life from 1896 show that {{she was living in}} poverty in Piraeus in 1896. At that point she had given birth to two children, a son who died in 1895, aged seven, and another child who was {{seventeen}} months old {{by the time of the}} 1896 Olympics.

5|$|After {{the death}} of her parents in 1890, Bonstelle went to New York City, and in 1891 she joined the company of Fanny Janauschek, with whom she toured for a season. In 1892 she worked as an {{understudy}} and chorus member in Augustin Daly's company, but the season left her exhausted. However, in 1893 she married the actor Alexander Hamilton Stuart, who was twenty years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> and Janauschek's leading man. Happily married, together they worked in Philadelphia's Forepaugh Stock Company for two years, before moving to Rochester, where Bonstelle played various roles and became an established leading lady.

5|$|Born in Moss Side, Manchester to {{politically}} active parents, Pankhurst was introduced {{at the age}} of 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her,</b> known for supporting women's rights to vote; they had five children over the next ten years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women. When that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her gender. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses.|$|E

60|$|She {{pointed to}} Isobel, who was {{leaning back in}} her chair {{laughing}} heartily into the face of a young man who was bending over her. By chance she looked just then <b>older</b> even <b>than</b> <b>her</b> years, and Arthur's glum figure, too, in the background was suggestive.|$|R
5|$|On her eighteenth birthday, Bella Swan {{wakes up}} from a dream, in which she sees herself as an old woman. She expresses her distaste about growing <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend Edward Cullen, a human with vampire powers, who stopped aging {{physically}} at seventeen. Despite her lack of enthusiasm, Edward's adoptive family host Bella a birthday party. While unwrapping a gift, Bella receives a paper cut. Edward's brother, Jasper, becomes overwhelmed by the scent of Bella's blood, and attempts to attack her. Realizing the danger {{that he and his}} family pose to Bella, Edward ends their relationship, and the Cullens leave Forks, Washington.|$|E
5|$|The agents later see Walter Chaco, Paula's {{grandfather}} and the plant's owner, who while shaken over Paula's death gives the agents permission {{to perform an}} autopsy. The agents find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears no <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When the agents nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn that the driver also suffered from the disease. Noticing the plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens to dredge it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, the agents notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he will talk to Chaco.|$|E
5|$|Tomoya meets {{a genius}} girl named Kotomi Ichinose, {{one day in}} the school library. She is ranked in the top 10 {{throughout}} the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a very quiet girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading, even if they make loud disturbances around her. Clannad fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo can be aggressive is a very strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is very athletic.

50|$|Young was a {{real estate}} {{developer}} in Long Beach, California and was married to Jessie Fay (Cooke) Young (1877-1955), a piano player and singer whom he married in 1902.

50|$|A {{young girl}} who is <b>older</b> <b>than</b> she appears. <b>Her</b> true nature is unknown. Shinichi often has visions of her, but she isn't seen around the mansion. Even in those visions though, Arisa seems childish and playful.|$|R
50|$|Strait-laced Magistrate Brutus Poskett (Will Hay) is {{concerned}} that his wife (Iris Hoey) may be <b>older</b> <b>than</b> he believes <b>her</b> to be, especially as his young stepson (John Mills) seems very precocious for an apparently fifteen-year-old boy.|$|R
5|$|These films {{took many}} liberties {{from the book}} series casting-wise. Red-haired Granville's {{portrayal}} of the then-blonde Nancy was portrayed to be ditzy, absent-minded, and more meddling that that of the ongoing book series. While the Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as older, feeble, {{and more of a}} hands-off parent, John Litel's Carson was young and handsome, much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college who lives in a different town, he was now her next-door neighbor, who was a year <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> and their romance was very ambiguous and tumultuous. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, a minor character in the books who was Hannah's teenage niece. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, a new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray the stereotypical bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the Torchy Blane series. Nancy's friends Bess and George did not appear in the film series, and never mentioned or referred to.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, eight-year-old Victoria becomes {{upset that}} her mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) has married Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), even after he saves her from {{drowning}} in a swimming pool.

50|$|Considering {{his firm}} social {{improvement}} and advancement, {{it might be}} expected that Muscat would be particularly susceptible to social mores and customs. However, this was not so. When it came to tying the knot, Muscat chose to flouted convention completely. In fact, {{at the age of}} twenty-eight, in 1763, he married a widow with three children who was much <b>older</b> <b>than</b> him. <b>Her</b> name was Maria Salamone.|$|R

25|$|In 1932, Stieglitz {{mounted a}} forty-year {{retrospective}} of 127 {{of his works}} at The Place. He included all of his most famous photographs, but he also purposely chose to include recent photos of O'Keeffe, who, because of her years in the Southwest sun, looked <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> forty-five years, next to portraits of his young lover Norman. It {{was one of the}} few times he acted spitefully to O'Keeffe in public, and it might have been as a result of their increasingly intense arguments in private about his control over her art.|$|E
25|$|However, Maria Luisa refused this {{compromise}} {{for more}} than two years. During this time, she lived with her children in a Roman palace. Family relationships became strained: her parents and her brother Ferdinand VII wanted to marry Maria Luisa's daughter, Maria Luisa Carlota, then fourteen years old, to Francisco de Paula, Maria Luisa's youngest brother. She opposed this plan, considering her brother (eight years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> young daughter) to be too reckless. She also rejected a proposed plan for her own son to marry Maria Cristina of Naples, a daughter of her sister Maria Isabel.|$|E

60|$|Rachel had had {{the palm}} of cleverness conceded to her ever since she could recollect, when she read better at three years <b>old</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> sister at five, and ever after, through the days of education, had enjoyed, and excelled in, the studies that were a toil to Grace. Subsequently, while Grace had {{contented}} herself with the ordinary course of unambitious feminine life, Rachel had thrown herself into the process of self-education with all her natural energy, and carried on her favourite studies by every means within her reach, until she considerably surpassed in acquirements and reflection all the persons with whom she came in frequent contact. It was a homely neighbourhood, a society well born, but of circumscribed interests and habits, and little connected with the great progressive world, where, however, Rachel's sympathies all lay, necessarily fed, however, by periodical literature, instead of by conversation or commerce with living minds.|$|R
5000|$|Ernst Holland, 18 years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> Hella, married <b>her</b> in 1908. They {{settled in}} Hattingen, {{a small town}} near Essen.

25|$|As tempting {{as it may}} be to thus view St. Margaret as a {{granddaughter of}} another famous saint, Stephen of Hungary, this popular {{solution}} fails to explain why Stephen's death triggered a dynastic crisis in Hungary, or at least that Agatha's family failed {{to play a role in}} that strife. If St. Stephen and Giselle were indeed Agatha's parents, her offspring would have had a strong claim to the Hungarian crown. Actually, there is no indication in Hungarian sources that any of Stephen's children outlived him. Likewise, all of the solutions involving Henry II would seem to make Agatha much <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> husband, and prohibitively old at the time of the birth of her last child, Edgar.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, {{the teenage}} Shamshad {{came in contact}} with Ganpat Lal Batto, a Hindu law student who lived in the same {{neighbourhood}} and who was several years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her.</b> In those days, marriages were performed while the bride and groom were very young, and Shamshad's parents were already looking out for a suitable alliance for her. Their efforts {{were on the verge of}} bearing fruit in 1934 when Ganpat Lal Batto and Shamshad made the decision to marry each other. In 1934, despite strenuous opposition from both their families due to religious differences, 15-year-old Shamshad got married to Ganpat Lal Batto. The couple were blessed with only a single child, a daughter named Usha, who in due course married a Hindu gentleman, Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Ratra, an officer in the Indian Army.|$|E
25|$|After her divorce, Maria Pavlovna {{continued}} to work in Paris, but she moved to Boulogne, the south west suburb of Paris, where many Russians had taken residence. She began an affair with the famous fashion designer Jean Patou, who was ten years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> and with a large fortune. They lived with great luxury appearing together in Parisian society events and spending time in Biarritz, Deauville and on the French Riviera. Rumors of a possible marriage between them spread in 1925, but Patou, a consummated bachelor, was reluctant to change his lifestyle. In 1926, Kitmirs business began to decline. In 1928, as embroidery began {{to be out of}} fashion, Maria Pavlovva sold her workshop. Having suffered a defeat, but not surrendering, the grand duchess moved to London in the spring 1928 where she started selling her own perfume, Prince Igor, {{following in the footsteps of}} Chanel No. 5 and Patou's perfume Joy. Failings in advertising and distribution made that Prince Igor was not a success. Undeterred, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna emigrated to the United States hoping for a new start. On 8 December 1928, she set sail for America from Le Havre.|$|E
