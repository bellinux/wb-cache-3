5|$|Although {{some parts}} of Waterfall Gully were {{transferred}} from the District Council of East Torrens (now the Adelaide Hills Council) to the City of Burnside in 1856 when the suburb's current boundaries were established, {{the government of the}} day chose to retain control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> portion of Waterfall Gully. Thus it was not until 1884 that the remaining land was transferred to the control of the Burnside Council, eventuating largely through the efforts of Samuel Davenport and G. F. Cleland.|$|E
5|$|An aspect weaver is a metaprogramming utility for aspect-oriented {{languages}} {{designed to}} take instructions specified by aspects (isolated representations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> concepts in a program) and generate the final implementation code.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> part of the country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|For a while, he was {{uncertain}} {{whether he would}} attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> portion of the accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E

The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Rabearivelo {{struggled}} {{throughout his}} life to reconcile his identity as Malagasy with his aspiration toward French assimilation and connection with the greater universal human experience. He has been depicted as a martyr figure {{as a result of}} his suicide following the refusal of French authorities to grant him permission to go to France. He has been the subject <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> number of books and conferences; on the fiftieth anniversary of his death, his work was commemorated at events organized in North America, Europe and Africa, including a week-long conference at the University of Antananarivo. Recent scholarship has questioned Rabearivelo's elevation as a colonial martyr, arguing that the poet was by and large an assimilationist who did not view himself as African.|$|E
5|$|The Childers Incident of 2 January 1793 {{marked the}} opening shots between British and French forces during the French Revolutionary Wars, {{the first phase}} of a 23-year-long war between the two countries. Following the French Revolution of 1789, {{diplomatic}} relations between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the French Republic had steadily deteriorated and France was in political and social turmoil. One of the strongest hotbeds of republican activity was the principal Atlantic naval base of the French Navy at Brest in Brittany, the scene <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> mutiny in 1790.|$|E

5|$|The Christian {{conversion}} of the Merina royal court in 1869 spurred the arrival of Merina missionaries in Sihanaka country and the conversion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> portion of the population. Following the French capture of the Merina capital in 1895, Christianity was largely abandoned in Sihanaka and traditional religious beliefs regained preeminence; {{at least one major}} historic church in the area was burned. French Catholic missionaries arrived in the area around 1900 and gradually began converting members of local communities. This was soon followed by a renewed {{effort on the part of}} Protestant missionaries, leading to further conversions. Today, traditional beliefs remain strong among the Sihanaka, although a growing number practice orthodox Christianity or a syncretic form that incorporates aspects of traditional respect for ancestors and their norms.|$|E
5|$|The Partisan {{attack on}} the camp and their liberation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> number of {{children}} brought the Ustaše to the realisation that this and similar camps for children could not be maintained. In late October 1942, 500 of the remaining children were dispersed to families in the surrounding villages by the Catholic aid group, Caritas. A total of 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages. Of the remaining children, 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška. The Jastrebarsko camp was then dismantled.|$|E

5|$|The {{short story}} {{was written for}} The Graphics Christmas number of 1870, and the play was first {{produced}} at the Court Theatre on 2 April 1871. It originally included six songs, but three were eventually cut, and some productions dispensed with the music entirely. While the lyrics survive, the music was never published and is lost. Reviews of the play were mostly positive, though it was criticised for the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> plot or superstructure to support its comic premise. Nonetheless, reviewers found it enjoyable, {{and it was a}} modest success, running for 91performances and enjoying revivals into {{the early part of the}} 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{varieties}} of short-period comet: Jupiter-family comets (those with semi-major axes of less than 5AU) and Halley-family comets. Halley-family comets, named for their prototype, Halley's Comet, are unusual in that although they are short-period comets, it is hypothesized that their ultimate origin lies in the Oort cloud, not in the scattered disc. Based on their orbits, it is suggested they were long-period comets that were captured by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System. This process may have also created the present orbits <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> fraction of the Jupiter-family comets, although the majority of such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc.|$|E
