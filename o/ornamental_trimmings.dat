2500|$|A better aid to dating is {{the quality}} of the clay. Over time their {{consistency}} became coarser, looser, more granular, and also lighter. The <b>ornamental</b> <b>trimmings</b> of the tiles are also useful: because they were the same for whole series of motifs, so one can reconstruct their relationships in the workshops and suggest contemporaneity. Very common motifs like the Ionian cymatium and palmettes are of only limited use, because these were used by a wide variety of workshops, even at the same time. Finally, sixe comparisons can also help with dating. Moulds were not only made from the original punch, but also often from tiles themselves. This leads to a natural [...] "shrinkage" [...] of the new tiles' dimensions. Because the moulds were sometimes reused for long periods of time, there are sometimes noticeable changes {{in the size of the}} tiles. For the motif depicting the Curetes performing a weapon dance around the baby Zeus, the moulds can be traced over a period of 170 years. In the process, the tiles lost about 40% of their size as a result of the repeated reuse of completed tiles as moulds. Therefore, in tiles which share a motif, the smaller can be identified as the younger. The motif also lost clarity through repeated remoulding.|$|E
