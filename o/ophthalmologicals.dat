30|$|As {{a second}} factor {{we found that}} {{patients}} with perceptional disorders, visual and balance impairment had the highest risk of experiencing a fall, which is in accordance with a study about recurrent fallers and their visit to an emergency department after a fall (Askari et al. 2013). Besides known FRIDS (analgetics, anti-Parkinson drugs, antipsychotics and antidepressants, drugs for acid-related disorders), nasal preparations and <b>ophthalmologicals</b> {{were significantly associated with}} a visit in the emergency department (Askari et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Background: cross-national {{comparisons}} {{can be used}} {{to explore}} therapeutic areas and identify potential medication issues. Methods: we used cross-sectional pharmacy supply data to explore medication use for nursing home residents in Australia (AU n = 26 homes, 1, 560 residents) and the Netherlands (NL n = 6 homes, 2, 037 residents). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the sex and aged adjusted odds ratios (OR) and associated 95 % confidence intervals with a flexible Bonferroni-Holm procedure used to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing. Results: total use of antipsychotics (AU: 37. 7 %, NL: 40. 3 %; OR 0. 91 (0. 79 - 1. 04, P = 0. 16) and antibacterials (66. 8 % AU, 62. 4 % NL, OR 1. 08 (0. 93 - 1. 24, P = 0. 31) was similar, but choice of individual agents differed between the two countries. Differences were observed in the use of antithrombotics (46. 7 % AU, 64. 7 % NL, OR 0. 48 (0. 42 - 0. 56, P > 0. 01), <b>ophthalmologicals</b> (44. 3 % AU, 22. 1 % NL, OR 2. 80 (2. 42 - 3. 24, P < 0. 001), laxatives (77. 1 % AU, 65. 8 % NL, OR 1. 65 (1. 41 - 1. 92, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: while the general prevalence of medication use in nursing home residents was similar across the two countries, distinct differences existed in the choice of agent among therapeutic groups. Comparing use between countries identified a number of potential medication related problem areas that need further exploration...|$|E

40|$|Polypharmacy, and {{specifically}} {{the use of}} multiple fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRID), have been associated with increased risk of falling in older age. However, it is not yet clear whether the known set of FRIDs can be extrapolated to recurrent fallers, since they form a distinct group of more vulnerable older persons with different characteristics. We aim to investigate which classes of medications are associated with recurrent falls in elderly patients visiting the Emergency Department (ED) after a fall. This study had a cross-sectional design and was conducted in the ED of an academic medical center. Patients who sustained a fall, 65 years or older, and who visited the ED between 2004 and 2010 were invited to fill in a validated fall questionnaire designed to assess patient and fall characteristics (CAREFALL Triage Instrument [CTI]). We translated self-reported medications to anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) codes (at the second level). Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association between medication classes and the outcome parameter (recurrent fall). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations after adjustment to potential confounders. In total 2, 258 patients participated in our study, of whom 39 % (873) had sustained two or more falls within the previous year. After adjustment for the potential confounders, drugs for acid-related disorders (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1. 29; 95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 60), analgesics (aOR 1. 22; 95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 41), anti-Parkinson drugs (aOR 1. 59; 95 % CI 1. 02 – 2. 46), nasal preparations (aOR 1. 49; 95 % CI 1. 07 – 2. 08), <b>ophthalmologicals</b> (aOR 1. 51; 95 % CI 1. 10 – 2. 09); antipsychotics (aOR 2. 21; 95 % CI 1. 08 – 4. 52), and antidepressants (aOR 1. 64; 95 % CI 1. 13 – 2. 37) remained statistically significantly associated with an ED visit due to a recurrent fall. Known FRIDs, such as psychotropic drugs, also increase the risk of recurrent falls. However, we found four relatively new classes that showed significant association with recurrent falls. In part, these classes may act as markers of frailty and comorbidity, or they may reflect differences in the risk factors affecting the older, frailer population that tends to sustain recurrent falls. Further investigation is needed to elucidate causes and ways to prevent recurrent fall...|$|E
