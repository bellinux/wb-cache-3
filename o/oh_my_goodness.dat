2500|$|The {{change in}} {{wardrobe}} {{was a factor}} Hendrickson especially needed to become accustomed to. [...] "On my first day, Maggie was wearing a miniskirt," [...] she said. [...] "In one of the scenes, Bianca fainted to the floor, {{and we had to}} do a few takes. The one that they [...] was when I went to catch her and bent over, forgetting that I was wearing a miniskirt. When I realized, I turned to everyone and was like, ' <b>Oh,</b> <b>my</b> <b>goodness!</b> I flashed the entire set. Sorry, guys. I'm not used to wearing miniskirts on the show [...] I'm used to wearing baggy pants!.'" [...] Though the change in wardrobe was a different feel, Hendrickson welcomed the new look. [...] "I used to get a little frustrated with what I wore as Frankie; I was sick of looking like a rugrat," [...] she stated. [...] "But now, I really like my wardrobe. I'm excited that Maggie wears skirts all the time!" ...|$|E

That accounts for his reasoning in a circle, and explains {{why there is}} neither beginning nor end to him, nor to anything he says. We really {{do not believe the}} vagabond can write a word that hasn't an O in it. Wonder if this O-ing is a habit of his? By-the-by, he came away from Down-East in a great hurry. Wonder if he O's as much there as he does here? [...] "O! it is pitiful."' ...|$|R

6000|$|As if awaked by the stir, Hannah {{started out}} of her sleep, hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then, {{throwing}} her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, [...] "The fever's turned, she's sleepin' nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes easy.

Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen. Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box announcing he is back. Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee." [...] Suzyn eventually confronted the duo in a long expletive-laced tirade, in which she expressed her obvious embarrassment of the situation. After the conversation, Mike and Chris vowed never to play the clip again, only to play it repeatedly {{later on in the}} evening. The clip is also played to mocking effect on Boston sports radio WEEI and for comedy on Boomer and Carton in the Morning, The Opie & Anthony Show, The Howard Stern Show, The Jim Rome Show, and ESPN Radio's The Herd with Colin Cowherd and The Dan Le Batard Show.|$|R

6000|$|He {{said these}} things vaguely, almost dryly, {{but with an}} air of final conviction, as after much sober reflection. He sat down, but Adeline would not let him be. [...] "Well, then, we'll help you to think out some way of getting back, after we're all there together. Go; it'll soon begin to be light, and I'm afraid somebody'll see you, and stop you!

I have a hundred thousand faults, and you arc blinded by your love and cannot see them. But then some day the scales will fall from your eyes, and you will perceive the whole hundred thousand at once. Oh, what a reaction there will be! You will see me as I am, frivolous, wilful, idle, petulant, and altogether horrid. But I do love you, Frank, with all my heart, and soul, and mind, and strength, and you'll count that on the other side, won't you? Now I am so glad I have said all this, because it is best that you should know what you should expect. It will be nice for you to look back and to say, 'She gave me fair warning, and she is no worse than she said.' O Frank, think of the 30th.|$|E
