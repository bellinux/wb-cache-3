40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>dumping</b> and {{landfilling}} are {{the prevalent}} {{solid waste disposal}} practices in Thailand. Surveys on the dis-posal sites revealed the presence of 95 landfills and 330 <b>open</b> <b>dumps.</b> Methane emission potential at these sites was estimated by three methods. Results of the Intergov-ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method, Landfill Gas Emission model (LandGEM), and closed flux chamber technique were compared. The methane emis-sion potential of 366 Gg/yr using the IPCC method was higher than the estimations of the LandGEM and closed flux chamber method of 115 Gg/yr and 103 Gg/yr, respec-tively. An understanding of the methane emission poten-tial initiated the analysis of upgrading the <b>open</b> <b>dumps</b> into landfills, adding landfills to meet the future needs and utilization of landfill gases. Upgrading the <b>open</b> <b>dumps</b> to landfills increased the methane emission rates and their utilization potential.

40|$|The North American {{approach}} to waste management {{has evolved over}} the years from “disposal in <b>open</b> <b>dumps</b> ” to “integrated waste management”. Considering that a solid waste disposal facility is central to waste management in North America, {{over the last couple}} of decades, considerable efforts have been directed at improving waste disposal practices. But, most of these efforts are reactive, stop-gap measures. Recently, it appears the emphasis has changed, from being reactive to being proactive. Holistic approaches are being promoted with waste considered a resource rather than a liability. The primary emphasis is on reducing the environmental and human health risks associated with waste to acceptable levels rather than trying to achieve zero risk at any cost. This paper details some of the new approaches being promoted in North America including bioreactor and biocell approaches of waste disposal and the use of methanotrophy to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from landfills.

The areas near <b>open</b> <b>dumps</b> or landfills have a greater possibility of groundwater contamination because of the potential pollution source of leachate (Saarela 2003).

40|$|Abstract The {{increasing}} {{municipal solid}} waste (MSW) generation along with the high fraction of organic waste and a common disposal of <b>open</b> <b>dumping</b> is the current scenario in many areas in Thailand. As a response to this problem, the country’s Pollution Control Department (PCD) aims to reduce the MSW generation rate to less than 1 kg/capita/day, increase the collection efficiency, and improve the recovery of recyclables. For many years, more than 60 % of the solid waste disposal system in Thailand {{has been carried out}} by <b>open</b> <b>dumping.</b> According to the survey conducted by this study, in 2004 there were 425 disposal sites (95 landfills; 330 <b>open</b> <b>dumps)</b> in Thailand and an estimated methane emission of 115. 4 Gg/year was generated based on this practice. It has been estimated that the anticipated methane emission in Thailand will rise from 115. 4 Gg/year to 118. 5 Gg/year if the largest open dumpsites in provinces with no existing landfill are upgraded to sanitary landfill; and it will increase to 193. 5 Gg/year if the existing sanitary landfill is upgraded to integrated waste management facilities. Moreover, Bangkok metropolitan have the highest methane emission (54. 83 Gg/year) among all the regions in Thailand. The methane emission forecast of 339 Gg/year by 2020 (based on LandGEM methodology) provides a stimulus to create a comprehensive plan to capture and utilize methane as an energy source...|$|R
40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{is one of}} the major {{environmental}} problems in Jordan. The World Bank visibility study (2004) showed that the rate of production of solid waste in Jordan was estimated annually of about 1. 46 million ton, and is expected to reach 2. 5 million ton by the year 2015 with a generation of 0. 9 /kg/capita/day. This solid waste volume is still increasing at high rates due to the rapid increase of populations and change in living standards and the consumption patterns. The majorities of landfills in Jordan are practicing <b>open</b> <b>dumping</b> and thus cause various environmental problems such as health hazards, surface water and ground water contamination, odors, etc. Sanitary landfills offer a viable option for the Common Service Councils (CSCs) which are responsible for operation and management of disposal sites in the country, to deal with the environmental hazards caused by <b>open</b> <b>dumps</b> practice within its financial constraints. If sanitary landfills are conducted properly, the negative environmental impacts can be kept to a minimum level. This paper will discuss the environmental, economic and social opportunities of moving <b>open</b> <b>dumps</b> toward sanitary landfills such a transfer is necessary and it could play important roles in tackling the pressing solid waste problems and a forward step for an approach for integrated solid waste management in the country...|$|R
30|$|Apart from non-point sources, {{some other}} point sources also {{contribute}} to groundwater NO 3 −pollution. Wakida and Lerner (2005) reviewed the non-agriculture sources of groundwater nitrate and suggested that waste disposal network, animal wastes including livestock and human excreta, industry, river–aquifer interactions, house building, etc. are some important factors indirectly enriching nitrate in groundwater. It has been observed that <b>open</b> <b>dumping</b> (in heaps) is the common practice to dispose garbage in the two areas. Due to weathering and <b>open</b> <b>dumping,</b> {{a considerable amount of}} soluble forms of nitrogen could be leached into deep soil layers especially during the wet months of the year.
