5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E

25|$|The BBC {{natural history}} unit's links to Bristol {{date back to}} the 1940s, when Desmond Hawkins, then a young producer, joined the West Region staff.

25|$|Oonops pulcher {{is a tiny}} spider (males about 1½mm, females 2mm). Its six {{eyes are}} located closely together, giving the {{impression}} of only one eye. The spider is of a bleak light red, with a reddish to whitish abdomen, and found <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> in bird nests, under stones and under tree bark, also in webs of Amaurobius and Coelotes (two spider genera from the Amaurobiidae family). Only two eggs are laid into a flat eggsac.|$|E
25|$|The {{choir and}} outdoor dress of the monks is of black woollen material, with long, wide sleeves, {{a black leather}} {{cincture}} and a long pointed capuche reaching to the cincture. The indoor dress consists of a black habit with capuche and cincture. In many Augustinian houses white is used in Summer and also worn in public, usually in places {{where there were no}} Dominicans. Shoes and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> (prior to Vatican II) a black hat or biretta completed the habit.|$|E

25|$|Bonsai are {{sometimes}} marketed or promoted as house plants, {{but few of}} the traditional bonsai species can thrive or even survive inside a typical house. Most bonsai are located <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors.</b> The best guideline to identifying a suitable growing environment for a bonsai is its native hardiness. If the bonsai grower can closely replicate the full year's temperatures, relative humidity, and sunlight, the bonsai should do well. In practice, this means that trees from a hardiness zone closely matching the grower's location will generally be the easiest to grow, and others will require more work or will not be viable at all.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Elmer, New Jersey to Samuel Preston Foster, Editor of the Elmer Times and Fannie Bateman a {{housewife}} with a green thumb and artistic leanings. He grew up exploring the woods around his New Jersey home {{under the guidance of}} his mother. With her inspiration, Mulford grew up making his own small gardens with the wild plants that he had gathered. He eventually started collecting snakes, lizards and other reptiles whenever he could. He attended school and graduated in 1905 as salutatorian from Elmer High School spending his free time <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E

25|$|Winter sports only play a minor role in British {{sporting}} {{life because}} the winters are not cold {{enough for them}} to be practised <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> very much. Great Britain is not a leading nation at the Winter Olympics, but has had a few successes in sports such as figure skating, curling and bob skeleton. A number of athletes represented Great Britain in the freestyle skiing discipline when it debuted at the 2014 Winter Olympics. Snowboarder Jenny Jones made history at those Games as the first British competitor to win a medal in an event on snow when she took a bronze in the slopestyle competition.|$|E
25|$|Rascher {{was also}} tasked with {{discovering}} how long German airmen {{would be able}} to survive if shot down above freezing water. His victims were forced to remain <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> naked in freezing weather for up to 14 hours, or kept in a tank of icewater for 3 hours, their pulse and internal temperature measured through a series of electrodes. Warming of the victim was then attempted by different methods, most usually and successfully by immersion in very hot water, and also less conventional methods such as placing the subject in bed with women who would try to sexually stimulate him, a method suggested by Himmler.|$|E
25|$|Although Sandford {{accepted}} imprisonment as {{the will}} of God, he had difficulty at first bending to prison regulations. But with sleep, proper nourishment, and enforced exercise, his health gradually improved. He even insisted that Shiloh residents drop whatever they were doing at 11:30 and 4:00 and exercise with him. He was made a gatekeeper and given a pass {{that allowed him to}} spend some time <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors.</b> He also volunteered to teach a group of prisoners how to read and write and especially enjoyed conducting a weekly Bible class that began with one student and grew to more than a hundred. Eventually Shiloh was allowed to send him a harp, and Sandford was not only able to practice, he gave at least two concerts at the prison.|$|E

25|$|According to his successor, Dr Meek, Mr M’Culloch {{had been}} in the habit of preaching <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors,</b> in the nearby gorge, because of the poor repair of the church. It was here, after sermon, that he shared the letters and written sermons he {{received}} from New England. Towards the end of January 1742, two men, Ingram More, a shoemaker, and Robert Bowman, a weaver, went through the parish, and got about 90 heads of families to sign a petition to the minister, asking that he give them a weekly lecture. Thursday evening was set for this. The first two lectures passed off as expected, and only a few persons came back to the manse for further prayer and discussion. However, on Monday 15 February, all the Fellowships in the parish turned up at the manse and spent several days praying and discussing and wondering about the great events that were being reported from England and America.|$|E

500|$|Eardwulf {{appears to}} have been an enemy of Æthelred I. He first appears in the {{historical}} record circa 790, when Symeon of Durham reports that:Eardulf was taken prisoner, and conveyed to Ripon, and there ordered by the aforesaid king [...] to be put to death without the gate of the monastery. The brethren carried his body into the church with Gregorian chanting, and placed it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> in a tent; after midnight he was found alive in the church. A letter from Alcuin to Eardwulf suggests that this fortunate recovery was seen as being miraculous.|$|E

[...] Andrew Sarris dismisses Donen as being without a personal style {{of his own and}} as being dependent upon his collaborators on his better films. Debbie Reynolds downplayed his contributions to Singin' in the Rain, stating that [...] "Stanley just operated the camera, because Stanley didn't dance." ...|$|E
500|$|Some Scientology churches (or [...] "orgs") {{adopted a}} {{land-based}} version of overboarding by making staff members stand {{against a wall}} while other Scientologists threw buckets of water at them, but the practice was largely abandoned in the 1970s. According to author Janet Reitman, Miscavige reintroduced it in the 2000s and ordered dozens of senior executives to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> {{in the middle of}} the night and assemble at the base's swimming pool or its muddy lake. They would then jump or be pushed into the water, often in freezing conditions, while fully clothed and with Miscavige watching. The Church acknowledges that overboarding took place but characterises it as part of its [...] "ecclesiastical justice" [...] system for dealing with poor performance.|$|E
500|$|In 1922, {{composer}} Dane Rudhyar, {{a friend}} of Cowell's, declared approvingly {{that the development of}} the tone cluster [...] "imperilled [...] existence" [...] of [...] "the musical unit, the note." [...] While that threat was not to be realized, clusters began to appear in the works {{of a growing number of}} composers. Already, Aaron Copland had written his Three Moods (aka Trois Esquisses; 1920–21) for piano—its name an apparent homage to a piece of Leo Ornstein's—which includes a triple-forte cluster. The most renowned composer to be directly inspired by Cowell's demonstrations of his tone cluster pieces was Béla Bartók, who requested Cowell's permission to employ the method. Bartók's First Piano Concerto, Piano Sonata, and the [...] from the <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Doors</b> suite (all 1926), his first significant works after three years in which he produced little, extensively feature tone clusters.|$|E
