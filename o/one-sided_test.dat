We study {{statistical}} {{tests with}} binary output that rarely outputs one, {{which we call}} nearly <b>one-sided</b> statistical <b>tests.</b> We provide an efficient reduction establishing improved security for the Goldreich-Levin hard-core bit against nearly <b>one-sided</b> <b>tests.</b> The analysis is extended to prove {{the security of the}} Blum-Micali pseudo-random generator combined with the Goldreich-Levin bit. Furthermore, applications where nearly <b>one-sided</b> <b>tests</b> naturally occur are discussed. This includes cryptographic constructions that replace real randomness with pseudo-randomness and where the adversary’s success easily can be verified. In particular, this applies to signature schemes that utilize a pseudo-random generator as a provider of randomness...|$|R

40|$|When {{back-testing}} the calibration {{quality of}} rating systems two-sided statistical tests can detect over- and underestimation of credit risk. Some users though, such as risk-averse investors and regulators, are primarily {{interested in the}} underestimation of risk only, and thus require <b>one-sided</b> <b>tests.</b> The established <b>one-sided</b> <b>tests</b> are multiple tests, which assess each rating class of the rating system separately and then combine the results to an overall assessment. However, these multiple tests may fail to detect underperformance of the whole rating system. Aiming to improve the overall assessment of rating systems, this paper presents a set of <b>one-sided</b> <b>tests,</b> which assess the performance of all rating classes jointly. These joint tests build on the method of Sterne [1954] for ranking possible outcomes by probability, which allows to extend back-testing to a setting of multiple rating classes. The new joint tests are compared to the most established <b>one-sided</b> multiple <b>test</b> and are further shown to outperform this benchmark in terms of power {{and size of the}} acceptance region...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present the two <b>one-sided</b> <b>test</b> (TOST) as an {{alternative}} approach to compare dissolution profiles of extended-release dosage forms.

These dissolution profiles were compared using the conventional similarity factor (f 2) and the proposed TOST as an equivalence test. TOST is a simple and alternative approach to compare dissolution profiles of extended-release dosage forms. It allows us to identify the time-point (or time-points) that did not show similarity.

40|$|We show {{a simple}} {{algorithm}} for learning families of hyperfinite graphs. This gives a simple {{proof of the}} main theorem of Newman and Sohler (STOC 2011) that every property of hyperfinite graphs is testable with a constant number of queries. For minor-free graphs, the query complexity of learning and testing is 2 (1 /ε) O(1), where ε is the proximity parameter. For minor-closed families of graphs that do not exclude trees, we give a query lower bound of 2 Ω(1 /ε). It is known due to a result of Czumaj, Shapira, and Sohler (SICOMP 2009) that all hereditary properties of hyperfinite graphs are testable with a constant number of queries. We show that <b>one-sided</b> <b>testing</b> of hereditary properties may require an arbitrarily fast growing number of queries {{as a function of}} the proximity parameter.
