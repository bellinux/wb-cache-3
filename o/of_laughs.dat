Two books based on the series have been released, both published by Scholastic Inc. in 2005: Ed, Edd n Eddy: Lots <b>of</b> <b>Laughs,</b> written by Jesse Leon McCann, and Ed, Edd n Eddy: Book of Extreme Excuses, written by Howie Dewin.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot <b>of</b> <b>laughs</b> because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons Ride {{was well}} {{received}} by fans after it opened. Seth Kubersky of Orlando Weekly described the ride as [...] "a more than worthy successor" [...] to [...] Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times described the ride as [...] "visually stunning" [...] {{and said it}} [...] "truly delivers — with loads of in-jokes and satire for serious fanatics and tons of thrills and fun for casual fans." [...] Elise Thompson of the LAist said [...] "the ride is a total blast, with plenty <b>of</b> <b>laughs</b> as well as thrills." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Mantle {{was cast}} {{opposite}} Sarah Lancashire as Jack Deakin in the comedy series Bloomin' Marvellous, written by playwright John Godber, described as [...] "a {{comedy about a}} couple who decide to start a family." [...] The series was panned by most critics, and Mantle sarcastically remarked that [...] "I've seen murderers and rapists get a better press than we did." [...] However, several critics, such as Brian Viner of The Mail on Sunday, said that Bloomin' Marvellous had [...] "charm, top-notch acting and a reasonable sprinkling <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> none of which are certainties in television comedy – especially the laughs." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its criticisms, [...] "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{received}} some positive reviews. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented on the}} episode, writing: [...] "I remember that 'Saddlesore' was much despised when it first aired, though I can’t recall if I joined that chorus as well. Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have made it look better, but I think that 'Saddlesore' offers a decent number <b>of</b> <b>laughs.</b> It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self-awareness, but it provides reasonable entertainment." [...] DVD Talk's Ian Jane described the cameo appearance by Bachman and Turner as [...] "fun".|$|E
500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{magazine}} wrote {{highly of}} the episode and called it [...] "a half hour of heartwarming comedy". She was particularly pleased with how Michael was able to overcome Oscar with pathos, and she enjoyed the episode's subplots. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic praised the episode and awarded it five stars out of five. He wrote that [...] "If my favorite thing for Jim to do is prank Dwight, my second favorite is when he backs Michael." [...] Furthermore, he wrote that [...] "While this A story was filled with plenty <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> [...] Dwight's B story was absolutely murderous [...] all gold". He also felt that the C plot was enjoyable, because [...] "Andy is great in small doses".|$|E

The South Wales Evening Post called Donna [...] "one of the programme's most popular faces" [...] and the Bristol Evening Post said she was [...] "one of the most refreshing Neighbours characters to come along for many a moon". Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said the character had become a favourite with fans. Ruth Deller, of television website Lowculture, called Donna [...] "fierce and fabulous". Robbie's co-star, Scott Major (Lucas Fitzgerald) praised her performance as Donna saying, [...] "Donna could've been played in so many ways, but I think Margot nailed it, she's always fun to work with, she's a barrel <b>of</b> <b>laughs</b> and always works hard at her stuff. She's really created Donna on her own and made Donna her own character".|$|E
500|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the episode, Praise plays a Russian grandmaster at chess. The Complete X-Files notes that the [...] "chess motif" [...] was carried on throughout the episode, most notably in the fact that The Smoking Man [...] "plays Mulder to a checkmate, using Jeffrey as a pawn." [...] Because of this, and his past actions, many perceived The Smoking Man as the true villain of the story. William B. Davis, who played The Smoking Man, however, felt that the character was the hero of the story. He noted, [...] "I used to go to conventions and try to convince everyone that I was the hero of the series and Mulder was the bad guy. [...] I got a lot <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> but it's certainly true of how one plays the character. Nobody thinks they're evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Ingela Ratledge of TV Guide favorably {{described}} the episode as {{the exact opposite}} of award show segments that reverentially pay homage to the year's departed celebrities, calling it [...] "a wonderfully tasteless farewell." [...] Sue Bergerstein, an arts and celebrity writer with Examiner.com, called [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] a [...] "new low" [...] for South Park, adding [...] "It's not only tasteless but this episode just adds to the sadness currently experienced by all the mourning relatives." [...] Newsweek writer Joshua Alston said few of the jokes in [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] were funny, and so the mocking of celebrities [...] "in the absence <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> felt tasteless and unnecessary". Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said many of the episodes seemed rehashed and predictable, especially those targeting Michael Jackson and children's beauty pageants. Sepinwall added he liked the Chipotle subplot, but commented, [...] "Overall, 'Dead Celebrities' was a misfire." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the game's negative response, GameZone said {{that even though the}} game does not feature continuous play, [...] "the action flows well once into an event". GameZone's review praised the game's audio track, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] because the comedy is straight from the television show, and the characters will [...] "bring a smile to your face". Reiner also commented positively on the soundtrack and that the game {{may not be the best}} wrestling game available, [...] "but it delivers what the cover advertises". GameSpot's Frank Provo said that [...] "wit" [...] and [...] "charm" [...] are the two most redeeming features of The Simpsons Wrestling, and in spite of the game's weak gameplay, it has [...] "plenty <b>of</b> <b>laughs</b> in store" [...] that devoted fans of The Simpsons will enjoy. The BBC's David Gibbon wrote that the end result of the track is one that will not [...] "fail to impress fans".|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Lard of the Dance" [...] aired as a teaser episode a month earlier, [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] was the {{official}} season premiere of The Simpsons tenth season. Don Aucoin of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "It is gratifying to report that, {{based on the}} season premiere, The Simpsons promises to remain the most reliable half-hour <b>of</b> <b>laughs</b> on television." [...] Similarly, David Bianculli of The New York Daily News reported that [...] "The Simpsons is one series that, year after year, remains fresh and funny and lively and surprising. Based on tonight's season premiere, that amazing streak is in no danger of ending." [...] Lauri Githens of The Buffalo News gave the episode a 5/5 rating, commenting that it shows that [...] "This cynical, bleak yet somehow still hopeful comedy is nowhere near midlife crisis with Season No. 10. It's still fall-down funny. Thank God." [...] She cited Homer's line to Marge as he and Bart leave for the Edison Museum, [...] "I'm-taking-Bart-over-state-lines-back-soon-I-have-your-wallet-bye!", as the best line of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin praised Bridges' {{performance}} in her review for The New York Times: [...] "Mr. Bridges finds a role so right {{for him that}} he seems never to have been anywhere else. Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair." [...] Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote: [...] "The result is a lot <b>of</b> <b>laughs</b> {{and a feeling of}} awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there'll be anything else like it the rest of this year." [...] In a five star review for Empire Magazine, Ian Nathan wrote: [...] "For those who delight in the Coens' divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana" [...] and [...] "In a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as [...] "weirdly engaging". In a 2010 review, Ebert gave The Big Lebowski four stars out of four and added the film to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.9 out of 10 rating, {{and said that}} Hooks' role as Jenna's mother [...] "helped the half hour, but this Jenna-centric episode still didn't blow me away." [...] He noted that the main plot had funny moments but [...] "there wasn't much else to invest in." [...] Overall, Canning reasoned that this episode {{was very much a}} stand-alone one [...] "built for some good jokes, and not exactly focused on storytelling. [...] An episode like 'Verna' can still bring a lot <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> but you can't help but feel like it's missing that extra something." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked both stories from [...] "Verna", and wrote that it was a disappointing episode, and that it was [...] "pretty weak overall." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, reported that despite Hooks' hilarious performance, the episode still felt a [...] "little bit like filler", and that there [...] "wasn't too much that was especially funny or memorable about it".|$|E
500|$|E! Online called Pete [...] "especially charming" [...] after [...] "Andy's Ancestry", {{and named}} {{him one of}} the [...] "Best Things in Pop Culture". Joseph Kratzer of WhatCulture! awarded the episode four out of five stars and called it [...] "another enjoyable episode" [...] which {{continued}} to signal [...] "the triumphant return of The Office". He explained that the success of the first episodes of the ninth season [...] "comes from a fluidity not seen in recent years, an organic component that helped make the series such a success in its second and third seasons". Ultimately, he noted that it was not [...] "the tightest plotted episode" [...] but that it was [...] "better than 90% of last season". IGN writer Cindy White awarded the episode an 8.2, designating a [...] "great" [...] episode. She applauded the fact that [...] "the show is returning to its roots" [...] as well as the fact that the actors themselves [...] "seem more invested" [...] in the series. She also called the conversation between Darryl and Jim a [...] "nice change of pace". She concluded that the plot allowed for a [...] "good source <b>of</b> <b>laughs</b> in the smartly written" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{wrote that}} the NBC/Comcast reference here [...] "wasn't exactly a well <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> but Baldwin's Donaghy kept the story entertaining enough to want to follow it." [...] He enjoyed Banks' appearance, noting that her standout moment came when Avery and Jack argued over the direction of NBC [...] "and for that brief moment Banks stole the show from Baldwin." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave it an 8 out of 10 rating. James Poniewozik of Time magazine said that the main story [...] "played more like a subplot even though it gave the episode its title". He added {{that there were some}} fine moments, and that overall Liz and Jack's plots [...] "have the potential to give the show some interesting forward movement". Los Angeles Times contributor Meredith Blake felt that Michael Sheen was [...] "underused" [...] in his role, and observed that Jack and Avery's relationship showcased here seemed [...] "remarkably convincing." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} episode's storytelling was [...] "better than it's been in recent weeks", however, was not complimentary towards Liz meeting Sheen's Wesley, as he felt that their plot fell flat.|$|E

500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started.

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} this episode [...] "was by far the funniest, laugh-out-loud, near genius episode of 30 Rock this season." [...] He wrote that [...] "there wasn't a moment wasted in the entire half hour, which not only gave us plenty <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> but it {{continued}} the ongoing storylines with fantastic pacing and ease." [...] Canning stated that [...] "the best part of this episode by far was Tracy's paranoia over The Black Crusaders" [...] and he rated the episode 9.7 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote regarding Emily Mortimer's guest appearance that [...] "she's not the first thought for most sitcoms looking to fill a vacancy. But here, she's obviously relishing (as Isabella Rossellini did) {{the chance to go}} a bit bonkers. When she lapsed out of the accent, what fun." [...] Anna Johns of AOL's TV Squad wrote that she [...] "didn't find 'Cleveland' nearly as funny as the super-sized 'Fireworks' episode two weeks ago, but it was still pretty good. The best sources of humor in this show are Kenneth the Page and Tracy Jordan, neither of which had a very prominent role this week." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The One {{with the}} Cast of Night Court" [...] has {{received}} mixed reception from television critics. Nathan Rabin [...] of The A.V.

[...] "For the more esoteric viewer, it's a milestone episode", said The Ages Farah Farouque. Cameron Adams for the Herald Sun called the episode hilarious, while The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert {{felt that it was}} flaccid and cliched. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that the episode [...] "did have its moments" [...] and that the storylines [...] "had their potential, and their share <b>of</b> <b>laughs,</b> but I can't help but feel they both could have been so much more." [...] He opined that the Kenneth and Tracy story was [...] "more up 30 Rocks style" [...] but that it was a shame that the story could not [...] "quite knock the concept out of the park." [...] Overall, Canning rated [...] "The One with the Cast of Night Court" [...] a 7.9 out of 10. Jeff Labrecque for Entertainment Weekly reported that the episode fell flat.|$|E
