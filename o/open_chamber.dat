25|$|The smoke {{detector}} has two ionization chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers {{should be the same}} as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the <b>open</b> <b>chamber,</b> some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current draw of an ionization {{smoke detector}} is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.|$|E
60|$|The western door--that {{which looked}} up the canyon, and through which we entered by our bridge of flying plank--was still entire, a handsome, {{panelled}} door, the most finished piece of carpentry in Silverado. And the two lowest bunks next to this we roughly filled with hay for that night's use. Through the opposite, or eastern- looking gable, with its open door and window, a faint, disused starshine {{came into the room}} like mist; and when we were once in bed, we lay, awaiting sleep, in a haunted, incomplete obscurity. At first the silence of the night was utter. Then a high wind began in the distance among the tree-tops, and for hours continued to grow higher. It seemed to me much such a wind as we had found on our visit; yet here in our <b>open</b> <b>chamber</b> we were fanned only by gentle and refreshing draughts, so deep was the canyon, so close our house was planted under the overhanging rock.|$|E
60|$|The scared leaves only {{flew the}} faster for all this, and a giddy chase it was; for {{they got into}} unfrequented places, {{where there was no}} outlet, and where their pursuer kept them eddying round and round at his pleasure; and they crept under the eaves of houses, and clung tightly to the sides of hay-ricks, like bats; and tore in at <b>open</b> <b>chamber</b> windows, and cowered close to hedges; and, in short, went {{anywhere}} for safety. But the oddest feat they achieved was, {{to take advantage of the}} sudden opening of Mr Pecksniff's front-door, to dash wildly into his passage; whither the wind following close upon them, and finding the back-door open, incontinently blew out the lighted candle held by Miss Pecksniff, and slammed the front-door against Mr Pecksniff who was at that moment entering, with such violence, that in the twinkling of an eye he lay on his back at the bottom of the steps. Being by this time weary of such trifling performances, the boisterous rover hurried away rejoicing, roaring over moor and meadow, hill and flat, until it got out to sea, where it met with other winds similarly disposed, and made a night of it.|$|E

50|$|Smoke detector: An {{ionization}} {{smoke detector}} includes a tiny mass of radioactive americium-241, {{which is a}} source of alpha radiation. Two ionisation chambers are placed next to each other. Both contain a small source of 241Am that gives rise to a small constant current. One is closed and serves for comparison, the other is open to ambient air; it has a gridded electrode. When smoke enters the <b>open</b> <b>chamber,</b> the current is disrupted as the smoke particles attach to the charged ions and restore them to a neutral electrical state. This reduces the current in the <b>open</b> <b>chamber.</b> When the current drops below a certain threshold, the alarm is triggered.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{operation}} of the PDE {{is similar to that}} of the pulse jet engine. In the pulse jet, air is mixed with fuel to create a flammable mixture that is then ignited in an <b>open</b> <b>chamber.</b> The resulting combustion greatly increases the pressure of the mixture to approximately 100 atmospheres (10 MPa), which then expands through a nozzle for thrust.|$|E
40|$|<b>Open</b> Top <b>Chamber</b> (OTC) and Free Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) are {{currently}} the prevailing approaches to study plant responses to elevated carbon dioxide. Method-inherent characteristics of either method distinctively influence results. Advantages {{and disadvantages of}} both methods are reviewed here, leading {{to the conclusion that}} <b>Open</b> Top <b>Chambers</b> seem to be more suitable for investigating the physiological responses of single trees to high levels of carbon dioxide, while Free Air CO 2 Enrichment systems are more useful for studying the effects of elevated carbon dioxide on whole forest ecosystems since they have a large diameter, thus allowing to work with larger trees. Free Air CO 2 Enrichment systems also provide a natural microclimate, thus leading to ecologically more meaningful results. Methods involving Screen-Aided CO 2 Control (SACC) are proposed as a compromise eliminating disadvantages and combining advantages of both the <b>Open</b> Top <b>Chamber</b> and the Free Air CO 2 Enrichment methods. Considering the wide variety of experiments under a range of additional environmental factors it is difficult to identify a typical bias that may be inherent in the data generated by the <b>Open</b> Top <b>Chamber</b> and the Free Air CO 2 Enrichment. Meta analysis of large number of past studies revealed that <b>Open</b> Top <b>Chamber</b> experiments produce a stronger growth enhancing effect of carbon dioxide than Free Air CO 2 Enrichment experiments.

50|$|The Dardick {{firearms}} {{were basically}} revolvers whose unique <b>open</b> <b>chambers</b> could be reloaded from a magazine. The operating principle used {{was the same}} as a double-action revolver, with a long trigger pull serving to rotate the cylinder, cock, and release the hammer.

50|$|All goniatites possessed an {{external}} shell, which is divided internally into chambers filled with gas giving it Buoyancy {{during the life}} of the animal. An <b>open</b> <b>chamber</b> {{at the front of the}} shell provided living space for the goniatitid animal, with access to open water through an aperture. The general morphology and habit of goniatites was probably similar to that of their later relatives the ammonites, being free swimming and possessing a head with two well developed eyes and arms (or tentacles).|$|E
50|$|Unlike a {{traditional}} firearms cartridge, whose case is roughly cylindrical, the <b>open</b> <b>chamber</b> requires the cartridge to be otherwise. Since the cartridge contacts the frame upon firing, {{one side of}} the cartridge must match the curvature of the cylinder's exterior, while {{the other side of the}} cartridge must match the half-chamber of the cylinder. Together, the cylinder and frame form the chamber, and the cartridge must not only fit in this space, but also must seal it upon firing, and not deform to prevent cylinder rotation.|$|E

5000|$|The 335 series engines {{used one}} of two {{different}} cylinder heads. The 4V (four venturi) head was used on engines equipped with a four-barrel carburetor while the 2V (two venturi) head was used with the engines equipped with two-barrel carburetors. The 4V heads had larger ports and valves than the 2V, but the 2V heads still had ports and valves that were significantly larger than Windsor engines. [...] The 4V head's large ports and valves were designed to promote better breathing at high rpm, while the smaller 2V ports {{have proven to be}} better for street use. [...] The cylinder heads used either an open, almost shallow hemispherical combustion chamber or a closed [...] "quench" [...] type combustion chamber. The closed chamber heads enclose the valves more closely, reducing the combustion chamber volume, but both combustion chamber designs have the same thermal efficiency and resistance to detonation. The closed combustion chamber promotes a better swirling action of the incoming air fuel mixture which provides a low-rpm torque advantage over the <b>open</b> <b>chamber.</b> However, the <b>open</b> <b>chamber</b> cylinder heads exhibit better emissions characteristics. The other significant advantage to the closed chamber heads is that less machining is required to obtain high compression ratios.|$|E
50|$|By convention, {{until the}} mid 19th-century, a single large <b>open</b> <b>chamber</b> (or 'hall') formed an {{integral}} part of the building housing the council. The hall may be used for council meetings and other significant events. This large chamber, the 'town hall', (and its later variant 'city hall') has become synonymous with the whole building, and with the administrative body housed in it. The terms 'council chambers', 'municipal building' or variants may be used locally in preference to 'town hall' if no such large hall is present within the building.|$|E
5000|$|In the Early Medieval period, the hall, {{a single}} large <b>open</b> <b>chamber,</b> was the main, and {{sometimes}} only {{room of the}} home of a feudal lord.

Activities in the hall played an essential role in the functioning of the feudal manor, the administrative unit of society.

50|$|Why {{all this}} {{complexity}} {{to produce a}} new version of an engine, the turboprop, whose primary advantage was simplicity?

The Otto cycle or Diesel cycle used in piston engines has a much lower specific fuel consumption than the Brayton cycle of a traditional gas turbine engines at low speed.
