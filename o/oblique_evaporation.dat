This is an undisclosed effect related to the Arsenic flux in the Molecular Beam Epitaxy growth of InAs Quantum Dots on GaAs(001). This effect cannot be explained by a shadowing effect, due to the gentle slopes of the mounds (1 °- 3 °), and reveals instead that As plays a fundamental role at these growth conditions. We have developed a kinetic model which takes into account the coupling between cations and anions, and found that the very small surface gradient in the anion flux, due to the <b>oblique</b> <b>evaporation</b> on the mounded surface, is responsible for a massive drain of cations toward the surface anion-rich areas, thus generating the selective growth of Quantum Dots...|$|E

It was accomplished by coating {{one side of the}} template by a thin layer of palladium in order to activate the electroless deposition within the nanopores from bottom up. However, prior to electroless deposition process, the template was pretreated with a suitable wetting agent in order to facilitate the penetration of the plating solution through the pores.

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{dependence of}} the photoluminescence (PL) decay kinetics at room temperature have been studied in porous nc-Si-SiOx nanostructures. Investigated samples were obtained by <b>oblique</b> <b>evaporation</b> of SiO with following annealing at 975 C in vacuum and treating in the HF vapor at 50 C. PL decay in these structures described by a stretched exponential and the average lifetime of the PL decrease exponentially with increasing energy of photons.

Dispersion parameter do not depend on emission energy and tends to 1 with increasing porosity, {{which is consistent with}} the model of noninteracting nc-Si. It was established, that the absorption cross section σ of the nc-Si particles increase with decreasing of nc-Si dimensions and increasing of emission energy.

40|$|Ultra-thin {{lamellar}} gratings {{represent a}} new kind of transparent heat mirror based on the principle of waveguides. Wavelengths shorter than double the waveguide diameter are propagated, while longer wavelengths are reflected {{at the opening of the}} waveguide. Parallel metal strips mounted perpendicular to a transparent surface exhibit equivalent behaviour for waves polarized perpendicular to the strips. For unpolarized radiation, two of these lamellar gratings have to be crossed. These gratings are manufactured by embossing a profile of right-angle triangles onto a transparent substrate. They have a period and depth of approximately 0, 8 mym. The vertical faces of the profile are then covered with a thin conducting metal layer by <b>oblique</b> <b>evaporation.</b> According to theoretical calculations, the IR-reflectance of the optimized grating is as high as the reflectance of a coherent metal coating, whereas the solar transmittance is very high even for diffuse radiation.

40|$|A mask-less {{crystalline}} silicon {{solar cell}} {{was made by}} using a surface texturing technique coupled with an <b>oblique</b> aluminum <b>evaporation.</b> To achieve this, trenches with a steep sidewall are mechanically grooved into the bulk silicon using the KS 775 Wafer Saw. More importantly, metal evaporation with the CVC evaporator at angles near parallel to the wafer surface allows deposition to occur {{along the side of}} the trenches creating the self-aligning front metal contacts. Of the four solar cells that made it through the processing, only one solar cell showed diode like 1 -V characteristics. The dark conditions shows a diode 1 -V where current doesn’t flow with a negative applied voltage and in the forward applied voltage, there is a turn on voltage around 0. 6 V, typical of a silicon diode. This is followed by an exponential gain in current. The n value of the diode is under dark conditions is 1. 7. Under illuminated conditions, the I-V curve shows a dramatic negative current for voltages below 0. 25 V. This isn’t the I-V curve of a solar cell but it does show that this device is light sensitive. The other three solar cells made are resistors with resistances of 4 Ω, 2 Ω and 19. 2 Ω for wafers 3, 4 and 5 respectively. The shorts on the solar cells are due to a nonuniformly coated N- 250 spin on glass (SOG) for the n+ layer on the p type wafer. Air pockets remained in the trenches and kept certain spots on the wafer surface to remain p. When the Al front contacts and bus paste are applied to the solar cells, it creates the p-n junction shorts. This was confirmed by breaking wafer 3 into smaller pieces where one of the pieces had a uniform n+ layer that showed I-V curves of a diode...|$|R

Hereafter, the structure, the morphology and the metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) property of the Ag and the Ag/ZnO core-shell particles were studied by XRD,SEM,TEM and fluorescence (FL) spectra. From the XRD patterns and the SEM,TEM images, the Ag nano column and the Ag/ZnO composite were successful obtained. Furthermore, the density of Ag nano columnar structure decreased {{with the increase of}} depositing angle. This phenomenon could be attributed to the surface diffusion function and the shading effect, As the result of the FL spectra, the MEF performance of the Ag/ZnO composite was more prominent than that of Ag nano column, due to the quenching effect. Moreover, the MEF performance of the Ag/ZnO composite depended on the deposited angle, firstly increasing and then decreasing with the tilt angle of Ag/ZnO core-shell structure. The mechanism of fluorescence enhancement would be due to the surface plasmon resonance of Ag surface and the change in photonic mode density and/or reduction in self-quenching of fluorophores for ZnO nano structure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the stationary phenomenon of superheated or metastable liquid jets, flashing into a two-dimensional axisymmetric domain, while in the two-phase region. In general, the phenomenon starts off when a high-pressure, high-temperature liquid jet emerges from a small nozzle or orifice expanding into a low-pressure chamber, below its saturation pressure taken at the injection temperature. As the process evolves, crossing the saturation curve, one observes that the fluid remains in the liquid phase reaching a superheated condition. Then, the liquid undergoes an abrupt phase change by means of an <b>oblique</b> <b>evaporation</b> wave. Across this phase change the superheated liquid becomes a two-phase high-speed mixture in various directions, expanding to supersonic velocities. In order to reach the downstream pressure, the supersonic fluid continues to expand, crossing a complex bow shock wave. The balance equations that govern the phenomenon are mass conservation, momentum conservation, and energy conservation, plus an equation-of-state for the substance. A false-transient model is implemented using the shock capturing scheme: dispersion-controlled dissipative (DCD), which was used to calculate the flow conditions as the steady-state condition is reached.

40|$|Here we show a new effect {{due to the}} arsenic flux in the {{molecular}} beam epitaxy growth of InAs quantum dots on GaAs(001) at temperatures higher than 500 °C and high As/In flux ratio. We show that, by changing and tuning {{the direction of the}} As flux on a rippled substrate, a selective growth can be obtained where the dots form only on some appropriately orientated slopes of a sequence of mounds elongated along the [1 ̅ 10] surface direction. Since the relative As flux intensity difference over the two opposite mound slopes is very small (2 – 5 %), the observed large effect cannot be explained simply as a pure shadowing effect and reveals instead that As, whose contribution to the modeling of growth has often been ignored or underestimated, probably for a lack of knowledge, plays a fundamental role at these growth conditions. To explain our experiment, we have developed a kinetic model that explicitly takes into account the coupling between cations (In) and anions (As) and found that the very small surface gradient in the anion flux, due to the <b>oblique</b> <b>evaporation</b> on the mounded surface, is responsible for a massive drain of cations toward the surface anion-rich areas, thus generating the selective growth of quantum dots.

40|$|Ferroelectric {{liquid crystal}} (FLC) {{attracted}} {{more and more}} interesting for display application long time ago. Because of good bistability and very fast switching time, FLC display has potential in field sequential color (FSC) and bistable display applications. However, there are two problems to stop FLC technology popular in display market for these years. First is how to receive good alignment on large size substrate. Second is how to achieve analog gray scales. The purpose of this thesis is trying to solve these two problems for FLC technology in bistable display application. In order to avoid “surface destroy” and static charge accumulation problems, two non-contacting methods are proposed, which are photo-alignment technology and SiO 2 thin films by ion beam deposition method. At the same time, SiOx surface using <b>oblique</b> <b>evaporation</b> method is investigated, in order to compare with characteristics of SiO 2 thin films.

40|$|Tape and disc {{media have}} their own {{specific}} fields of application in magnetic, magneto-optic and optical recording. Tape media are commonly used where a large storage capacity is needed. To meet the increasing demands for larger storage capacities industry has investigated the possibility to use the method of vacuum evaporation {{for the production of}} magnetic recording tape. This has resulted in a commercial product called Metal Evaporated tape. In ME-tape production one takes advantage of the special properties of magnetic films evaporated under oblique vapour incidence, a method which has been discovered in 1959 in laboratory experiments. The difference however between industrial production of ME-tape and laboratory scale evaporation of thin film is extreme. The results obtained in the 35 years of experiments with <b>oblique</b> <b>evaporation</b> cannot be used unconditionally for the industrial production of ME-tape. Therefore the necessity for a model relating process conditions to structural and magnetic film properties is evident. In this thesis such a model is constructed using theoretical and experimental results already published in literature, combined with new theory and experiments. A number of experiments with Co 80 Ni 20 evaporated at high angles of incidence are presented, including the first results on experiments with small-scale ME-tape production. In chapter 2 the relation between process conditions and film structure is discussed. The special structure of obliquely evaporated films has its origin in shadowing phenomena during film growth. Because of shadowing the film consists of bundles of inclined columns, the bundles being aligned perpendicularly to the vapour incidence direction. The column inclination angle lies in-between the film normal and the vapour incidence direction. Different models found in literature relating process parameters and film structure are discussed. It is shown that surface diffusion plays an important role, especially the difference between random and directional surface diffusion. The latter is induced by the <b>oblique</b> <b>evaporation</b> process. An attempt is made to give a quantitative expression for the relation between process conditions and surface diffusion including the influence of substrate temperature, rate and contamination with residual gasses. Using the models found in literature and adding the new calculations the relation between surface diffusion and film structure is discussed in detail and compared with measurements found in literature. In chapter 3 the relation between film structure and magnetic properties of obliquely evaporated magnetic thin films is treated. The tilted columnar structure results in a magnetic shape anisotropy. Two methods to calculate the shape anisotropy are compared, one is especially developed for this purpose. Next to the columnar structure also the anisotropic texture orientation and stress distribution contribute to the magnetic anisotropy. All these effects lead to an easy axis of magnetisation tilted out of the film plane. To determine the magnetic anisotropy in such films a measurement method using a torque-magnetometer is presented, leading to a general formulation of the anisotropy energy in arbitrary systems. The magnetic reversal is strongly affected by the magnetic anisotropy and the exchange between spins in adjacent columns. In films where the exchange is continuous throughout the film the tilted easy axis leads to specific magnetic domain structures which are only found in obliquely evaporated magnetic films. With increasing columnar separation the magnetic reversal turns to a mechanism of rotation of magnetisation in magnetically isolated particles, accompanied by a strong increase in coercivity. Furthermore the tilted easy axis causes a dependence of the recording properties on the tape running direction. In chapter 4 and 5 several experiments performed in the CNRS and MESA laboratories are discussed. Where possible a relation with the theory of chapter 2 and 3 is given. For each evaporation set-up used an estimate of the run-to-run reproducibility is made. It is concluded that the run-to-run scatter is mainly caused by small variations in the angle of incidence. This could be prevented by using an improved substrate holder. It is shown that the structural and magnetic properties of obliquely evaporated Co 80 Ni 20 films depend on layer thickness up to a thickness of about 150 nm. Above this thickness the film properties remain constant. It was concluded that the difference is not caused by the change in substrate temperature during evaporation but by the film growth process itself. In preparation of the tape deposition set-up the rate of evaporation had to be increased. Therefore a short investigation on the effect of increase in evaporation on films prepared on Si substrates has been performed. An increase in rate from 0. 5 to 20 nms- 1 resulted in an increase in coercivity and anisotropy of the film. Since the columnar inclination and the apparent saturation magnetisation remain almost constant, it was concluded that the changes are mainly caused by an increase in crystal anisotropy. The influence of stress however should not be excluded. The observed change in film properties with increasing evaporation rate might be caused by the expected decrease in contamination with H 2 O molecules. To enable recording experiments, Co 80 Ni 20 is evaporated on tape by the method of continuously varying angle of vapour incidence. For this a special "mini roll coater" was constructed which resembles the much larger roll-coaters used in industry for the production of ME-tape. This mini roll coater is used to study the effect of addition of oxygen on the film structure and its magnetic and recording properties. The recording performance of the tape prepared with this mini-roll coater are still bad in comparison with commercially available ME tape. The aim of the experiment however is not to produce commercial tape but to investigate the relation between process conditions, film structure, magnetic and recording properties. From this perspective the first results are encouraging...|$|E
