Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches,</b> but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|On McGovern's December 15 mission over Linz, {{his second}} as pilot, {{a piece of}} {{shrapnel}} from flak came through the windshield and missed fatally wounding him by <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches.</b> The following day {{on a mission to}} Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

25|$|A common {{distinction}} between dams and weirs is that water flows {{over the top}} (crest) of a weir or underneath it {{for at least some}} of its length. Accordingly, the crest of an overflow spillway on a large dam may therefore be referred to as a weir. Weirs can vary in size both horizontally and vertically, with the smallest being <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> in height whilst the largest may be hundreds of metres long and many metres tall. Some common weir purposes are outlined below.|$|E

Arthur Johnson, a glass blower who had previously worked for both Baird and H-H, produced the new models. These had screens ten inches across, comparable to monochrome screens of the era. The guns fired upward at about a 45 degree angle. As in the teapot tube, the necks were very long.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being in}} the majority, none of the loyalists put up a {{significant}} struggle once they saw Bligh bound, and the ship was taken over without bloodshed. The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen a 23-foot (7m) launch (so heavily loaded that the gunwales were <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> above the water). They were allowed four cutlasses, food and water for perhaps a week, a quadrant and a compass, but no charts, or marine chronometer. Most of these were obtained by the clerk, Mr Samuel, who acted with great calm and resolution, despite threats from the mutineers. The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members, so four were detained on Bounty for their useful skills; they were later released in Tahiti.|$|E

Captain Miller sent two men ahead in a boat to scout out for rocks and rapids, and the Shoshone proceeded behind them. They ran a particularly hazardous stretch at the Mountain Sheep section in Seven Devils Canyon. The boat was sucked into a whirlpool, and a huge wall of water came aboard, breaking into and nearly flooding the engine room, washing big chunks of cordwood all about the engine room floor. As {{the men in the}} engine room dodged these hazards, the Shoshone ran through a passage so narrow that there were <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> clearance between the rock walls {{on both sides of the}} vessel.|$|E

25|$|The danger {{most often}} {{associated}} with suspension bondage, {{over and above the}} usual risks inherent in bondage, is falling; whether due to a weak suspension point, faulty equipment or poor technique. Inverted positions are especially hazardous in this regard since a head-first fall of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> can kill or paralyze a person. Less obvious dangers include nerve compression and resulting damage, circulation problems and fainting, and the recently recognized harness hang syndrome. Harness hang syndrome appears to relate to suspension with the legs below the heart, as in the case when someone is suspended in a standing position, with no weight on their legs. Extracting a person safely out of suspension bondage can be difficult if they are unconscious, or if a winch or hoist jams. Suspension tops will often work with spotters who can help get the person down in an emergency.|$|E

[...] As they rowed towards their rescuer, they passed Peter McCabe, still clinging to the makeshift raft, the only one of its 72 occupants to have survived the night; he, too was taken on board Huron.

50|$|Although {{for most}} of the year, <b>only</b> water <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> deep trickles in the stream, experts of the Water Department of Bacău County {{considered}} that prevention of sudden floodings of the stream may only be solved by converting it into a drainage channel. According to environmentalists, life of birds, fish, frogs and other species is affected by the concrete stream-bed solution. The mayor's office and the local population, however, is satisfied with the chosen solution and consider it a sign of progress. Besides, as they say, life already died out from the stream anyway because of the waste water trickling into the stream from the neighboring cesspools.|$|R

500|$|The Coldrum Stones {{have been}} {{excavated}} on multiple occasions. On 16 April 1910, the amateur archaeologist F. J.

He soon discovered human bones [...] "under <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> of chalky soil". He {{returned to the}} site for further excavation in August 1910, this time with his niece and her husband, {{both of whom were}} dentists with an interest in craniology; on that day they discovered pieces of a human skull, which they were able to largely reconstruct. A few days later he returned to excavate on the north-west corner of the chamber with the architect E. W. Filkins; that day, they found a second skull, further bones, a flint tool, and pieces of pottery. This pottery was later identified as being Anglo-Saxon in date.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of Anomalocaris ("abnormal shrimp") was a comedy of errors. The name was initially {{given to a}} fossil that looked like the rear end of a shrimp-like crustacean. Walcott classified a ring-like fossil he called Peytoia {{as a kind of}} jellyfish, and another poorly preserved fossil he called Laggania as a holothurian (sea cucumber). After many plot twists, Derek Briggs started dissecting another ill-defined fossil in very thin slices and found a pair of Anomalocaris-like structures on one end of a specimen of Laggania, which also had a specimen of Peytoia attached just behind those of Anomalocaris. After dissecting more specimens and finding similar configurations, Briggs and Whittington concluded that the whole assemblage represented a single animal, which was named Anomalocaris because that was the earliest name assigned to any of its parts. This animal's body was fragile and usually disintegrated before it could be fossilized. But the complete animal had tough grasping appendages (Anomalocaris), a tough, ring-like mouth with teeth on the inner edge (Peytoia) and a long, segmented body (Laggania) with flaps on the sides that enabled it to swim with a Mexican wave motion, and perhaps to turn quickly by putting the flaps on one side into reverse. This monster was over [...] long when other animals were <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> at most. Nedin suggested in 1999 that the animal was capable of taking heavily armored trilobites apart, possibly by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock {{the other end of the}} animal back and forth, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. In 2009 Hagadorn found that anomalocarid mouthparts showed little wear, which suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells. Computer modeling of the Anomalocaris mouthparts suggests they were in fact better suited to sucking on smaller, soft-bodied organisms. Although Whittington and Briggs concluded that Anomalocaris did not fit into any known phylum, research since the 1990s has concluded that it was closely related to Opabinia and to the ancestors of arthropods. In 2009 a fossil named Schinderhannes bartelsi, an apparent relative of Anomalocaris, was found in the Early Devonian period, about 100million years later than the Burgess Shale.|$|E

60|$|The {{moment he}} was sure they were gone, he began to search the place for a tool which would fairly suit his purpose.

2500|$|In November 1912, Mazama became {{stranded}} in the Wood River, when {{as a result of}} poorly constructed irrigation canal, most of the water in the river was diverted into the canal, flooding the surrounding area, and leaving insufficient water in the river for Mazama to navigate.

2500|$|At 12:25pm on 22 September 1907 {{the nearly}} {{completed}} Principessa Jolanda was launched before a large audience of onlookers, {{government officials and}} foreign journalists. After travelling down the slipway, the ship immediately became unstable and heeled sharply to port. Efforts by tugboats and shipyard workers to rescue the situation, including lowering the anchors to starboard to counteract the movement, were unsuccessful. After 20 minutes the vessel's list was such that it began taking on water through openings in the upper decks. She soon capsized with her funnels a few metres above and parallel to the water.

2500|$|The Evolution Series {{locomotives}} {{are visually}} {{similar to the}} AC4400CW, although small differences are evident.

As with the AC6000CW the radiators project beyond the end of the hood, though not to the same extent, as the Evolution Series protrudes <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> out. Also, unlike previous GE locomotives, the grilles under the radiator are at two different angles. The increase in radiator size is due to the necessity for greater cooling capacity in the locomotive in order to reduce emissions. [...] The other major difference between the Evolution Series and earlier models are the vents below the radiators, which are larger than those on previous GE locomotives. In addition, most, if not all, Evolution Series units have air conditioners mounted below the cab on the conductor's side.|$|E
