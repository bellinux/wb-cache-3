25|$|<b>The</b> huge losses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefields</b> {{were not}} limited to men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and {{ammunition}} (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were {{being sent to the}} front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefields.</b> <b>The</b> soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as human beings, or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered {{for the purposes of the}} rich and powerful.|$|R

5|$|Although cavalry {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{throughout the world}} during the 19th century, horses became less important to warfare after {{the beginning of the}} 20th century.
