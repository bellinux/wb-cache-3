5|$|The {{impact of}} Tkach’s tenure {{as the head}} of the WCG was notable. Church income dropped from a high of over $200 million in 1990 to $50 million by 1996. By then the church could only count 49,000 as members, less than half from its peak. The {{circulation}} of The Plain Truth, distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell from a peak of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry. The number of employees at the church headquarters fell from 1,000 to about 50. Ambassador University, as the college had become after earning regional accreditation in Texas, ceased operations in 1997 as the church could no longer provide its annual <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy.</b> The Pasadena campus was finally sold in 2004.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} two public transit policies, subsidization and privatization, on the wages of taxi drivers. In theory, transit <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> benefit transit firms {{at the expense of}} the taxi industry and its employees. By contrast, the privatization policy of contracting-out transit service to lower cost private providers is potentially beneficial to taxi firms and their drivers. Estimated wage equations confirm that transit <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> have negatively affected taxi driver wages even as they have bolstered transit drivers'wages. Transit privatization has had the predicted positive effect on taxi driver wages, all else held constant. These results suggest that a more accurate assessment of the effect of transit <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> on labor costs must encompass their net effects on the labor costs of the entire urban transportation sector, not just the public transit industry. ...|$|R

In 2008, the system carried 3.55 million riders. Despite the fact the shuttle service is free, it is {{comparatively}} inexpensive to operate: with an operating cost of $4.55 million in 2008, the <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> was only $1.28 per passenger. Even Metro Transit's busy METRO Blue Line light rail required a subsidy of $1.44 that year, and that was with many riders paying $1.75 or more for a ride.|$|E

Fares were reduced on March 9, 2016 to $12 for a one-way trip between Union and Pearson, or $9 with a Presto card. On {{the first day}} of reduced fares, staff counted 5,300 boardings with 40 per cent of the riders being first-time UPX users, 83 per cent being air travelers and 17 per cent being commuters. By June 2016, the daily average ridership had risen to 7,657, and a new record was set on July 29, when the service carried more than 11,000 passengers. However, the fare reduction has lowered the total revenue collected by the UP Express, which is expected to be below what is required for its operating costs. It was revealed that since opening day to March 2016, the UP Express' provincial <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> totaled $39.3 million or about $52.26 per ride.|$|E

Nexus, which owns and manages Metro, contracted out operations and train maintenance {{as part of}} a deal with the UK Government to secure modernisation investment and <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> for the system between 2010 and 2021. Nexus continued to set fares, set frequency of services and Metro operating hours. Opponents say this was privatisation by the back door, though some services had already been contracted out, such as cleaning of stations and ticket inspections. On 3 November 2008, Nexus invited potential bidders to declare an interest in a contract to run the operations side of the business on its behalf. The successful bidder was to obtain a seven-year contract commencing on 1 April 2010, with up to an additional two years depending on performance. In February 2009 four bids were shortlisted; DB Regio, MTR Corporation, Serco-Abellio, and an in-house bid by Metro. By October 2009 the shortlist had been reduced to bids from DB Regio and Nexus. In December 2009, DB Regio was named as the preferred bidder. The contract for operating the system was signed on 2 February 2010, and the service was handed over to DB Regio on 1 April 2010.|$|E
