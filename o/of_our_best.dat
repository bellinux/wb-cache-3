5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is well worth the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story.

5|$|While {{the speech}} {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, this is of little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem {{to be part of the}} speech in the hope that the salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given in the speech has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, the speech tells us much about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, it is our most reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

500|$|When {{the episode}} was finally {{finished}} and aired, it was highly enjoyed by The X-Files cast and crew. Carter called the entry [...] "tight, funny, touching, and quirky." [...] Series writer Vince Gilligan {{was impressed with}} the episode, and noted that the episode represented the seventh season of the show as whole. He explained: [...] "The seventh season, for my money, was one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> because we took more storytelling risks than in previous years." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1930, Tracy was {{approached}} {{about a new}} play called The Last Mile. Looking to cast the lead role of a murderer on death row, producer Herman Shumlin met with Tracy, and later recounted: [...] "beneath the surface, {{here was a man}} of passion, violence, sensitivity and desperation: no ordinary man, and just the man for the part." [...] The Last Mile opened on Broadway in February, where Tracy's performance was met by a standing ovation that lasted 14 curtain calls. The Commonweal described him as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> and most versatile young actors". The play was a hit with critics, and ran for 289 performances.|$|E

500|$|Carter also {{directed}} the episode; initially, the episode {{was supposed to}} have been helmed by another individual, but no one was ever selected. At the last minute, Carter took on the role. Due to time constraints, Carter was writing whole parts of the script while the episode was being filmed. Many of the cast and crew were pleased with Carter's directing. Gillian Anderson said that she thought [...] "Chris has directed some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> episodes. He's very even tempered, and he's quiet and gentle and quite nice to have as a director, because that energy can't help but pervade the rest of the set [...] He's got a clear vision, and he's good at communicating that." [...] Annabeth Gish noted that Carter's directing was [...] "very meticulous" [...] and that he [...] "knows exactly what he wants".|$|E

Beecham was much admired for {{conducting}} the complicated new score of Stravinsky's Petrushka, at two days' notice and without rehearsal, when Monteux became unavailable. [...] While in Berlin, Beecham and his orchestra, in Beecham's words, caused a [...] "mild stir", scoring a triumph: the orchestra was agreed by the Berlin press to be an elite body, {{one of the best}} in the world. [...] The principal Berlin musical weekly, Die Signale, asked, [...] "Where does London find such magnificent young instrumentalists?" [...] The violins were credited with rich, noble tone, the woodwinds with lustre, the brass, [...] "which has not quite the dignity and amplitude <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> German brass", with uncommon delicacy of execution.|$|E
500|$|On {{top of a}} poor {{commercial}} showing at the {{box office}} in 1960, critical reception to Crossroads to Crime has remained consistently negative. Anderson once called it [...] "possibly the worst film ever made", while Elliott considers it [...] "awful". Cohen and Levy were similarly unimpressed and offered Anderson no further commissions for Anglo-Amalgamated. During the promotional campaign for Thunderbirds Are Go, made by AP Films' successor company Century 21 and released in 1966, Sylvia Anderson said of the earlier film, [...] "The less said about it, the better"; she has since commented that it [...] "hardly ranks as one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> efforts". A contemporary review in Monthly Film Bulletin was more positive: [...] "Quick off the mark, this modest little thriller soon settles down into a routine 'cops and robbers' format, efficient if not always too convincing." [...] Stronger praise came in the October 1960 issue of Kine Weekly, which commended Crossroads to Crime as being [...] "refreshingly free from pretence", adding: [...] "The film's moral is lofty, its tender domestic asides encourage feminine interest, and the climax is a corker." ...|$|E

500|$|Abi's earlier storylines {{consist of}} her parents {{fighting}} for custody of her and her siblings, being injured in a collision with Deano Wicks' (Di Angelo) car and helping her friend Ben (Jones) with his abuse from stepmother Stella Crawford (Thompson) In February 2011, Abi {{was involved in a}} car accident with Max and would suffer severe injuries after their car collides with a lorry on the way to Tanya's wedding to her new partner Greg (Booth). The crash scenes were filmed on 6 March 2011 and aired on 14 April 2011. After these minor storylines, Joyner said that Fitzgerald should be involved in more complex storylines in 2012. She said, [...] "I think it's going to be an exciting year for Lorna. She's been a natural on the show ever since she was younger, and I think she's one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> actresses.

500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati was one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. When I got back, {{it took me a}} minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E

Walker graduated from the Command and General Staff School in June 1935 and was posted to Hamilton Field, first as Intelligence and Operations Officer of the 7th Bombardment Group, and then as commander of the 9th Bombardment Squadron. [...] While landing a Martin B-12 bomber, he overshot the runway. The station commander, Brigadier General Henry Arnold reported that Walker, [...] "supposed to be one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> pilots, apparently cuts out completely, uses up [...] and finally hits a concrete block and spoils a perfectly good airplane when he normally would have given her the gun and gone around again." [...] After fifteen years in the rank, jokes circulated about his being the most senior first lieutenant in the Air Corps, but he was finally promoted to captain on 1 August 1935. He was temporary major from 20 October 1935 to 16 June 1936, and again on 4 October 1938, before the rank finally became substantive on 1 July 1940. He had another accident in 1937, when he crashed a B-17 on take off from Denver Municipal Airport but this time his flying skills were credited with saving the entire crew of nine from injury.|$|E

500|$|In 1967, Redding {{performed}} at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, {{the second day of}} the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler. Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences. [...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] and looking for a big response. The ballad [...] "I've Been Loving You" [...] followed. The last song was [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. [...] "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones, [...] "I think we did one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey."

The Guardian scored the film four out of five stars, calling it a film of [...] "granite, monolithic intensity", yet also calling it a [...] "hammy, portentous affair". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon writes [...] "if The Dark Knight Rises is a fascist film, it's a great fascist film, and arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, stating [...] "the film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax." [...] Film critic Richard Roeper gave the film an [...] "A", calling it [...] "a majestic, gorgeous, brutal and richly satisfying epic", and citing the final scenes of the picture as [...] "the best five minutes of any film this year." [...] The London Film Review gave the film a B and said [...] "Nolan's film is a reminder that superheroes aren't merely a frivolous distraction, but an embodiment <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>best</b> selves." [...] The film was crowned by Forbes as the best modern comic book superhero adaption on screen, outranking both its main summer blockbuster competitor, Marvel's The Avengers, and the trilogy's previous installment The Dark Knight.
