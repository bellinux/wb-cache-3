5|$|In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who {{had never}} been {{particularly}} popular among his followers—tried {{to convince them that}} she should be their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen. Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1922, and it was here that Fortune carried <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff, {{using the}} energy of the Cardiff Rift to {{recharge}} the engines. Rose has Mickey bring her passport to the TARDIS, and together with the Doctor and Jack Harkness, they go to lunch. At lunch, the Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine, a Slitheen, has become Cardiff's new mayor. The four track down and capture Margaret to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is doing there after their previous encounter (in Aliens of London). The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains a functioning tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator that Margaret would have used to flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Margaret back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorious, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Margaret makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then tries to play on the Doctor's sympathies, asking him to take her to another planet instead.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Aaron Shure and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grundy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin, and the writers collectively decided the Pam character should leave {{and try to find}} <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants from life. The episode included a guest appearance by Idris Elba, who played new Dunder Mifflin vice president Charles Miner. [...] "Two Weeks" [...] received generally positive reviews and, according to Nielsen ratings, was watched by 8.7 million overall viewers and was the top-rated show on NBC the week it aired. [...] "Two Weeks" [...] received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series.|$|E

The Fringe division discovers an undamaged device they believe {{is used by the}} shapeshifters to take another's identity. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) gives the device to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) at Massive Dynamic; with the intact device, they can use it to examine the device of the first shapeshifter that tried to kill Olivia in the episode [...] "A New Day in the Old Town".

500|$|When Charles {{became ill}} in the 1390s, Isabeau was 22; {{she had three}} {{children}} and had already lost two infants. During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize her, and caused her great distress by demanding her removal when she entered his chamber. The Monk of St Denis wrote in his chronicle, [...] "What distressed her above all was to see how on all occasions... the king repulsed her, whispering to his people, 'Who is this woman obstructing my view? Find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants and stop her from annoying and bothering me. As his illness worsened {{at the turn of}} the century, she was accused of abandoning him, particularly when she moved her residence to the Hôtel Barbette. Historian Rachel Gibbons speculates that Isabeau wanted to distance herself from her husband and his illness, writing, [...] "it would be unjust to blame her if she did not want to live with a madman." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{was written}} by Aaron Shure and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. Shure {{said there was a}} great deal of debate among the writers about Pam's decision to leave Dunder Mifflin with Michael, but they decided to move in that direction to demonstrate Pam was trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants in life. Lieberstein thought of the idea of the final scene in which Michael and Pam's faces go from optimism to concern, because he felt it would anchor the episode. The decision to have Charles choose Stanley as productivity czar and Kevin as receptionist was made by Shure the day before the episode's draft was handed in because he wanted to have Charles make [...] "rookie mistakes, despite all his poise." [...] "Two Weeks" [...] was the second of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Bibel {{criticized the}} soap opera when Victoria [...] "decided {{to give up a}} {{corporate}} career to become a children’s book author", writing: [...] "From the time she was SORASED into a teen, Victoria’s ambition was to run Newman Enterprises. She was the child who inherited Victor’s (Eric Braeden) business acumen. He, being a male chauvinist, always viewed the more family oriented Nick as his heir apparent. Her struggle to get her father’s recognition is what fueled her." [...] She also stated that while watching the series, there was [...] "the sense that women could, if that was what interested them, be power players". Of Victoria's choice to leave Newman Enterprises, Bibel wrote: [...] "For Victoria, it came across as giving up Peggy Olsen’s life for Betty Draper’s. I was also peeved by her telling her mother that she didn’t have the first idea of how to become an author. She ran a major cosmetics company. She should have a hundred contacts in publishing, and the confidence and skills to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> doesn’t know. I got to thinking about all of the ways that, over the past few months, the women of Genoa City have been, to use the lingo of Leaning In, the most popular non-fiction book in the country right now, leaning out." [...] Tommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood blamed head writer Josh Griffith for turning the character into a [...] "hard-nosed unforgiving socialite".|$|E

2500|$|Overall, {{this book}} works to {{shed some light}} on what hooks sees as the modern day {{abandonment}} of love and what it means for people of today to experience love. One strong argument she proposes is how love cannot exist {{in the middle of a}} power struggle. Hooks goes as far as to present a number of problems she finds with our modern ideals of love and proposes their possible solutions. She includes the propositions of full reconstruction and transformation of modern-day love based on [...] "affection, respect, recognition, commitment, trust and care" [...] (Nonfiction Book Review). Hooks also points <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> sees to be the roots of the problems regarding modern day love, those being gender stereotypes, domination, control, ego, and aggression (Nonfiction Book Review).|$|E

2500|$|In 1953 Gardner {{initiated}} a young woman, Doreen Valiente, into the craft, and she soon {{went on to}} become the High Priestess of his Bricket Wood coven. Around the same time, Gardner invented the Book of Shadows, a workbook of rituals, although he claimed it was of ancient origins. Valiente helped Gardner rewrite the Book, cutting <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw as [...] "Crowleyanity", and writing sections such as the Charge of the Goddess in poetic verse. Valiente and Gardner later fell out, however, when she got fed up with his constant attempts to gain publicity and when he tried to impose the Wiccan Laws upon the coven, something which he claimed were used by the Witch-Cult, but which Valiente believed he had simply made up. She, and several other members of the coven, left, and founded their own. However, the Bricket Wood coven continued, with members that included Jack Bracelin, Dayonis, Frederic Lamond and Lois Bourne.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{relationship}} was severely tested when Chrissie {{made contact with}} Mark's father, Frank Williams. Robert Powell explained: [...] ""Chrissie finds Mark's father for him {{but he has not}} spoken to his father for some time since they had a major falling <b>out.</b> <b>What</b> <b>she</b> does not know is that the issues between Mark and his father are nothing compared to the issues between Mark's father and Tricia, his daughter-in-law." [...] Indeed, Tricia was extremely pensive about the reunion, even more so when Frank was taken ill and admitted to the hospital. Sharon Maughan expanded on the storyline: [...] "Tricia's horrified when Lisa tells her that Frank had a suspected stroke in the night and was rambling on about Chrissie being his daughter. At first, Tricia claims that Frank doesn't know what he is talking about because he is ill. But later, when Lisa finds her crying, she breaks down and reveals that Frank raped her when she was a teenager, during the time she was married to Mark." [...] Tricia had Frank take a secret paternity test, confirming that he was indeed Chrissie's biological father. [...] As his condition deteriorated, she lied, claiming that he had expressed an instruction that he did not wish to be resuscitated. Frank died, and Tricia hoped that Chrissie's true paternity could remain a secret.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, Tricky Stewart {{revealed}} that Ciara {{had been working}} on her fourth studio album. At the time the project was set to be produced solely by trio of Tricky Stewart, The-Dream and Ciara herself. Stewart described the studio sessions as [...] "feeling good" [...] with the music [...] "having a good vibe". On the record's theme he said [...] " [...] is obviously is gonna have tempo to it, but I think it's gonna have even more substance than the last record. She dances and we always want to bring <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does that other people don't." [...] Additionally the trio said that they intended the album to contain no features except for one collaboration with The-Dream, although there would features on remixes. They had wanted to release the album in 2009 but accepted that a 2010 release was more realistic. Later in an interview with Rap-Up magazine, two songs were name dropped, [...] "Speechless" [...] which was the aforementioned feature with The-Dream and [...] "Gifted." [...] Both songs where tipped to appear on the album, though on the final track listing only [...] "Speechless" [...] made the album without The-Dream's vocals. In December 2009, Digital Spy reported that Ciara had begun working Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, someone she had previously collaborated with for Fantasy Ride (2009). Milk Recording Studios, in Atlanta, confirmed that Ciara had been recording at their studios with Miles Walker, an engineer who worked on Usher's Raymond v. Raymond and Mary J. Blige's Stronger with Each Tear. He mixed tracks for the album, however none of the tracks he mixed for the record made the final track listing.|$|E
