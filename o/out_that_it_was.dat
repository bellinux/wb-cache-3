5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E
5|$|Only {{later did}} Pflanz find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Wick he saw bailing out. Göring had ordered Kriegsmarine torpedo boats on a night-long search-and-rescue mission for Wick. The next day, other naval vessels and the Seenotdienst (air-sea rescue) service, escorted by fighters of JG2, {{continued}} {{in vain to}} search for him. He was never found, however, and the Luftwaffe declared him missing in action, presumed dead, on 4 December 1940, earning him his last reference in the daily Wehrmachtbericht. Wick, on his 168th combat mission, was the first Oak Leaves recipient to lose his life in combat.|$|E
5|$|She is now {{best known}} as a fashion guru and style advisor. Her fashion career started when she worked for many years as a shop girl in America for Giorgio Armani. She later came back to London with the hope of {{securing}} a job with Armani but ended up working for designers such as Richard James, Patrick Cox, Alistair Blair and John Galliano which gained her an even greater understanding of fashion, providing an in depth knowledge of how a garment progresses from a sketch. She then started working with the British Brain and Spine Foundation and consequently met the sports editor of The Daily Telegraph. Whilst doing a piece for GMTV, he asked Constantine to report the women's World Cup Final in cricket on finding <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her passion. She proceeded to write about cars and then fashion.|$|E

5|$|The lower river, from Midhurst to its {{junction}} {{with the}} River Arun, {{has been used}} for navigation. Boats used the section from the Arun to Fittleworth following improvements made to the Arun in 1615, and after the Arun Navigation was completed in 1790, the Earl of Egremont made the river navigable up to Midhurst by constructing eight locks and some small cuts. The work was completed in 1794, and many of the bridges built at that time still survive. With the opening of the Mid-Sussex Railway branch to Midhurst in 1859, traffic declined, and commercial use of the river had ceased by the 1880s. Pleasure boats continued to be used on the river for many years, and published accounts of journeys along the decaying navigation appeared in 1914 and 1920. The navigation was officially abandoned in 1936, after an undergraduate pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> still a public right of way.|$|E
5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{controversy}} {{between the}} local organisation Galleri Texas and the state-owned corporation Follo Futura arose, regarding the hiring contract {{of the station}} building, and which of them were to operate the cultural meeting place. Follo Futura, which together with the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Rom Eiendom officially owned the station building wanted {{to take over the}} café business. They argued that they were better fit to operate it, since Galleri Texas did not have the economical capacity to run the café with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. The local community wanted Galleri Texas to operate the café, arguing that replacing a local company for a governmental one would weaken the local and patriotic spirit of the café. On 1 January 2010, the operation of the café and the cultural meeting place was transferred from Galleri Texas to Follo Futura, since Galleri Texas no longer could pay the rental costs. In 2010, smoke was tumbling out of the station, but it turned <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only a cigarette that had not been quenched, and had been laying overnight in a flower basket.|$|E
