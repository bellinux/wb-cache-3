5|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then <b>on</b> <b>out.</b> In 1965, {{it was decided to}} expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. In February 1966, the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Oakland and St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
25|$|A {{title for}} the series had not been decided when {{production}} began. Names including Dimension 4, The Edge of Tomorrow and From the Unknown were considered before settling <b>on</b> <b>Out</b> of the Unknown. The title music was composed by Norman Kay and the title sequence was created by Bernard Lodge. It was intended from an early stage that, as with Boris Karloff <b>on</b> <b>Out</b> of this World, each story would be introduced by a regular host. Christopher Lee and Vincent Price were approached but were not available and the idea was dropped. The episode “Some Lapse of Time” is notable for having Ridley Scott, future director of such films as Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator, as designer.|$|E

25|$|While Landrith {{was still}} {{recovering}} from his ankle injury, the Cincinnati Reds brought him up the Major Leagues and placed him on the disabled list. Landrith joined the Reds squad when they played an exhibition game in Detroit, his home town, on June 12. He worked out with the team from there <b>on</b> <b>out,</b> traveling with the team on all road trips, catching in batting practice and pulling bullpen duty. On July 30, the top three catchers on the Reds' depth chart were all recovering from ailing injuries. Johnny Pramesa had a sprained ankle sustained the day before on July 29, Bob Scheffing was having problems with his left elbow, and Dixie Howell's throwing hand had been sore. Reds Manager Luke Sewell {{made the decision to}} finally give Landrith his first major league start that day at the Boston Braves, singling in his first at bat off Braves starter Vern Bickford and driving in a run. Landrith played in three more games through August 8 before he was no longer used in games and resumed his duty of working solely in practice roles.|$|E

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's going <b>on</b> <b>out</b> there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action {{movies is}} not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

500|$|Sensing the {{importance}} of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, the crowd erupted. Australia were struggling at 68/3 as Harvey, playing his first Ashes Test and the youngest member of the squad at the age of 19, walked out bareheaded to join Miller at the crease. The tourists were more than 400 behind, and another wicket would expose the lower order and give England the opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Harvey told his senior partner [...] "What's going <b>on</b> <b>out</b> here, eh? Let's get stuck into 'em". He got off the mark by forcing the ball behind point.|$|E

He was opposed by Roy McDowell, who criticized Harpole's plan to build a ballpark, saying [...] "We didn't get to vote on it, but I am going to make sure from here <b>on</b> <b>out</b> that people get to vote on all major issues".

The next morning, Hassett and Bradman fell in one Dick Pollard over to leave Australia at 3/68 with two new batsmen at the crease. Harvey came in bareheaded at No. 5 to join cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves {{an opportunity to take}} a large first innings lead.

500|$|While Christopher {{was holding}} out for a new deal from the Athletics, he was also trying to gain weight.

After apparently reaching {{an agreement with the}} Athletics, Christopher was purchased by the Cleveland Indians on April 3, 1948. While the deal was made between Mack and Indians owner Bill Veeck, Mack said he would not have made it unless Christopher consented to it, which he did not expect to happen. Indians manager Lou Boudreau reacted positively to the trade and felt that he was the missing piece for a pennant run.

Schoedsack contributed to the film, focusing on shooting scenes for the boat sequences and in native villages, leaving Cooper to shoot the jungle scenes. In February 1933, the title for the film was registered for copyright. Throughout filming there were creative battles. Critics at RKO argued that the film should begin with Kong. Cooper believed that a film should begin with a [...] "slow dramatic buildup that would establish everything from characters to mood..." [...] so that {{the action of the}} film could [...] "naturally, relentlessly, roll <b>on</b> <b>out</b> of its own creative movement," [...] and thus chose to not begin the film with a shot of Kong. The iconic scene in which Kong is on top of the Empire State Building was almost called off by Cooper for legal reasons, but was kept in the film because RKO bought the rights to The Lost World.|$|E

On October 17, 2011, she posted five GIF files with scenes from the video on her Tumblr. The video was released the same day on the iTunes Store; it reached the top position on its chart within minutes. Becky Bain of Idolator called it [...] "an epic mini-movie, full of romance, intrigue [...] a whole lot of unnecessary PDA between Brit and her beau. It was full of passion, joy and just a little touch of madness — just like its star." [...] Bain also noted several influences, such as Alfred Hitchcock films and the music videos for Spears' [...] "Toxic" [...] (2004) and Green Day’s [...] "21 Guns" [...] (2009). A writer for Rolling Stone also compared it to a Hitchcock film and deemed the opening scene as [...] "a tribute to Old Hollywood".
