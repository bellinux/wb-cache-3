40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{production}} of various malts intended for manufacture of special types of beer. The malts {{were used to}} brew samples of beer with alcoholic strength ranging between 8 - 12 % EPM. The above range of <b>original</b> <b>wort</b> <b>content</b> was chosen due to its suitability for sensory evaluation and properties; in stronger types of beer, (more than 12 % EPM), nature of the beverage can be drown by mashy flavour. In the experimental samples, the actual residual extract oscillated between 4. 0 - 6. 5 %. The content of ethanol corresponded {{to the degree of}} fermentation and thereby also to the residual actual extract in balance equilibrium specifying that higher residual extract corresponds to lower content of alcohol by volume. It ranged between 2. 5 - 5. 0 %. The sample 1 contained the highest amount of ethanol by mass (3. 9 %) and the sample 13 showed the lowest one (1. 9 %); alike trend of ethanol content by volume was revealed (5 and 2. 44 %, respectively). The highest content of actual and apparent extract was found in the sample 2 (6. 6 and 5. 2 %, respectively); the sample 13 showed the lowest levels (4. 0 and 3. 1 %, respectively). The original wort extract content averaged 9. 9 % in most of the samples; the sample 1 showed distinctly higher value (12. 6 %) and, on the contrary, the sample 13 demonstrated the lowest one (7. 4 %). The highest relative density was revealed in the sample 2 (1. 02 %) and the lowest one in the sample 13 (1. 01 %). Considering differences in osmotic pressure, the sample 1 exhibited the highest value (1045 mOs) and the sample 13 the lowest one (551 mOs). The highest level of fermentation was found in the sample 19 (61. 7 %), the lowest one was proved in the sample 19 (44. 0 %). Sensory analysis corresponded to originality and characteristics of each sample. The sample of beer made from spring barley was evaluated to be the best one. © 2017 Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences...|$|E

The analytical data were related to standard beer parameters. AX content was lowest in alcohol-free and light beers (0. 49 - 0. 69 g/L) and highest in strong ales (1. 19 - 1. 90 g/L) and German white beers (1. 64 - 1. 78 g/L).

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the abilities of these three immobilized yeasts for producing alcohol for brewing at two temperatures (7 and 12 °C) using two different sugar levels (one at original level supplied in the brewery and one with 2. 5 % (w/v), added glucose to the wort). Increasing both parameters resulted in higher alcohol production by all the yeasts studied. At 7 °C and with <b>original</b> <b>wort</b> density the ethanol content at the end of fermentation was 2. 7 % (v/v) for S. cerevisiae, 1. 7 % for S. ludwigii and 2. 0 % for S. rouxii.

40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-ᴅ-glucan are desired in malt/wort created from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to ensure efficiency during brewing. This goal {{can be achieved}} through low grain β-glucan content, high malt β-glucanase activity, or a combination thereof. Evaluation of these traits is time-consuming and expensive since malting must occur before analysis, thus they are ideal for the identification of associated markers to permit marker-assisted selection. Two genetic mapping approaches were taken to evaluate these traits. First, a bi-parental QTL mapping population was developed from the Western Canadian two-row, spring, hulled varieties CDC Meredith and CDC Kindersley. CDC Meredith has normal to higher grain β-glucan <b>content</b> and higher <b>wort</b> β-glucan <b>content,</b> while CDC Kindersley has normal to lower grain β-glucan content and very low <b>wort</b> β-glucan <b>content.</b> Secondly, a 92 member association mapping (AM) population was assembled consisting of two-row, spring, hulled elite malting breeding lines and varieties derived from eight different barley breeding programs focused on Western Canada. Both populations were grown over a two year period and assessed for kilned malt β-glucanase activity, grain, malt, and <b>wort</b> β-glucan <b>content,</b> plus green malt β-glucanase activity in the AM population. Both populations were genotyped using the Barley 9 K iSELECT Genotyping BeadChip and the QTL population was also genotyped with DArTseq markers. As expected, green malt β-glucanase activity typically had a stronger correlation to malt/wort β-glucan content than did either kilned malt β-glucanase activity or grain β-glucan content. Ten unique QTLs (four for grain β-glucan, two for malt β-glucan, and three for kilned malt β-glucanase) were identified in the QTL population and eight marker-trait associations were identified in the AM population for grain β-glucan, green/kilned malt β-glucanase, or a combination thereof. One common genomic region on chromosome 2 H was identified in both studies which was associated with grain β-glucan content. In the QTL and AM populations, six and five QTLs and marker-trait associations identified were novel, respectively, while the others overlay previously identified regions. In some cases, underlying genes were identified which may explain the observed associations. Lines with high β-glucanase activity and heat stability were identified in the AM population, thus through crossing, lines possessing both of these beneficial traits could be generated. Further trials {{to collect data on}} these traits would be desirable to validate the identified markers and confirm the β-glucanase heat stability data...|$|R

However, the {{free amino nitrogen}} (FAN) and mineral content can be too low, owing to low protein digestibility (PD) and phytate–mineral chelation, respectively. This study evaluated the potential for improvement in yeast nutrition in raw whole sorghum and maize brewing and bioethanol production by genetic modification (GM) of sorghum to improve PD and reduce phytate content, and by treatment with exogenous phytase. While phytase addition decreased sorghum spent grain phytate content (88 %) and content of minerals (17 to 59 %; i. e. increased <b>wort</b> mineral <b>content),</b> it did not affect maize phytate spent grain mineral content or HWE significantly. However, phytase addition did increase maize wort FAN (20 %), sorghum HWE (2. 8 percentage points) and wort FAN (23 %).

The article discusses the effects of different concentrations of flour on the process of mashing, fermentation and the quality of beer. Prepared in the ratio of light barley malt:amaranth flour 90 : 10 and 80 : 20, respectively.  Experimental were chosen of mashing barley malt with the addition of flour. The mashing process started with a temperature of 40  or 500 C. Cytolytic pause was 30 min, protein- 25 min, malt pause was increased up to 30 min. Using 20 % of flour in the total grain charge leads to the increase of first <b>wort</b> extract <b>content</b> to 12. 2 %. By increasing the amount of flour in the grist of grain products increases the saccharification of the mash.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) is an {{economically}} important disease of barley caused by mycotoxin-producing Fusarium species. Resistance to FHB {{is associated with}} several agronomic traits, particularly height. Taller cultivars are generally more resistant; however increased height is less favourable due to the prospect of lodging, creating a trade-off between disease resistance and agronomic qualities. Disease assays with pathogens of differing trophic lifestyles were conducted using barley BRI 1 mutation lines, which display brassinosteroid (BR) insensitivity and a semi-dwarf phenotype. Interestingly, bri 1 semi-dwarf lines did not display increased susceptibility to FHB. Additionally, bri 1 mutation provided advantageous resistance to necrotrophs but did not increase susceptibility to biotrophs, demonstrating an absence of a resistance trade-off. The barley cultivars Chevallier and Armelle display significant FHB resistance, yet also possess a tall height phenotype. To determine whether the resistance of these cultivars was associated with height, bi-parental populations were created by crossing to the short, modern variety NFC Tipple. High density genetic maps of the populations were produced using Genotyping-by-Sequencing and 384 -SNP BeadXpress assays to enable quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of both FHB and agronomic traits. Within the C×T population, a QTL for FHB resistance was identified on chromosome 6 H which {{was not associated with}} either height or heading date, suggesting that resistance in this region is not due to linkage or pleiotropy with these traits. In contrast, FHB resistance within the A×T population was coincident with both height and heading date QTL on 3 H. QTL analysis of malting traits of Chevallier, an English malting landrace, was also undertaken. Chevallier compared favourably to NFC Tipple, a modern malting cultivar, for several malting characteristics including free amino nitrogen, diastatic power and <b>wort</b> β-glucan <b>content.</b> This demonstrates that Chevallier may be a useful potential source of both FHB disease resistance and quality traits...|$|R
40|$|Traditional beer {{fermentation}} is a {{batch process}} in which an amount of yeast cells are suspended in the wort. The fermentation process usually takes five to ten days for complete attenuation. To increase the productivity, several strategies could be adopted, such as increasing the fermentation temperature, increased agitation, the application of continuous fermentation, the use of immobilised yeast, or a combination. However, these variables have a pronounced influence on beer flavour and on the physiology of the yeast. Another promising strategy may be to enhance the amount of suspended yeast cells in the batch fermenter, as this has beenproven effective in decreasing the fermentation time without major deleterious influences on beer quality. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} work was to contribute to a more systematic and complete understanding of the yeast physiology in relation to flavour formation upon so-called high cell density (HCD) fermentations. First of all, the response of different lager yeast strains to the HCD fermentation conditions was investigated. The results pointed out that the rate of fermentation was 2 - 4 times increased when high initial cell levels were used. High viabilities for all yeasts were observed throughout the fermentations. Except for diacetyl, the cell density had only an moderate influence on the flavour profile. Furthermore, yeast strain specific characteristics could not be overlooked as they determined the sensitivity of the yeast to the application of higher cell densities. As the oxygen availability decreased when higher yeast concentrations were pitched, the build-up of unsaturated fatty acids in the initial phase of the fermentation was repressed, and consequently, lower yeast growth rates were obtained. The expression levels of the genes HSP 104 and HSP 12 and the concentration of trehalose were higher with increased pitching rates, suggesting a moderate exposure to stress in case of higher cell concentrations. Though, the viability and the vitality of the yeast population were not affected. With exception of totaldiacetyl and the limited aerobic formation of essential membrane lipids, these results demonstrate that most aspects of the yeast physiology and flavour balance were not negatively affected when the pitching rate was changed. The decreased yeast net growth observed in HCD fermentations can have anegative impact on the physiological stability throughout subsequent yeast generations. Therefore, the use of different oxygen conditions was investigated to improve the growth yield during HCD fermentations. The results showed that increasing the oxygen supply to the yeast, by means ofpreoxygenation or intensive wort oxygenation, stimulated the build-up of essential membrane lipids essential for yeast growth. Wort oxygenationhad a significant decreasing effect on the formation of esters, which was caused by a decreased expression of ATF 1, compared with the other conditions. Lower glycogen and trehalose levels at the end of fermentation were observed in case of the HCD fermentations with oxygenated wort. Next to this, oxidative stress markers (CTT 1 and SOD 1) were induced in case of oxygenated wort, but this had no effect on the viability. However, repetitive exposure to too high concentrations of oxygen is known to be deleterious for the yeast viability. Therefore, optimum oxygen levels for HCD fermentations are needed through the application of yeast preoxygenation in combination with wort aeration. Preoxygenation increased the extent of growth without significantly affecting the yeast physiology, and was selected for further research. Next, successive fermentations of HCD populations were evaluated. It was shown that preoxygenating the yeast was essential for the yeast physiological stability and beer flavour compound consistency of high cell density fermentations during the process of serial repitching. In contrast,the use of non-preoxygenated yeast resulted in inadequate growth, whichcaused insufficient yield of biomass to repitch all eight generations, a decrease in viability, a moderate increase of yeast age, and a dramatic increase of the unwanted flavour compounds acetaldehyde and total diacetyl during the sequential fermentations. Therefore, in order to achievesustainable HCD fermentations throughout serial repitching, adequate yeast growth turned out to be essential. The combination of HCD and high gravity brewing (HGB) was investigated. It was shown that HGB exerted an extra source of stress upon the yeast cells in HCD populations. It was postulated that increased osmotic stress and ethanol stress, as a result of HGB, induced the expression of stress related genes (e. g., GPD 1, HSP 12, SSA 3, and CTT 1) and also triggered higher trehalose levels. Notonly the wort density, but also the relative proportion of sugars dramatically influenced the yeast fermentation performance. As sucrose fully activated the cAMP/PKA signal pathway, stress resistance decreased, lowering the viability of the yeast populations. Hence, it was suggested that the use of sucrose should be restricted to maintain a healthy yeast population. In addition, it was shown that optimisation of the <b>wort</b> FAN <b>content</b> clearly reduced the residual amount of total diacetyl in the HCD beers. Finally, pilot-scale fermentation trials showed that HCD beers could beproduced with similar characteristics as conventionally brewed beers. In conclusion, provided that an appropriate yeast strain is used and that the oxygen supply and wort composition are optimised, HCD fermentations do not negatively affect the yeast physiology and can produce beer ofacceptable quality with great time savings.
