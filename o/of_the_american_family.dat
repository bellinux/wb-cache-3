Products like the BK Stacker and BK XXL {{are aimed at}} late teen to young adult males; health-conscious individuals are offered products such as salads, grilled chicken, and veggie burgers. Products such as the BK Veggie, a meatless burger initially introduced in 2002, target the female and health-oriented demographic using a co-branded marketing program and a patty produced by the Kellogg Company's Morningstar Farms division. Another sub-market in this group is on-the-go parents and commuters; The company's BK Chicken Fries—French-fry cut pieces of breaded chicken—is specifically targeted to this segment. First introduced in 2005, the product was successful enough that Burger King expanded the marketing of chicken fries to the children's demographic with a kid's meal version of the product in 2007. The meal was launched with a cross-promotion in conjunction with Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants.

500|$|The {{following}} year, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) relaxed rules regarding partial nudity on television, which previously forced undergarment {{manufacturers to}} use mannequins in their commercials, despite bathing suits and equally revealing swimwear being allowed. Playtex {{was the first}} to advertise with a live model wearing only a bra from the waist up.

500|$|On June 6, 1988, Donald Wildmon, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Family</b> Association (AFA), {{alleged that}} [...] "The Littlest Tramp" [...] {{depicted}} cocaine use, instigating a media frenzy. The AFA, during its incarnation as the National Federation for Decency, had previously targeted CBS as an [...] "accessory to murder" [...] after a mother killed her daughter following an airing of [...] Concerning Bakshi's involvement with Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, the AFA claimed that CBS [...] "intentionally hired a known pornographer to do a cartoon for children, and then {{allowed him to}} insert {{a scene in which}} the cartoon hero is shown sniffing cocaine." [...] Bakshi responded, [...] "You could pick a still out of Lady and the Tramp and get the same impression. Fritz the Cat wasn't pornography. It was social commentary. This all smacks of burning books and the Third Reich. It smacks of McCarthyism. I'm {{not going to get into}} who sniffs what. This is lunacy!" [...] On CBS's order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage. Wildmon claimed that the edits were [...] "a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine". Despite receiving an award from Action for Children's Television, favorable reviews, and a ranking in Time magazine's [...] "Best of '87" [...] feature, Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures was canceled by CBS following the controversy.|$|E

2500|$|Two former gay lovers, Pete, and {{the narrator}} of the novel Tim, are reunited when Tim needs a ride back to Los Angeles. They go on a surreal {{adventure}} over the next day-and-a-half, {{most of it in}} cars, with memories of the last twenty years, including tea rooms and bathhouses, increasingly enraging them at the AIDS pandemic destruction. Sleep deprived, using gallows humor and self-medicating with mescaline-spiked drinks they travel through an increasingly hostile environment meeting a bizarre and queer cast of supporting characters who fuel undercurrent rage at society's homophobia and the LGBT community's apathy. They meet an occult-obsessed indie filmmaker, leather-dykes, a Southern belle drag queen and then four anarchistic gays who are HIV-positive. The quartet reflect the hopelessness felt as their friends die and the country does little to counteract a [...] "gay" [...] disease. They hope to win the cultural war by assassinating ex-President Ronald Reagan, who did little for the first four years of growing HIV-AIDS epidemic, by bombing him at a church service. Tim and Pete convince the plotters to change targets to a meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Family</b> Association, a group known for its anti-LGBT rhetoric that led to the failed response to AIDS, where there would be fewer [...] "innocent" [...] victims.|$|E
60|$|The lizards {{are five}} in number; a {{peculiar}} species of gecko, Phyllodactylus galapagensis, and four species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>family</b> Iguanidæ. Two {{of these are}} distinct species of the genus Tropidurus, the other two being large, and so very distinct as to be classed in peculiar genera.

These last were originally described as Amblyrhynchus cristatus by Mr. Bell, and A. subcristatus by Gray; they were afterwards placed in two other genera Trachycephalus and Oreocephalus (see Brit. Mus. Catalogue of Lizards), while in a recent paper by Dr. Steindachner, the marine species is again classed as Amblyrhynchus, while the terrestrial form is placed in another genus Conolophus, both genera being peculiar to the Galapagos.|$|E

6000|$|He {{comes to}} the midland {{counties}} of England, where he conceives his claims to lie, and seeks for his ancestral home; but there are difficulties {{in the way of}} finding it, the estates having passed into the female line, though still remaining in the blood. By and by, however, he comes to an old town where there is one of the charitable institutions bearing the name of his family, by whose beneficence it had indeed been founded, in Queen Elizabeth's time. He of course becomes interested in this Hospital; he finds it still going on, precisely {{as it did in the}} old days; and all the character and life of the establishment must be picturesquely described. Here he gets acquainted with an old man, an inmate of the Hospital, who (if the uncontrollable fatality of the story will permit) must have an active influence on the ensuing events. I suppose him to have been an American, but to have fled his country and taken refuge in England; he shall have been a man of the Nicholas Biddle stamp, a mighty speculator, the ruin of whose schemes had crushed hundreds of people, and Middleton's father among the rest. Here he had quitted the activity of his mind, as well as he could, becoming a local antiquary, etc., and he has made himself acquainted with the family history of the Eldredges, knowing more about it than the members of the family themselves do. He had known in America (from Middleton's father, who was his friend) the legends preserved in this branch of the family, and perhaps had been struck by the way in which they fit into the English legends; at any rate, this strikes him when Middleton tells him his story and shows him the document respecting the change of name. After various conversations together (in which, however, the old man keeps the secret of his own identity, and indeed acts as mysteriously as possible) they go together to visit the ancestral mansion. Perhaps it should not be in their first visit that the cabinet, representing the stately mansion, shall be seen. But the Bloody Footstep may; which shall interest Middleton much, both because Hammond has told him the English tradition respecting it, and because too the legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>family</b> made some obscure allusions to his ancestor having left blood--a bloody footstep--on the ancestral threshold. This is the point to which the story has now been sketched out. Middleton finds a commonplace old English country gentleman in possession of the estate, where his forefathers had lived in peace for many generations; but there must be circumstances contrived which shall cause Middleton's conduct to be attended by no end of turmoil and trouble. The old Hospitaller, I suppose, must be the malicious agent in this; and his malice must be motived in some satisfactory way. The more serious question, what shall be the nature of this tragic trouble, and how can it be brought about? ...|$|E
