5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a wave to travel to the first <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E
5|$|From series {{three of}} Robot Wars, the Gauntlet and Trial stages of each heat were dropped, {{with the whole}} of the main {{competition}} formed around direct combat. Razer's first battle of the series was against Backstabber. Scott lowered Razer's arm into an extrusion on Backstabber, and Lewis pushed their opponent into the 'pit', an <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> in the arena floor. In the second round, despite causing damage to Aggrobot, Razer lost due to a mechanical failure: the valve which controls the direction of hydraulic fluid in the arm jammed, causing Razer's arm to raise to its full height and refuse to lower. With its rear wheels off the ground, Razer was weaponless and immobile, and eliminated early from the main competition once more. Outside of the main UK championship, Razer won the concurrent Pinball Warrior Tournament side event and retained the Best Design award.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E

25|$|This is {{the most}} common <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> {{completion}} used today. It is basically the same described on the vertical <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> completion but on a horizontal well it enlarges significantly the contact with the reservoir, increasing the production or injection rates of your well. Sand control on a horizontal well is completely different from a vertical well. We can no longer rely on the gravity for the gravel placement. Most service companies uses an alpha and beta wave design to cover the total length of the horizontal well with gravel. It's known that very long wells (around 6000ft) were successfully gravel packed in many occasions, including deepwater reservoirs in Brazil.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oscillating}} currents flowing {{around the}} cavities, and {{their effect on}} the electron flow within the tube, causes large amounts of microwave radiofrequency energy to be generated in the cavities. The cavities are open on one end, so the entire mechanism forms a single, larger, microwave oscillator. A [...] "tap", normally a wire formed into a loop, extracts microwave energy {{from one of the}} cavities. In some systems the tap wire is replaced by an <b>open</b> <b>hole,</b> which allows the microwaves to flow into a waveguide.|$|E
2500|$|Vibrato: Vibrato can be {{achieved}} on most notes by opening and closing one of the open holes, or by variation of breath pressure (this last is actually both vibrato (pitch modulation), and tremolo (amplitude modulation)). Of the two, fingered (i.e., true) vibrato is much more common than diaphragmatic (breath) vibrato (i.e., tremolo), except on notes like the lowest note on the whistle where fingered vibrato is much more difficult. [...] A common method of achieving vibrato is to finger a note, and then quickly flick a finger on and off, not the hole below the fingered note, but the hole two below the fingered note, leaving an <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> in between. [...] This technique can be heard on The Chieftains' iconic air, Women of Ireland (Chieftains IV).|$|E

2500|$|<b>Open</b> <b>hole</b> keys versus plateau keys: Open-hole [...] "French model" [...] flutes have {{circular}} {{holes in}} the centers of five of the keys. These holes are covered by the fingertips when the keys are depressed. [...] Open-hole flutes are frequently chosen by concert-level flutists, although this preference is less prevalent in Germany, Italy, and Eastern Europe. Students may use temporary plugs to cover the holes until they can reliably cover the holes with the fingertips. Some flutists claim that open-hole keys permit louder and clearer sound projection in the lower register. Open-hole keys are needed for traditional Celtic music and other ethnic styles and some modern concert pieces that require harmonic overtones or [...] "breathy" [...] sounds. They can also facilitate alternate fingerings, [...] "extended techniques" [...] such as quarter-tones, glissando, and multiphonics. Closed holes (plateau keys) permit a more relaxed hand position for some flutists, which can help their playing.|$|E
