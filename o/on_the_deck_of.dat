5|$|After regaining the title, Yokozuna {{challenged}} any American {{athlete to}} bodyslam him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the USS Intrepid on July 4, 1993. After many challengers failed, Lex Luger arrived by helicopter and bodyslammed Yokozuna. Luger became a fan favorite and changed his gimmick to an American patriot. He faced Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993; {{he won the}} match by countout but did not win the title. Lex Luger and Bret Hart each earned a title match against Yokozuna the following year at WrestleMania X. Luger was disqualified in his match, but Hart won the championship later that night.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh later joined Ernest Joyce {{and others}} on a journey across the Great Ice Barrier to Minna Bluff, to lay a depot for Shackleton's polar party, whose return from their {{southern}} march was awaited. On 3 March, while keeping watch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> Nimrod, Mackintosh observed a flare, which signalled the safe return of Shackleton and his party. They had fallen just short of their South Pole objective, having reached a Farthest South of 88° 23' S.|$|E
5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, prominent cases of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged {{for him to be}} examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E

5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} to body slam Yokozuna, Luger {{arrived in a}} helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, {{which led to a}} title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{called for}} {{unconditional}} Japanese surrender in the Potsdam Declaration of 27 July, but the Japanese government rejected the call. In early August, the USAAF dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Allies justified the atomic bombings {{as a military}} necessity to avoid invading the Japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 Allied servicemen and millions of Japanese troops and civilians. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting force. The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E

5|$|The British arrival was {{reportedly}} greeted with derision by the French sailors, until a boarding party clambered onto the frigate from Bedfords deck, {{to be met}} by resistance from the French crew. Mann then ordered his ship's Royal Marines to fire into the French sailors, killing several and driving many more over the side into the harbour. This attack broke their resolve and the French surrendered, several leaping into the sea to escape capture, only to be collected by the boats of Captain. As Modeste was subdued, the boats of Speedy approached the tartanes. As the boat parties boarded the small French warships, the crew of one surrendered while the other resisted the British boarders. A short melee broke out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the tartane, resulting in the captain and one other French sailor wounded and the tartane firmly in British hands. The raid completed, the British squadron withdrew from Genoa with their prizes. British sources reported that one French sailor {{had been killed in}} the operation and ten wounded, while the British boarding parties had survived unscathed, while French sources claimed five killed and 30 wounded or in the most extreme accounts, as many as 50 killed.|$|E
