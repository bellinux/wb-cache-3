The purpose of the present study was to examine how variations in prior notification of a civil settlement would influence juror decision-making.

5000|$|An early {{example of}} an [...] "online only" [...] {{newspaper}} or magazine is [...] "News Report", an online newspaper created by Bruce Parrello in 1974 on the PLATO system at the University of Illinois. Beginning in 1987, the Brazilian newspaper Jornaldodia ran on the state owned Embratel network, moving to the internet in the 1990s. By the late 1990s, hundreds of U.S. newspapers were publishing online versions, but did not yet offer much interactivity. One example is Britain's Weekend City Press Review, which provided a weekly <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> online beginning <b>in</b> 1995. Today, online news has become {{a huge part of}} society which leads people to argue {{whether or not it is}} good for society. Austra Taylor author of the popular book The Peoples Platform argues that online news does not provide the detail needed to fully understand what actually happened. It is more just a fast summary to inform people what happened, but does not give a solution or fixation to the problem.|$|R

50|$|BBC Scotland {{started using}} their own {{continuity}} announcers for all evening and weekend afternoon junctions around 1977; before this period, announcers only covered opt-outs, {{which resulted in the}} London announcer being heard most of the time. From 1979, their duties were expanded to cover the lunchtime news bulletin at 12:40, just before the network Midday News at 12:45. There was one announcer who was never seen: Robert Logan, who was also a Conservative councillor. Consequently, he never read the <b>news</b> <b>summaries,</b> nor did he ever give his name at closedown. From 1985, the announcing team started doing a <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> just before children's programmes at around 15:53, and within a few weeks, additional <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> at 21:25 were introduced. From 31 October 1988, newsroom staff started to read the <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> instead of the announcers.|$|R
