5|$|The ancestral {{function}} of the RNAi system is generally agreed to have been immune defense against exogenous genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes. Related functions such as histone modification may have already been present in the ancestor of modern eukaryotes, although <b>other</b> <b>functions</b> such as regulation of development by miRNA {{are thought to have}} evolved later.|$|E

5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition {{by considering the}} difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of <b>other</b> <b>functions</b> are more easily computed using rules for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} roles of mitochondria are {{to produce the}} energy currency of the cell, ATP (i.e., phosphorylation of ADP), through respiration, and to regulate cellular metabolism. The central set of reactions involved in ATP production are collectively known as the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle. However, the mitochondrion has many <b>other</b> <b>functions</b> {{in addition to the}} production of ATP.|$|E

5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among <b>other</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} <b>other</b> <b>functions.</b> They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve <b>other</b> <b>functions,</b> particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E

5|$|Pteranodon was {{notable for}} its skull crest, though the {{function}} of this crest has been a subject of debate. Most explanations {{have focused on the}} blade-like, backward pointed crest of male P. longiceps, however, and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex. The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, and any <b>other</b> <b>functions</b> were secondary.|$|E
5|$|Some bioluminous {{bacteria}} infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract predators to {{the dead}} insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria and nematodes. A similar reason {{may account for the}} many species of fungi that emit light. Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus, Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium, cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal, but <b>other</b> <b>functions</b> may also be involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{album is}} named after the Office of Strategic Influence, an {{organization}} set up after the September 11 attacks to spread misinformation and plant false news items in the media, among <b>other</b> <b>functions.</b> The Office was shut after The New York Times published a story on it; many of its operations were transferred to the Information Operations Task Force.
