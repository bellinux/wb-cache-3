5|$|Naughty Dog began {{developing}} The Last of Us: Left Behind {{following the}} release of The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>in</b> June 2013, with a team about half the size. Following the decision to create single-player downloadable content for the game, the development team immediately decided that the story would focus {{on the character of}} Ellie; they found that players of The Last of Us were interested to learn about events in Ellie's life prior to the events of the main game, particularly the events involving Riley Abel, whom Ellie mentioned in The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us.</b> <b>In</b> addition, they found that some players were interested in the events that occurred between the Fall and Winter segments of the main game, in which Ellie cares for an injured Joel. This led to the team deciding to contrast these two events against each other, feeling it would help the story's pacing. Game director Bruce Straley said that the team felt the story justified the development of Left Behind.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, it was {{announced}} that Second Sons pre-order sales had surpassed those of The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. Two special edition versions of the game were produced; pre-ordered and first-run copies of the game received the Limited Edition, which includes the Coles Legacy mission pack that explain story events between Infamous 2 and Second Son. The Collector's Edition includes a unique box cover, a replica of Delsin's beanie, eight pins from his vest, an exclusive in-game vest, and a D.U.P.-themed patch. All pre-ordered copies of the game included four in-game vests for Delsin.|$|E

25|$|For twenty-eight days we were prisoners. Sentries at our cabin doors day and night, sentries on deck {{during the}} hour we were daily {{permitted}} to breathe the fresh air. Our men comrades were cooped up in dark, damp quarters, wretchedly fed, all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> complete {{ignorance of the}} direction we were to take.|$|E
25|$|We {{must not}} wait passively. A free Poland is our aim, {{but no one}} will give us that freedom. Our {{passivity}} will result in their murdering more and more <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>in</b> {{more and more people}} suffering. We must educate, because even when a free Poland is achieved, the nation will be so exhausted {{that there will be no}} one to lead it.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 former Tikkun editors accused Lerner of {{publishing}} pseudonymous {{letters to the}} editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.|$|E

500|$|This was {{the series}} {{everybody}} wanted to see {{because of what happened}} in the 2003 ALCS. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said [...] "I think Boston...really are...a mirror image <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> terms of...aggressiveness and desire to win". Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina summarized the build-up: [...] "This is what everyone was hoping for...it's a rematch of last year, with the best two teams in the American League".|$|E

500|$|As {{the winter}} season took hold, {{the party was}} almost {{completely}} restricted to the cramped living quarters. This {{proved to be a}} difficult time; Bernacchi wrote of rising boredom and irritation: [...] "Officers and men, ten <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> all, found tempers wearing thin". During this period of tension and confinement, Borchgrevink's qualities as a commander were found wanting; he was, wrote Bernacchi, [...] "in many respects... not a good leader". Polar historian Ranulph Fiennes writes that in conditions of [...] "democratic anarchy", dirt, disorder and inactivity were the order of the day.|$|E
500|$|Restoring the {{steamroller}} {{placed a}} heavy burden upon his marriage and Alison would often complain that her husband spent {{more time in the}} shed, repairing the engine, than he did in the house.

[...] Alison eventually developed an affection for the antique vehicle saying [...] "We've done without for so many years to get it built up. I couldn't bear to part with it. There's too much <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Kirk Hammett {{commented on}} the lack of guitar solos on St. Anger, a {{departure}} from what Metallica had done in the past: [...] "We wanted to preserve the sound of all four <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a room just jamming. We tried to put guitar solos on, but we kept on running into this problem. It really sounded like an afterthought." [...] Hammett said that he was happy with the final product. Rock stated, [...] "We made a promise to ourselves that we'd only keep stuff that had integrity. We didn't want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs." ...|$|E

Two months later on November 19–20, Colonel Clarence S. Irvine and Lieutenant Colonel G. R. Stanley flew a long-distance testbed B-29 named Pacusan Dreamboat to a world's distance record of 7,916 miles (12,740km) flying nonstop and unrefueled from Guam to Washington, D.C., taking 35 hours and 5 minutes.

500|$|Jones, {{who played}} Les, {{revealed}} that the runaway storyline was tough on him and he began crying when he read the script. He continued [...] "The four <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the Battersby family read our scripts together to work out how {{we are going to}} play our parts. On this occasion, all four of us were sobbing. It is not like a normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary work on The Last of Us, {{under the}} codename [...] "Project Thing" [...] or [...] "T1", began {{after the release}} of [...] in October 2009.

Straley, who was employed at Naughty Dog in March 1999, was selected to lead the project based on his experience and his work on previous projects, while Druckmann, an employee since 2004, was chosen for his determination and talent for design.|$|E

500|$|Insomniac {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "a celebration of games", in which the team pushed existing concepts in a new direction. Besides drawing influences from Prince of Persia, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Jet Set Radio series of games for the game's traversal system, they drew influences from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure for their [...] "Next-Gen Respawn" [...] system, Scott Pilgrim and The Omega Man for the game's setting, and Peggle when they were creating the game's weaponry. The game's humor was inspired by Insomniac's own game series Ratchet & Clank and Spyro the Dragon. There are also references to other pop culture icons such as Breaking Bad and Portal. Despite that, Smith said that the game would be completely different from The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us,</b> <b>in</b> which the unnamed protagonist sometimes broke the fourth wall and communicated with players.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Michael Arndt {{initially}} {{worked for}} {{a year on the}} film's script, calling it [...] "both a brilliantly creative idea but also incredibly challenging," [...] but left the project in early 2011, adding that [...] "knowing the Pixar process, there may not be a single word [...] that remains in the final script! They've had writers work on it since then." [...] Josh Cooley and Meg LeFauve were credited as co-writers of the screenplay following their contributions during the rewrite. Like Docter, Cooley and LeFauve included experiences with raising their own children into the screenplay. Cooley said [...] "... we treated the emotions like parents for Riley and because all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the writing room are parents ourselves, we just reflected on our own experiences as parents to create the characters." [...] Despite his departure, Arndt received an 'Additional Story Material' credit.|$|E
500|$|After her {{inaugural session}} of First Minister's Questions on 22 December 2011, the BBC's Brian Taylor called Lamont's {{performance}} [...] "confident, direct and salient".

[...] Peter Hetherington of The Guardian quotes an unnamed political observer at Holyrood who said, [...] "She's getting under [...] skin like no predecessor." [...] Writing for The Scotsman as Scottish Labour gathered for its conference in April 2013, Andrew Whitaker felt that Lamont's tenure as party leader had been successful, citing Labour's local election achievements and her weekly exchanges with Salmond at First Minister's Questions as examples: [...] "Ms Lamont has made Labour at Holyrood respectable again and less of the laughing stock than the ravaged party that emerged from heavy defeat in 2011." ...|$|E
