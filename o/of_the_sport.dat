5|$|Joseph Cattarinich and Leo Dandurand, {{owners of}} the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens in the 1920s, led the {{participating}} ice hockey arena owners to introduce the new sport. In the 1930s, 6 v 6 indoor lacrosse came to be played in the summer in unused hockey rinks. Canadians adopted the new version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> quickly. Eventually it became the more popular version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> in Canada, supplanting field lacrosse. This form was also adopted as the primary version of the game played on Native American reservations in the US and Canada by Iroquois and other Native peoples., It is the only sport in which the American indigenous people are sanctioned to compete internationally, participating as the Iroquois Nationals.

5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Martin greatly {{influenced}} the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> of curling into a competitive sport. He was an instrumental {{part of the}} group that brought about the Grand Slam of Curling. In the early 2000s, he became the spokesperson for the promotion of the financial growth of curling, represented largely by the World Curling Tour, which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded by corporate sponsorship opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments. The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian Curling Association for its refusal to allow the developments in the World Curling Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier, but also the growth of the Grand Slam, and in doing so, ultimately allowed the sport of curling to become a legitimate spectator sport. The development of the competitive tier <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> also marked a change in both the players <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> and the sport itself, as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of curling games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay.|$|E
