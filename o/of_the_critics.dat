5|$|The final treaty also voided Spanish {{guarantees}} of military support that colonial officials {{had made to}} Native Americans in the disputed regions, greatly weakening those communities’ ability to resist encroachment upon their lands. The treaty represented a major victory for Washington administration, and placated many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> of the Jay Treaty. It also enabled and encouraged American settlers to continue their movement west, by making the frontier areas more attractive and lucrative. The region that Spain relinquished its claim to through the treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798.|$|E

The original version charted in the lower regions of the charts of Australia and its Urban chart, Spain, United Kingdom and on the US R charts.

5|$|The Life of Samuel Johnson or Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D. {{was written}} by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full {{biography}} of Samuel Johnson—with Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins {{was a friend of}} Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did not like him. After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his works. His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's Life of Samuel Johnson came under swift attack from critics, from friends of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Jean Baptiste Lamarck used fossils in his {{arguments}} for {{his theory of}} the transmutation of species in the early 19th century. Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that life had changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic {{during the next few}} decades. Robert Chambers used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that life had progressed from the simple to the complex. These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories. Hugh Miller would make a similar argument, pointing out that the fossil fish found in the Old Red Sandstone formation were fully as complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by Vestiges. While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> {{charged that}} Levin was repeating {{material}} in his plays (Yakish and Poupche, Hamitlabet), although his later plays (The Dreaming Child, Those Who Walk in the Darkness, Repose, and others) received widespread acclaim.|$|E
25|$|Depression era {{literature}} was blunt and direct in its social criticism. John Steinbeck (1902–1968) {{was born in}} Salinas, California, where he set many of his stories. His style was simple and evocative, winning him the favor of the readers but not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics.</b> Steinbeck often wrote about poor, working-class people and their struggle to lead a decent and honest life. The Grapes of Wrath, considered his masterpiece, is a strong, socially-oriented novel that {{tells the story of}} the Joads, a poor family from Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a better life.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the views}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics,</b> La Tosca {{proved to be}} phenomenally successful. It {{ultimately}} had 3000 performances in France alone, played in theatres {{all over the world}} for thirty years, and netted Sardou 500,000 francs. Sarah Bernhardt's costumes brought Empire silhouette dresses back into style, and the long walking stick she carried in Act 1 became a new fashion accessory. Both a leopard in a famous New York menagerie and an American race horse were named in honour of the play's heroine, as were numerous dishes, several of them created by the French chef, Auguste Escoffier, a devotee of Bernhardt.|$|E

25|$|After his death, Trollope's Autobiography {{appeared}} {{and was a}} best-seller in London. Trollope's downfall in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, he confirmed his critics' worst fears. The Muse, in their view, might prove immensely prolific, but she would never ever follow a schedule. Furthermore, Trollope admitted that he wrote for money; {{at the same time}} he called the disdain of money false and foolish. The Muse, claimed the critics, should not be aware of money.|$|E
25|$|The {{play was}} written between 1961 and 1962, drawing on Stoppard's {{experiences}} as a Bristol theatre critic. It was initially named The Stand-ins and later, The Critics. It is a parody of the stereotypical parlor mystery {{in the style of}} Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, as well as <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> watching the play, with their personal desires and obsessions interwoven into their bombastic and pompous reviews. The title is a direct reference to the ending of The Mousetrap, a play well known for guarding the secrecy of its twist ending, although the producers of Agatha Christie's play could not publicly object without drawing even more attention to the fact.|$|E
25|$|The {{reputation}} of the author was confirmed and extended by the appearance, in 1827, of Hope Leslie, the most decided favourite of all her novels. She wrote other things afterward, that {{in the opinion of}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> are superior to either Redwood or Hope Leslie. But these later writings had to jostle their way among a crowd of competitors, both domestic and foreign. Her earlier works stood alone, and Hope Leslie, especially, became firmly associated in the public mind with the rising form of a native literature. It was not only read with satisfaction but familiarly quoted and applauded as a source of national pride. Her subsequent novels followed at about uniform intervals, Clarence, a Tale of our Own Times appearing in 1830.|$|E

25|$|The 1950-51 side under Freddie Brown...was full of inexperienced {{players and}} we paid the penalty. I'm sure {{if we had}} {{selected}} one or two solid players such as Jack Robertson, Dennis Brookes, Jack Ikin and Bill Edrich we would have won the Ashes - in spite of once again being caught on a glue-pot at Brisbane. Two Tests were lost by a very small margin and we won the last. In addition Denis Compton was a complete failure in the Tests, scoring only 53 runs in four matches. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> the bowling proved adequate and Freddie Brown did a grand job {{in view of the}} shortcomings of the side. To me the annoying part was that we had players in England who could have won the series for us.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th century {{evolutionary}} ideas were most strongly disputed by the premillennialists, who {{held to a}} prophecy of the imminent return of Christ based on a form of Biblical literalism, and were convinced that the Bible would be invalidated if any error in the Scriptures was conceded. However, hardly any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> of evolution at that time were as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the Edenic creation to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings. In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth, the progressive nature of the fossil record. Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists. Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of {{the first chapter of}} the Book of Genesis, or allowed that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days.|$|E
25|$|According to Goenner, the {{contributions}} to the book are a mixture of mathematical–physical incompetence, hubris, and the feelings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> of being suppressed by contemporary physicists advocating for the new theory. The compilation of the authors show, Goenner continues, {{that this was not}} a reaction within the physics community—only one physicist (Karl Strehl) and three mathematicians (Jean-Marie Le Roux, Emanuel Lasker and Hjalmar Mellin) were present—but a reaction of an inadequately educated academic citizenship, which didn't know what to do with relativity. As regards the average age of the authors: 57% were substantially older than Einstein, one third was around the same age, and only two persons were substantially younger. Two authors (Reuterdahl, von Mitis) were antisemitic and four others were possibly connected to the Nazi movement. On the other hand, no antisemitic expression can be found in the book, and it also included contributions of some authors of Jewish ancestry (Salomo Friedländer, Ludwig Goldschmidt, Hans Israel, Emanuel Lasker, Oskar Kraus, Menyhért Palágyi).|$|E
