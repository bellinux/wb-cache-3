500|$|A major {{rift between}} Johnson and Millererstwhile rivals for the Australian captaincydeveloped during the Fourth Test, played at Kensington Oval in Barbados. During the third day, Miller, bowling fast-medium swingers, had {{dismissed}} Everton Weekes and Collie Smith {{in quick succession}} to leave the West Indies at 6/147 with Denis Atkinson and Clairmonte Depeiaza batting. Johnson, thinking that the two batsmen would be vulnerable to express pace, asked Miller to increase his bowling speed. [...] When Miller refused, Johnson remonstrated with him: [...] "I'll say who bowls and what they bowl". With Miller refusing to bowl as directed, Johnson replaced him in the attack with Ray Lindwall. [...] Walking off the field {{at the end of}} the day's play and continuing in the dressing room, Miller provoked Johnson, telling him he [...] "couldn't captain a team of schoolboys", among other insults. Finally Johnson responded, asking [...] "If you want to go <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> why don't we go around the back and thrash it out?" [...] The much larger Miller declined the offer and the pair travelled back to the team hotel together. [...] The next day, Atkinson and Depeiaza batted throughout the entire day's play. [...] Their partnership of 347runs for the seventh wicket is still a world record.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{scheduled}} to spend June and July 2006 on the main stage of the Warped Tour, but on July 28, 2006, {{it was announced that}} Underoath was dropping off the remaining dates of the tour. A statement from the band stated that the members [...] "felt it necessary to take some immediate time to focus on our friendship, as that's more important than risking it for the sake of touring at this time." [...] In an Alternative Press cover story on Underoath, Michael [...] "Fat Mike" [...] Burkett told the magazine that Chamberlain had confided in him that Underoath's band members had been [...] "having a lot of arguments over their religious beliefs." [...] Burkett admitted to Punknews.org that he had poked fun at the band for their beliefs, but emphasized that he befriended Underoath's band members {{at the start of the}} tour and had a personal policy of not making jokes on-stage about anyone he was not friends with or did not like personally. It was also spread that the band's withdrawal from the tour was due to Chamberlain's rumored drug problems and time spent in rehabilitation, to which Gillespie responded, [...] "If there was something serious going <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and he was in rehab, we'd have to tell the press. But it's just not true." [...] Underoath toured extensively throughout Europe, Australia and Asia in the late 2006, from February to April in 2007 toured with Taking Back Sunday and Armor for Sleep.|$|E
2500|$|Kinney {{mentioned}} in a February 2006 {{interview that he}} would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains. He explained, [...] "If we found some other dude, I'd love to move on, write some cool tunes and change the name and go <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I don't see continuing as Alice and replacing somebody. ... We're not trying to replace Layne. We want to play these songs one more time, and if it seems like the right thing to do, it'll happen. I don't know how long it will go or where it will take us. It's kind of a tribute to Layne and our fans, the people who love these songs. It's not some 'I'm broke and I need the money' situation. We love playing together." ...|$|E
