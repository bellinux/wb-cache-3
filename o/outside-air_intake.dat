50|$|The {{cabin air}} filter is {{typically}} a pleated-paper filter that {{is placed in the}} <b>outside-air</b> <b>intake</b> for the vehicle's passenger compartment. Some of these filters are rectangular and similar in shape to the combustion air filter. Others are uniquely shaped to fit the available space of particular vehicles' outside-air intakes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next step}} is to {{dehumidify}} the air. Cooling the air has caused any water vapor it contains to condense into fog, which can be removed using a cyclonic separator. Historically, the water extracted by the separator was simply dumped overboard, but newer ACMs instead spray it into the <b>outside-air</b> <b>intakes</b> for each heat exchanger, which gives the coolant a greater heat capacity and improves efficiency. (It also means that running the ACM on an airplane parked on the tarmac does not leave a puddle.) ...|$|R
40|$|Any {{microorganism}} {{that causes}} disease or produces toxins {{can be used}} as a biological weapon. For design purposes, the following can be used to represent the entire array of possible BW agents: • Anthrax spores, which are relatively easy to filter, but resistant to UVGI—except at very high doses. 1 • Smallpox, which is one of the most penetrating microor-ganisms for filters, but highly susceptible to UVGI. • TB bacilli, which are mid-sized bacteria removable by either filtration or UVGI. • Influenza, a small virus of variable lethality that has caused epidemics around the world. • Botulinum toxin, which is the deadliest toxin known and used to represent many other toxins that might be used as BW agents. Toxins are poisonous com-pounds produced by plants, Events following Sept. 11, 2001 —particu-larly the anthrax mail scare—heightenedawareness of the threat of bioterrorism. One method of dealing with this threat is the appli-cation of immune-building technologies. Immune build-ings are those that suppress or resist harmful microbial con-tamination—airborne or oth-erwise. The primary immune-building technologies for controlling airborne pathogens are dilution ventilation, filtra-tion, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). This arti-cle reviews the effectiveness of these technologies in mitigat-ing the threat to occupants posed by the release of five representative biological-weapon (BW) agents in a model multistory building’s <b>outside-air</b> <b>intakes.</b> A compari-son of the predicted casualties with and without air-cleaning technologies installed provides a basis for evaluating the limits of protection.
