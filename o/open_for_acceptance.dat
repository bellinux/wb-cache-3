5000|$|The case itself {{concerns}} the possible sale of potatoes by a Forfar potato merchant {{to an international}} potato merchant in Amsterdam, on 29 November 1977. The Forfar merchant telexed an offer (<b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> till 17.00 hrs., 30 November 1977) to sell potatoes to the international merchant, subject to certain conditions regarding delivery dates and sizes. By telex dated 30 November 1977, the international merchant purported to accept the offer, subject to certain additional conditions. Following a telephone conversation between the parties to clarify the position, the international merchant by further telex dated 30 November 1977, sent within the time-limit, again purported to accept the original offer but requested that their conditions telexed in their first telex, should be given consideration. The Forfar merchant did not supply the potatoes and was sued for damages. The question arose as to {{whether there was a}} valid contract with consensus in idem ever constituted between the parties.|$|E

40|$|Oswald Hall {{is one of}} the “outsiders” who has profoundly {{impacted}} Canadian chiropractic and by extension, {{its various}} constituencies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to document how Dr. Hall used the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience assimilated in his career, to interact with the chiropractic profession and the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC). Dr. Hall’s main achievement for chiropractic was to quietly, firmly, yet politely, <b>open</b> doors <b>for</b> the <b>acceptance</b> by and of chiropractic and CMCC into the arena of graduate level professional education. He did this in three ways: Dr. Hall’s first step took place in 1973, when as Chair of the Task Force on Chiropractic for the OCH, he assisted the committee to make positive recommendations regarding our education and practice. Dr. Hall’s second step was his contribution to the sociological study culminating in the book, “Chiropractors: Do They Help. ” His third, and most complex initiative began in 1982 when he joined the CMCC Board. His stamina and affability were tested during his sixteen year tenure on the University Affiliation Committee as the College endured protracted, failed attempts to unite with the University of Victoria, BC (1988 – 1992) and York University, Toronto, ON (1995 – 2001) ...|$|R
