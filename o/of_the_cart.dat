25|$|The poem {{features}} {{a version of}} the hero's childhood, including {{the death of his father}} Pant (Ban) and his upbringing by a water fay, that is similar to that contained in the Prose Lancelot and mentioned in Chrétien de Troyes' Lancelot, the Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cart,</b> but it deviates very strikingly from the familiar version of Lancelot's life in other respects. The most notable among these is the absence of the hero's famous love affair with Arthur's wife Guinevere; when Ginover (Guinevere) is abducted by King Valerin it is not Lanzelet who rescues her, and Lanzelet eventually finds love elsewhere with a young princess named Iblis. It has been suggested that Lancelot, who is mentioned for the first time by Chrétien de Troyes in his first romance Erec and Enide, was originally the hero of a story independent of the adulterous love triangle and perhaps very similar to Ulrich's version. If this is true, then the adultury facet would have been added either by Chrétien in Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> or the source provided him by his patron, Marie de Champagne.|$|E

25|$|Oftentimes it is {{beneficial}} to use Newton's Second Law instead of Lagrange's equations because Newton's equations give the reaction forces at the joint between the pendulum and the cart.

25|$|In medieval romances, one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} story arcs is Queen Guinevere's tragic love affair with her husband's chief knight, Lancelot. This story first appeared in Chrétien de Troyes's Lancelot, the Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> and became a motif in Arthurian literature, starting with the Lancelot-Grail of the early 13th century and carrying through the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Guinevere and Lancelot's betrayal of Arthur preceded his eventual defeat at the Battle of Camlann by Mordred.|$|E
25|$|Chrétien de Troyes tells {{yet another}} version of Guinevere's abduction, this time by Meleagant (whose name is {{possibly}} derived from Melwas) in Lancelot, the Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cart.</b> The abduction sequence is largely a reworking of that recorded in Caradoc's work, but here the queen's rescuer is not Arthur (or Yder) but Lancelot, whose adultery with the queen is dealt with {{for the first time}} in this poem. It has been suggested that Chrétien invented their affair to supply Guinevere with a courtly extramarital lover. Mordred could not be used as his reputation was beyond saving, and Yder had been forgotten entirely.|$|E
25|$|Marie de France's lai was {{composed}} {{at a time}} when the story of King Arthur was not fully developed, and probably before the story of the love between Lancelot and Queen Guinevere had been added to it by Chrétien de Troyes in his Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cart.</b> Thomas Chestre describes a 10-year period during which Launfal prospers at Arthur's bachelor court, followed by Arthur's marriage to Guinevere. In the 13th-century French Arthurian romances, Merlin warns against this marriage; in Chestre's poem, he arranges it, betraying Chestre's willingness to adapt an established legend in his own way.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} five works of Chrétien de Troyes, Gawain became a very popular figure in French chivalric romances in the later 12th century. Chrétien uses Gawain as a major {{character}} and establishes some characteristics that pervade later depictions, including his unparalleled courteousness and his way with women. His romances set the pattern often followed in later works in which Gawain serves as an ally to the protagonist and a model of knighthood to whom others are compared. However, in Chrétien's later romances, especially Lancelot, the Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> and Perceval, the Story of the Grail, the title heroes prove morally superior to Gawain, who follows the rules of courtliness to the letter rather than the spirit.|$|E
25|$|In the 1170s Chretien de Troyes wrote {{a romance}} called The Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> {{in which an}} unknown knight, only much later {{revealed}} to be Sir Lancelot, travels into a land to which the only access is via a 'Sword Bridge' and an 'Underwater Bridge'. Near {{the end of this}} tale, having achieved the release of many people from King Arthur's court who had been held prisoner in this land, including Queen Guinevere, Lancelot attends a tournament in disguise, wearing a red shield. He is invincible but then, following secret instructions from Queen Guinevere, he behaves like an incompetent fool, then he as an invincible knight once again, before leaving the tournament without anybody except the queen knowing who it is.|$|E
25|$|The {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a classic}} problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms (PID controllers, state space representation, neural networks, fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, etc.). Variations on this problem include multiple links, allowing the motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum, and balancing the cart-pendulum system on a see-saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where {{the center of gravity}} is located behind the center of drag causing aerodynamic instability. The understanding of a similar problem can be shown by simple robotics {{in the form of a}} balancing cart. Balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger is a simple demonstration, and the problem is solved by self-balancing personal transporters such as the Segway PT, the self-balancing hoverboard and the self-balancing unicycle.|$|E
50|$|Fidelipac was {{originally}} a 1/4 in analog recording tape, two-track format. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks {{was used for}} monaural program audio, and the other being used for a cue track to control the player, where either a primary cue tone was recorded to automatically stop <b>the</b> <b>cart,</b> a secondary tone was recorded to automatically re-cue <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> to <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cart's</b> program material (in some models, two secondary tones, one after the program material, and one before it, were recorded to have <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> machine automatically fast-forward through any leftover blank tape at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a <b>cart's</b> program), or a tertiary tone, which was used by some players to trigger another cart player or another form of external equipment. Later versions used three tracks, two for stereo audio, and the third for the cue track.|$|R

25|$|A typical dovecot or doocot {{is located}} {{above the door}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> shed building. The doocot is a typical feature of country estates, {{as the right to}} build one was {{strictly}} limited to the major landowners initially, and only later were small freeholders permitted to build them; at a more recent date tenants could sometimes gain permission from their landlord to build doocots to provide food or to add a picturesque feature to their properties. (Peters 2003). In the Middle Ages doocots or pigeon-houses were a badge of manorial privilege and distinctive, often very ornate buildings were constructed (Buxbaum 1987). The Kittochside doocot is a simple and practical design, however the problem of the pigeons feeding off the farm crops still had to be balanced against the benefits of the all year round meat supply that the doocot provided. A lean-to gig shed, (gig: a light, two-wheeled sprung cart pulled by one horse) was built {{at the north end of}} the stable in the early 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} and specific source for his romances are uncertain. He speaks in the vaguest {{way of the}} materials he used, and though Celtic influence is detectable in the stories, {{there is no direct}} evidence that he had Celtic written sources. Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned Erec, Lancelot, Gornemant and many others who {{play an important role in}} Chrétien's narratives. One is left to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore that goes back to a Celtic source in the case of Béroul, an Anglo-Norman who wrote around 1150. However, Chrétien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his own day. And Chrétien's five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French chivalry. Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chrétien was influenced by the changing face of secular and canonical law in the 12th century. This is particularly relevant for his Lancelot, the Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chrétien's day.|$|E
