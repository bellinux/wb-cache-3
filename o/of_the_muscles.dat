5|$|Rumination syndrome, or Merycism, is an under-diagnosed chronic {{motility}} disorder {{characterized by}} effortless regurgitation of most meals following consumption, {{due to the}} involuntary contraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> around the abdomen. There is no retching, nausea, heartburn, odour, or abdominal pain associated with the regurgitation, as there is with typical vomiting. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence {{is as high as}} 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities).|$|E

5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, but most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, {{as well as the}} arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can {{be transmitted}} through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-dimensional {{finite element model}} of skeletal muscle which was developed to simulate active and passive non-linear mechanical behaviours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> during lengthening or shortening under either quasi-static or dynamic condition. Constitutive relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> was determined by using a strain energy approach, while active contraction behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fibre was simulated by establishing a numerical algorithm based on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hill's three-element <b>muscle</b> model. <b>The</b> proposed numerical algorithm {{could be used to}} predict concentric, eccentric, isometric and isotonic contraction behaviours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle.</b> <b>The</b> proposed numerical algorithm and constitutive model for <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> were derived and implemented into a non-linear large deformation finite element programme ABAQUS by using user-defined material subroutines. A number of scenarios have been used to demonstrate capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model for simulating both quasi-static and dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle.</b> Validation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed model has been performed by comparing the simulated results with <b>the</b> experimental ones <b>of</b> frog gastrocenemius <b>muscle</b> deformation. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fusiform <b>muscle</b> geometry and fibre orientation on the stress and fibre stretch distributions of frog muscle during isotonic contraction have also been investigated by using the proposed model. <b>The</b> predictability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present model for dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> has been demonstrated by simulating <b>the</b> extension <b>of</b> a squid tentacle during a strike to catch prey.

5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles,</b> including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
5|$|The two valves of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining the valves together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both valves. The position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the hinge line of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
