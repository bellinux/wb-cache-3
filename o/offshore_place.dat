Report Summary In early 2008, the Commission commended the Australian Government for ending the so-called ‘Pacific solution’ by closing the offshore immigration detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island. Since then, the government has initiated further positive reforms, in particular the July 2008 announcement of ‘New Directions’ for Australia’s immigration detention system. However, despite these positive changes, the Commission has ongoing concerns – {{one of the most}} critical being the mandatory detention and offshore processing of asylum seekers on Christmas Island. While there are clearly significant efforts being put into the detention and offshore processing system on Christmas Island, those efforts cannot overcome the fundamental problems with the system itself. The Commission’s major concerns can be summarised as follows: Excision and offshore processing Asylum seekers who arrive in excised offshore places such as Christmas Island are barred from the refugee status determination system that applies on the mainland under Australian law. Instead, they go through a ‘non-statutory’ process governed by guidelines that are not legally binding. They have no access to the Refugee Review Tribunal and very limited access to the Australian courts. They must rely on a non-compellable and non-reviewable Ministerial discretion to be allowed to apply for a protection visa. Mandatory detention, without judicial oversight Asylum seekers (including children) who arrive by boat without a valid visa in an excised <b>offshore</b> <b>place</b> are mandatorily detained on Christmas Island despite the fact that the Migration Act does not require this. Further, the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Migration Act) purports to bar them from challenging the lawfulness of their detention in the Australian courts. Detention of unaccompanied minors and families with children Some children (including unaccompanied children) are detained in a closed immigration detention facility on Christmas Island – the ‘construction camp’. The Commission considers this a concerning regression from the 2005 changes to the Migration Act which affirmed the principle that children should only be detained as a last resort. There is a conflict of interest created by having the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship or DIAC officers act as the legal guardian for unaccompanied minors detained on Christmas Island. There is also a lack of clarity about responsibilities and procedures relating to child welfare and protection for children in immigration detention on the island. Detention in a small, remote community Asylum seekers on Christmas Island are detained in a small community in a remote location where their access to appropriate services including health and mental health care, legal advice, cultural and religious support, and community-based advocacy and support networks is more limited than it would be on the mainland. The remote location and limited facilities and infrastructure on Christmas Island make it a difficult place in which to ensure implementation of some key aspects of the government’s New Directions – in particular the intention to use immigration detention centres only as a last resort, and the presumption that unauthorised arrivals will be released into the community once their health, identity and security checks are completed. The shortage of community-based accommodation appears to be preventing the release of some detainees from closed detention facilities into community detention. The remote location of Christmas Island makes the immigration detention operations there less visible and transparent to the Australian public, and less accessible for external scrutiny bodies. Conditions and treatment of detainees The immigration detention facilities on Christmas Island are not appropriate for detaining asylum seekers, particularly those with a background of torture or trauma. The Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) is a high security detention centre that looks like a prison. The construction camp facility is not appropriate for unaccompanied minors or families with children. While some detainees on Christmas Island expressed positive views about their treatment, others expressed frustration about the restrictions placed on them during the initial ‘separation detention’ phase, the length of time they had been detained, their lack of access to external excursions, and difficulties accessing interpreters and translated documents. Under the Refugee Convention, asylum seekers should not be penalised because of their method of arrival. Regardless of how or where they arrive in Australia, all people are entitled to protection of their fundamental human rights, including the right to seek asylum. The excision and offshore processing regime establishes a two-tiered system for determining refugee status. Asylum seekers who arrive in excised offshore places such as Christmas Island have fewer legal safeguards than those who arrive on the mainland. In the Commission’s view this undermines the core principles of the Refugee Convention, jeopardises asylum seekers’ human rights and increases the risk that a refugee may be sent back to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened. Further, the policy of detaining all unauthorised boat arrivals in a place as small and remote as Christmas Island restricts asylum seekers’ access to essential services and support networks, and limits the ability of the Australian Government to ensure that those people are treated in accordance with key aspects of its own New Directions policy. The Commission therefore reiterates its past recommendations that the provisions of the Migration Act relating to excised offshore places should be repealed; people should not be held in immigration detention on Christmas Island; and all unauthorised arrivals who make claims for asylum should have those claims assessed through the refugee status determination system that applies under the Migration Act.  ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{use of the}} Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) as a {{distributive}} {{medium is}} seen by many businesses as a legitimate way to cut costs of operation. Confidence is growing {{in the use of}} this medium to transact business because of the increasing sophistication of firewalls, encryption software, and digital key technology. This paper presents empirical evidence from one offshore financial center where the process of legislative and regulatory reform put in place to establish confidence in the traditional provision of offshore financial services is now being used to regulate and legitimize the online distribution of such services. The results show that all firms surveyed for this study use the Internet for routine brochure-ware purposes and the larger firms (particularly in the offshore life insurance sector) are developing more sophisticated customized transactional functions via extranet platforms. Tensions exist though with respect to "regulatory grasp" via the Internet, as <b>offshore</b> <b>places</b> are being put under increased pressure by supranational organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to require greater transparency in offshore financial transactions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to conduct an {{international}} market selection which {{will result in a}} suitable choice of market for an SME that is about to <b>place</b> <b>offshore</b> production in an emerging market. A focus during the thesis is directed towards potential risks that may occur and how SMEs can manage these. In order to fulfill this purpose the authors have developed two main research questions:How can an SME use the IMS-framework to select an emerging market for offshore production?How can an SME manage potential risks when <b>placing</b> <b>offshore</b> production in an emerging market?The theoretical framework consists of the description of the international market selection process that is relevant as it is the framework from which the selection of a target market originates. Further, a description of theories on entry modes and risk management is presented in order to provide insight on how SMEs can manage risks when placing production in an emerging market. The empirical chapter consists of interviews from a case company as well as Business Sweden and is structured in accordance to the theoretical chapter. In the analysis the theoretical frameworks are discussed and connected to the empirical findings. In the initial part of the analysis the international market selection is presented and discussed before it culminates in the authors chosen target market. The latter part of the analysis addresses the risk management SMEs is faced with when <b>placing</b> <b>offshore</b> production in an emerging market. The conclusion provides the reader with the chosen target market for the case company. It also shows that SMEs ought to apply a risk averse mindset when placing their production in an emerging market.
