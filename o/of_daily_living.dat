5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties {{up to eight}} years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> The most noticeable deficit is short term memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of pain depends {{mainly on the}} location of the cancer and the stage of the disease. At any given time, about half of all people diagnosed with malignant cancer are experiencing pain, and two thirds of those with advanced cancer experience pain of such intensity that it adversely affects their sleep, mood, social relations and activities <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E
5|$|No {{treatments}} stop {{or reverse}} its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing {{a burden on}} the caregiver; the pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programmes may be beneficial with respect to activities <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> and can potentially improve outcomes. Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common, but not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with {{an increased risk of}} early death.|$|E

5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the relationship between self-efficacy and independence <b>of</b> activity <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> on stroke patient. The study method was quantitative descriptive correlation with cross-sectional approach. A consecutive sampling was used to recruit 73 participants with the criteria of both hemorrhagic and non hemorrhagic stroke patients aged 22 - 65 years, with stroke length 6 - 24 weeks. The data was collected using questionnaires, The Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and Barthel Index. The research result showed that 91. 8 % stroke patient have high self-efficacy and 83. 6 % stroke patient have an independence in activity <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> The result also showed that there was a positive correlation between self-efficacy and independence <b>of</b> activity <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> (p value: 0. 001; r correlation 0. 675), it means that the higher self-efficacy will increase the independence in activity <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> This study can be used as a suggestion for stroke patient, family, nurse, and hospital to enhance stroke patient’s self-efficacy to achieve independence <b>of</b> activity <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> by give verbal persuasion for stroke patients...|$|R
40|$|Poster Session CBackground: Most {{people with}} chronic {{schizophrenia}} {{suffer from the}} deterioration <b>of</b> adaptive <b>daily</b> <b>living,</b> which is associated with impaired quality of life, sense of control, and poor prognosis of the illness. And thus, the maintenance <b>of</b> adaptive <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> is a focus of psycho-social care for people with schizophrenia. The benefits of regular exercise in enhancing physical well-being of people with chronic illness have been documented in the literature, however little is known on its impact on people with chronic schizophrenia. Purpose: To {{purpose of the study}} is to explore the effectiveness of a 12 -week exercise program in improving <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> ability <b>of</b> Chinese with chronic schizophrenia receiving healthcare service in a residential setting. Methods: The study adopted a non-blind, 2 -arm randomized-controlled study design. A total of 90 participants were recruited and randomized into either the 12 -week Exercise Group or a Wait-List Control Group. Participants were surveyed before and immediate post-intervention on a measurement <b>of</b> adaptive <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> skills (ADL). Results: Findings suggested that significant Time x Group effects on the measurement <b>of</b> adaptive <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> (F(1, 91) = 7. 62, p ≤. 01) were found. Participants in the Exercise Group showed significant improvements in their adaptive <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> skills (T 0 : 94. 04; T 1 : 98. 94) at immediate post-intervention when compared with those who are in the Wait-List Control Group (T 0 : 95. 98; T 1 : 95. 87). Implications: Regular exercise regime improves the ability in adaptive <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> <b>of</b> people with chronic schizophrenia residing in a long-term care setting; whereas those who do not have a regular exercise regime showed deterioration in this aspect. Therefore, our finding implied that exercise appeared to reverse the deleterious effect of schizophrenia has on adaptive daily living; suggesting that the development of an exercise regime should be considered as part of the psycho-social support service for people with chronic schizophrenia to help them regain sense of control in their <b>daily</b> <b>living...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the nature of the}} relationship between europsychologi-cal tests, the Halstead-Reitan Battery, and a measure of everyday living ability, the Community Competence Scale. The sample consisted of 40 geriatric patients referred for suspected ementia.

Although some sperific neuropsychological measures, or combination of mea-sures, were more predictive <b>of</b> particular functional <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> skills, their rela-tionship did not necessarily follow logical or theoretical expectations. Thus, while it may be safe for neuropsychologists to make predictions about a patient’s global capacity to function independently, predictions regarding specific func-tional <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> skills may be unwarranted.
