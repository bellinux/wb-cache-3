50|$|Jocelyne Cesari, in {{her study}} of {{discrimination}} against Muslims in Europe, finds that anti-Islamic sentiment {{may be difficult to}} separate from other drivers of discrimination. Because Muslims are mainly from immigrant backgrounds and the largest group of immigrants in many Western European countries, xenophobia overlaps with Islamophobia, and a person may have one, the other, or both. So, for example, some people who have a negative perception of and attitude toward Muslims may also show this toward non-Muslim immigrants, either as a whole or certain groups (such as, for example, Eastern Europeans, sub-Saharan Africans, or Roma), whereas others would not. Nigel Farage, for example, is anti-EU and in favor of crackdowns on immigration from Eastern Europe, but is favourable to immigration from Islamic Commonwealth countries such as Nigeria and Pakistan. In the United States, where immigrants from Latin America and Asia dominate and Muslims are a comparatively small fraction, xenophobia and Islamophobia may be more easily separable. Classism is another <b>overlapping</b> <b>factor</b> in some nations. Muslims have lower income and poorer education in France, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands while Muslims in the US have higher income and education than the general population. In the UK, Islam is seen as a threat to secularism in response to the calls by some Muslims for blasphemy laws. In the Netherlands, Islam is seen as a socially conservative force that threatens gender equality and the acceptance of homosexuality.|$|E

In this paper, we review one of the filter bank multicarrier technique-staggered multi tone modulation, discuss its efficient implementation in polyphase form and compare between several performance parameters of the same. We also discuss the role of <b>overlapping</b> <b>factor</b> in staggered multi tone modulation systems. We describe a low complexity procedure for generation of the required overlapping factors based on frequency sampling method. Our simulations describe the effectiveness of the optimum value selection for <b>overlapping</b> <b>factor</b> in a staggered multi tone modulation system. The proposed system is theoretically found to be compatible with the Long Term Evolution standards. The performance evaluation of the proposed system in ideal conditions emphasizes about the reduction in spectrum leakage in sidebands of the staggered multi tone modulation system, along with a little increase in system complexity.

However, in certain cases with limited accessibility, single-sided laser beam joining is considered. In the present study, single-sided welding of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V and nickel-based alloy Inconel 600 in a T-joint configuration was carried out using continuous-wave (CW), low-power Ytterbium (Yb) -fiber laser. The influence of the <b>overlapping</b> <b>factor</b> and welding speed of the laser beam on weld morphology and properties was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively.

40|$|Several {{stars at}} the low-metallicity extreme of the Galactic halo show large spreads of [Pb/hs]. Theoretically, a s-process pattern should be {{obtained}} from an AGB star with fixed metallicity and initial mass. For the third dredge-up and the s-process model, several important properties depend primarily on the core mass of AGB stars. Zijlstra (2004) reported that the initial-final-mass relation steepens at low metallicity, due to low mass-loss efficiency. This perhaps affects the model parameters of the AGB stars, e. g. the <b>overlap</b> <b>factor</b> and the neutron irradiation time, in particular at low metallicity. The calculated results show indeed that the <b>overlap</b> <b>factor</b> and the neutron irradiation time are significantly small at low metallicities, especially for 3. 0 Msun AGB stars.

30|$|Considering short packet {{transmission}} in URLLC service or TDD systems, short pulses are desirable to enable low-latency transmission of packets spread over very few symbols and fast switching between uplink and downlink. Long symbols, on the contrary, would yield long transitions times {{due to their}} symbol tails. Given these circumstances, pulse-shaped OFDM with small <b>overlapping</b> <b>factor</b> K should be chosen, basically extending the symbol duration by up to half the symbol interval at maximum, i.e. K∈ [1; 1.5]. If K∼ 1 is chosen, the solution reduces to W-OFDM. Considering the numerology design for these cases, e.g., subcarrier spacing, symbol interval, and symbol overhead, the methodology for OFDM/W-OFDM systems described in Section 2.3 can be adopted, followed by an optimization of the designed pulse shape. It should be noted here that a larger CP length allows for improving the spectral containment, similar as increasing the symbol length characterized by the <b>overlapping</b> <b>factor</b> K, as indicated in Table 8. Hence, balancing between CP length and symbol length may be a useful consideration in some scenarios to allow finding the optimum solution.|$|E
