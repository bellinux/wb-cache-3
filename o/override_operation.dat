First, it supports application developers to build a graphics interface for manipulating with 2 D devices their own 3 D data representations, without intimate knowledge of its internal structure. Second, it provides facilities for interface researchers to create and experiment 3 D widgets from reusable draggers and 2 D– 3 D mapping strategies. Finally, it permits graphics experts to implement sophisticated draggers and complex 2 D- 3 D mapping strategies by <b>overriding</b> <b>operations</b> of the predefined abstract classes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The tier aspect model {{addresses}} Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) in {{the context}} of database applications. It is a new technique of separation of concerns through tiers implemented as virtual object-oriented updatable views. The code of an aspect related to particular objects is encapsulated within a separate view that <b>overrides</b> all generic <b>operations</b> performed on the objects. Aspect tiers form a chain of views. Such additional codes can do any extra action e. g. security, licensing, integrity constraints, monitoring and others. The idea is based on the Stack-Based Approach to object-oriented query languages and the novel idea of virtual updatable views. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{management}} of change logs is crucial in different areas of information systems like data replication, data warehousing, and process management. One barrier that hampers the (intelligent) use of respective change logs is the possibly large amount of unnecessary and redundant data provided by them. In particular, change logs often contain information about changes which actually have {{had no effect on}} the original data source (e. g., due to subsequently applied, <b>overriding</b> change <b>operations).</b> Typically, such inflated logs lead to difficulties with respect to system performance, data quality or change comparability. In order to deal with this we introduce the DeltaLayer algorithm. It takes arbitrary change log information as input and produces a cleaned output which only contains the net change effects; i. e., the produced log only contains information about those changes which actually have had an effect on the original source. We formally prove the minimality of our algorithm, and we show how it can be applied in different domains; e. g., the post-processing of differential snapshots in data warehouses or the analysis of conflicting changes in process management systems. Altogether the ability to purge change logs from unnecessary information provides the basis for a more intelligent handling of these logs...|$|R
40|$|Developing a single-pilot, {{all-weather}} nap-of-the-earth (NOE) capability requires {{fully automatic}} NOE (ANOE) navigation and flight control. Innovative guidance and control concepts are investigated in a four-fold research effort that: (1) organizes the on-board computer-based storage and real-time updating of NOE terrain profiles and obstacles in course-oriented coordinates indexed {{to the mission}} flight plan; (2) defines a class of automatic anticipative pursuit guidance algorithms and necessary data preview requirements to follow the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal guidance commands dictated by the updated flight profiles; (3) automates a decision-making process for unexpected obstacle avoidance; and (4) provides several rapid response maneuvers. Acquired knowledge from the sensed environment is correlated with the forehand knowledge of the recorded environment (terrain, cultural features, threats, and targets), which is then used to determine an appropriate evasive maneuver if a nonconformity of the sensed and recorded environments is observed. This four-fold research effort was evaluated in both fixed-base and moving-base real-time piloted simulations; thereby, providing a practical demonstration for evaluating pilot acceptance of the automated concepts, supervisory <b>override,</b> manual <b>operation,</b> and re-engagement of the automatic system. Volume one describes the major components of the guidance and control laws {{as well as the}} results of the piloted simulations.

40|$|Design {{patterns}} are micro architectures that {{have proved to}} be reliable, easy-to implement and robust. There is a need in science and industry for recognizing these patterns. We present a new method for discovering design patterns in the source code. This method provides a precise specification of how the patterns work by describing basic structural information like inheritance, composition, aggregation and association, and as an indispensable part, by defining call delegation, object creation and <b>operation</b> <b>overriding.</b> We introduce a new XML–based language, the Design Pattern Markup Language (DPML), which provides an easy way for the users to modify pattern descriptions to suit their needs, or even to define their own patterns or just classes in certain relations they wish to find. We tested our method on four open-source systems, and found it effective in discovering design pattern instances...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{stabilization}} of the retina during rotational head movements requires that in far vision the eyes rotate {{about the same}} axis as the head but in opposite direction with a gain close to unity (optimal strategy). To achieve this goal the vestibulo-oculomotor system {{must be able to}} independently control all three rotational degrees of freedom of the eye. Studies of the human rotational vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR) have shown that its spatial characteristics are best explained by a strategy that lies halfway between the optimal image stabilization and perfect compliance with Listing's law. Here we argue that these spatial characteristics are fully compatible with an optimal strategy under the condition of a restrained gain of the torsional velocity-to-position integration. One implication of this finding is that the rotational VORs must <b>override</b> the default <b>operation</b> mode of the ocular plant that, according to recent findings, mechanically favours movements obeying Listing's law...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} simple object calculi {{that support}} method override and object subsumption. We give an untyped calculus, typing rules, and equational rules. We illustrate the expressiveness of our calculi and the pitfalls that we avoid. 1. Introduction Typed l-calculi {{have provided a}} rich foundation for procedural languages, but attempts to use these calculi to model object-oriented languages have not been completely successful. We aim to study the intrinsic properties of objects by developing object calculi that are as simple and fruitful as l-calculi. Instead of struggling with complex encodings of objects as l-terms, we take objects as primitive and concentrate on the rules that they should obey. We investigate calculi that support method override in presence of object subsumption. Subsumption {{is the ability to}} emulate an object by means of another object that has more refined methods. <b>Override</b> is the <b>operation</b> that modifies the behavior of an object, or class, by replacing one of it [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Region-based memory {{management}} offers several important potential advantages over garbage collection, including real-time performance, better data locality, {{and more efficient}} use of limited memory. Researchers have advocated the use of regions for functional, imperative, and object-oriented languages. Lexically scoped regions are now a core feature of the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) [5]. Recent research in region-based programming for Java has focused on region checking, which requires manual effort to augment the program with region annotations. In this paper, we propose an automatic region inference system for a core subset of Java. To provide an inference method that is both precise and practical, we support classes and methods that are region-polymorphic, with regionpolymorphic recursion for methods. One challenging aspect is to ensure region safety {{in the presence of}} features such as class subtyping, method <b>overriding,</b> and downcast <b>operations.</b> Our region inference rules can handle these object-oriented features safely without creating dangling references...|$|R
40|$|Metrics {{are used}} to help a {{software}} engineer in quantitative analysis to assess {{the quality of the}} design before a system is built. The focus of Object-Oriented metrics is on the class which is the fundamental building block of the Object-Oriented architecture. These metrics are focused on internal object structure and external object structure. Internal object structure reflects the complexity of each individual entity such as methods and classes. External complexity measures the interaction among entities such as Coupling and Inheritance. This paper mainly focuses on a set of object oriented metrics {{that can be used to}} measure the quality of an object oriented design. Two types of complexity metrics in Object-Oriented paradigm namely Mood metrics and Lorenz & Kidd metrics. Mood metrics consist of Method inheritance factor(MIF), Coupling factor(CF), Attribute inheritance factor(AIF), Method hiding factor(MHF), Attribute hiding factor(AHF), and polymorphism factor(PF). Lorenz & Kidd metrics consist of Number of <b>operations</b> <b>overridden</b> (NOO), Number <b>operations</b> added (NOA), Specialization index(SI). Mood metrics and Lorenz & Kidd metrics measurements are used mainly by designers and testers. Designers uses these metrics to access the software early in process,making changes that will reduce complexity and improve the continuing capability of the design. Testers use to test the software for finding the complexity, performance of the system, quality of the software. This paper reviews Mood metrics and Lorenz & Kidd metrics are validates theoretically and empirically methods. In thispaper, work has been done to explore the quality of design of software components using object oriented paradigm. A number of object oriented metrics have been proposed in the literature for measuring the design attributes such as inheritance, coupling, polymorphism etc. This paper, metrics have been used to analyzevarious features of software component. Complexity of methods involved is a predictor of how much time, effort, Cost is required to develop and maintain the class. If a large number of methods can be invoked in response to a message, the testing and debugging of the class becomes more complicated since it requires a greater level of understanding on the part of the tester...|$|R

30|$|However, {{the need}} to raise funds {{is not the only}} driver of NGOs, and NGO {{decision-making}} is in fact a highly complex process. In all these years that I have studied NGOs and talked to their staff, I have been {{struck by the fact that}} people and organizations are usually genuinely and altruistically committed to their values and the core principle of humanity, i.e. ‘the desire to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found … to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being’. 1 However, the principle of humanity is not the only driver of an agency or its people. NGOs are simultaneously driven by the desire to maintain their operations. This is a legitimate desire, as it would be extremely complicated and unethical for organizations to hire and fire staff according to whichever crisis comes by. It only becomes problematic when the desire to maintain <b>operations</b> <b>overrides</b> the desire to save lives and restore dignity. Such an imbalance between altruistic and selfish interests becomes especially visible in cases where aid becomes ‘hyped’ such as during the Asian tsunami of 2004 when an abundance of resources created a visible competition among aid agencies concerning who should benefit (Hyndman 2012; Fernando and Hilhorst 2006; Hilhorst and Douma 2018). Studying aid from an arena perspective means keeping an open mind about the multiple interests and drivers of aid and how these work out in everyday practice.|$|R
40|$|Formulating the {{question}} This thesis examines constitutional entrenchment of the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) {{through the use}} of manner and form requirements. Manner and form requirements usually demand compliance with special procedures for the effective repeal or amendment of a protected law. Imposing such restrictions on Parliament's power to legislate inevitably gives rise to a persisting dilemma: whether human rights can be effectively protected while upholding parliamentary sovereignty? This thesis considers this dilemma and associated issues, and recommends methods by which the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities can be effectively entrenched. Law relating to manner and form In examining the law relating to manner and form requirements, this thesis presents new perspectives concerning the level of majority that may potentially constitute a valid manner and form requirement, and suggests that the validity of a two-thirds majority requirement should not be easily dismissed. This thesis also addresses the dangers of promiscuous entrenchment and proposes amendments to the Constitution Act 1975 (Vic) to mandate symmetric entrenchment. Mandating symmetric entrenchment would require Parliament, in enacting the entrenching law, to follow the same requirements it is proposing to introduce. Entrenchment provisions in the Victorian Constitution Discussion of the law relating to manner and form is contextualised by examining the entrenchments currently found in the Constitution Act 1975 (Vic). Doubt is expressed in relation to the effectiveness of entrenchments of laws that do not respect the 'constitution, power or procedure' of Parliament, as these do not fall within the purview of section 6 of the Australia Acts. For these to be valid and binding, authority outside of section 6 of Australia Acts should be sought, and this thesis contends that it is unlikely to be obtained. Entrenching the Victorian Charter The thesis recommends that the Victorian Charter be entrenched, in its entirety, with the use of an absolute majority requirement and an express declaration clause. Furthermore, it recommends that the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities form a separate part of the Constitution Act 1975 (Vic). The thesis illustrates {{that it is possible to}} effectively entrench the Victorian Charter whilst retaining the key elements of the model, including institutional dialogue, the inability of the Courts to invalidate legislation deemed to be inconsistent with the Charter, and the ability of Parliament to <b>override</b> the <b>operation</b> of the Charter...|$|R

The IMU (Integrated Publishing in Multimedia Network) trial system, developed in this work, automatizes parts of the news content acquirement and processing work of the portal web master. The IMU active proxy server extracts the metadata from news web sites and from the television news broadcasts through video analysis making an automatic classification and linking of related articles and TV clips possible. The deeply integrated material is partitioned into news composites called channels, which can be personalised by the user. The automatically computed event and media calendar allows for a new type of integration of news and up-coming events. The news content is refined by setting up filters for monitoring of the business environment. Through our interfaces for PC, TV, WAP and MP 3 terminals, the user accesses the same news content at work, at home {{in the living room and}} on the move. To balance the automatic procedures with journalistic judgement, we created web tools for human editors to control and <b>override</b> the automatic <b>operations</b> and for creating new content. The community feature enables groups to share news and to discuss topics internally. The trial including closely 400 users with PC, TV and WAP terminals showed a stable interest in the service. The typical user retrieved a few fresh articles including a TV clip at prime time in the evening. The television set user retrieved two times more material than the PC user, but proportionally less news. The most popular channels for the TV-user were TV programme schedules and TV clips. The community channels attracted the TV set users. Personalization was used scarcely and searches even more seldom. The interviews showed that the system was well accepted, except for navigating in the TV-IMU application with the remote controller...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{diagnosis}} of sinus venosus defects remains {{a matter of}} debate. It is crucial to provide solid anatomical criteria, by identifying {{the very nature of}} the atrial septum relative to sinus venosus defects, to diagnose and differentiate them from other interatrial communications. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to reestablish the anatomical criteria for the {{diagnosis of}} sinus venosus defects. METHODS: Five specimens with sinus venosus defects from the cardiopathological museum were examined. Study of the abnormal hearts was supplemented by examining the extent and structure of the atrial septum in 10 normal hearts. The echocardiograms and surgical notes were reviewed from 18 patients seen between July 1991 and August 1996 at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London diagnosed preoperatively to have a sinus venosus defect. RESULTS: The nature of the oval fossa and its muscular borders were identified in the normal hearts. In all three autopsied specimens of the superior variety of sinus venosus defect, the mouth of the superior caval vein was overriding the intact muscular anterosuperior border of the oval fossa. Two specimens thought initially to have the inferior variety of sinus venosus defect were re-classified as having defects within the oval fossa as it was the deficient oval fossa itself, rather than its intact muscular border, that was overridden by the mouth of the inferior caval vein. Sixteen patients had been diagnosed echocardiographically as exhibiting the superior variant of the defect. Retrospective review showed overriding of the superior caval vein across the upper rim of the oval fossa in 12 patients. These findings were confirmed by surgery in 11 patients with the 12 th awaiting <b>operation.</b> <b>Overriding</b> of the fossa by the caval vein was not found in the other four patients. Surgery in all of these showed the defect to be within the oval fossa. In two patients diagnosed echocardiographically as having inferior defects, the surgical findings confirmed a biatrial connection of the inferior caval vein in one patient, the findings in the second were equivocal. CONCLUSIONS: The key anatomical criterion for the diagnosis of sinus venosus defects is overriding of the mouth of the superior or inferior caval vein across the intact muscular border of the oval fossa. The interatrial communication is then formed within the mouth of the overriding vein, and is outside the confines of the oval fossa...|$|R
