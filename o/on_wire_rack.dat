40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or <b>on</b> a <b>wire</b> hay <b>rack.</b> Results: Drying on a hay rack produced very good hay. The upper portion of the hay dried on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that dried <b>on</b> a <b>wire</b> hay <b>rack.</b> The lower portion of the hay dried on the floor still contained too much water and was inappropriate for long term storage.

50|$|Sliding racks are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung <b>on</b> a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> connected to tracks that are suspended from channels {{on the floor and}} ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames. Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Excessive {{environmental}} vibrations {{can have}} deleterious effects {{in a variety}} of animals. Despite the potentially detrimental effects vibrations may have on animal health and experimental results, they remain poorly understood in the animal laboratory setting. This study investigates the consequences of excessive train vibrations on the breeding success of laboratory mice. An instrumented cage, featuring a high sensitivity microphone and accelerometer, was used to characterize the vibrations and noise in a vivarium that is in close proximity to an active railroad. The passing trains cause vibrations of a magnitude that is three times larger than the ambient vibrations caused by the mice. The majority of the noise recorded within the laboratory facility was below the audible range of mice and was thus considered to not have a significant erect on them. Low breeding rates were observed and are hypothesized {{to be the result of}} the train vibrations. To verify the effect of the train vibrations, a controlled vibration study was conducted by using a custom-built electromagnetic shaker to simulate the train vibrations. Mice, which were unaccustomed to train vibrations, served as the test subjects and were vibrated in a facility far from the railroad tracks. The stress levels of the mice test groups, featuring both males and females, were compared to control groups in order to establish the signifcance of the results. It was determined that vibrations similar to those produced by a passing train can create large fluctuations in the stress levels of female mice. These fluctuations in stress levels warrant concern due to the negative effects that stress can have on mice and, consequently, on experimental outcomes. In order to alleviate further negative impacts on laboratory research, a vibration isolating caster system will be designed to replace the on currently being used <b>on</b> the <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> <b>on</b> which the mouse are housed...|$|R

Performance and Carcass Quality of Broilers Raised <b>on</b> <b>Wire</b> Flooring With and Without Padded Roosts Two {{experiments}} were performed with broilers raised <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> flooring {{with and without}} padded roosts to {{study the effects of}} bird performance and carcass quality. Each experiment had 480 straight-run commercial broilers divided equally into two treatments and reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> with and without padded roosts. At 49 days of age, body weights were taken and feed conversions were calculated. Birds were observed for percent mortality, percent deformed legs, percent breast blisters, percent feather follicle infection (folliculitis) and foot pad dermatitis. In Experiment 1, percent incidence breast blisters was the only parameter with a significant difference (P<. 05) between birds <b>on</b> plain <b>wire</b> and birds reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> with padded roosts. In Experiment 2, no significant differences were observed in the parameters measured between the birds reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> with and without padded roosts. II. Performance and Carcass Quality with Broilers Reared <b>On</b> <b>Wire</b> Flooring, Plastic Inserts, Wood Slats and Plastic Coated Expanded Metal Flooring 2 Each With and Without Padded Roosts Commercial straight-run broilers were reared on non-litter flooring in two experiments. Experiment 1 had (control <b>on</b> wire; <b>wire</b> with padded roosts; wood slats; wood slats with padded roosts; plastic insert over wire; plastic insert over wire with padded roosts; plastic coated expanded metal; plastic coated expanded metal with padded roosts) to study the effects on broiler performance and carcass quality. In Experiment 1, mean body weights, foot pad dermatitis, feed conversion and percent incidences of mortality, deformed legs and body fat were not significantly different among the treatments. Feather soilage score and percent incidence of feather follicle infection were significantly higher (P<. 05) for broilers reared on wood slats with and without padded roosts compared to those reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> and plastic inserts. Percent incidence breast blister was significantly higher (P<. 05) for controls <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> than all other treatments. In Experiment 2, mean body weights, feed conversion and percent incidences of feather follicle infection, deformed legs and mortality were not significantly different among treatments. Feather soilage score was significantly lower (P<. 05) with birds reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> both with and without padded roosts than those on expanded metal.
