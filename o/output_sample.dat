This paper presents a comparison study of Simulated Annealing and fast <b>output</b> <b>sampling</b> based power system stabilizer (PSS) for stability enhancement. Conventional Power system stabilizers (CPSSs) are designed with the phase compensation technique in the frequency domain and include the lead-lag blocks and related parameters are tuned using an optimization method based on Simulated Annealing (SA). The performance of SA-PSS is evaluated at single-machine infinite bus system. In fast <b>output</b> <b>sampling</b> technique, the nonlinear model of single-machine infinite bus system is linearized at different operating point and a linear model is obtained. For this model, a common state feedback gain is obtained using LMI technique. A robust fast <b>output</b> <b>sampling</b> feedback gain which realizes output injection gain is obtained using LMI approach. This method does not require states of the system for feedback and is easily implementable.

It is also straightforward to avoid overflow in an FIR filter. The main disadvantage is that they may require significantly more processing and memory resources than cleverly designed IIR variants.
