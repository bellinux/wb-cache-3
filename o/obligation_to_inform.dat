Inter-vention in cases of elder abuse is often fraught with ambiguity and ethical dilemmas as the application of pro-fessional principles is less than straightforward, bringing to the fore personal, legal, and ethical concerns in the man-agement of the client’s safety and well-being. This article addresses challenges which arise from the complexity of elder abuse cases and reviews clinical, ethical, and legal <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> ethical decision-making...|$|R

40|$|Informed consent {{requirements}} for medical research have expanded {{over the past}} half-century. The focus here is upon one aspect of this expansion: the introduction of explicit <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> subjects about funding sources, in the Declaration of Helsinki. Whilst it is agreed from the outset that a failure <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> about funding sources can wrong a research subject, a general obligation is problematic {{in a number of}} ways: including, determining the scope of the norm; plus problems with subjects’ comprehension of complex funding information, and, most importantly, that such a norm seems to oblige researchers to disclose too much, including information irrelevant to most consent decisions. We ask whether the general obligation in Helsinki might be justified by appeal to respect for autonomy and informed consent, but find that it cannot be. The general <b>obligation</b> seems <b>to</b> rest upon an “informational fallacy”. We then note that this orthodox justification of research ethics—by appeal to respect for autonomy and informed consent—has been subject to various critiques. The aim {{in the second part of}} the paper is to provide a better approach to making sense of how a failure <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> about funding sources wrongs subjects: making appeal <b>to</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> refrain from misleading by omission. This alternative approach—grounded in <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> refrain from misleading—provides a basis for a norm that protects subjects interests without being hostage to the orthodox justification, that avoids the informational fallacy, and that—by and large—avoids the problems noted above about the scope of the obligation, and its implications for subjects’ comprehension...|$|R
30|$|Liability rules induce {{manufacturers}} and users to take special care—at least when those rules involve so-called fault-based liability, meaning that liability ensues {{only as a}} result of negligent or deliberate action. The contemporary state of liability law reflects this development: The events giving rise to a claim for damages are preponed in so far as the breaching of a duty of care prior to the actual occurrence of a damage-inflicting incident may already suffice for establishing damage liability. In this respect, the particular actual conditions of service robot employment need to be taken into consideration when establishing a duty of care; especially, <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> have received a prominent role. However, much of the information can not even be processed in the short time available. On the one hand, comprehensibility is a significant requirement {{when it comes to the}} operation of service robots. On the other hand, it may lead to a drop-off in the controllability—and consequently in the adaptability—of service robots. Moreover, vagueness in communication with the robot must be handled. Thus, liability rules can promote standardization and technical formalization. Simultaneously, however, they can diminish the impact of service robots. This also shows that the users of service robots can likewise be encumbered with duties of care, the non-observation of which could lead to a partitioning of liability.|$|R

40|$|The Roman Catholic Church in Australia has lobbied {{politicians}} to prohibit {{embryonic stem cell}} research, {{on the grounds that}} such research violates the sanctity and inherent dignity of human life. I suggest, however, that reasoned reflection does not uniquely support such conclusions about the moral-ity of stem cell research. A recent parliamentary standing committee report recommended that embry-onic stem cell research be allowed to proceed in certain circumstances, and there appears to be widespread support in the Australian community for this position. I argue that the moral value of democracy requires parliamentarians <b>to</b> acknowledge the <b>informed</b> views of the wider community here, and to resist lobbying by church leaders on this issue. Skene and Parker raise important questions aboutreligious doctrine influencing law and public policy whenthe Roman Catholic Church is granted amicus curiae sta-tus to intervene in civil litigation involving cases with signifi-cant legal ramifications. 1 Parallel concerns arise when the church invokes religious doctrine in attempting to determine public policy and law more directly, through the lobbying of politicians, in cases where the church’s view is at odds with the informed views of the wider community. Just as judges have role-based <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> decide cases by appeal to legal principle, so too, politicians have role-based <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge the <b>informed</b> views of the broader community, in deciding on matters of public policy and legislation.

Because the most common tests for HIV infection rely on detecting antibodies to HIV, they may also detect antibodies induced by a candidate HIV vaccine. The detection of vaccine-induced antibodies to HIV by serological tests is most {{commonly referred to as}} vaccine-induced sero-reactivity (VISR). VISR can be misinterpreted as a sign of HIV infection in a healthy study participant. In a participant who has developed vaccine-induced antibodies, accurate diagnosis of HIV infection (or lack thereof) may require specialized tests and algorithms (differential testing) that are usually not available in community settings. Organizations sponsoring clinical testing of preventive HIV vaccine candidates have an ethical <b>obligation</b> not only <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> healthy volunteers about the potential problems associated with participating in a clinical trial but also to help manage any resulting issues.

Smallpox Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) - This document, entitled "Smallpox Vaccine: What You Need to Know," contains information about smallpox disease, the benefits and risks of smallpox vaccine, contraindications, vaccination site care instructions, what to do if a reaction occurs after vaccination, and where to get more information. 3. Pre-Event Screening Worksheet for Smallpox Vaccine n 1 ̆ 92 a worksheet with questions to help individuals determine whether or not they should receive smallpox vaccine because of certain medical conditions that would place them at a greater risk for an adverse reaction from the vaccine.

Someone You are Close to May Get Smallpox Vaccine: What You Should Know and Do - a fact sheet that informs close contacts of people considering vaccination about the health conditions that put people at risk if they are in close physical contact with someone who has been vaccinated.
