The present paper is aimed at analysing the implementation of non-quasi-static effects for advanced millimeter-wave FET models.

Given the input admittances, output admittances, and transfer functions of two 2 -ports, our formulas compute the input admittance, <b>output</b> <b>admittance,</b> and transfer function when these 2 ports are combined either in parallel or in series. A nice conclusion of our work is the discovery our formulas form an elegant framework integrating the results from two classical papers, Rubinstein et al. & O'Brien and Savarino, for computing the Elmore delay and drivingpoint admittance moments in RC trees. 1 Introduction and Motivations In recent years, timing analysis methods based on moments have become increasingly popular [1] [4].

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design of}} a Redundant Drive Joint with Double Actuation (RDJ-DA) to produce controlled compliant motions over a higher bandwidth. First, our strategies on mechanical and controller designs to produce compliant motions are described, and the basic structure and impedance control of the RDJ-DA with internal serial structure explained. The standard form of the basic structure is introduced using a set of parameters which can be used to express the inertia property of RDJ-DA. Second, a problem statement for the design of RDJ-DAs is described after pointing out that required torques of the second actuator of the RDJ-DA could be large. Then, a basic idea of introducing springs into the second actuator in parallel is proposed {{as a part of the}} structural design of RDJ-DA to reduce the large torques. Simulations are conducted to find out a set of the design parameters of RDJ-DA which obtains a higher natural frequency of the <b>output</b> joint <b>admittance</b> satisfying both the desired <b>output</b> joint <b>admittance</b> and the limitations of two identical motors on their performance.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method to design an even-order {{symmetric}} bandpass filter with Chebyshev response. The alternative J inverters and λ/ 4 short-ended resonators {{are used in the}} filter design. It is well known that a conventional even-order Chebyshev bandpass filter prototype can be designed by using Jinverters. However, to achieve the Chebyshev response, a problem is that the <b>output</b> <b>admittance</b> YL is unequal to the input admittance Y 0 since normalized gn+ 1 is not equal to the g 0. Thus, for the symmetrical structure, an additional impedance transform can be installed at the output port to solve this problem, thus the network of even-order symmetric bandpass filter with a Chebyshev response should be modified with new J-inverters. In this work, all J-inverters of the symmetric bandpass filter with Chebyshev response are extracted and described as curves to determine the circuit dimensions of the proposed structure. Two even-order Chebyshev bandpass filters with the second- and fourth-order are designed with the proposed method as its application examples. Finally, the fourth-order filter is fabricated and measured at center frequency of 2. 5 GHz with the fractional bandwidth 25 %. The measured result is in good agreement with the simulated one...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} develop a simple and {{reliable}} assessment method of the stress induced psychosomatic and hemodynamic responses against various stress situations, especially for evaluating {{of the effectiveness of}} stress reduction methods, a multipurpose non-invasive continuous cardiovascular monitoring system was developed. The monitoring system could measure beat-by-beat finger blood pressure (SBP, MBP, DBP based on the volume-compensation method), cardiac <b>output</b> (CO, electrical <b>admittance</b> method), total peripheral resistance (TPR=MBP/CO), and the other hemodynamic related parameters (e. g. RR-interval, respiratory rate, pulse wave velocity, etc.). As controlled stress conditions, the human subjects would be exposed to the various stresses such as flash video display, electrical stimulation and so on. In this study, after 5 minutes resting, the stress induced hemodynamic responses were measured during 10 -min presentation of floating vertical stripes image using 5 healthy subjects. The image presentation was discontinued when the subject gave his/her self-assessment due to considerable discomfort. The results showed that although BP increased during the presentation in all the subjects, there observed two types of cardiovascular responses; one is a type of increase in CO (or of almost unchanging or decrease in TRP), and the other of increase in TPR. These results strongly suggested that the detection of the change in TPR might be an important factor for the evaluation of stress conditions. Further investigations would be required for the reasons why these two types were observed in the same stressful condition. I...|$|R
30|$|When {{physical}} systems {{interact with}} each other, they behave either as an impedance (i.e., accepts external motion inputs and generates force <b>outputs)</b> or an <b>admittance</b> (i.e., accepts external force inputs and generates motion outputs) [8]. The human ankle functions by adjusting its mechanical impedance and capability of producing net positive work during push-off. These capabilities have inspired the design of several new ankle-foot prostheses. One example is a transfemoral prosthesis with powered ankle and knee joints in the sagittal plane developed by Sup et al. where the controller is capable of regulating the impedance of each joint as needed [9]-[12]. SPARKy 1 and 2 have been developed by Hitt et al. as a tendon-actuated ankle-foot prostheses capable of producing the necessary push-off moments during walking and running, respectively [13],[14]. Additionally, Au et al. developed the BiOM, an ankle-foot prosthesis with a finite state machine to determine the gait phase and generate the appropriate kinetic output [15]-[19]. All three of the aforementioned devices are capable of increasing mobility in the sagittal plane by producing net positive work in the sagittal plane. Finally, Bellman et al. conceived SPARKy 3, an ankle robot with two DOFs; however, a prototype design has not been developed [20]. This leads {{to the fact that}} a design to address the weight and size limitations is necessary to develop the next generation of ankle-foot prostheses capable of properly functioning in both the sagittal and frontal planes. These additional capabilities will allow a more natural gait, especially during turning and traversing inclined planes.|$|R
40|$|Application of {{conducting}} polymers {{has been growing}} widely in {{different fields such as}} batteries, solar cells, capacitors and actuators. Mechanical properties {{of conducting}} polymers like flexibility, high power to mass ratio and high active strain make them potentially applicable to robotic and automation industries. Obviously, a dynamic model of the actuation phenomenon in conducting polymers is needed to study its controllability and also to optimize the mechanical performance. De Rossi and colleagues suggest treating the mechanical behaviour of conducting polymers separately from the viscoelastic structural model and electrochemical actuation[1]. But it has been observed that the effects of electrochemical actuation and diffusion of ions on the viscoelastic coefficients cannot be neglected in some conducting polymer actuators, as shown in[1]. In this paper, we present the effects of cyclic voltammetry actuation on shear modulus of polypyrrole in propylene carbonate and EMI. TSFI as measured by an electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (eQCM). The QCM consists basically of an AT-cut piezoelectric quartz crystal disc with metallic electrode films deposited on its faces. One face is exposed to the active medium. A driver circuit applies an AC signal to the electrodes, causing the crystal to oscillate in a shear mode, at a given resonance frequency. QCM has been routinely used for the determination of mass changes. Measured resonance frequency shifts are converted into mass changes by the wellknown Sauerbrey 2 ̆ 7 s equation. In this paper, we correlate the <b>admittance</b> <b>output</b> of QCM to the real shear modulus of polypyrrole.
