25|$|Supporters of {{daylight}} saving time and a common time zone in Indiana often claim Indiana must adopt the time-keeping system of the Eastern United States to preserve interstate business with that region. Some believe that Indiana businesses have lost hours of productive time with out-of-state colleagues because the time quirks are too confusing {{to keep track of}} on a daily basis. The confusion caused to outsiders featured prominently in the plot of an episode of The West Wing in which presidential aides unfamiliar with Indiana's non-observance of DST miss their return flight to Washington, D.C., <b>on</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>One</b> and express consternation with the variances in the state's time measurement.|$|E

In the rush, a Bible was not at hand, so Johnson took {{the oath of office}} using a Roman Catholic missal from President Kennedy's desk. Cecil Stoughton's iconic photograph of Johnson taking the presidential oath of office as Mrs. Kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft.|$|E
500|$|During the crisis, Gingrich's {{public image}} {{suffered}} from {{the perception that the}} Republicans' hardline budget stance was owed partly to an alleged snub of Gingrich by Clinton during a flight <b>on</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>One</b> to and from Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in Israel. That perception developed after the trip when Gingrich, while being questioned by Lars-Erik Nelson at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, said that he was dissatisfied that Clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight. He complained that he and Dole were instructed to use the plane's rear exit to deplane, saying the snub was [...] "part of why you ended up with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution". In response to Gingrich's complaint that they were [...] "forced to use the rear door," [...] NBC news released their videotape footage showing both Gingrich and Dole disembarking at Tel Aviv just behind Clinton via the front stairway.|$|E
500|$|The episode makes several {{references}} to {{popular culture and}} history.

The episode includes a scene based on Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, where Lisa and Bob Hope escape the Fort Springfield stage. It also makes two {{references to}} Star Wars, where the caricature artist displays a caricature of Darth Vader and a montage shows Lisa with a double-bun hairdo like Princess Leia. The Springfield Waxworks' Chamber of Horrors contains Mr. T, Ronald Reagan and Dr. Ruth, and Laramie's mascot Menthol Moose is a parody of Joe Camel. Musically, Homer mournfully sings a song, [...] "Blimpy Boy", to the tune of The Seekers' [...] "Georgy Girl". Historically, there is a parody of the Hindenburg disaster, when the Duff Blimp crashes into the radio tower, to which Kent Brockman quotes [...] "Oh, the humanity!"
