The project was founded by Robert Watson {{with the goal of}} implementing concepts from the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation and the <b>Orange</b> <b>Book.</b> This project is ongoing and many of its extensions have been integrated into FreeBSD. The project is supported by a variety of organizations, including the DARPA, NSA, Network Associates Laboratories, Safeport Network Services, the University of Pennsylvania, Yahoo!, McAfee Research, SPARTA, Apple Computer, nCircle Network Security, Google, the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, and others.|$|E

25|$|CD-RW is a re-recordable {{medium that}} uses a {{metallic}} alloy instead of a dye. The write laser {{in this case is}} used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players cannot read CD-RW discs, although most later CD audio players and stand-alone DVD players can. CD-RWs follow the <b>Orange</b> <b>Book</b> standard.|$|E

25|$|As {{outlined}} by the aforementioned <b>Orange</b> <b>Book,</b> software portions of the trusted computing base need to protect themselves against tampering to be of any effect. This {{is due to the}} von Neumann architecture implemented by virtually all modern computers: since machine code can be processed as just another kind of data, it can be read and overwritten by any program barring special memory management provisions that subsequently have to be treated as part of the TCB. Specifically, the trusted computing base must at least prevent its own software from being written to.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that as a {{consequence}} of the above <b>Orange</b> <b>Book</b> definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the network server example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system's TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, it definitely is part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user's browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, but it certainly constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.|$|E
25|$|Some drives use special {{techniques}}, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN, {{to write}} more data onto a given disc; these techniques are inherently {{deviations from the}} Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or <b>Orange</b> <b>Book)</b> standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group {{and will not be}} archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2GiB with GigaRec or 1.8GiB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). The greatest risk in using such a proprietary data storage format, assuming that it works reliably as designed, is that it may be difficult or impossible to repair or replace the hardware used to read the media if it fails, is damaged, or is lost after its original vendor discontinues it.|$|E

2500|$|A {{standard}} CD-R is a [...] thick disc made of polycarbonate about 120mm (4.7in) or 80mm (3.150in) diameter. The 120mm disc has {{a storage}} capacity of 74 minutes of audio or 650 Megabytes of data. CD-R/RWs {{are available with}} capacities of 80 minutes of audio or 737,280,000 bytes (700MiB), which they achieve by molding the disc at the tightest allowable tolerances specified in the <b>Orange</b> <b>Book</b> CD-R/CD-RW standards.

2500|$|These special {{provisions}} that aim at preventing {{certain kinds of}} actions from being executed, in essence, constitute the trusted computing base. For this reason, the <b>Orange</b> <b>Book</b> (still a reference {{on the design of}} secure operating systems [...] ) characterizes the various security assurance levels that it defines mainly in terms of the structure and security features of the TCB.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the foregoing, most CD-Rs on {{the market}} have an 80-minute capacity. [...] There are also 90 minute/790MiB and 99 minute/870MiB discs, {{although}} they are less common (and depart from the <b>Orange</b> <b>Book</b> standard outright). [...] Also, due to {{the limitations of the}} data structures in the ATIP (see below), 90 and 99 minute blanks will identify as 80 minute ones. (As the ATIP is part of the <b>Orange</b> <b>Book</b> standard, it is natural that its design does not support some nonstandard disc configurations.) Therefore, in order to use the additional capacity, these discs have to be burned using [...] "overburn" [...] options in the CD recording software. [...] (Overburning itself is so named because it is outside the written standards, but, due to market demand, it has nonetheless become a de facto standard function in most CD writing drives and software for them.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Nothing in the Red, Yellow or <b>Orange</b> <b>Book</b> {{standards}} prohibits disc reading/writing devices {{from having}} {{the capacity to}} read or write discs beyond the Compact Disc standards. [...] The standards do require discs to meet precise requirements {{in order to be}} called Compact Discs, but the other discs may be called by other names; if this were not true, no DVD drive could legally bear the Compact Disc logo. [...] While disc players and drives may have capabilities beyond the standards, enabling them to read and write nonstandard discs, there is no assurance, in the absence of explicit additional manufacturer specifications beyond normal Compact Disc logo certification, that any particular player or drive will perform beyond the standards at all or consistently. Furthermore, if the same device with no explicit performance specs beyond the Compact Disc logo initially handles nonstandard discs reliably, there is no assurance that it will not later stop doing so, and in that case, there is no assurance that it can be made to do so again by service or adjustment. [...] Therefore, discs with capacities larger than 650 MB, and especially those larger than 700 MB, are less interchangeable among players/drives than standard discs and are not very suitable for archival use, as their readability on future equipment, or even on the same equipment at a future time, is not assured, even under the assumption that the discs will not degrade at all.|$|E

2500|$|The CD-R, {{originally}} named CD Write-Once (WO), specification {{was first}} published in 1988 by Philips and Sony in the 'Orange Book'. The <b>Orange</b> <b>Book</b> consists of several parts, furnishing details of the CD-WO, CD-MO (Magneto-Optic), and CD-RW (ReWritable). The latest editions have abandoned {{the use of the term}} [...] "CD-WO" [...] in favor of [...] "CD-R", while [...] "CD-MO" [...] were used very little. [...] Written CD-Rs and CD-RWs are, in the aspect of low-level encoding and data format, fully compatible with the audio CD (Red Book CD-DA) and data CD (Yellow Book CD-ROM) standards. [...] (Note that the Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM only specifies a high-level data format and refers to the Red Book for all physical format and low-level code details, such as track pitch, linear bit density, and bitstream encoding.) [...] This means they use Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation, CIRC error correction, and, for CD-ROM, the third error correction layer defined in the Yellow Book. [...] Properly written CD-R discs on blanks of less than 80 minutes length are fully compatible with the audio CD and CD-ROM standards in all details including physical specifications. [...] 80 minute CD-R discs marginally violate the Red Book physical format specifications, and longer discs are noncompliant. [...] CD-RW discs have lower reflectivity than CD-R or pressed (non-writable) CDs and for this reason cannot meet the Red Book standard (or come close). [...] Some hardware compatible with Red Book CDs may have difficulty reading CD-Rs and, because of their lower reflectivity, especially CD-RWs. [...] To the extent that CD hardware can read extended-length discs or CD-RW discs, it is because that hardware has capability beyond the minimum required by the Red Book and Yellow Book standards (the hardware is more capable than it needs to be to bear the Compact Disc logo).|$|E
