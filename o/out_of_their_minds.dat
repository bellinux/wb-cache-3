25|$|Every {{single year}} Feyenoord fans {{look forward to}} the club's first {{training}} of the new season. They show up with thousands together and temporary stands are placed around the training pitch. Players signed during the summer will be seen by the fans in public {{for the first time and}} the players take some time to sign autographs after the training. Around the training pitch there are several other activities held before the first and in between the first and second training of the day. No other club in the Netherlands attracts as much supporters towards the first training and the new players are positively surprised every year. Despite finishing 9th in the Eredivisie in the 2006–07 season for instance the first training of the 2007–08 season broke all records when 20,000 fans showed up to support the team and to erase the previous season <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} telepathy is not {{dissimilar}} to two clinical concepts: delusions of thought insertion/removal. This similarity might explain how an individual {{might come to}} the conclusion that they were experiencing telepathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of psychosis, particularly of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or substance-induced psychosis. Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic medication. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists believe and empirical findings support the idea that people with schizotypy and [...] schizotypal personality disorder are particularly likely to believe in telepathy.|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert thought the movie was a disgrace. He gave the film one star out of four and said it was [...] "a horrible mess of a movie, without shape, trajectory or purpose–a one joke movie, if it had one joke. The two characters wander witlessly past the bizarre backdrops of Las Vegas (some real, some hallucinated, all interchangeable) while zonked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> Humor depends on attitude.

25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma.

The elaborate puns on getting stoned combine a sense of paranoiac persecution with [...] "nudge-nudge wink-wink bohemian hedonism". Heylin {{points out that the}} Old Testament connotations of getting stoned made the Salvation Army-style musical backing seem like a good joke. The enigmatic title came about, Heylin suggests, because Dylan knew a song entitled [...] "everybody must get stoned" [...] would be kept off the airwaves. Heylin links the title to the Book of Proverbs, chapter 27, verse 15: [...] "A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike."
