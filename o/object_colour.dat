The most significant was an area anterior in the ventral occipital lobe, subsequently named V4α. Further fMRI experiments found that V4α had a different function than V4, but worked cooperatively with it. V4α is involved in a number of processes, and is active during tasks requiring colour ordering, imagery, knowledge about colour, colour illusions, and <b>object</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{dimensionality}} of the <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> manifold was studied using {{a multidimensional}} scaling technique, {{which allows for}} the representation {{of a set of}} coloured papers as a configuration in a Euclidean space where the distance between papers corresponds to the perceptual dissimilarities between them. When the papers are evenly illuminated they can be arranged as a three-dimensional configuration. This is in line with the generally accepted view that the <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> space is three-dimensional. Yet, we show that under variegated illumination another three dimensions emerge. We call them lighting dimensions of <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> in order to distinguish from the traditional three referred to as material dimensions of <b>object</b> <b>colour...</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a novel colour substitution algorithm {{based on the}} dichromatic reflection model. We separate the <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> and scene illumination information in the target area of the original image. The <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> was subsequently substituted while keeping the illumination information unchanged. A new method was employed to estimate the <b>object</b> <b>colour.</b> We also developed a set of new parameters to adjust the intensity distribution on the resultant image. Our algorithm is totally automatic and can achieve more realistic effects compared with other colour substitution methods. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|The eyes of most diurnal {{reptiles}} {{and birds}} contain coloured retinal filters-oil droplets. Although these filters are widespread, their adaptive advantage remains uncertain. To understand why coloured oil droplets appeared and were retained during evolution, I consider both {{the benefits and}} the costs of light filtering in the retina. Oil droplets decrease cone quantum catch and reduce the overlap in sensitivity between spectrally adjacent cones. The reduction of spectral overlap increases the volume occupied by <b>object</b> <b>colours</b> in a cone space, whereas the decrease in quantum catch increases noise, and thus reduces the discriminability of similar colours. The trade-off between these two effects determines the total benefit of oil droplets. Calculations show that coloured oil droplets increase the number of <b>object</b> <b>colours</b> that can be discriminated, and thus are beneficial for colour vision...|$|R

40|$|A hue {{descriptor}} {{based on}} Logvinenko’s illuminant-invariant <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> atlas [1] is tested {{in terms of}} how well it maps hues to the hue names found in Moroney’s Colour Thesaurus [2] [3] and how well it maps hues of Munsell papers to their corresponding Munsell hue designator. Called the KSM hue descriptor, it correlates hue with the central wavelength of a Gaussian-shaped reflectance function. An important feature of this representation is that the set of hue descriptors inherits the illuminate invariant property of Logvinenko’s <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> atlas. Despite the illuminant invariance of the atlas and the hue descriptors, metamer mismatching means that colour stimulus shift [4] can occur, which will inevitably lead to some hue shifts. However, tests show that KSM hue is robust {{in the sense that it}} is much more stable under a change of illuminant than CIELAB hue...|$|E
40|$|Embodied {{theories}} of cognition hold that mentally representing something red engages the neural subsystems that respond to environmental perception of that colour. This paper examines whether implicit perceptual information on <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> is represented during sentence comprehension even though doing so {{does not necessarily}} facilitate task performance. After reading a sentence that implied a particular colour for a given object, participants were presented {{with a picture of}} the object that either matched or mismatched the implied colour. When asked if the pictured object was mentioned in the preceding sentence, people's responses were faster when the colours mismatched than when they matched, suggesting that <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> is represented differently to other object properties such as shape and orientation. A distinction between stable and unstable embodied representations is proposed to allow embodied theories to account for these findings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{further studies}} and improvements {{of a novel}} multi-channel Fuzzy colour contrast fusion algorithm for accurate colour object detection. Previous research tested the different architectures the colour contrast fusion algorithm may be built upon. Now, {{in order to test}} the generality of the algorithm, this research examines the algorithm’s applicability in different colour spaces. The algorithm is able to capture the elusive features of colours depicting objects under spatially varying illumination intensities by adaptively employing a fusion of colour contrast manipulation operations in the form of fuzzy colour contrast rules. Unlike existing colour constancy algorithms, this algorithm selectively pinpoints the cluster of colours depicting the target object, and does not require stabilizing the colours of the whole image per se. Empirical results show that this algorithm is able to break the limits of accuracy of the pie-slice decision region for <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> spotting, using the robot soccer game as testbed. In all colour spaces tested, results show that the utilization of the algorithm always improves the accuracy of colour object detection. Furthermore, we also show that the algorithm succeeds in the task of selective <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> correction for improved colour object visibility under extreme lighting conditions...|$|E

In many situations environmental conditions or object colours or shades cannot be controlled, leading to difficulties in correctly processing {{the images and}} requiring complicated processing algorithms. Many of these complications can be avoided by using range image data, instead of intensity data. This is because range image data represents the physical properties of object location and shape, practically independently of <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> or shading. The advantages of range {{image processing}} are presented, along with three example applications that show how robust machine vision results can be obtained with relatively simple range image processing in real-time applications...|$|E

As result of the experience, significant <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> coordinates displacements in LEDs lighting were observed. As it was predictable from LEDs spectral distribution, orange – red colours were poorly reproduced. However, the subjective experience did not show a remarkable preference to the conventional light sources.

Detection is based on automated background modelling rather than a manually generated <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> model. Furthermore, a labelling method is proposed to create tracks of objects through the scene, rather than unconnected detections. A methodical comparison between the new PF tracking method and two other multi-object trackers is presented on the PETS 2004 benchmark data set.

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the extent to}} which a change to an <b>object’s</b> <b>colour</b> is overtly prioritized for fixation relative to the appearance of a new object during real-world scene viewing. Both types of scene change captured gaze (and attention) when introduced during a fixation, although colour changes captured attention less often than new objects. Neither of these scene changes captured attention when they occurred during a saccade, but slower and less reliable memory-based mechanisms were nevertheless able to prioritize new <b>objects</b> and <b>colour</b> changes relative to the other stable objects in the scene. These results indicate that online memory for object identity and at least some object features are functional in detecting changes to real-world scenes. Additionally, visual factors such as the salience of onsets and colour changes did not affect prioritization of these events. We discuss these results in terms of current theories of attention allocation within, and online memory representations of, real-world scenes...|$|R

Few defined brush strokes appear in the painting, and <b>objects,</b> <b>colours,</b> and figures become indistinct. Rather, objects are defined by their colours in the painting, and some objects (like the bodies of the slaves and the incoming storm) have no real border at all, being solely defined by the contrast with the pigments around them.

The detection method does not assume uniform <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> or texture, and does not rely on prebuilt models such as 3 D geometric primitives. A novel detection algorithm has been developed to find lines of reflectional symmetry in images. This detection algorithm can operate at 10 frames per second on 640 by 480 pixel images. Using the detected symmetry, objects are segmented with a dynamic programming approach. Both algorithms have been extended to accommodate skew symmetry. I...|$|E

Since spotting a colour depends on the threshold used to define the colour, ROC analysis is used in evaluating the results.

The precision and stability of the colour constancy were estimated using the same colour constancy algorithm for all the models compared. The experiments indicate that the Gaussian model is potentially more effective for estimating the chromaticity of the scene illuminant and the scene objects than the linear spectral models are.

For this class of <b>objects,</b> <b>colour</b> invariant histogram matching has proven to be very encouraging. However, matching many local colour cubes is computationally demanding. We propose a compact colour descriptor, which we call Wiccest, requiring only 12 numbers to locally capture colour and texture information.

Moreover, we demonstrate the features to be applicable to highly compressed images while retaining discriminative power. ...|$|R

In order to calibrate the <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> in different lighting conditions, a kind of statistic ellipsoidal model is adopted. We build a 3 -D Colour Look-up Table (CLUT) in which only 18 bits are used to represent a kind of colour instead of conventional 24 bits. This method resolves the problem of object overlapping in a colour space, and has the merits of higher classification accuracy and lower memory cost than traditional ones. It is implemented on FPGA, which can highly reduce the CPU computation burden and remarkably improve the performance of robot vision systems. This method is validated by the applications on a mobile robot in the research. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Colour {{constancy}} {{refers to}} the stable perception of <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> under changing illumination conditions. This problem has been reformulated as relational colour constancy, or {{the ability of the}} observer to discriminate between material changes and changes in illumination. It has been suggested that local cone excitation ratios play a prominent role in achieving such constancy. Here we show that perceptual colour constancy measured by achromatic adjustments is to a large part complete after 25 ms. This speaks against a prominent role for receptor adaptation, which takes significantly longer. We also found no difference in colour constancy between colour changes that were compatible with a change of illuminant, and between colour changes where local cone ratios were uncorrelated between the two illuminants. Our results show that constant cone ratios are not necessary for colour constancy. ...|$|E

In order to identify suitable artificial objects, we developed a reaction time paradigm that measures (subjective) colour diagnosticity. In the main experiment, participants adjusted sixteen such objects to their typical colour as well as to grey. If the achromatic object appears in its typical colour, then participants should adjust it to the opponent colour in order to subjectively perceive it as grey. We found that knowledge about the typical colour influences the colour appearance of artificial objects. This effect was particularly strong along the daylight axis...|$|R
