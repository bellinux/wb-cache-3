This was changed in 1995 when all matters were to be handled by the district courts first.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the quality of data {{obtained}} from individual oral and group written administration of a classroom simulation test. The individual <b>oral</b> <b>procedure</b> involved one group of subjects taking the simulator test individually and responding orally, while the group written procedure involved another group writing their responses to the simulator test under group conditions. The sample consisted of 34 women majoring in elementary education at Oregon College of Education at Monmouth, Oregon. These subjects were matched on the basis of age and years of teaching experience. In each of the two different test procedure. the subjects responded to 11 short filmed episodes of the classroom behavior of 22 sixth grade children. The subjects enacted the role of student teacher and were asked to respond at any time during the filmed episode where they felt some response or action was needed. Each subject was equipped with a stop watch. This was used to indicate the point in time in the sequence of events that a subject chose to initiate a response or formulate a judgment. In both test procedures the subjects were asked to respond as if they were actually the teacher talking to the children portrayed on the film. Upon completion of each of the episodes, the subjects were asked to answer three questions: (1) What was it in this situation that made you, as the teacher, respond when you did? (2) Why did you say what you said or do what you did? and (3) What did you anticipate achieving, if anything, by the response you made? These questions were used to try and tap the rationale or reasoning for the particular response made. The protocols, which included responses to the filmed episodes and the answers to the three questions, from the two test procedures were compared in the following ways: (1) the number of words elicited by each method, (2) the point in the episode (time) at which the subject responded, (3) the degree of involvement in the response, (4) the homogeneity of content, and (5) the consistency between the rationale given for a response and the response itself. Analyses three, four and five involved placement of the protocols in category systems. Reliability of category classification was demonstrated by a measure of percent agreement between two sets of raters before the protocols were classified. The data were analyzed by the chi-square analysis and the t-test for related samples to determine the similarity of data elicited by the two administrative procedures. In general, the results of the analyses indicated that the two methods of test procedure, individual oral and group written, elicited comparable data to a classroom simulation test. On the basis of these results, several conclusions seem justified: 1. The group written procedure is economically superior to the individual <b>oral</b> <b>procedure</b> because of its tendency to elicit significantly shorter protocols and because it can be administered to more than one person at one time. 2. Both methods are similar in terms of the time of initiation of response. 3. The group written procedure and the individual <b>oral</b> <b>procedure</b> are similar in facilitating involvement in the simulator test. 4. Both methods are similar in terms of the nature of the content elicited. 5. Consistency between response and rationale for the response was independent of method of administration. The results of the present investigation cannot claim superiority for one method over the other, but it points to the equality of both. Additional research involving the use of simulation materials under various methodological conditions needs to be done in order to further explore the potential of this type of test stimuli...|$|E

This mass was found to be a retroperitoneal tumor with central necrosis by low abdominal CT scanning and the low abdominal echography. The mass was removed easily, though it was slightly adherent to the anterior surface of the sacral bone. Pelvic lymphadenectomy was also done simultaneously. The removed mass was encapsulated by fibrous tissue, round in shape, 750 grams in weight (13 by 12 by 12 cm), evenly flat, elastic soft and contained 230 ml bloody exudate at the center. Histologically this mass contained areas where oval and spindle cells made palisading arrangement and areas where the tumor cells had no communication with each other and stroma was edematous. However, hyperchromatism of nuclei of tumor cells and high cellularity indicated this mass to be a malignant Schwannoma. Dissected lymph nodes had no metastatic involvement.

In this study, we have evaluated the possibility of inducing gastric immune responses in H pylori infected volunteers by intestinal and gastric immunisation.  METHODS—H pylori infected subjects were given two doses of an inactivated cholera vaccine, either intestinally via an endoscope approximately 30  cm distal to the pylorus sphincter or intragastrically as small droplets applied directly onto the stomach mucosa. Uninfected individuals received the vaccine by standard <b>oral</b> <b>procedure.</b> Vaccine specific antibody secreting cells in antral and duodenal biopsies were detected by the enzyme linked immunospot assay technique before and seven days after the second immunisation.  RESULTS—Intestinal immunisations resulted in induction of vaccine specific gastric IgA secreting cells in five of eight volunteers. This immunisation schedule also gave rise to specific duodenal antibody secreting cells in seven of eight individuals. Local gastric immunisation resulted in the induction of specific B cells in the gastric mucosa of four of eight volunteers. Gastric antigen application also resulted in B cell responses in the duodenum in all volunteers. Uninfected volunteers receiving the vaccine perorally responded in the duodenum {{but not in the}} stomach.  CONCLUSIONS—H pylori infection increases the ability of the gastric mucosa to serve as an expression site for intestinally induced B cell responses. These findings are of importance when designing a therapeutic H pylori vaccine, and based on our results such a vaccine can be delivered along the whole upper gastrointestinal tract.    Keywords: Helicobacter pylori; vaccine; stomach; B cell; lymphocyte traffickin...|$|E

Two experiments (experiments I and II) were conducted. In experiment I, feeding hormonal treatment was applied on post-yolk sac stage fry (10 days after fertilization at 27 ºC). Dosages of 30 mg (group A) and 60 mg (group B) of 17 α-methyltestosterone per kg of food were used during 60 -day periods (40 fry per treatment). The control group i. e. group C, received no hormone. In experiment II, one day post hatching larvae were exposed to an immersion treatment in 17 α-methyltestosterone at 1000 µg/l up to 2 h (16 larvae per treatment). Later, at the first day of post-yolk sac stage, the treatment was followed by <b>oral</b> <b>procedure</b> which was divided in 2 groups: group D and group E. In group D, 30 mg 17 α-Methyltestosterone per kg of food was used during a 60 -day period. In group E, fry received 60 mg of hormone per kg of food during the same period. The control group i. e. group F, did not receive any hormone. Change in sex proportion within each experiment as well as between experiments was analyzed by chi-square test (p< 0. 05). In experiment I, 60 mg feeding treatment significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the proportion of the males (85. 7 %) in comparison to the control group (46. 67 %). Lower male proportion (60 %), but still significant (p< 0. 05), was evaluated in 30 mg feeding treatment. In experiment II, in both groups (D and E), although sex ratio was different from the theoretical 1 : 1 sex ratio, fish skewed toward sterility rather than masculinization because of high hormonal dozes.
