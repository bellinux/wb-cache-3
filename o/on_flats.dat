5|$|The Sind sparrow is gregarious, {{generally}} forming {{small groups}} of four to six birds while feeding. It tends to breed in loose colonies of a few pairs, and non-breeding birds may gather to roost in acacias or tamarisks near water. During winter, the non-breeding season, it forms larger flocks {{of as many as}} 30 birds, and joins flocks with other seed-eating birds, such as house sparrows and red avadavats. The Sind sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grasses and other plants such as Polygonum plebeium. It may also forage for insects such as caterpillars, especially to feed nestlings. Flocks forage <b>on</b> <b>flats</b> alongside rivers, flying into nearby bushes and continuing to forage when disturbed.|$|E

A {{research on the}} feasibility of new planting techniques (direct seeding <b>on</b> <b>flat,</b> transplanting <b>on</b> <b>flat,</b> direct seeding <b>on</b> ridges, transplanting on ridges and parachute planting) in transplanted and direct wet-seeded rice was undertaken at Dera Ismail Khan region of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province during 2002 and 2003. Among the planting techniques, the best performance for the yield formation and economic evaluation was noted for transplanting <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> during both years. Chinese parachute planting technology also showed very promising results {{in most of the}} parameters. Direct seeding on ridges could not excel transplanting <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> and parachute planting during both cropping seasons. The findings concluded the feasibility of parachute planting technology along with traditional rice transplanting <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> over all other planting techniques being practiced in the area...|$|R

2500|$|Cross-country skiers use a grip wax (also called [...] "kick wax") for classic-style waxable skis {{to provide}} {{traction}} with static friction {{on the snow}} {{that allows them to}} propel themselves forward <b>on</b> <b>flats</b> and up hills. They are applied in an area beneath the skier's foot and extending, somewhat forward, that is formed by the camber of the classic ski, called the [...] "grip zone" [...] (or [...] "kick zone"). The presence of camber allows the skis to grip the snow, when the weight is on one ski and the ski is fully flexed, but minimize drag when the skis are weighted equally and are thus less than fully flexed. [...] Grip waxes are designed for specific temperature ranges and types of snow; a correctly selected grip wax does not appreciably decrease the glide of skis that have proper camber for the skier's weight and for the snow conditions. There are two substances used for grip wax: hard wax and klister.|$|E
2500|$|Watson people (100–800 CE) {{generally}} lived <b>on</b> <b>flats</b> {{above the}} annual flooding {{of the major}} rivers, near their small conical mounds. Their dominant pottery preference was decorated with a Z-twist cordage technique. This period signals an ending of large conical mounds northerly in and along the state. Here they arose adjacent to the Armstrong people and following Buck Garden on their south extent. The spanning duration and region Woodland type site is Watson 46HK34 (Woodland/Watson) located at Hancock County. Upon their horizon and zenith, there were no bean or maize seeds in the state. These were hunters and fishermen, but gardeners of a larger variety of indigenous seed crops, who were transitioning to just supplemental gathering of wild berries and nuts. The bean of the horticulturalists appeared sparsely in the area toward the ending of this period. About the time the Buck Garden arose, they were also found living in small compact villages. Their mounds were made partly with rocks, having more people buried within than earlier special person mounds.|$|E

60|$|July 10th.--Last evening I walked {{round the}} castle rock, {{and through the}} Grass-Market, where I stood on the inlaid cross in the pavement, thence down the High Street beyond John Knox's house. The throng {{in that part of}} the town was very great. There is a strange fascination in these old streets, and in the peeps down the closes; but it doubtless would be a great blessing were a fire to sweep through the whole of ancient Edinburgh. This system of living <b>on</b> <b>flats,</b> up to I know not what story, must be most {{unfavorable}} to cleanliness, since they have to fetch their water all that distance towards heaven, and how they get rid of their rubbish is best known to themselves.|$|E

Our halting-places were <b>on</b> <b>flats</b> close to the river, covered with large trees, and carpeted with a most luxuriant herbage, amongst which a wild buckwheat (Polygonum*) [Polygonum cymosum, Wall. This is a common Himalayan plant, and {{is also found in}} the Khasia mountains.] was abundant, which formed an excellent spinach: it is called [...] "Pullop-bi"; a name I shall hereafter have occasion to mention with gratitude.|$|E

60|$|After {{crossing}} the Teesta by the cane bridge of Lingo, our route lay over a steep and lofty spur, round which the river {{makes a great}} sweep. On the ascent of this ridge we passed large villages <b>on</b> <b>flats</b> cultivated with buckwheat. The saddle is 5,500 feet high, and thence a rapid descent leads {{to the village of}} Singtam, which faces the north, and is 300 feet lower, and 3000 feet above the river, which is here no longer called the Teesta, but is known as the Lachen-Lachoong, from its double origin in the rivers of these names, which unite at Choongtam, twenty miles higher up. Of these, the source of the Lachen is in the Cholamoo lakes in Tibet; while the Lachoong rises on the south flank of Donkia mountain, both many marches north of my present position. At Singtam the Lachen-Lachoong runs westward, till joined by the Rihi from the north, and the Rinoong from the west, after receiving which it assumes the name of Teesta: of these affluents, the Rinoong is the largest, and drains the south-east face of Kinchinjunga and Pundim, and the north of Nursing: all which mountains are seen to the north-north-west of Singtam. The Rinoong valley is cultivated for several miles up, and has amongst others the village and Lamasery of Bah. Beyond this the view of black, rugged precipices with snowy mountains towering above them, is one of the finest in Sikkim. There is a pass in that direction, from Bah over the Tckonglah to the Thlonok valley, and thence to the province of Jigatzi in Tibet, but it is almost impracticable.|$|E
