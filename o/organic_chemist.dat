5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the <b>organic</b> <b>chemist,</b> including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Conant {{entered into}} a {{business}} partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, Stanley Pennock and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like benzoic acid that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of <b>organic</b> <b>chemist</b> Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an explosion at the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E

25|$|Mosher {{attended}} Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, {{where he}} received a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1937. He went on to Oregon State University, where he earned a master's degree in 1938. He then returned to Willamette to teach for one year. In 1939, he continued his graduate work at Pennsylvania State University under the mentorship of Frank C. Whitmore, a renowned <b>organic</b> <b>chemist.</b> In 1942, Mosher completed his PhD in organic chemistry. He remained at Pennsylvania State as an assistant professor, supervising research on synthetic anti-malarial drugs for the National Research Council {{and the production of}} DDT with the War Production Board. In 1944, Mosher married Carol Walker, a fellow chemistry graduate student at the university. Three years later, Mosher accepted an assistant professorship at Stanford University in the Department of Chemistry, and he and his wife moved to California for the position. That same year his wife Carol joined the staff of the Stanford Research Institute, later becoming senior <b>organic</b> <b>chemist.</b>|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{attempts}} at diverting sewage {{for use as a}} fertilizer in the farm was made by the cotton mill owner James Smith in the 1840s. He experimented with a piped distribution system initially proposed by James Vetch that collected sewage from his factory and pumped it into the outlying farms, and his success was enthusiastically followed by Edwin Chadwick and supported by <b>organic</b> <b>chemist</b> Justus von Liebig.|$|E
25|$|Culminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson {{among others}} had {{investigated}} {{the mechanisms of}} organic reactions, and {{had come up with}} empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic <b>organic</b> <b>chemist</b> who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.|$|E
25|$|John Harold Eicher (March 30, 1921 – June 7, 2016) was an <b>organic</b> <b>chemist,</b> philosopher of science, historian, and author. He was a Manhattan Project {{scientist}} {{who worked at}} Columbia University to develop the first atomic bomb, and taught chemistry at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, for 37 years.

5000|$|When he couldn't {{find enough}} fully trained local chemists, Rosenkranz {{recruited}} researchers from Mexico {{and around the}} world. Rosenkranz also helped to create an institute of chemistry, the Instituto de Quimica (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México), now considered [...] "a flagship in Mexico's ethnobotanical research". He was able to attract significant synthetic <b>organic</b> <b>chemists</b> as researchers and instructors and to obtain funding to expand programs for the training of <b>organic</b> <b>chemists.</b> He and his colleagues regularly worked at Syntex {{during the day and}} then spent the evenings teaching chemistry.

25|$|During World War II, Woodward was an {{advisor to}} the War Production Board on the {{penicillin}} project. Although often given credit for proposing the beta-lactam structure of penicillin, it was actually first proposed by chemists at Merck and Edward Abraham at Oxford and then investigated by other groups, as well (e.g., Shell). Woodward at first endorsed an incorrect tricyclic (thiazolidine fused, amino bridged oxazinone) structure put forth by the penicillin group at Peoria. Subsequently, he put his imprimatur on the beta-lactam structure, {{all of this in}} opposition to the thiazolidineoxazolone structure proposed by Robert Robinson, the then leading <b>organic</b> <b>chemist</b> of his generation. Ultimately, the beta-lactam structure was shown to be correct by Dorothy Hodgkin using X-ray crystallography in 1945.|$|E
25|$|In 1816, François Magendie {{discovered}} that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein {{as an essential}} dietary component. William Prout in 1827 {{was the first person}} to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein. During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds). With a reputation as the leading <b>organic</b> <b>chemist</b> of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology, Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value. In the 1860s, Claude Bernard {{discovered that}} body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, on April 30, 1936, Carothers {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences, a very high honor. Carothers was the first {{industrial}} <b>organic</b> <b>chemist</b> to receive this honor. Yet by June 1936, in spite of this honor which validated his contributions to science, Carothers could not shake the depression that prevented him from working. In early June he was admitted involuntarily to the Philadelphia Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, a prestigious mental hospital, where his psychiatrist was Dr. Kenneth Appel. One month later he was given permission to leave the institute to go hiking in the Tyrolean Alps with friends. The plan was for him to day hike with Dr. Roger Adams and Dr. John Flack for two weeks. After they left, he stayed on, hiking by himself, without sending word to anyone, even his wife. On September 14, he suddenly appeared at her desk at the Experimental Station. From that point on Carothers was not expected to perform any real work at the Experimental Station. He would often go in and visit. He began living in Whiskey Acres again, after his wife had agreed with Dr. Appel that she was not strong enough to watch over Carothers.|$|E
