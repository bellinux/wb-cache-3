Drake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where he was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement late Sunday evening.|$|E
25|$|Abbott Lawrence Lowell {{was in his}} tenth year as President of the University. He {{was born}} in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1856, the scion of a famous family. He {{graduated}} from Harvard College cum laude in 1877 and from Harvard Law School in 1880. After practicing law, he taught at Harvard and in 1909 began his 24-year tenure as President of Harvard University. An educational reformer, he implemented {{a new set of}} academic requirements for Harvard undergraduates that required them to concentrate in a particular discipline beginning in 1914. He established a distinctive profile as a defender <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>freedom</b> in the years during and after World War I. His tenure was marked by controversies about his proposed establishment of a quota to limit the admission of Jewish students and his attempt to exclude African American students from residing in the Freshman Halls. He implemented Harvard College's residential house system in 1930 and retired in 1933. He died in 1943.|$|E

25|$|Political theorist Herbert Marcuse {{joined the}} faculty in 1965. A {{champion}} of the New Left, he reportedly was the first protestor to occupy the administration building in a demonstration organized by his student, political activist Angela Davis. The American Legion offered to buy out the remainder of Marcuse's contract for $20,000; the Regents censured Chancellor McGill for defending Marcuse on the basis <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>freedom,</b> but further action was averted after local leaders expressed support for Marcuse. Further student unrest was felt at the university, as the United States increased its involvement in the Vietnam War during the early 1960s, when a student raised a Viet Minh flag over the campus. Protests escalated as the war continued and were only exacerbated after the National Guard fired on student protesters at Kent State University in 1970. Over 200 students occupied Urey Hall, with one student setting himself on fire in protest of the war.|$|E
25|$|H. Bruce Franklin (born February 1934), is an American {{cultural}} {{historian and}} scholar. He is notable for receiving top awards for his lifetime scholarship in fields {{as diverse as}} American studies, science fiction, prison literature and marine ecology. He has written or edited nineteen books and three hundred professional articles and participated in making four films. His main areas of academic focus are science fiction, prison literature, environmentalism, the Vietnam War and its aftermath, and American cultural history. He was instrumental in helping to debunk false public speculation that Vietnam was continuing to hold prisoners of war. He helped to establish science fiction writing as a genre worthy of serious academic study. In 2008, the American Studies Association awarded him the Pearson-Bode Prize for Lifetime Achievement in American Studies. A critic of the Vietnam War, he was fired from Stanford in 1972 for allegedly inciting to riot, and the termination brought nationwide attention to the issue <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>freedom.</b> Since 1975, he is the John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|CNN did an {{interview}} with Al-Arian in January 2002 in which Al-Arian accused the university of allowing those who make death threats dictate the limits <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>freedom.</b> Florida Governor Jeb Bush entered into the fray when he offered support for Genshaft's decision for Al-Arian's dismissal. An editorial from The New York Times criticized Bush and the university's handling of the case as an affront to freedom of speech. In late January, several student organizations at USF rallied on campus to protest Genshaft's firing of Al-Arian. At the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Lakeland in February 2002, Al-Arian discussed {{the history of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict and answered questions from the community regarding his USF quandary. Roy Weatherford, the President of the USF Faculty Union, lambasted the decision to fire Al-Arian in front of Genshaft in a faculty summit in March 2002. Following the summit, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) revealed that it was conducting an investigation on Genshaft to determine if she had violated academic freedom. In late April 2002, AAUP investigators reported that Genshaft was wavering on her decision to fire Al-Arian, especially if the university was officially censured. AAUP investigators went on to conclude that Genshaft's decision to place Al-Arian on paid administrative leave rather than suspension reflected her lack of faith in legal advice that green-lighted Al-Arian's firing. USF denied the report and denied that AAUP's decision for censure would factor in Al-Arian's firing.|$|E

500|$|On April 19, 1969, Cornell's Afro-American Society {{occupied}} the Willard Straight Hall student union in protest against [...] "the university's racist attitudes and irrelevant curriculum" [...] regarding racial issues. The university was divided between {{proponents of the}} inclusion of the principles of social justice in course instruction and advocates <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>freedom</b> for the faculty. This clash affected the Department of Government, where Kahin and a number of professors defending academic freedom resided. Many of these professors had considered leaving the university due to the administration's policies promoting racial justice, and many did following the end of the occupation. The following week, the Department of Government organized a teach-in on academic freedom, and Kahin was invited to speak at the event by department chair Peter Sharfman. Historian Walter LaFeber would later remember his remarks as [...] "the most eloquent speech about academic freedom I have ever encountered anywhere up to that time or since that time".|$|E
500|$|Between 1965 and 1969, Conant, {{suffering}} from a heart condition, worked on his biography, My Several Lives. He became increasingly infirm, and suffered a series of strokes in 1977.

He was survived by his wife and sons. His papers are in the Harvard University Archives. Among them was a sealed brown Manila envelope that Conant had given the archives in 1951, with instructions that it was to be opened by the President of Harvard in the 21st century. It was given to the 28th President of Harvard University, Drew Faust, in 2007. She broke the seal, and found that it contained a letter in which Conant expressed his hopes and fears for the future to his successor.

500|$|Later in 1899, while {{traveling}} by train between Atlanta and Covington, Georgia, Sledd witnessed {{the aftermath of}} the lynching of an African-American man named Sam Hose. [...] The idealistic young minister was outraged. In reaction, he wrote an essay entitled [...] "The Negro: Another View," [...] which was published as an article in the July 1902 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. In the article, Sledd denounced the lynchings of black men in the South in graphic terms: [...] "lynching is not 'justice,' however rude; it is a wild and diabolic carnival of blood." [...] While he flatly asserted that the [...] "negro race" [...] was not the equal of the [...] "white race," [...] he nevertheless demanded equal justice for blacks and whites alike, writing [...] "There is nothing in a white skin or a black to nullify the essential rights of man as man." [...] Even though Sledd's essay condoned the continued racial segregation of white and black Southerners as a necessary social expedient, a public firestorm ensued in Georgia over Sledd's criticism of the South's treatment of its black citizens, with the controversy stoked by the vitriolic letters and editorial attacks of agrarian populist Rebecca Felton in The Atlanta Constitution newspaper. As the controversy grew, The Atlanta Journal and Atlanta News quickly joined the anti-Sledd chorus. When a majority of the members of Emory's board of trustees threatened to withdraw their support of the college because of the negative publicity, the newly installed college president, James E. Dickey, demanded Sledd's resignation from the faculty, and Sledd resigned on August 9, 1902. The Sledd Affair subsequently attracted attention throughout the United States as a matter <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>freedom</b> and freedom of speech.|$|E
