40|$|A {{central part}} of the {{innovation}} process concerns the way firms go about organizing search for new ideas that have commercial potential. New models of innovation have suggested that many innovative firms have changed the way they search for new ideas, adopting <b>open</b> <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> that involve the use {{of a wide range of}} external actors and sources to help them achieve and sustain innovation. Using a large-scale sample of industrial firms, this paper links search strategy to innovative performance, finding that searching widely and deeply is curvilinearly (taking an inverted U-shape) related to performance...|$|E
40|$|Given Chesbrough's idea of open innovation, {{it could}} be said that {{external}} knowledge is an important element in the optimisation of in-house innovation. External knowledge is distributed among various actors and is accessible through many channels. However, we still do not know much about the search strategies that affect innovation performance. Our study therefore explores the relationship between open knowledge search strategies and company-level innovative performance. This study examines the <b>open</b> <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> of 193 firms on the basis of cross-sectional data from Finnish markets. We identified four specific strategies, namely (1) market-driven, (2) science-driven, (3) intermediary-driven and (4) generic-knowledge-driven. According to the results, all except intermediary-driven strategies positively affect innovation performance. Openness, innovation performance, search strategies, innovation...|$|E

A single case study design enabled us to perform a thorough and detailed analysis of inter-firm collaboration and open innovation within the specific context of the Amsterdam denim cluster, which is internationally renowned as a centre of denim expertise with an important focus on sustainability. In-depth interviews and workshops were held with several stakeholders involved in Denim City, such as campus managers and denim brands. We find that <b>open</b> <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> have more depth than breadth when the collaboration is focused on radical innovation.

40|$|Firms compete {{increasingly}} in an <b>open</b> innovation environment. <b>Search</b> <b>strategies</b> for external knowledge become therefore crucial for firm success. Existing research differentiates between the breadth (diversity) and depth (intensity) with which firms pursue external knowledge source. A consensus exists that resource constrains force firms to balance both dimensions. However, relatively {{little is known}} on how managers can selectively strengthen one of these dimensions. We argue conceptually that the {{breadth and depth of}} a <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> depends upon the nature of a firm’s absorptive capacity (i. e. whether they are built through internal or external R&D activities) and the munificence of its innovation environment. We test these hypotheses empirically for a large sample of more than 8, 300 firms from 12 European countries. Our empirical results show that in-house R&D strengthens the depth of a firm’s <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> while external R&D activities (e. g. contract research) increase its breadth. Moreover, we find that scarce innovation environments favor deep <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> while breadth is more prevalent in munificent environments.

40|$|Moving from simplistic, <b>open</b> web <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> {{sufficient}} {{for high school}} level work to independently navigating the complex system of information sources available on college campuses is a developmental milestone for undergraduate students. One of the aims of library instruction is to {{play a critical role}} in this transition to college-level research, which necessitates the use of specialized databases and other information sources. Instruction librarians raise awareness of library e-resources and provide in-depth guidance in selecting and effectively using online sources. Santa Clara University librarians were interested in investigating the immediate impact of instruction on the use of the library’s e-resources. Do students regularly use library resources after instruction or do they revert to open web sources when searching independently? To study this question, Santa Clara University librarians examined LibGuides statistics, usage data, and instruction data to determine how frequently students access library databases post-instruction. The investigators examined LibGuides associated with course instruction from a selection of classes and explored the potential impact of instructional techniques, timing of instruction, and assignment integration on sustained use of electronic resources. The investigators also examined use of resources by level of course to explore whether independent use of library resources increased as students progress through their college years. This poster will share methodologies for assessing use of library e-resources after instruction using LibGuides statistics combined with usage and instruction data. The poster will also explore opportunities for implementing this method to assess instruction, access, and use of e-resources on college campuses. Speaker...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the open innovation model, it is increasingly common to source knowledge for new product ideas {{from a wide range of}} actors located outside of organizational boundaries. Such <b>open</b> <b>search</b> <b>strategies,</b> however, might not always be superior to their closed counterparts. Indeed, widening the scope of knowledge sourcing at the ideation stage typically comes at a price given the substantial monetary and nonmonetary costs often incurred in the process of identifying, assimilating, and utilizing external knowledge inputs. Considering both the benefits and costs of search openness, the authors develop a project-level contingency model of open innovation. This model suggests that search openness is curvilinearly (taking an inverted U-shape) related to new product creativity and success. They hence assume that too little as well as too much search openness at the ideation stage will be detrimental to new product outcomes. Moreover, they argue that the effectiveness of <b>open</b> <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> is contingent upon the new product development (NPD) project type (typological contingency), the NPD project leader (managerial contingency), and the NPD project environment (contextual contingency). To test these propositions empirically, multi-informant data from 62 NPD projects initiated in the English National Health Service (NHS) were collected. The econometric analyses conducted provide considerable support for a curvilinear relationship between search openness and NPD outcomes as well as for the hypothesized contingency effects. More specifically, they reveal that explorative NPD projects have more to gain from search openness at the ideation stage than their exploitative counterparts. Moreover, the project-level payoff from search openness tends to be greater, when the project leader has substantial prior innovation and management experience, and when the immediate work environment actively supports creative endeavors. These findings are valuable for NPD practice, as they demonstrate that effective knowledge sourcing has much to contribute to NPD success. In particular, pursuing an open search strategy might not always be the best choice. Rather, each NPD project is in need of a carefully tailored search strategy, effective leadership, and a supportive climate, if the full value of external knowledge sourcing is to be captured...|$|E

We performed a Mars analogue drilling campaign next to the Salar Grande (Atacama, Chile) in July 2009, and several cores and powder samples from up to 5 m deep were analyzed in situ with LDChip 300 (a Life Detector Chip containing 300 antibodies). Here, we show {{the discovery of a}} hypersaline subsurface microbial habitat associated with halite-, nitrate-, and perchlorate-containing salts at 2 m deep. LDChip 300 detected bacteria, archaea, and other biological material (DNA, exopolysaccharides, some peptides) from the analysis of less than 0. 5 g of ground core sample. The results were supported by oligonucleotide microarray hybridization in the field and finally confirmed by molecular phylogenetic analysis and direct visualization of microbial cells bound to halite crystals in the laboratory. Geochemical analyses revealed a habitat with abundant hygroscopic salts like halite (up to 260 g kg - 1) and perchlorate (41. 13 μg g - 1 maximum), which allow deliquescence events at low relative humidity. Thin liquid water films would permit microbes to proliferate by using detected organic acids like acetate (19. 14 μg g - 1) or formate (76. 06 μg g - 1) as electron donors, and sulfate (15875 μg g - 1), nitrate (13490 μg g - 1), or perchlorate as acceptors.

When MEDLINE is searched unaided, key articles are often missed while retrieving many articles that are irrelevant to the search. The objectives of this study were to develop optimal <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> to detect articles with mental health content and to determine the effect of combining mental health content <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> with methodologic <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> calibrated to detect the best studies of treatment. Method An analytic survey was conducted, comparing hand searches of 29 journals with retrievals from MEDLINE for 3, 395 candidate search terms and 11, 317 combinations. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy of the <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> were calculated. Results 3, 277 (26. 8 %) of the 12, 233 articles classified in the 29 journals were considered to be of interest to the discipline area of mental health. Search term combinations reached peak sensitivities of 98. 4 % with specificity at 50. 0 %, whereas combinations of search terms to optimize specificity reached peak specificities of 97. 1 % with sensitivity at 51. 7 %. Combining content <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> with methodologic <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> for treatment led to improved precision: substantive decreases in the number of articles that needed to be sorted through in order to find target articles.

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the minimal number of high-quality articles in a journal subset that would need to be hand-searched to update or create new MEDLINE <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> for treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis studies. Methods The desired width of the 95 % confidence intervals (W) for the lowest sensitivity among existing <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> was used to calculate the number of high-quality articles needed to reliably update <b>search</b> <b>strategies.</b> New <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> were derived in journal subsets formed by 2 approaches: random sampling of journals and top journals (having the most high-quality articles). The new strategies were tested in both the original large journal database and in a low-yielding journal (having few high-quality articles) subset. Results For treatment studies, if W was 10 % or less for the lowest sensitivity among our existing <b>search</b> <b>strategies,</b> a subset of 15 randomly selected journals or 2 top journals were adequate for updating <b>search</b> <b>strategies,</b> based on each approach having at least 99 high-quality articles. The new strategies derived in 15 randomly selected journals or 2 top journals performed well in the original large journal database. Nevertheless, the new <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> developed using the random sampling approach performed better than those developed using the top journal approach in a low-yielding journal subset. For studies of diagnosis and prognosis, no journal subset had enough high-quality articles to achieve the expected W (10 %).

By reasonably setting a searching scope, the local computational complexity is reduced when the optimal relays are selected.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{an efficient}} <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> to substantially accelerate feature based registration. Previous feature based registration algorithms often use truncated <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> {{in order to}} achieve small computation times. Our new accelerated <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> is based on the realization that the search for corresponding features can be dramat-ically accelerated by utilizing Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimension reduc-tion. Order of magnitude calculations for the <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> we propose here indicate that the algorithm proposed is more than a million times faster than previously utilized naive <b>search</b> <b>strategies,</b> and this advan-tage in speed is directly translated into an advantage in accuracy as the fast speed enables more comparisons {{to be made in the}} same amount of time. We describe the accelerated scheme together with a full complex-ity analysis. The registration algorithm was applied to large transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of neural ultrastructure. Our experi-ments demonstrate that our algorithm enables alignment of TEM images with increased accuracy and efficiency compared to previous algorithms. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a heuristic <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> called beam <b>search</b> and investigates its effectiveness by applying it to classical job shop scheduling problems. A look-ahead feature {{is incorporated in}} the strategy to detect potential resource conflicts. Benchmark problems and existing test cases are used in a performance analysis of the <b>search</b> <b>strategy.</b> The <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> is implemented in a SUN SPARC station using Common-LISP. Our computational experience using this enhanced version of beam search on job shop scheduling problems are reported...|$|R

Studies that focusing the use of the controlled and natural languages in the <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> are reviewed providing a perspective on the complexity of searching for bibliographic and referral information, including the selection of terms for the <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> and the role of controlled vocabulary or the natural language in this contex...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the absence}} of side effects, a {{functional}} logic program can be executed with different strategies. To evaluate expressions, Curry uses a variant of the needed narrowing strategy which combines lazy evaluation with non-deterministic <b>search</b> <b>strategies.</b> In contrast to Prolog, which uses backtracking to search for solutions, Curry does not fix a particular <b>search</b> <b>strategy.</b> Hence, there are implementations of Curry, like KiCS2, where the user can easily select a <b>search</b> <b>strategy,</b> like depth-first <b>search</b> (backtracking), breadth-first search, iterative deepening, or parallel search.|$|R
