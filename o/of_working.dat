40|$|The {{power demand}} <b>of</b> many mobile <b>working</b> {{machines}} such as mine loaders, straddle carriers and harvesters varies significantly during operation, and typically, the average power demand <b>of</b> a <b>working</b> machine is considerably {{lower than the}} demand for maximum power. Consequently, {{for most of the}} time, the diesel engine <b>of</b> a <b>working</b> machine operates at a poor efficiency far from its optimum efficiency range. However, the energy efficiency <b>of</b> dieseldriven <b>working</b> machines can be improved by electric hybridization. This way, the diesel engine can be dimensioned to operate within its optimum efficiency range, and the electric drive with its energy storages responds to changes in machine loading. A hybrid working machine can be implemented in many ways either as a parallel hybrid, a series hybrid or a combination of these two. The energy efficiency <b>of</b> hybrid <b>working</b> machines can be further enhanced by energy recovery and reuse. This doctoral thesis introduces the component models required in the simulation model <b>of</b> a <b>working</b> machine. Component efficiency maps are applied to the modelling; the efficiency maps for electrical machines are determined analytically in the whole torque–rotational speed plane based on the electricalmachine parameters. Furthermore, the thesis provides simulation models for parallel, series and parallel-series hybrid working machines. With these simulation models, the energy consumption <b>of</b> the <b>working</b> machine can be analysed. In addition, the hybridization process is introduced and described. The thesis provides a case example of the hybridization and dimensioning process <b>of</b> a <b>working</b> machine, starting from the work cycle of the machine. The selection and dimensioning of the hybrid system {{have a significant impact on}} the energy consumption <b>of</b> a hybrid <b>working</b> machine. The thesis compares the energy consumption <b>of</b> a <b>working</b> machine implemented by three different hybrid systems (parallel, series and parallel-series) and with different component dimensions. The payback time <b>of</b> a hybrid <b>working</b> machine and the energy storage lifetime are also estimated in the study...|$|R
