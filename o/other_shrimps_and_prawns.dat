5000|$|The term [...] "prawn" [...] is used {{particularly}} in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Commonwealth nations, for large swimming crustaceans or shrimp, especially those with commercial significance in the fishing industry. Shrimp that fall in this category often belong to the suborder Dendrobranchiata. In North America, the term is used less frequently, typically for freshwater shrimp. The terms <b>shrimp</b> <b>and</b> <b>prawn</b> themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years, the way <b>shrimp</b> <b>and</b> <b>prawn</b> are used has changed, and nowadays the terms are almost interchangeable.|$|R
