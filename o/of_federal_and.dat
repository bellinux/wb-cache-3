5|$|A {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>and</b> State {{funding was}} {{obtained for the}} project. In March 1972, the entire cost of the section between 34th Street and 126th Street, according to the project's Draft Environmental Study, {{was estimated to be}} $381 million. In June 1972, it was announced that the UMTA would grant $25 million for the construction of this section of the line. The MTA had requested $254 million in federal funds for {{the northern part of the}} line. Preliminary estimates of the cost of the southern portion of the line came to $450 million.|$|E
5|$|The New York State Department of Transportation has {{scheduled}} for NY28N to undergo construction in spring 2013, to rehabilitate the {{bridge over the}} Upper Hudson River Railroad. The $5.9million project is projected to be complete in fall of 2015, and is to be supported by state and federal funds. New York State Department of Transportation has also planned for NY28N's bridge over Stillwater Brook in Minerva to be replaced with a stronger structure. The development of the project {{is expected to take}} place 2014, with bids and construction starting in 2016. The project has been set to end in 2017, and is predicted to cost $1.1million <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> state funds.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>and</b> State {{funding was}} obtained, {{and despite the}} controversy over the number of stops and route, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 27, 1972 at Second Avenue and 103rd Street. Construction began shortly thereafter on what was to be the 99th–105th Streets segment, which was projected to cost $17.48 million (worth about $ today). However, the city soon experienced its most dire fiscal crisis yet, due to the stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs, and in September 1975 construction on the line stopped, and the tunnels were sealed. Over the next few decades, the MTA regularly inspected and maintained the tunnel segments (spending $20,000 a year by the early 1990s), to maintain the structural integrity of the streets above, and in case construction would ever resume. Trespassers would often camp in the tunnels until the MTA increased security.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day that Typhoon Pongsona struck Guam, President George W. Bush {{declared}} the island a major disaster area. Around the time of the cyclone passing over the island, 2,271residents were in shelters, and by the next day it increased to 3,467 after people discovered their homes were uninhabitable. With thirteen Red Cross shelters across Guam, most remained in shelters for about three weeks before disaster tents were distributed. The American Red Cross worked with the United States Department of Agriculture to provide meals for shelter attendees for a two-week period following the typhoon. Through the collaboration <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> other agencies, disaster assistance on Guam totaled over $300million (2003USD, $335million 2007USD) by 100days after the typhoon struck, including $60million (2002USD, $ USD) in initial disaster response. Nearly 29,000individuals registered for disaster assistance, with the first assistance check arrived ten days after the disaster declaration. By three months after the storm, the United States Small Business Administration approved $130million (2003USD, $ USD) in low-interest loans.|$|E

The federal government is responsible for establishing objectives for the entire country and the provincial governments are responsible for enforcing these objectives and developing the methods to achieve these goals.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{transcription}} {{is still}} the primary mechanism for a physician to clearly communicate with other healthcare providers who access the patient record, to advise them {{on the state of}} the patient's health and past/current treatment, and to assure continuity of care.

25|$|Although {{the provinces}} {{have the power}} to create {{criminal}} courts, only the federal government has the power to determine criminal procedure and to appoint those courts' judges. Criminal procedure includes prosecution, and federal law can determine the extent <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> provincial involvement. The provinces' power under s. 92(14) over the administration of justice includes the organization of courts and police forces, which determines the level of law enforcement. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as the federal police, contracts for the provision of many provincial and municipal police forces.|$|E
25|$|United States {{antitrust}} {{law is a}} collection <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> state government laws that regulates the conduct and organization of business corporations, generally to promote fair competition {{for the benefit of}} consumers. (The concept is called competition law in other English-speaking countries.) The main statutes are the Sherman Act 1890, the Clayton Act 1914 and the Federal Trade Commission Act 1914. These Acts, first, restrict the formation of cartels and prohibit other collusive practices regarded as being in restraint of trade. Second, they restrict the mergers and acquisitions of organizations that could substantially lessen competition. Third, they prohibit the creation of a monopoly and the abuse of monopoly power.|$|E

25|$|The head {{of state}} is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as {{representative}} of the nation. Examples include the President of Germany (appointed by members <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> state legislatures), the Queen of the United Kingdom (an hereditary office), and the President of Austria (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the presidential system, found in the United States and in Brazil. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both {{head of state}} and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature {{to which it is}} not accountable.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, city {{authorities}} {{started an}} investigation against Agriprocessors due to complaints from local residents {{that the firm}} routinely deposited untreated effluent into local rivers in breach of regulations. On August 31, 2006, Agriprocessors signed a consent decree where they essentially admitted discharging untreated slaughtering wastewater into the Postville sewer system, in violation <b>of</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>and</b> Iowa State law and paid a $600,000 fine for violating waste-water regulations. Untreated wastewater from abattoirs is a heavy burden on wastewater treatment plants because of its high biochemical oxygen demand and high concentration of FOG (Fats, oils, and grease) which can form insoluble plaques in sewage pipes.|$|E

Collier's statement also said that EPA’s proposal was based on outdated mining scenarios that were not part of the project's approach.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{is a major}} {{producer}} of uranium, which it exports as uranium oxide to nuclear power generating nations.

As of January 2016, new nuclear industrial development (other than the mining of uranium) is prohibited by various acts <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> state legislation. The Federal government will consider the findings of the South Australian Royal Commission after it releases its findings in 2016.|$|E
25|$|When the Bosnian War {{broke out}} in April 1992, there were four types <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> Serb armed forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

With {{the withdrawal of the}} JNA from Slovenia and much of Croatia, by early April 1992 the JNA in western Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina had around 100,000–110,000 troops, equipped with about 500 tanks, 400 medium artillery pieces, 48 multiple rocket launchers, and 350 120mm mortars. In addition, the JNA had 120 fighter-bombers, 40 light helicopters and 30 transport helicopters. The Bosnian Serb MUP totalled about 15,000, including active, special and reserve police.|$|E
