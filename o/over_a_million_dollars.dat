5|$|Chandralekha was in {{production}} {{for five years}} (1943–1948), with changes to its story, cast and filming which generated substantial time and cost overruns. The film ultimately cost 3million (about $600,000 in 1948), and was the most-expensive Indian film at the time. Vasan mortgaged all his property, received financial assistance from The Hindu editor K. Srinivasan and sold his jewellery to complete the film. Adjusted for inflation, Chandralekha would have cost $28million in 2010. According to historian S.

Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{was freed}} and {{returned}} to Israel after having served about {{three years in prison}} first in Israel and then in the United States. Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money, he allegedly had played a relatively minor role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin, who was arrested in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011, but refuses to testify against the Abergils. As a result, U.S. authorities reportedly were not able to build a case against Meir Abergil, leading to a plea agreement approved by a California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> from another mob figure. In Israel, he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel, including Internet cafes, convenience stores, soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos. According to his lawyer, Abergil′s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to rural}} parts of California, living in Milpitas is more expensive, {{as it is}} {{throughout}} Silicon Valley. Compared to other South Bay bedroom communities Milpitas is considered affordable. For example, a regular one-story, detached single-family home with a 1,300-square-foot (140 m²) size sells for between $600,000 to $700,000 in the city. These prices are slightly more affordable {{than the rest of}} the San Francisco Bay Area, as a similar sized house may cost well <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> in more affluent cities such as Palo Alto, Cupertino or Saratoga. Reasons for the expensive housing in the South Bay Area include the regional high tech industries, mild climate, strong foreign investment in the West Coast's housing, and a huge demand for limited homes. With the decline in the housing market, however, median sales prices in Milpitas have declined from nearly $700,000 to less than $500,000, and single-family new house construction building permits have plummeted from a 2004 average price of $949,900 to $269,400 in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter {{finally gave}} up and in 1961 sold the stadium for $600,000 {{to a group of}} New York real estate investors, losing <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> after his 7-year ownership; he secured a 3-year lease and an option to stay through 1967 while he pursued his Torresdale stadium plan. The New York buyers quickly flipped the {{property}} to another New York consortium who, assuming the Phillies would be gone by 1967, began planning the demolition of the stadium and construction of a bowling alley and discount store on the site. Then in May 1964, Jerry Wolman, who had just bought the Philadelphia Eagles in February, brought the stadium ownership back to town, paying $757,000 for it {{as part of a larger}} real estate deal. Wolman's motivations for the purchase are in dispute – all the mortgage shuffling did not slow the decay out at the park – but he claimed he wanted to help the Phillies; the move also put him at the very center of the emerging fight over a new stadium in Philadelphia, which would likely affect his Eagles.|$|E
