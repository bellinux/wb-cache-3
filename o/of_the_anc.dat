5|$|In 1975 and 1976, the South African {{government}} conducted delicate {{negotiations with}} neighbouring states: the South Africans wanted to encourage those states to maintain economic relations with South Africa and Rhodesia while limiting the activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> ZANU and ZAPU. However, increasingly aggressive {{actions by the}} Rhodesian army outside its own borders resulted in the failure of this conciliatory approach.|$|E
5|$|The Ipsos/Sunday Times survey {{undertaken}} in February and March 2014 {{showed that the}} ANC enjoyed majority support in all provinces except the Western Cape, where the DA retains majority support. DA support followed that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> in all other provinces except for the North West, where the EFF came in second place.|$|E
5|$|Biko {{endorsed}} {{the unification of}} South Africa's black liberationist groups—among them the BCM, PAC, and African National Congress (ANC)—in order to concentrate their anti-apartheid efforts. To this end, {{he reached out to}} leading members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> PAC, and Unity Movement. His communications with the ANC were largely via Griffiths Mxenge, and plans were being made to smuggle him out of the country to meet Oliver Tambo, a leading ANC figure. Biko's negotiations with the PAC were primarily through intermediaries who exchanged messages between him and Sobukwe; those with the Unity Movement were largely via Fikile Bam.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, with <b>the</b> tide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War turning and {{no sign of}} a {{political}} resolution in South Africa, Western patience began to run out. By 1989, a bipartisan Republican/Democratic initiative in the US favoured economic sanctions (realised as the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act <b>of</b> 1986), <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> Nelson Mandela and a negotiated settlement involving <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> Thatcher too began to take a similar line, but insisted on <b>the</b> suspension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> armed struggle.|$|R
5|$|Gordimer herself became {{involved}} in South African struggle politics after the arrest of a friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 for trade unionist activities and {{being a member of}} the SACP. Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend. Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the Delmas Treason Trial in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> while it was still an illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders in her own home to help them evade arrest by the security forces.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{has also}} {{been used as a}} symbol of protest post-1994. In 2005, a statue of King Makhado was vandalised in Louis Trichardt with the colours of the flag as a protest against a {{proposal}} to change the name of the town to Makhado. Some South Africans in the 21st century started to fly the flag as a protest against a perceived failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> to make progress in governing South Africa as a democracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} African National Congress (ANC), {{supported by}} its Tripartite Alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP), have held {{a majority of}} the seats in the National Assembly since 1994. They were re-elected with increasing majorities in 1999 and 2004, and with a slight fall in its majority from 69% to 65.9% in 2009. The ANC is led by Jacob Zuma. In 2012, Zuma was re-elected to a second five-year term as President of the African National Congress, beating his only rival and deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, by a wide margin. Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as Deputy President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> succeeding Motlanthe who had declined a second term after losing to Zuma.|$|E
50|$|He is a vocal critic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present <b>ANC</b> {{leadership}} under Jacob Zuma, {{calling for}} <b>the</b> resignation <b>of</b> Zuma, and has links with grassroots movements opposed to <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The African National Congress {{printed and}} {{distributed}} leaflets with the slogan [...] "Free Mandela, Hang Vorster", immediately linking the language issue to its revolutionary heritage and programme and helping establish its leading role (see Baruch Hirson's [...] "Year of Fire, Year of Ash" [...] {{for a discussion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> ability to channel and direct the popular anger).|$|R
25|$|Following <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ban on <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> in February 1990, Zuma was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>ANC</b> {{leaders to}} return to South Africa to begin <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> negotiations.|$|R
5|$|Freedom Square {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Victoria and Morris Streets. It was famous in the 1950s for the {{political}} meetings held there. It was utilised by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Transvaal Congress Party. Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston. Freedom Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties. Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime. Freedom Square in Sophiatown {{should not be confused with}} Freedom Square in Kliptown, Soweto, where the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC in 1955. It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside the Christ the King Church.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, Mandela {{published}} Long Walk to Freedom, {{an autobiography}} based around a manuscript {{he had written}} in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel. In late 1994, he attended the 49th conference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> in Bloemfontein, at which a more militant national executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she {{expressed an interest in}} reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995. By 1995, he had entered into a relationship with Graça Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel. They had first met in July 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. She turned down Mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the ANC {{held to the}} belief that its primary {{activity}} was political organising, and that any cultural activity was secondary to this. This belief began to shift with the establishment of the Mayibuye Cultural Ensemble in 1975, and the Amandla Cultural Ensemble later in the 1970s. Mayibuye was established as a growing number of ANC activists argued that cultural events needed to form a part of their work, and could be used to raise awareness of apartheid, gather support, and drive political change. The group was established by ANC activists Barry Feinberg and Ronnie Kasrils, who named it after the slogan Mayibuye iAfrika (Let Africa Return). The group consisted of several South African performers, and used a mixture of songs, poetry, and narrative in their performance, which described life under the apartheid government and their struggle against it. The songs were often performed in three- or four-part harmony. The group performed more than 200 times across Europe, and were seen as the cultural arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> The group experienced personal and organisational difficulties, and disbanded in 1980.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, however, with <b>the</b> tide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War turning and {{no sign of}} a {{political}} resolution in South Africa, Western patience with the apartheid government began to run out. By 1989, a bipartisan Republican/Democratic initiative in the US favoured economic sanctions (realised as the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act), <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> Nelson Mandela and a negotiated settlement involving <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> Thatcher too began to take a similar line, but insisted on <b>the</b> suspension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> armed struggle.|$|R

500|$|Due to <b>the</b> secretive nature <b>of</b> {{political}} {{funding in}} South Africa generally little public information exists on both sources of political funding of South African {{political parties and}} <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> their expenses however <b>the</b> ruling <b>ANC</b> did declare <b>the</b> 2014 elections to be the “most expensive election” it had ever fought to date. [...] According to leaked sources within <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> <b>the</b> 2014 elections cost <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> over R429-million. [...] Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> expenses include R118 million on campaign T-shirts, R17-million for the manifesto launch in Mbombela, R83.7-million in advertising (including R27-million for posters and billboards), R21 million for the victory rally, and R67-million on volunteers.|$|R
25|$|Zuma {{became a}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> National Executive Committee in 1977. He also served as Deputy Chief Representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> in Mozambique, a post he {{occupied}} until {{the signing of the}} Nkomati Accord between the Mozambican and South African governments in 1984. After signing the Accord, he was appointed as Chief Representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1990, he {{was elected}} Chairperson <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> for the Southern Natal region, and took {{a leading role in}} {{fighting}} political violence in the region between members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).

25|$|In 1973, Mbeki {{was sent}} to Botswana, where he engaged the Botswana {{government}} in discussions to open an ANC office there. He left Botswana in 1974. In 1975, he {{became a member of}} the National Executive Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> In December 1976, he {{was sent to}} Nigeria as a representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b>|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> {{presidency}} <b>of</b> Thabo Mbeki (1999-2008) {{relations were}} strained {{due to a}} combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> paranoia around alleged CIA activities {{in the country and}} perceived criticism of Mebeki's AIDS denialism. A feeling partly based on <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> experiences <b>of</b> tacit American support for the Apartheid government during the Reagan administration. The Bush administration's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as its PEPFAR imitative (that clashed with Mbeki's views on AIDS) served to alienate the South African presidency until president Mbeki left government in 2008.|$|R

50|$|After the 1994 {{democratic}} election, Pahad {{served as}} the Parliamentary Counsellor to then-Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.

25|$|After the 1994 general election, {{with the}} ANC {{becoming}} a governing party but having lost KwaZulu-Natal province to the IFP, {{he was appointed}} as Member of the Executive Committee (MEC) of Economic Affairs and Tourism for the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government, after stepping aside to allow Thabo Mbeki to run unopposed for deputy presidency. In December 1994, he was elected National Chairperson <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> and chairperson <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> in KwaZulu-Natal, and was re-elected to the latter position in 1996.

25|$|In December 1961, Mbeki {{was elected}} {{secretary}} of the African Students' Association. In the following year, he left South Africa on instructions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} party tradition, as the deputy {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> Zuma {{was already in}} line to succeed Mbeki. The party structures held their nominations conferences in October and November 2007, where Zuma appeared favourite for the post of ANC President, and, by implication, the President of South Africa in 2009. With then-incumbent ANC- and South African President Thabo Mbeki as his opposition, Zuma was elected President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> on 18 December 2007 with 2329 votes, beating Mbeki's 1505 votes. Mbeki had sought a third term as ANC president, though the South African Constitution would not have allowed him a third term as President of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|When {{apartheid}} {{began to}} collapse in 1990 Bacher immediately {{set out to}} form one body to oversee all cricket in South Africa.

500|$|After 1989, F.W. de Klerk {{was elected}} {{president}} and immediately unbanned the African National Congress (ANC) and released their leader Nelson Mandela from prison. De Klerk instigated negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa with Mandela's <b>ANC.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> demands was that the flag gradually decrease in usage in South African life and that a new flag be created, as black South Africans associated the current one with apartheid and Afrikaner nationalism.|$|R

While at Sussex he saw himself as a representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> and helped motivate the university population against apartheid. Still in the UK, he worked in the ANC's London office on Penton Street. He received military training in the Soviet Union and lived at different times in Botswana, Swaziland and Nigeria, but his primary base was in Lusaka, Zambia, the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> headquarters.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the ANC {{launched}} an online weekly web-based newsletter, ANC Today – Online Voice of the African National Congress {{to offset the}} alleged bias of the press. It consists mainly of updates on current programmes and initiatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b>|$|E

50|$|During {{his early}} years with <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> Oliver Tambo was {{directly}} responsible for organizing active guerilla units. Along with his cohorts Nelson Mandela, Joe Slovo, and Walter Sisulu; Tambo directed and facilitated several attacks against the illegal apartheid state. Of which one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most notable was the Church Street bombing on 20 May 1983, which resulted in <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> 19 civilians and <b>the</b> wounding <b>of</b> a further 217. In submissions to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1997 and 1998, <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> revealed that <b>the</b> attack was orchestrated by a special operations unit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), commanded by Aboobaker Ismail. Such units had been authorised by Oliver Tambo, <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> President, in 1979. At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack, they reported to Joe Slovo as chief <b>of</b> staff, and <b>the</b> Church Street attack was authorised by Tambo.|$|R
5|$|With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops {{launched}} a major offensive against South Kasai.

As a result, <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. <b>The</b> violence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.|$|R
