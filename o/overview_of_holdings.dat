40|$|A short {{account of}} {{holdings}} of {{documents related to}} astronomy in German archives is given. Several online and printed inventories are indicated. The appendix contains a list of selected collections. 1. <b>Overview</b> <b>of</b> <b>Holdings</b> Astronomical documents {{can be found in}} a very large number of Ger-man archives. Large collections are e. g. that of the Berlin Academy of Sciences (holding papers from the Berlin and Potsdam observatories, papers of Auwers, Bessel, Bode, Encke and others, as well as papers concerning astronomy at the Berlin Academy), of the Göttingen Univer-sity Library (keeping papers from the Göttingen Observatory as well as papers of Gauß, Schwarzschild and others), and of the Deutsches Museum at Munich (owning papers of the Munich instrument makers Fraunhofer, Reichenbach, Steinheil and Utzschneider, as well as of some astronomers). Many observatories keep their files in their libraries or at other places (e. g. Bonn, Hamburg and Munich; also the European Southern Observatory at its headquarter in Garching near Munich – see Blaauw 1992), but the access is mostly difficult. It is not easy to convince institutions to give their papers to professional archives. In the case of Leipzig the files are in the University Library because the observatory does not longer exist. Papers of astronomers are kept in many different archives and li-braries, e. g. that of Max Wolf are stored in the Heidelberg Univer-sity Library, that of H. C. Schumacher – the founder of Astronomi-sche Nachrichten – in the State Library at Berlin. Letters written by 3...|$|E

This is achieved through the provision <b>of</b> an <b>overview</b> <b>of</b> the <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> a wide variety of Australian institutions that relate to the study of food and beverages, including their production, preparation and consumption. This article acknowledges the range of traditional materials that have, for many years, supported scholarly research in the field of food studies such as cookery books and historical materials. In addition, this article outlines some of the more unusual items that are both relevant and important to researchers including film and photographic materials, manuscripts, ephemera and everyday objects...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} brief history of the {{scientific}} study of butterflies in Mexico, which began in the 18 th century, and provide an <b>overview</b> <b>of</b> the <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> Mexican butterfly specimens in institutional collections worldwide. The current status of a massive database on Mexican butterflies. at present containing over 450, 000 distributional records, is detailed. Around 1800 species of butterflies have been reported freom Mexico, which equals roughly 10 % of the world butterfly fauna, placing Mexico among the ten most butterflyrich countries in the world. About 14. 8 % of Mexico's butterfly species are endemic, and six genera appear to be endemic to Mexico. For the first time, we present a list of all endemic Mexican butterfly taxa: 88 species and 150 additional subspecies of Papilionoidea, and 171 species and 14 additional subspecies of Hesperiidae. Patterns of species richness and endemism are not alike: the richest areas are in the southeastern part of Mexico, mostly in the tropical evergreen forests, whereas endeniism is greater in the and north, and the humid montane forest in the central and southern parts of the country. The twenty richest sites for butterfly diversity in Mexico are identified, and comparisons are made between these sites and regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to gain an <b>overview</b> <b>of</b> the <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> Slovenec in Slovenian libraries and to state the uniqueness of its original binding kept by the library of the Institute of Contemporary History in Ljubljana (hereafter {{referred to as the}} INZ). The article treats the question whether it is reasonable to conserve and restore the newspaper collection or to convert the microfilm version into digital form. The daily newspaper Slovenec was published in Ljubljana between the years 1873 and 1945 and between 1991 and 1996. It is considered to be an important part of Slovenian national and cultural heritage. The research encompasses only copies published between the years 1873 and 1945. The results are presented in two parts. The first part focuses on the condition of the newspaper collection in Slovenian libraries, whereas the second part focuses on copies kept by INZ. The article brings data on their number and condition, major damages and storage, as well as on their use and accessibility. Detailed description of the newspaper condition includes only copies kept by INZ. The research proved that only two collections are complete (one kept by the National and University Library in Ljubljana and the other one kept by INZ) and that the collection kept by INZ is unique. It was also established that a great deal of copies kept by individual libraries are damaged, however it is possible to digitize them. Damages are mostly due to heavy use, unsuitable storage conditions and poor quality of the materials. That is why paper edition should be appropriately preserved and conserved consequently the newspaper should be available in a more user-friendly form...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} situation <b>of</b> many forest <b>holdings</b> inthe Netherlands {{is a major}} concern. For example, the yearly <b>overview</b> <b>of</b> Dutch private forest holdings larger than 5 ha shows that over the las t 30 years, the average annual results were negative during most years. However, it {{should be taken into}} account that not all forest holdings focus pri-marily on the generation of financial benefits. Surprisingly, no studies relating financial rationales and financial results have yet been conducted. The aim of the present study was,therefore, to provide {{a better understanding of the}} financialsituation <b>of</b> forest <b>holdings,</b> using Dutch forest holdings as a case study, by (1) determining their financi al rationales and (2) relating these financial rationales to their financialresults. A survey was condu cted, in which the owners and managers <b>of</b> 205 forest <b>holdings</b> in the Netherlands partic-ipated. Based on a cluster analysis, these holdings could be classified into five rationales: ‘hobby owne rs’; ‘efficiency-based owners’; ‘budget producers’; ‘break even players’; and ‘economically oriented owners’. Different financial rationales led to differences in financial results: owner types that were more strongly oriented towards financial benefitsgenerally produce better results on average. However, the findings also showed that not all forest owners financially orientated on benefits achieved positive results. The findings give a better understanding <b>of</b> forest <b>holdings</b> and the financial results <b>of</b> their <b>holdings,</b> and provide a basis for further research and policy development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} there is a relationship between land distribution and productivity in agriculture. This paper estimates a cross-country agricultural production function that includes for the first time measures of land distribution as elements of productivity. The measures capture both the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> within a country, and the availability <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> across the agricultural population. The estimates suggest a very large and significant role for the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>holdings.</b> This role, though, does not appear to arise because of the decreasing returns to farm size that are often identified in micro-level research. The results indicate that improvements in the distribution of agricultural land are a potential source of gains in agricultural productivity, and income per capita, across countries...|$|R
