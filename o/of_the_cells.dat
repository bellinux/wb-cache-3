5|$|A {{configuration}} in Rule 90 can be partitioned {{into two}} subsets of cells {{that do not}} interact with each other. One of these two subsets consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in even positions at even time steps and the cells in odd positions in odd time steps. The other subset consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in even positions at odd time steps and the cells in odd positions at even time steps.

5|$|Like {{those of}} cnidarians, (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), ctenophores' bodies {{consist of a}} {{relatively}} thick, jelly-like mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia, layers of cells bound by inter-cell connections and by a fibrous basement membrane that they secrete. The epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in the upper layer have several cilia per cell.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{surfaces}} <b>of</b> most <b>cells</b> bear a net negative charge. <b>The</b> imposition <b>of</b> {{an electric}} field parallel to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> should produce, therefore, an electro-osmotic flow <b>of</b> fluid towards <b>the</b> cathodal side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> Our analysis <b>of</b> a simple model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface {{indicates that a}} negatively charged mobile macromolecule will be swept by this electro-osmotic flow <b>of</b> fluid to <b>the</b> cathodal side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> if its zeta potential, zeta 1, is less negative than <b>the</b> zeta potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface, zeta 2. Conversely, if zeta 2 is less negative than zeta 1, the negatively charged macromolecule will accumulate at <b>the</b> anodal side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> Our experimental results demonstrate that concanavalin A (Con A) receptors on embryonic muscle cells normally accumulate at <b>the</b> cathodal side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> but {{that they can be}} induced to accumulate at <b>the</b> anodal side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> by preincubating <b>the</b> myotubes either with neuraminidase, a treatment that removes negatively charged sialic acid residues, or with the lipid diI, a treatment that adds positive charges to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> Addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negatively charged lipid monosialoganglioside (GM 1), on the other hand, enhances <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> Con A receptors at <b>the</b> cathodal side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell...</b>|$|R

5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move.

5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells,</b> they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to safety}} {{concerns}} with viral vectors, nonviral delivery methods, typically employing lipid-based or polymeric vectors, are also promising candidates. Computational modeling of nonviral siRNA delivery paired with in vitro and in vivo gene knockdown studies elucidated the temporal behavior of RNAi in these systems. The model used an input bolus dose of siRNA and computationally and experimentally showed that knockdown duration was dependent {{mainly on the}} doubling time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> to which siRNA was delivered, while peak knockdown depended primarily on the delivered dose. Kinetic considerations of RNAi are imperative to safe and effective dosing schedules as nonviral methods of inducing RNAi continue to be developed.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{crystalline}} silicon modules, the solder material, that joins together the copper strings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells,</b> contains about 36 percent of lead (Pb). Moreover, the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb {{have been used for}} 100 gigawatts of c-Si solar modules. However, there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E

50|$|The MAPK/ERK pathway (also {{known as}} the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) is a chain <b>of</b> {{proteins}} in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> that communicates a signal from a receptor on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> to <b>the</b> DNA in <b>the</b> nucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|R

5|$|Mosaicism in horses {{is thought}} to account for some {{spontaneous}} occurrences of white, near-white, spotted, and roan horses. Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single-cell stage, and therefore affect {{only a portion of}} the adult cells. Mosaicism may be one possible cause for the rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses. Mosaic-white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites. Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a stem cell in the developing foal underwent a mutation, or change to the DNA, that resulted in unpigmented skin and hair. The cells that descend from the affected stem cell will exhibit the mutation, while the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> are unaffected.|$|E
5|$|Multinucleated cells contain {{multiple}} nuclei. Most acantharean {{species of}} protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other {{examples include the}} intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.|$|E
5|$|Rule 90 is an {{elementary}} cellular automaton. That {{means that it}} consists of a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which holds a single binary value, either 0 or 1. An assignment of values to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> is called a configuration. The automaton is given an initial configuration, and then progresses through other configurations in a sequence of discrete time steps. At each step, all cells are updated simultaneously. A pre-specified rule determines the new value of each cell {{as a function of}} its previous value and of the values in its two neighboring cells. All cells obey the same rule, which may be given either as a formula or as a rule table that specifies the new value for each possible combination of neighboring values.|$|E

5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tau {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade. In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies.

This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{advantage}} <b>of</b> whole-cell patch clamp recording over sharp microelectrode recording is {{that the}} larger opening at <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patch clamp electrode provides lower resistance and thus better electrical access to <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> A disadvantage <b>of</b> this technique is that because <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode is larger than <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> <b>the</b> soluble contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell's</b> interior will slowly be replaced by <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode. This {{is referred to as}} the electrode [...] "dialyzing" [...] <b>the</b> <b>cell's</b> contents. After a while, any properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> that depend on soluble intracellular contents will be altered. The pipette solution used usually approximates <b>the</b> high-potassium environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> to minimize any changes this may cause. There is often a period at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> a whole-cell recording when one can take measurements before <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> has been dialyzed.|$|R

50|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} is what <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> builds off <b>of</b> and has {{two primary}} purposes; {{the first is to}} stabilize <b>the</b> topography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intracellular components and the second is to help control the size and shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> While <b>the</b> first function is important for biochemical processes, the latter is crucial in defining the surface to volume ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> This heavily influences the potential electrical properties of excitable cells. Additionally deviation from the standard shape and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> can have negative prognostic impact.|$|R
