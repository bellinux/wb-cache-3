5|$|There {{were many}} ways to die on the inner German border. Numerous escapees were shot by the border guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany.

Meanwhile, negotiations between Smith and Harold Wilson's British Labour government broke down repeatedly throughout the year, leading the Rhodesian government to issue the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965. Most RLI men supported Smith, the RF and UDI, and so saw this step as cause for celebration.|$|E
