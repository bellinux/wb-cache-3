5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he {{said had}} been {{thinking}} along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my <b>own</b> <b>opinions,</b> which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius {{is not confined to}} the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her <b>own</b> <b>opinions.</b> Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Bridges' {{attitude}} changed sharply {{after the}} end of World War II. While he still advocated the post-war plan for industrial peace that the Communist Party, along with the leaders of the CIO, the AFL and the Chamber of Commerce, were advocating, he differed sharply with CIO leadership on Cold War politics. He had his <b>own</b> <b>opinions</b> about the Marshall Plan and the application of the Truman Doctrine in Greece and Turkey, as well as participation in the World Federation of Trade Unions, viewing every element from the point of how it would affect his constituents.|$|E

The truth is that he never yielded at all upon the question till my <b>own</b> <b>opinions</b> had become very strong and perfectly unchangeable, and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E

25|$|Of all the {{classical}} philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally {{considered the most}} important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's <b>own</b> <b>opinions</b> who has {{very little to do with}} the historical figure of the same name. The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the Socratic problem.|$|E
25|$|From the Renaissance on, some {{individuals}} wanted {{not only to}} record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to put down their <b>own</b> <b>opinions</b> and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris that covers the years 1405–49, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the Florentines Buonaccorso Pitti and Gregorio Dati and the Venetian Marino Sanuto the Younger. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.|$|E
25|$|On March 27, 2006, Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong {{received}} his first briefing {{on the case}} from Gottlieb and Himan. Within {{a few hours of}} receiving the briefing, Nifong made his first public statement on the case. During the week of March 27, Nifong by his own estimate gave fifty to seventy interviews and devoted more than forty hours to reporters. After that, he continued to make statements, although less frequently. Many of Nifong's statements concerned the team members' alleged failure or refusal to provide information to law enforcement authorities, the team members' invocation of their Constitutional rights, or Nifong's <b>own</b> <b>opinions</b> that a crime had occurred, that it was racially motivated, and that one or more lacrosse players were guilty.|$|E

25|$|The immortal souls {{that follow}} the gods most closely {{are able to}} just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, {{having to deal with}} their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while {{straining}} to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their <b>own</b> <b>opinions,</b> rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} show jumping {{competition}} held in England was at Olympia in 1907. Most of the competitors {{were members of}} the military and it became clear at this competition and in the subsequent years, that there was no uniformity of rules for the sport. Judges marked on their <b>own</b> <b>opinions.</b> Some marked according to the severity of the obstacle and others marked according to style. Before 1907 there were no penalties for a refusal and the competitor was sometimes asked to miss the fence to please the spectators. The first courses were built with little imagination, many consisting of only a straight bar fence and a water jump. A meeting was arranged in 1923 which {{led to the formation of}} the BSJA in 1925. In the United States, a similar need for national rules for jumping and other equestrian activities led to the formation of the American Horse Shows Association in 1917, which now is known as the United States Equestrian Federation.|$|E
