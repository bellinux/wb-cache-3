40|$|Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the {{bibliography}} topic, I {{spent the}} first couple of weeks of the semester reading books and articles given to me by Roger Pielke Jr. and Bobbie Klein. We had a few meetings where they gave me a more in depth description of what they wanted in the bibliography and how it would most likely be used. I started by searching the Chinook library catalogue as well as the Internet for anything related to vulnerability and natural disasters. Upon finding useful books, I used their bibliographies or references to find others of a similar nature. I searched many online journals or literature catalogues as well as related websites. After another meeting I started searching for topics relating to vulnerability and either the military, computers, or health. Adding these to the bibliography will hopefully give other researchers a broader outlook on the overall topic of vulnerability. Putting the whole project together I went through all the information I found to make sure everything would be useful. I used the <b>MLA</b> <b>format</b> for the entire bibliography.

40|$|The Challenge: Today a {{daunting}} quantity of scholarship relating to Hamlet exists. While databases and electronic catalogues aid research, these directories present a virtual wall of minimal bibliographic data. Sorting through lists still takes eons. Meanwhile, new publications are constantly {{added to the}} academic stacks that ever threaten to tumble over. The Solution: A web site that groups together scholarly publications using similar approaches and treating similar subjects will translate the overwhelming into the maneuverable. The online medium will provide accessibility to everyone [...] student, research assistant, instructor, scholar [...] and will guarantee the opportunity to update this resource on a regular basis. Scope: Listings will span materials published between 1991 and 2001. The bibliography will exclude notes, reviews, abstracts, and treatments of theatre and film performances as well as certain forums (e. g., newsletters, bulletins, electronic journals). Scholarship focusing on the Folio/Quartos debate seems relevant but requires specific and technical specialization and will thus be omitted. Pedagogical studies and comparisons of Hamlet to other literary works will also be excluded. Research: IAC Expanded Academic Index, 1982 - 1995, IAC Expanded Academic Index, 1996 -, and MLA Bibliography databases, as well as Dr. Sara Deats?private bibliography on Hamlet, will be combed for applicable scholarship. Organization: The bibliography will categorize publications by theoretical approach (e. g., feminism, new historicism) and subject focus (e. g., characters, themes).

40|$|Teachers {{confront the}} problem of {{plagiarism}} when they give research assignments. These research projects {{vary according to the}} way in which the professor, the department and the discipline defines research. To investigate research across the disciplines, I interviewed six professors who teach research assignments in their classes and six students who attempted to complete these assignments during the academic period of summer semester (1993) through fall semester (1994) at Ball State University. Specifically, I observed six disciplines [...] English, history, philosophy and religious studies, anthropology, physics, and biology [...] to assess the teachers' procedures for teaching research, and their explanations of how research could go wrong. Six student volunteers were observed throughout their research assignment as they gathered sources, accumulated data, observed experiments, wrote papers and compiled 11 a Works Cited list. After students completed their research assignments, I requested that each instructor evaluate the assignments and conclude whether it constituted legitimate, effective research. Although all six student researchers had difficulties completing their assignments, by the end of the semester four out of the six produced successful research projects. One student received an F on her project because she plagiarized, while another earned a C because she did not complete the assignment effectively. The students who did well on their research projects exhibited discipline-specific skills and the following general characteristics: the ability to gather sources, focus topics, authenticate sources, employ disciplinary language, adhere to citation and documentation format guidelines, and use computer and lab equipment. Indicators of possible plagiarism in research projects included: students using unspecified format (such as an older <b>MLA</b> <b>format),</b> writing that revealed improvement several skill levels above previous writing, uncited elevated language and phraseology, and a lack of sources in the bibliography.

40|$|Online {{education}} programs in nursing are increasing rapidly. Faculty need to be competent in their role and possess {{the skills necessary to}} positively impact student outcomes. Existing research offers effective teaching strategies for online education; however, there may be some disconnect in the application of these strategies and faculty perceptions of associated outcomes. Focus groups were formed to uncover how nursing faculty in an online program define and describe teaching effectiveness and quality indicators in an asynchronous online environment. A semistructured interview <b>format</b> <b>guided</b> group discussion. Participants (n= 11) included nurse educators from an online university with an average of 15 years of experience teaching in nursing academia and 6 years in an online environment.

What materialized from the analysis was an overarching concept of a “dance” that occurs in the online environment.
