500|$|The {{second and}} third seasons of the series were {{broadcast}} in two blocks each, with a season of Agent Carter airing in between. Bell explained that this decision was made following the challenge of producing 22 episodes for the first season to be aired over 36–40 weeks, which meant having repeats and [...] "losing momentum". Instead, Agent Carter took up much of that gap in a row, leaving the back half of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s season to run uninterrupted. This format allowed the producers and writers to approach each season in two parts, each with distinct stories connected by carried-over elements. Ahead of the fourth season, Tancharoen explained, [...] "For the past two seasons, we've been able to break our season down into two little mini-seasons because of the airdate schedule. This upcoming season, our airdate schedule is a little different, so we're breaking it into three pods. Story wise, the development <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> made our lives easier, to break it down in that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Rohrer was {{inspired}} by German-style board games to build a turn-based strategy game. He wanted to harness the unique qualities that a video game could bring to a board game, and so focused {{on their ability to}} deliver different views of the board to each player. He wanted to create a game which explored [...] "knowledge chains", where the player must not only be aware of his knowledge and movements on the board, but also how much <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been exposed to the opponent. In March 2009, he was invited by publisher Majesco Entertainment to pitch an idea for a Nintendo DS game, and keeping these mechanics in mind, he pitched a game called Deception. In Deception, two players would play one half of a married couple, with the aim to gather as much damaging evidence regarding their spouse's infidelities as ammunition for a forthcoming divorce case. Majesco rejected this concept as being [...] "too sensitive a subject for the DS market".|$|E

[...] To Pitchfork Media Cox said that, with each song, [...] "The genesis is usually a beat." [...] Cox considers the music of Let the Blind Lead to have a [...] "dynamic arc": {{the first half of the}} record contains [...] "more accessible songs. I was very depressed in the middle, and it created this kind of black hole of misery. Then I tried to bring it up again at the end." [...] Cox intended for his music to be [...] "therapeutic", for both himself and his audience. [...] In addition, he wanted the album to have a healing element, and be something [...] "somebody could listen to all the way through and feel like they went through a bad period of time and came out of it." [...] Pauline Oliveros, a composer who runs an organization that studies music therapy, was described by Cox as having [...] "a big influence" [...] on him and his ideas of therapeutic music. [...] He considers music [...] "the only art form I know <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> such an immediate effect on the human psyche", and found the time he first met and talked with Oliveros as being [...] "like meeting a hero of mine." ...|$|E
