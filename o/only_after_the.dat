Abovian's influence on Western Armenian literature was not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.|$|E

5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. <b>Only</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. <b>Only</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> popularity of the film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E

5|$|Currently Silverthrone is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano's magma system is.

Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or <b>only</b> <b>after,</b> <b>the</b> discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E
5|$|It {{was officially}} {{activated}} as an airborne division in April 1943 {{but was not}} immediately sent to a combat theater, remaining in the United States to complete its training. During this training process, the division took part in several training exercises, including the Knollwood Maneuver, in which it played a vital part in ensuring that the airborne division remained as a military formation in the U.S. Army.

In 992 al-Aziz invited Mufarrij to participate in the campaign against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin, but it is unclear whether Mufarrij fought in this or the subsequent campaigns, as he is not mentioned again until 996.|$|E
