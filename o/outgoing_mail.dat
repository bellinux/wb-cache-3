50|$|Born in 1841, Cotterell {{came from}} modest means {{and had little}} education. At the age ten, he began work at a {{succession}} of jobs, before becoming a cabin boy, crossing the Atlantic several times. In January 1863, he was a cabin steward on a ship that was owned by a Liverpool merchant firm which was leaving for Oil Rivers. At Oil Rivers, he persuaded the local agent of the Liverpool firm to retain him at Bonny. After spending three years at Bonny, Cotterrell was earning income with a share of profits, he also had some success singing at parties. He became an independent trader with trade activities largely centered in the towns of Bonny, Calabar and Old Calabar. In the Oil Rivers, he was head of a committee that settled trade disputes and also processed incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>mails.</b>|$|R

25|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the Post Office had begun to {{encourage}} homeowners to attach wall-mounted mailboxes {{to the outside of}} their houses in lieu of mail slots. Mounted at the height of a standing man, attached mailboxes did not require the mail carrier to lean over to deposit the mail. They also allowed the homeowner to keep <b>outgoing</b> <b>mail</b> dry while awaiting pickup by the mail carrier.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of pillar boxes, in the UK, it was customary to take <b>outgoing</b> <b>mail</b> to the nearest letter-receiving house or post office. Such houses were usually coaching inns or turnpike houses where the Royal Mail coach would stop {{to pick up and}} set down mails and passengers. People took their letters, in person, to the receiver, or postmaster, purchased a stamp (after 1840) and handed over the letter.|$|E

40|$|In Thornburgh v. Abbott, the Supreme Court {{upheld the}} {{constitutionality}} of regulations that allowed prison officials to reject certain publications sent by publishers to prisoners. Finding the regulations reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, the Court {{for the first time}} applied a reasonableness standard to restrictions that directly affected the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners. Part I of this Note briefly reviews the instrumental Supreme Court decisions addressing First Amendment rights in the prison context. This Part traces the development of the standard of review for prison regulations that restrict First Amendment freedoms for both prisoners and nonprisoners. It concludes with a general discussion of Thornburgh v. Abbott. Part II critiques the Abbott decision and analyzes the problems inherent in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning. Further, this Part discusses subsequent decisions of the lower courts that have applied Abbott to a variety of prison mail regulations and examines the split between the circuits regarding which standard of review should apply to restrictions on <b>outgoing</b> prisoner <b>mail.</b> This Note concludes with a call for courts to more carefully scrutinize prison regulations which affect the First Amendment rights of free citizens and, specifically, to adhere to the intermediate scrutiny standard of review for restrictions on <b>outgoing</b> prisoner <b>mail...</b>|$|R
25|$|Rural {{and some}} {{suburban}} areas of North America may utilize curbside mailboxes, {{also known as}} rural mailboxes. These receptacles generally consist of a large metal box mounted on a support designed primarily to receive large quantities of incoming mail, often with an attached flag to signal the presence of <b>outgoing</b> <b>mail</b> to the mail carrier. In the US and Canada, rural curbside mailboxes may be found grouped together at property boundaries or road/driveway intersections, depending upon conditions. Although the United States Postal Service (USPS) has general regulations stating the distance a letter box may be from the road surface, these requirements may be changed by the local postmaster according to local environment and road conditions.|$|E
25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was <b>outgoing</b> <b>mail</b> inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|E

50|$|In 1919 {{he went to}} University College, Galway {{to study}} medicine, but soon gave this up {{to work in the}} sorting office of the GPO. Mick Newell, the captain of the Volunteers, {{suggested}} to him that he should remain inconspicuous as he could be potentially very useful because of his job. Peter Hynes instructed him on ciphers, on making them up and breaking them down. Togher worked undercover as far as possible. “I dealt personally with all the incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>mails</b> for both the military and RIC at Renmore and Eglinton Barracks. It meant quite a lot of night work for me in order to ensure no delay. To enter the office at night, which I could not do officially, I was obliged to climb in through a second floor window, extract any mail I was doubtful about, bring them back home, break up the cipher, and pass the information to the Brigade Commandant, Seamus Murphy.” His biggest problem was getting those mails back unnoticed. He also supplied information to units of the IRA in south Mayo and to Michael Collins in GHQ in Dublin, the latter usually via men who worked on the mail van on the Galway/Dublin train. As almost every second person on the street in the area where he worked was either a policeman or a soldier, it was remarkable {{that he was able to}} achieve all this.|$|R

2500|$|Originally {{designed}} {{only for}} incoming mail delivery, curbside mailboxes were soon {{fitted with a}} [...] or signal flag mounted on an attached arm to signal the postman to pickup <b>outgoing</b> <b>mail.</b> Originally, this flag was raised {{not only by the}} resident of the property to signal the postman of <b>outgoing</b> <b>mail,</b> but also by the postman to inform the recipient that incoming mail had been delivered - a convenience to all during periods of freezing or inclement weather.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, {{wall-mounted}} or curbside mailboxes {{that are}} only designed for receiving incoming mail are known as [...] "limited-service" [...] mailboxes, while mailboxes equipped with a mechanism for notifying the postman to collect <b>outgoing</b> <b>mail</b> from the mailbox are known as [...] "full service" [...] mailboxes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Document {{management}} systems are generally assumed {{to hold a}} potential for delegating the recording and retrieval of documents to professionals such as civil servants and for supporting the coordination and control of work, so-called workflow management. This study investigates the use and organizational impact of document {{management systems}} in the Danish central government. The currently used systems unfold around the recording of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> paper <b>mail</b> and have typically not been accompanied by organizational changes. Rather, document management tends to remain an appendix to the primary work and be delegated to a specialized organizational unit. Several factors contribute to the present document management practices, for example it takes an extraordinary effort to achieve the benefits, and few institutions are forced to pursue them. Furthermo re, document and workflow management is applied most extensively in an institution with certain mass production characteristics, and the systems do not address needs specific to the civil servants. 1...|$|R

50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the first air-mail route in 1918, and the later additional routes, plus the accepted use of premium priced air mail by the public, it was only natural that the Railway Mail Service (RMS), being in charge of transit mail, was assigned the task of establishing Air Mail Field (AMF) postal facilities at the major airports. Only <b>outgoing</b> air <b>mail</b> was distributed at these workrooms, channeled there by both the post offices and Railway Post Office (RPO) routes. This mail was distributed and dispatched to other AMFs via the different flight connections. Incoming mail from other AMFs was distributed by general scheme and pouched to outgoing RPOs and necessary post offices. The Motor Vehicle Service provided frequent trips between the city post office and the AMF for air mail ground transportation. In 1951, there were 1200 clerks manning forty AMFs. They continue to exist within the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and are now called Air Mail Centers (AMCs).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{the costs and}} benefits of using first-class postage compared to non-profit, pre-canceled postage in inducing response to a self-administered mail questionnaire. An experiment was conducted with the outgoing postage for the 1998 Nebraska Rural Poll. Twenty-five percent of the <b>outgoing</b> questionnaires were <b>mailed</b> with first-class postage, with the remaining seventy-five percent having non-profit, pre-canceled postage affixed. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in response rates between the two groups, there were no differences in demographic characteristics between the two postage groups, and the use of non-profit, pre-canceled postage resulted in substantial cost savings...|$|R
