25|$|The Vieille's beam has {{undergone}} several changes over its history. First lit on 15 September 1887, it had white, {{red and green}} sectors, with a 50cm mirror. At the same time, the twin lights of Pointe du Raz were extinguished. In 1898, the lighthouse was equipped with a 5-second <b>occulting</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a third}} {{lighthouse}} just upstream of the pier, on the Herd Groyne (constructed in 1861-67 {{to preserve}} Littlehaven Beach, formerly known as Herd Sands, which had begun to be washed away by the change of currents caused by the new piers). The Groyne shows an <b>occulting</b> <b>light</b> which marks a safe entrance course between the piers, showing white to a vessel approaching from seaward on the correct course, green to a vessel off-course to the north, and red to one off-course to the south. Built by Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House in 1882, It consists of an upper hexagonal part, including the lantern, of wood and corrugated iron construction, sitting on twelve cylindrical steel legs. The whole structure is painted red and stands [...] in height. The Herd Groyne lighthouse was refurbished and repainted in 2014.|$|E

5000|$|Group {{notation}} {{similar to}} flashing and <b>occulting</b> <b>lights</b> is also sometimes used (e.g. Q.(9)).|$|R
50|$|Located on the harbour breakwaters of Büsum are {{two other}} lights. On the west mole is a 9 metre high red tower which {{displays}} an <b>occulting</b> red <b>light.</b> The east mole has a similar tower, painted green that displays an <b>occulting</b> green <b>light.</b>|$|R

5000|$|We know, also, that {{multiple}} lights were {{a feature of}} many locations before <b>occulting</b> <b>lights</b> arrived to give a station clear identity at night. The Cornwall Tourist Board website says: [...] "Trinity House built a two coal fired station (at the Lizard)... The signal continued as two fixed lights until 1903... in 1903 the two tower system was stopped and a single flashing light used." ...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>occulting</b> <b>light</b> is {{a rhythmic}} light {{in which the}} {{duration}} of light in each period is longer than the total duration of darkness. In other words, it is the opposite to a flashing light where the total duration of darkness is longer than the duration of light. It has the appearance of flashing off, rather than flashing on. Like a flashing light, {{it can be used}} for a single <b>occulting</b> <b>light</b> that exhibits only a single period of darkness or the periods of darkness can be grouped and repeated at regular intervals (abbreviated [...] "Oc"), a group (Oc (3)) or a composite group (Oc (2+1)).|$|E
50|$|The south {{lighthouse}} displays an <b>occulting</b> sector <b>light</b> with white, red {{and green}} sectors. The green sector is used to indicate safe waters near the coast {{to the north of}} Tynemouth, while red indicates an area with numerous wrecks to the east and south of the lighthouse.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{recognisable}} by its red {{and white}} vertical stripes and commonly bears a top-sign in shape of a red ball. Lighted buoys flash morse code [...] "A", <b>occulting</b> (more <b>light</b> than dark), Isophase (equal light and dark) or long flash every 10 seconds (L Fl 10s).|$|R

50|$|The {{tapering}} 6.7 m wooden {{tower is}} of the salt shaker design, painted white, with a red lantern and balcony, although pictures from 2008 show an all-white tower and lantern. It has a broad vertical red stripe to mark the range line, matching the stripe on the front range tower. Both {{the front and rear}} <b>lights</b> display an <b>occulting</b> yellow <b>light,</b> flashing every eleven seconds, and both have a range of 16 nautical miles. The light is automatic, but only operates seasonally between April and December.|$|R
5000|$|The 12 m tall {{lighthouse}} has an <b>occulting</b> <b>light</b> that flashes white, red, and green.

50|$|The North Mole Lighthouse began {{operation}} in 1906 at entrance to Fremantle Harbour. The <b>occulting</b> red <b>light,</b> emitted from a fixed lightsource at a focal plane height of 15 m above sea level, is visible for 11 mi and indicates the westernmost {{point of the}} harbour and its entrance. The lighthouse established permanent service from 1906; after the mole's foundations had settled a temporary lighting arrangement there was discharged. The light originally planned for the house {{was found to be}} too powerful and was sent to Broome for the steel lighthouse at Gantheume Point.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{features}} around Whidbey Island {{bear the}} Whidbey name, such as Joseph Whidbey State Park and Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. From the latter comes {{the name of}} the Whidbey Island class dock landing ship. In Britain, the Whidbey Automatic <b>Light</b> (<b>Occulting</b> Green) was constructed at the eastern end of Plymouth Sound in 1980.|$|R
500|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was fully}} automated in February 1994. The extant optics were kept, but complemented with a three position lampchanger. The foghorn {{was changed to}} an electric model, with a directional 500Hz emitter stack that was installed on the gallery of the lantern room. The active lighthouse has a [...] masonry tower with lantern and gallery. The tower is painted white, with a single wide red horizontal band in the middle. The lighthouse has a white <b>light</b> which <b>occults</b> every ten seconds. There is a continuous red light {{as well as an}} <b>occulting</b> red <b>light</b> which is on for 5.8 seconds and off for 4.2 seconds. In addition, a foghorn emits a blast every twenty seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Åsvær Lighthouse (Åsvær fyr) is {{an active}} coastal {{lighthouse}} located {{on the island of}} Åsvær in the municipality of Dønna in Nordland county, Norway.

The ruins of an outhouse lie nearby.|$|E
5000|$|In 1882 the 'high' {{light was}} changed to an [...] <b>occulting</b> <b>light</b> [...] and the 'low' light put out of use. In 1912 the light was again updated and work began on {{installing}} a 36 feet long [...] fog horn which came into service in 1913 and was itself replaced by a new horn in 1963. The lighthouse was automated and became unmanned in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|The island hosts one of {{the three}} lighthouses used to guide {{navigation}} on Oneida Lake. The lighthouses were built in 1917 as part of the New York State Barge Canal, which uses Oneida Lake as part of its water route from the Hudson River to Lake Erie. The Frenchman Island Lighthouse is no longer in operation today (vandalized and open) and is managed by the New York State Canal Corporation. [...] While the lighthouse was completed in August 1917, {{it may not have been}} first lit until 1918. The tower's 1,500 candlepower <b>occulting</b> white <b>light</b> was powered by commercial electricity until ___?, although it was gas-powered for several years after its initial completion.|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} results concerning the fine scale structure {{analysis of the}} streamers on the east limb and the region between these streamers, {{as well as their}} morphological and physical characteristics are presented. The results were obtained using white light polarized brightness data. The solar corona was observed with an externally <b>occulted</b> white <b>light</b> coronagraph carried on the SPARTAN 201 - 01 spacecraft for a 47 h period beginning on DOY 101, 1993. At this phase of the solar magnetic activity cycle there were well developed coronal helmet streamers located over both the east and west limbs of the sun. The photometric properties of one streamer found near the south east limb of the sun are similar to those measured of helmet streamers {{at the time of the}} 1973 total eclipse by both the ground based white light coronal camera and the Skylab externally occulted coronagraph...|$|R
5000|$|The Marstein Lighthouse {{currently}} {{consists of}} a 17 m tall square, white, masonry tower with a red roof, and a single-storey service building attached. The light sits at an elevation of 37.5 m above sea level. It emits a white and red isophase light with a period of 4 seconds. The light has an intensity of 850,000 candela {{and it can be}} seen for about [...] A secondary light is located at an elevation of 29 m above sea level and that emits a red <b>light,</b> <b>occulting</b> in groups of two.|$|R
