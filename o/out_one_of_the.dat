5|$|Byzantine troops {{occupied}} {{large portions}} of Bulgaria, including modern Dobruja, under Emperor John I Tzimiskes (969976). After his death an anti-Byzantine uprising led by four brothers broke <b>out.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brothers, David, was killed by Vlachs in the present-day border region between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia. In 1018, the Byzantines conquered the whole territory of the Bulgarian Empire and the Archbishop of Ohrid acquired ecclesiastic jurisdiction in 1020 over the Vlachs living there.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four days, the Allied troops were pushed {{south-east}} towards the city of Singapore. Throughout this time, the battalion's companies were in almost constant action, either—in the case of 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E' Companies—under separate command, or 'A' and 'HQ' Companies with Battalion Headquarters. The reinforcements of 'E' Company, detached to the Special Reserve Battalion, suffered heavily. In three days, they lost 43 men killed or missing, before the ad hoc formation was disbanded and the men returned to the 2/4th. 7 Platoon, 'B' Company, took on a mounted role, procuring four Bren carriers, with which they began patrolling in support. On 12 February they were engaged along the Buona Vista Road, while supporting the Malayan Regiment. The following day, they were attacked by a Japanese light tank, which knocked <b>out</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriers before the platoon extricated themselves.|$|E
5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed <b>out</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut <b>out.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out {{the top of her head}} in the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|The Griffins, the Swansons, and Quagmire {{prepare for}} a road trip, ostensibly for a {{vacation}} in Maine. Quagmire distracts Bonnie and Lois as Peter alters course to Virginia instead. The group arrives at a bar in Stoolbend, Virginia, and discover that it was Cleveland who told the bartender the joke. Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo told it to him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots <b>out</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car's tires, causing it to spin out of control and flip onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive at a Washington hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of the joke. He races away on a handcart through Washington. Losing track of Sal, they are soon captured by several men in black suits who pistol-whip them until they are unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming <b>out.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

25|$|The Peleliu landing {{took place}} on September 15, 1944 and the 5th Marines were the left flank {{regiment}} on the division front. In the first hour of action, the assault waves fought their way 100 yards inland {{to the top of}} a small coral ridge, one of dozens on the island. Cpl Bausell, who, one month earlier had been examined and found qualified for promotion to the rank of sergeant, was in a squad assigned to clean <b>out</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many enemy-infested caves which honeycombed the ridge.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{remained}} the Head Gardener at Chatsworth until 1858, {{he was also}} able to undertake outside work such as the Crystal Palace and his directorship of the Midland Railway.

He arrived at City Hall by himself and was allowed to speak with Mayor Wood in his private office. Learning the purpose of his visit, Wood refused to accompany Walling, who then attempted {{to take him out}} of the building by force. Over 300 Municipal officers were stationed at City Hall, and Walling was stopped and thrown out into the street. He attempted several times to re-enter, arguing with Captain Abraham Ackerman, until the arrival of Captains Jacob Sebring and Coroner Perry, leading fifty Metropolitans, to serve the second warrant.|$|E
25|$|The {{defenders}} of Biazza Ridge managed to capture two 75-mm pack howitzers, which they turned into direct fire weapons {{to defend the}} ridge. One managed to knock <b>out</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacking Tiger tanks. By early evening, the situation had turned grim when six American M4 Sherman tanks suddenly appeared, eliciting cheers from the weary paratroopers, who had been joined by others, including some airborne engineers, infantry, clerks, cooks and truck drivers. With this scratch force and the Shermans, Gavin counterattacked {{and in so doing}} deterred the Germans from pressing their considerable advantage. The battle ended with the Americans still in control of Biazza Ridge. For his feats of valor that day, Colonel Gavin was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
25|$|Slonim's work diversified, and {{he became}} a {{literary}} impresario, founding, with George Reavey, the European Literary Bureau. It had contracts with Berdyaev, Samuel Beckett, André Malraux and Jacques Maritain. He also worked on translations and on editing books for print: in 1930, Čestmír Jeřábek's Svět hoří; and in 1934, Adèle Hommaire de Hell's Mémoires d'une aventurière. Together with Reavey, he put <b>out</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first collections of Russian prose rendered in English (1934), which is also noted for its inclusion of Socialist Realists Alexander Fadeyev and Feodor Gladkov. With Gide's help, Slonim and Reavey's anthology of Soviet literature came at Gallimard in 1935, and possibly included unsigned translations by Tsvetaeva. Slonim was by then also publishing regular literary chronicles, turning his attention to works by William Faulkner, Peter Neagoe, and D. H. Lawrence.|$|E

25|$|After {{the crowd}} (perhaps accidentally) toppled {{one of the}} Angels' motorcycles, the Angels became even more aggressive, {{including}} toward the performers. Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane jumped off the stage to try and sort out the problem, only to be punched {{in the head and}} knocked unconscious by an Angel during the band's set, as seen in the documentary film Gimme Shelter. When Jefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner sarcastically thanked the Angels for knocking the singer <b>out,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bikers took hold of a microphone and argued with him about it. The Grateful Dead had been scheduled to play between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and the Rolling Stones, but after hearing about the Balin incident from Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, they refused to play and left the venue, citing the quickly degenerating security situation.|$|E
25|$|This {{practice}} {{is believed to}} have been passed down through the centuries from the Apostles, with different practices developing in different places. As Christian monasticism spread, the practice of specified hours and liturgical formats began to develop and become standardized. Around the year 484, the Greek-Cappadocian monk Sabbas the Sanctified began the process of recording the liturgical practices around Jerusalem while the cathedral and parish rites in the Patriarchate of Constantinople evolved in an entirely different manner; the two were synthesized commencing in the eighth century to yield an office of great complexity. In 525, Benedict of Nursia set <b>out</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest schemes for the recitation of the Psalter at the Office. With the Cluniac Reforms of the 11th century, there was a new emphasis on liturgy and the canonical hours in the reformed priories of the Order of Saint Benedict, with Cluny Abbey at their head.|$|E
