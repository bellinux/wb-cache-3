25|$|CMLL {{held their}} tribute to Rayo de Jalisco and Salvador Lutteroth after the ring was cleared from the Luchas de Apuetas match. Rayo de Jalisco Sr. {{came to the}} ring wearing his {{trademark}} lightingbolt mask and was accompanied by his son as well as Atlantis and Máscara Dorada for the ceremony. The fans showed their appreciation of the lucha libre legend by giving him a standing ovation as he was presented with a plaque commemorating the event. Atlantis and Máscara Dorada escorted the almost 80-year-old Rayo de Jalisco to the back while Rayo Jr. remained in the right for the fourth match of the night. Rayo Jr.'s partner Rush {{was introduced to the}} crowd, but before they could bring out Shocker Universo 2000 came through the crowd and attacked Rayo de Jalisco Jr. from behind. Moments later Shocker, Mr. Niebla and El Terrible all rushed to the ring and the <b>opening</b> <b>portion</b> of the match was chaos with all six wrestlers in the ring at the same time. The brawl saw the wrestlers pair off with their natural rivals, Shocker and Mr. Niebla, Rush and El Terrible and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Universo 2000. The rudo team took advantage of the confusion and cheated their way into winning the first fall. During the second fall Universo 2000 made a mistake, giving Rayo de Jalisco Jr. the opportunity to tie the match up at one fall each. During the third and final fall the 53-year-old Rayo de Jalisco Jr. actually leap off the top rope onto Universo 2000 on the floor. The third fall ended without a decisive victory as Universo 2000 decided to land a foul, low kick on Rayo de Jalisco Jr. drawing a disqualification from the referee.|$|E

500|$|At 09:15 the {{following}} morning, Admiral Hipper was detached {{to reinforce the}} destroyers at Narvik, which had reported engaging British forces. Early on 9 April, the two ships encountered the British battlecruiser HMS Renown. Gneisenaus Seetakt radar picked up a radar contact at 04:30, which prompted the crews of both vessels to go to combat stations. Half an hour later, Scharnhorsts navigator spotted gun flashes from [...] firing at Gneisenau; the Germans returned fire three minutes later. Gneisenau was hit twice in the <b>opening</b> <b>portion</b> of the engagement, and one shell disabled her rear gun turret. Scharnhorsts radar malfunctioned, which prevented her {{from being able to}} effectively engage Renown during the battle. At 05:18, the British battlecruiser shifted fire to Scharnhorst, which maneuvered to avoid the falling shells. By 07:15, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had used their superior speed to escape from the pursuing Renown. Heavy seas and the high speed with which the pair of battleships escaped caused them to ship large amounts of water forward. Scharnhorsts forward turret was put out of action by severe flooding. Mechanical problems with her starboard turbines developed after running at full speed, which forced the ships to reduce speed to [...]|$|E

6000|$|The 'Allegoric Vision' {{dates from}} August, 1795. It {{served as a}} kind of preface or prologue to Coleridge's first Theological Lecture on 'The Origin of Evil. The Necessity of Revelation deduced from the Nature of Man. An Examination and Defence of the Mosaic Dispensation' (see Cottle's Early Recollections, 1837, i. 27). The purport of these Lectures was to uphold the golden mean of Unitarian orthodoxy as opposed to the Church on the one hand, and {{infidelity}} or materialism on the other. 'Superstition' stood for and symbolized the Church of England. Sixteen years later this <b>opening</b> <b>portion</b> of an unpublished Lecture was rewritten and printed in The Courier (Aug. 31, 1811), with the heading 'An Allegoric Vision: Superstition, Religion, Atheism'. The attack was now diverted from the Church of England to the Church of Rome. 'Men clad in black robes,' intent on gathering in their Tenths, become 'men clothed in ceremonial robes, who with menacing countenances drag some reluctant victim to a vast idol, framed of iron bars intercrossed which formed at the same time an immense cage, and yet represented the form of a human Colossus. At the base of the Statue I saw engraved the words [...] "To Dominic holy and merciful, the preventer and avenger of soul-murder".' The vision was turned into a political jeu d'esprit levelled at the aiders and abettors of Catholic Emancipation, a measure to which Coleridge was more or less opposed as long as he lived. See Constitution of Church and State, 1830, passim. A third adaptation of the 'Allegorical Vision' was affixed to the Introduction to A Lay Sermon: Addressed to the Higher and Middle Classes, which was published in 1817. The first fifty-six lines, which contain a description of Italian mountain scenery, were entirely new, {{but the rest of the}} 'Vision' is an amended and softened reproduction of the preface to the Lecture of 1795. The moral he desires to point is the 'falsehood of extremes'. As Religion is the golden mean between Superstition and Atheism, so the righteous government of a righteous people is the mean between a selfish and oppressive aristocracy, and seditious and unbridled mob-rule. A probable 'Source' of the first draft of the 'Vision' is John Aikin's Hill of Science, A Vision, which was included in Elegant Extracts, 1794, ii. 801. In the present issue the text of 1834 has been collated with that of 1817 and 1829, but not (exhaustively) with the MS. (1795), or at all with the Courier version of 1811.|$|E

6000|$|Pope was a {{contributor}} to the Guardian, and on cordial terms with the editor, but he could not ask to have a paper inserted in which he had drawn a comparison between his own Pastorals and those of his rival, and awarded himself the palm. He therefore sent the criticism anonymously, and Steele, as we are told by Warburton, not discovering that the praise of Philips and the censure of Pope were both ironical, showed the manuscript to the latter, and assured him that he would [...] "never publish any paper where one of the club was complimented at the expense of another." [...] His ingenuous ally affected magnanimity, and prevailed upon Steele to print the essay. The irony which could not be detected by the wits at Button's might well escape less cultivated minds. Ayre, in his Memoirs of Pope, in 1745, and Dilworth, in 1760, both believed that the criticism was to be interpreted literally, that Steele was the author of it, and that it was dictated by friendship for Philips. Small as was the ability of these biographers, they may be supposed to have shared the common opinion. This continued to be the accepted doctrine in the next generation; and the celebrated circle in which Hannah More lived were unanimous in holding that the essay was not satirical. [...] "The whole criticism," [...] she wrote August 4, 1783, [...] "appears to me a burlesque, but I have some reason to think I am in the wrong, as I have all the world against me. That a writer of so pure a taste could be in earnest when he talks of the elegance of Diggon Davy, and exalts all that trash of Philips's, whose simplicity is silliness, I cannot bring myself to believe." [...] She found it still more difficult to believe that the author could be serious in asserting that Hobbinol and Lobbin are names agreeable to the delicacy of an English ear.[25] Hannah More judged of Philips by the wretched extracts in the Guardian. Her accomplished friends could hardly have admired them; and it must have been for a different reason {{that the purpose of the}} essay was misunderstood. Warton says that the misapprehension arose from [...] "the skill with which the irony was conducted." [...] It would be more natural to infer that the execution was defective when the vast majority of literary men mistook the design. The satire, in fact, is imperfectly sustained, and passages, which the author intended for irony, appeared to the reader to be plain common sense. [...] "Mr. Pope," [...] he says of himself, [...] "hath fallen into the same error with Virgil. His names are borrowed from Theocritus and Virgil, which are improper to the scenes of his Pastorals. He introduces Daphnis, Alexis, and Thyrsis on British plains, as Virgil had done before him on the Mantuan." [...] Habit had reconciled Pope to the affectation of calling English shepherds Daphnis and Thyrsis, but [...] "the names," [...] as De Quincey says, [...] "are rank with childishness," [...] and the public, who felt the practice to be absurd, concluded that the censure was real. [...] "It may," [...] said Pope, [...] "be observed, as a farther beauty of this pastoral, that the words nymph, dryad, naiad, faun, Cupid, or satyr, are not once mentioned through the whole," [...] which was a sneer at Addison's commendation of Philips for rejecting those dreary nonentities; but the public, who had been nauseated with them, could not detect a covert sarcasm in the repetition of the praise by the writer in the Guardian. The circumstance which seemed to Warton to render the irony transparent was the remark, that [...] "Philips had with great judgment described wolves in England," [...] but the ridicule was based upon ignorance, and must have been lost upon every one who was aware that wolves abounded in the antique period to which the pastorals referred. Bowles, who knew that the paper was ironical, yet imagined that Pope was serious in the <b>opening</b> <b>portion,</b> where it is asserted that Virgil has not above a couple of [...] "true pastorals," [...] and that Theocritus has scarcely more. This part, however, of the essay was in the same sarcastic vein with the rest. The previous critic in the Guardian had laid down the rule that a pastoral should reflect [...] "the golden age of innocence," [...] and Pope, to deprive Philips of the benefit of the definition, endeavoured to show that Theocritus and Virgil had hardly ever conformed to it. He did not mean seriously to admit that his competitor was a more genuine pastoral poet than Virgil and Theocritus. His object was to throw ridicule on the definition itself, albeit he adopted it in his Discourse on Pastoral Poetry when he was no longer engaged in disparaging Philips.|$|E
