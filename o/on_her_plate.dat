The task of this research was {{to examine the effects of}} alcohol depuration and development of new methods of calculation based on the model of theoretical plates. The paper examines the work depuration column at different modes. Were composed material balance equation and it is calculated concentration distribution of ethanol on the plates of the column. Further we obtained equations for estimating the effects of ethanol purification from the accompanying impurities. The carries out calculations have shown that when depuration column working with water selection method observed the significant decrease in the concentration of ethanol <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>plates.</b> As a result, increases the coefficient evaporation of impurities, which considerably improved it concentration. But it fortress of epurate reduced, which may degrade the performance of the distillation column and result in a loss with the bottoms liquid. It was therefore reviewed variant with the installation of the stripping part on depuration column, thereby increasing the concentration of ethanol in epurate and reduced the content in it of organic acids and other tail impurities that are discharged with liquid from her cube. Having recorded material balance equation for the stripping part, it was determined that are no losses of alcohol with cube liquid are. With some assumptions, from the equations of material balance are obtained the equations allowing estimating proportion of tail impurities withdrawn with cube liquid. The calculations have shown that more than half of the tail impurities incoming to the depuration column removed from her cube...|$|R

6000|$|The {{easiest way}} {{of finding a}} mine-field is to steam into it, {{on the edge of}} night for choice, with a steep sea running, for that brings the bows down like a chopper on the detonator-horns. Some boats have enjoyed this {{experience}} and still live. There was one destroyer (and there may have been others since) who came through twenty-four hours of highly-compressed life. She had an idea that there was a mine-field somewhere about, and left her companions behind while she explored. The weather was dead calm, and she walked delicately. She saw one Scandinavian steamer blow up a couple of miles away, rescued the skipper and some hands; saw another neutral, which she could not reach till all was over, skied in another direction; and, between her life-saving efforts and her natural curiosity, got herself as thoroughly mixed up with the field as a camel among tent-ropes. A destroyer's bows are very fine, and her sides are very straight. This causes her to cleave the wave with the minimum of disturbance, and this boat had no desire to cleave anything else. None the less, from time to time, she heard a mine grate, or tinkle, or jar (I could not arrive at the precise note it strikes, but they say it is unpleasant) <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>plates.</b> Sometimes she would be free of them for a long while, and began to hope she was clear. At other times they were numerous, but when at last she seemed to have worried out of the danger zone lieutenant and sub together left the bridge for a cup of tea. ("In those days we took mines very seriously, you know.") As they were in act to drink, they heard the hateful sound again just outside the wardroom. Both put their cups down with extreme care, little fingers extended ("We felt as if they might blow up, too"), and tip-toed on deck, where they met the foc'sle also on tip-toe. They pulled themselves together, and asked severely what the foc'sle thought it was doing. [...] "Beg pardon, sir, but there's another of those blighters tap-tapping alongside, our end." [...] They all waited and listened to their common coffin being nailed by Death himself. But the things bumped away. At this point they thought it only decent to invite the rescued skipper, warm and blanketed in one of their bunks, to step up and do any further perishing in the open.|$|R
