5|$|During Bush's second term, a {{controversy}} arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House {{maintained that the}} U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b> The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{sought to}} run a more {{efficient}} and accountable government than his predecessors. His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later. The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland, who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand {{the role of the}} U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b> There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court—Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin, who had declined. Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin, and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal, nominated instead John Archibald Campbell, an advocate of states' rights; this would be Pierce's only Supreme Court appointment.|$|E

25|$|The Justice Department {{seems to}} have been aware of Peterson's duplicity, but {{nevertheless}} kept him on the payroll. Peterson came to believe—or was led to believe—that Louis Fraina was also on the payroll <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b> This information was conveyed to Nuorteva, a factional opponent of Fraina and the CPA, who levied these suspicions publicly {{in the pages of the}} Socialist Party daily, the New York Call.|$|E
25|$|Under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, the Civil Rights Section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> tried, but failed, {{to prosecute}} lynchers under Reconstruction-er{{a civil rights}} laws. The first {{successful}} federal prosecution of a lyncher for a civil rights violation was in 1946. By that time, the era of lynchings as a common occurrence had ended. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. succeeded in gaining House passage of an anti-lynching bill, but it was defeated in the Senate, still dominated by the Southern Democratic bloc, supported by its disfranchisement of blacks.|$|E

25|$|Greel {{was arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of sabotaging the robots and attempting to kill the Chief Judge. However, after 72 hours of intensive interrogation no evidence was found to prove the charge, and he was released (but demoted). McGruder aborted the Mechanismo Programme and, on returning to Mega-City One, resigned from office. Her final, controversial act as chief judge was to order that her successor was to be elected by the 400 senior judges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b> Judge Volt decisively defeated Dredd, Hershey and Herriman in the election, and reinstated the Council of Five.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political repercussions. Relying heavily upon anonymous sources, Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed Judy Hoback Miller, the bookkeeper for Nixon, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.|$|E

Wainstein proposed that internal audits by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> with reporting to select groups of Congressmen, would ensure that the expanded capability would not be abused.|$|E

25|$|In January 2002, the {{partially}} nude female {{statue of the}} Spirit of Justice, which stands in the Great Hall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> where Ashcroft held press conferences, was covered with blue curtains, along with its male counterpart, the Majesty of Justice. Some speculated that Ashcroft thought that reporters were photographing him with the female statue in the background {{to make fun of}} his church's opposition to pornography. A Justice Department spokeswoman said that Ashcroft knew nothing of the decision to spend $8,000 for the curtains; a spokesman said the decision for permanent curtains was intended to save on the $2,000 per use rental costs of temporary curtains used for formal events.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, Abramoff began {{secretly}} granting exclusive {{interviews to}} former Boston Globe investigative reporter Gary S. Chafetz, without {{the knowledge of}} Abramoff's attorneys or the federal prosecutors with whom Abramoff had been cooperating. These interviews – conducted before and during Abramoff's imprisonment – continued until May 2008. In September 2008, Chafetz's book, The Perfect Villain: John McCain and the Demonization of Lobbyist Jack Abramoff was rushed into print prior to the 2008 presidential election. In his book, Chafetz asserted that Abramoff, though guilty {{of some of the}} charges, was the victim of misleading and sensational reporting by the Washington Post, vengeance and mendacity on the part of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), and strong-arm tactics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> who forced Abramoff into confessing to crimes he did not believe he was guilty of. Chafetz also accused federal prosecutors of abusive – and possibly illegal – tactics in their reliance on private and public honest services fraud, which he characterized as vague and controversial.|$|E

500|$|The {{convictions}} in the 1949 trial {{encouraged the}} Department of Justice {{to prepare for}} additional prosecutions of CPUSA leaders. Three months after the trial, in January1950, a representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> testified before Congress during appropriation hearings to justify an increase in funding to support Smith Act prosecutions. See also Fast, Howard, [...] "The Big Finger", Masses & Mainstream, March, 1950, pp 62–68. He testified that there were 21,105 potential persons that could be indicted under the Smith Act, and that 12,000 of those would be indicted if the Smith Act was upheld as constitutional. The FBI had {{compiled a list of}} 200,000 persons in its Communist Index; since the CPUSA had only around 32,000 members in 1950, the FBI explained the disparity by asserting that for every official Party member, there were ten persons who were loyal to the CPUSA and ready to carry out its orders. Navasky, p 26 (32,000 figure). Seven months after the convictions, in May1950, Hoover gave a radio address in which he declared [...] "communists have been and are today at work within the very gates of America.... Wherever they may be, they have in common one diabolic ambition: to weaken and to eventually destroy American democracy by stealth and cunning." [...] Sabin, p 56.|$|E
