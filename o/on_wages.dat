Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy <b>on</b> <b>wages</b> to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and applies a {{new approach}} to the estimation of the impact of economy-wide reforms <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> differentials, using a new high-quality data set <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> differentials by schooling level for 18 Latin American countries for the period 1980 - 1998. The results indicate that reform overall has had a short-run disequalizing effect of expanding wage differentials, although this effect tends to fade over time. This disequalizing effect is due to the strong impact of domestic financial market reform, capital account liberalization and tax reform. On the other hand, privatization contributed to narrowing wage differentials, and trade openness had no effect <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> differentials. Technological progress, rather than trade flows, appears to be a channel through which reforms are affecting inequality. The paper also explores the effects of reforms <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> levels; tentative results suggest that reforms have had a positive effect <b>on</b> real average <b>wages,</b> but a negative effect <b>on</b> the <b>wages</b> of less-schooled workers.

40|$|Empirical {{studies have}} shown that {{voluntary}} job-to-job changes have a positive effect <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> mobility. In this paper, we suggest that the impact of a job change <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> growth depends <b>on</b> the position in the wage distribution. Using panel data from the UK and Germany, we investigate the effect of employer changes and withinfirm job changes <b>on</b> year-to-year <b>wage</b> mobility. We show that a change of employer results into a wage increase for the low-paid workers but not for the high-paid workers. Within-firm job changes produce, <b>on</b> average, moderate <b>wage</b> gains for the low-paid workers in the UK, but have no effect in Germany. Results <b>on</b> 3 -year <b>wage</b> mobility are shown to be very similar to the results <b>on</b> year-to-year <b>wage</b> growth. ...|$|R

Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract—the 1949 championship game. Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich, who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC. Bell and the owners were advised by John C.

5|$|After his release, Friday {{returned}} to Acton, {{where he had}} a girlfriend called Maxine Doughan and a baby daughter called Nicola. Maxine was of mixed race. The local controversy surrounding the interracial relationship caused the couple and their circle of friends to be socially isolated, {{and led to a}} physical attack on the group one night in an Acton public house. Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents—Alf refused to even attend the wedding—they married, both aged 17. Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics. A friend who played for Walthamstow Avenue, a semi-professional Isthmian League club from north-east London, took Friday along to training one day in early 1971. Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day <b>on</b> <b>wages</b> of £10 per week. Many of his new teammates were asphalters from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{started the}} 1964–65 season <b>on</b> <b>wages</b> of £40 a week, {{and the club}} only agreed to pay £60 a week in December. These miserly wages made it {{difficult}} for the club to spend the £80,000 it received from the sale of Frank McLintock – he had put in a transfer request over dissatisfaction with his pay and quality replacements were reluctant to join a club that paid full internationals like Banks and McLintock no more than the base rate that rival clubs paid to average players. Leicester finished 18th in the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Liverpool at Anfield in the sixth round. In the League Cup, City struggled to get past Peterborough United (in a replay), Grimsby Town and Crystal Palace (in a replay), before they recorded an 8–1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road. After easing past Plymouth Argyle in the semi-finals, Banks found himself playing in another League Cup final. However Chelsea won the final after successfully defending their 3–2 win at Stamford Bridge with a goalless draw at Filbert Street.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} end of the first {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure <b>on</b> <b>wages</b> and prices, with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages and prices rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production, trading and retailing. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation – as much as 70% by the 1370s. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims. With the wages of the lower classes still rising, the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363. These laws banned the lower classes from consuming certain products or wearing high-status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high-quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.|$|E
30|$|I {{estimate}} the upper bound i̇β ^IV^∗ {{of the effect}} of informality <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> inequality for the main results reported for models 1 and 2 in Table 2. I find that β ^IV^∗= 0.893 i̇ when the dependent variable is the Gini index, so that for model 1 B= [0.773, 0.893], and that β ^IV^∗= 0.798 i̇ when the dependent variable is the variance of log wages, thus in model 2 B= [0.738, 0.798]. Therefore, when the exogeneity assumption is relaxed, the IV effect of informality <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> inequality is bounded tightly, {{and the size of the}} upper bounds confirms a strong positive effect of informality <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> inequality.|$|R

5|$|Rutherford's {{government}} {{appointed a}} commission in February, {{but it was}} not until May that it met. It consisted of Chief Justice Arthur Sifton, mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom. It began taking evidence in July. In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay; coal supply promptly increased, as did its price. In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent <b>on</b> <b>wages</b> (other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} performance-related pay <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> differentials within firms. Our theoretical framework predicts that, compared to a fixed pay system, pay schemes based on individual effort increase within-firm wage inequality, while group-based bonuses have minor effects <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> dispersion. Theory also predicts an interaction between performance-related pay and union bargaining, where union power reduces the impact of performance pay <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> dispersion. The empirical contribution utilizes two recent Norwegian employer surveys, linked to {{a full set of}} employee records. A longitudinal sub-sample allows for identification based on fixed establishment effects. Introduction of performance-related pay is shown to raise residual wage inequality in nonunion firms, but not in firms with high union density. Our findings suggest that even though performance-related pay appears to be on the rise, the overall impact <b>on</b> <b>wage</b> dispersion is likely to be small, particularly in European countries with strong unions.
