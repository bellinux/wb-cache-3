Effects of the exchange and correlation interactions are also briefly discussed for undoped graphene at zero temperature. Nonlinear results are compared with both the linearized TF model and the dielectric screening model within random phase approximation (RPA). In addition, image potential of the <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> is evaluated from the solution of the nonlinear integral equation and compared to the results of linear models. We have found generally good agreement between the results of the nonlinear TF model and the RPA model in doped graphene, apart from Friedel oscillations in the latter model.

40|$|Molecular orbital {{calculations}} {{are carried}} out {{on a number of}} carotenoids in the presence of an <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> and a constant electric field. The <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> is used to represent the strong permanent field that is believed to polarize carotenoids in photosynthetic membranes and thus to account for their linear response to the transmembrane potential. Our calculations show that the in vitro leads to in vivo spectral shifts of carotenoids (approximately 25 nm) can be produced by a charge in close proximity to the molecule. The interaction of the induced dipole moment with a constant field accounts for the observed magnitude of the electrochromic response in photosynthetic bacteria. The existence of a second pool of carotenoids that shows a significant (approximately 20 nm) wavelength shift but no electrochromic response can be explained by an <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> positioned {{near the center of the}} molecule that affects its absorption maximum while inducing essentially no dipole moment. The spectral shift for this pool is due to the induction of higher multipoles. These also account for discrepancies that arise when one attempts to account quantitatively for available experimental results on carotenoid band shifts in terms of classical electrochromic theory...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{non-linear}} Thomas-Fermi theory which describes the electric charge screening {{in the system}} including two charged substrate layers separated by a few-layered graphene film.

The transition from weak to strong screening is shown to turn on relatively quickly, and it happens when the applied external charge/external field reaches a certain crossover magnitude. The possibilities for experimental observation of the predicted crossover are discussed. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{establish}} a density-functional reformulation of coupled matter-photon problems subject to general external electromagnetic fields and charge currents. We first show that for static minimally-coupled matter-photon systems an external electromagnetic field {{is equivalent to}} an <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> current. We employ this to show that scalar external potentials and transversal <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> currents are in a one-to-one correspondence to the expectation values of the charge density and the vector-potential of the correlated matter-photon ground state. This allows to establish a Maxwell-Kohn-Sham approach, where {{in conjunction with the}} usual single-particle Kohn-Sham equations a classical Maxwell equation has to be solved. In the magnetic mean-field limit this reduces to a current-density-functional theory that does not suffer from non-uniqueness problems and if furthermore the magnetic field is zero recovers standard density-functional theory...|$|R
50|$|The {{requirements}} for a BMS in mobile applications (such as electric vehicles) and stationary applications (like stand-by UPSs in a server room) are quite different, {{especially from the}} space and weight constraint requirements, so the hardware and software implementations must be tailored to the specific use. In the case of electric or hybrid vehicles, the BMS is only a subsystem and cannot work as a standalone device. It must communicate {{with at least a}} charger (or charging infrastructure), a load, thermal management and emergency shutdown subsystems. Therefore, in a good vehicle design the BMS is tightly integrated with those subsystems. Some small mobile applications (such as medical equipment carts, motorized wheelchairs, scooters, and fork lifts) often have <b>external</b> <b>charging</b> hardware, however the on-board BMS must still have tight design integration with the <b>external</b> <b>charger.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{remaining}} {{question is}} how large the induced charges are. The movement of charges {{is caused by the}} force exerted on them by the electric field of the <b>external</b> <b>charged</b> object, by Coulomb's law. As the charges in the metal object continue to separate, the resulting positive and negative regions create their own electric field, which opposes the field of the <b>external</b> <b>charge.</b> [...] This process continues until very quickly (within a fraction of a second) an equilibrium is reached in which the induced charges are exactly the right size to cancel the external electric field throughout the interior of the metal object. [...] Then the remaining mobile charges (electrons) in the interior of the metal no longer feel a force and the net motion of the charges stops.|$|R

40|$|Water {{permeation}} {{across a}} {{single-walled carbon nanotube}} (SWNT) {{under the influence of}} a mobile <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> has been studied with molecular dynamics simulations. This designed nanopore shows an excellent on–off gating behavior by a single <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> (of value + 1. 0 e) : it is both sensitive to the available charge signal when it is close (less than a critical distance of 0. 85 Å or about half the size of a water molecule) and effectively resistant to charge noise, i. e., the effect on the flow and net flux across the channel is found to be negligible when the charge is > 0. 85 Å away from the wall of the nanopore. This critical distance can be estimated from the interaction balance for the water molecule in the SWNT closest to the imposed charge with its neighboring water molecules and with the charge. The flow and net flux decay exponentially with respect to the difference between these two interaction energies when the charge gets closer to the wall of the SWNT and reaches a very small value once the charge crosses the wall, suggesting a dominating effect on the permeation properties from local water molecules near the <b>external</b> <b>charge.</b> These findings might have biological implications because membrane water channels share a similar single-file water chain inside these nanoscale channels...|$|R
50|$|When a charged {{object is}} brought near an uncharged, {{electrically}} conducting object, {{such as a}} piece of metal, the force of the nearby charge due to Coulomb's law causes a separation of these internal charges. For example, if a positive charge is brought near the object (see picture at right), the electrons in the metal will be attracted toward it and move {{to the side of the}} object facing it. When the electrons move out of an area, they leave an unbalanced positive charge due to the nuclei. This results in a region of negative charge on the object nearest to the <b>external</b> <b>charge,</b> and a region of positive charge on the part away from it. These are called induced <b>charges.</b> If the <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> is negative, the polarity of the charged regions will be reversed.|$|R
