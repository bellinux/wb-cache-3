40|$|Impact of odour {{emissions}} from livestock operation {{sites on the}} air quality of neighboring areas has raised public concerns. A practical means {{to solve this problem}} is to set adequate setback distance. Air dispersion modeling was proved to be a promising method in predicting proper odour setback distance. Although a lot of air dispersion models have been used to predict odour concentrations downwind agricultural odour sources, not so much information regarding the capability of these models in odour dispersion modeling simulation could be found because very limited field odour data are available to be applied to evaluate the modeling result. A main purpose of this project was evaluating AERMOD and CALPUFF air dispersion models for odour dispersion simulation using field odour data. Before evaluating and calibrating AERMOD and CALPUFF, sensitivity analysis of these two models to five major climatic parameters, i. e., mixing height, ambient temperature, stability class, wind speed, and wind direction, was conducted under both steady-state and variable meteorological conditions. It was found under steady-state weather condition, stability class and wind speed had great impact on the odour dispersion; while, ambient temperature and wind direction had limited impact on it; and mixing height had no impact on the odour dispersion at all. Under variable weather condition, maximum odour travel distance with odour concentrations of 1, 2, 5 and 10 OU/m 3 were examined using annual hourly meteorological data of year 2003 of the simulated area and the simulation result showed odour traveled longer distance under the prevailing wind direction. Evaluation outcomes of these two models using field odour data from University of Minnesota and University of Alberta showed capability of these two models in odour dispersion simulation was close in terms of agreement of modeled and field measured odour occurrences. Using Minnesota odour plume data, the difference of overall agreement of all field <b>odour</b> <b>measurements</b> and model predictions was 3. 6 % applying conversion equation from University of Minnesota and 3. 1 % applying conversion equation from University of Alberta between two models. However, if field odour intensity 0 was not considered in Minnesota measured odour data, the difference of overall agreement of all field <b>odour</b> <b>measurements</b> and model predictions was 3. 1 % applying conversion equation from University of Minnesota and 1. 6 % applying conversion equation from University of Alberta between two models. Using Alberta odour plume data, the difference of overall agreement of all field <b>odour</b> <b>measurements</b> and model predictions was 0. 7 % applying conversion equation from University of Alberta and 1. 2 % applying conversion equation from University of Minnesota between two models. However, if field odour intensity 0 was not considered in Alberta measured odour data, the difference of overall agreement of all field <b>odour</b> <b>measurements</b> and model predictions was 0. 4 % applying conversion equation from University of Alberta and 0. 7 % applying conversion equation from University of Minnesota between two models. Application of scaling factors can improve agreement of modeled and measured odour intensities (including all field <b>odour</b> <b>measurements</b> and field <b>odour</b> <b>measurements</b> without intensity 0) when conversion equation from University of Minnesota was used. Both models were used in determining odour setback distance based on their close performance in odour dispersion simulation. Application of two models in predicting odour setback distance using warm season (from May to October) historical annul hourly meteorological data (from 1999 to 2002) for a swine farm in Saskatchewan showed some differences existed between models predicted and Prairie Provinces odour control guidelines recommended setbacks.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in sensor technology, signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms {{have led to}} the development of chemical sensing instruments housing one or more non-specific gas sensors. These instruments are often referred to as 'electronic noses' or 'artificial olfaction systems' since they measure a range of non-specific compounds that make up odorous emissions. Odours usually contain various odorous chemical compounds, some of which cause annoyance to local receptors. For this reason, <b>odour</b> <b>measurement</b> has often been considered more of an art than a science.

40|$|The public {{nuisance}} and health concerns caused by odours from livestock facilities {{are among the}} key issues that affect neighbouring communities {{and the growth of}} the livestock industry across Canada. A setback distance is the common regulatory practice to reduce odour impact on the neighbouring areas. The air dispersion modeling method may be a more accurate tool for establishing setback distances since it considers site-specific airborne emissions, such as odour and gases from the animal production site as well as weather conditions and then estimates a concentration of the pollutant (odour, ammonia, etc.). Although various dispersion models have been studied to predict odour concentration from agricultural sources, limited field data exist to evaluate their applicability in agricultural odour dispersion. Thus, the purpose of this project was to evaluate the selected commercial air dispersion models with field plume measurements from swine operations. Firstly, this thesis describes a sensitivity analysis of how the climatic parameters affect model simulations for four selected air dispersion models, ISCST 3, AUSPLUME, CALPUFF, and CALPUFF. Under the steady state weather condition, mixing height had no effect on the livestock odour dispersion, while atmospheric stability, wind speed and wind direction had great effect on the livestock odour dispersion. Ambient temperature had a moderate effect compared with other parameters. Under variable weather conditions, the predicted odour concentrations were much lower than the results under steady state weather conditions. A series of comparisons between model predictions of the same four models and field <b>odour</b> <b>measurements</b> were conducted. When using the livestock <b>odour</b> plume <b>measurement</b> data from University of Manitoba, three equations were used to convert the model predicted odour concentration to field measured odour intensity. The equations did not predict odour intensity very well. No model showed obvious better performance than the others. Scaling factors did not improve the results considerably. When using the <b>odour</b> plume <b>measurement</b> data from University of Minnesota, INPUFF 2 performed better than CALPUFF. Scaling factors did improve the modeled results. When using the <b>odour</b> plume <b>measurement</b> data from University of Saskatchewan, INPUFF 2 also performed better than CALPUFF. Scaling factors were still useful for the results improvements. Finally, because CALPUFF is the US EPA preferred model and predicted the highest values under variable weather conditions in the sensitivity study, we used it to simulate odour plumes on selected three swine sites using hourly weather data from 1993 to 2002 in Yorkton, Saskatchewan. The maximum predicted distance were 2. 9 km for 1 OU, which was lower than the recommended maximum setback distance of 3. 2 km. It is recommended that the variable weather conditions be used in the setback distance determination. CALPUFF is the preferred model and INPUFF 2 is another option for field odour plume simulation, however scaling factors are needed to bring the model predictions close to the field measured results. Because the models evaluated were not developed for odour dispersion simulation, a model that can accurately predict livestock odour dispersion should be developed to take into account of the difference between odour and gas and wind direction shifts within the simulation time interval...|$|R
40|$|Continuous <b>odour</b> <b>measurements</b> both of {{emissions}} {{as well as}} ambient concentrations are seldom realised, mainly because of their high costs. They are therefore often substituted by concentration measurements of odorous substances. Then a conversion of the chemical concentrations C (mg m- 3) into odour concentrations COD (ouE m- 3) and odour intensities OI is necessary. Four methods to convert the concentrations of single substances to the odour concentrations and odour intensities of an odorous mixture are investigated: (1) direct use of measured concentrations, (2) {{the sum of the}} odour activity value SOAV, (3) the sum of the odour intensities SOI, and (4) the equivalent odour concentration EOC, as a new method.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been new odour {{assessment}} tools available to help municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) understand their off-site odour impact, such as dispersion modelling, portable <b>odour</b> <b>measurement</b> panel equipment, electronic noses, air tracer compounds, and odour sensors {{that can be used}} to measure ambient odours at the plant fenceline. However, perception of odours is highly subjective, individuals might have different responses to an odour at various concentration and duration. Many WWTPs have serious concerns about off-site odour impacts that are causing them to look for viable odour controls to meet community needs for an odour-free environment. This paper presents ways to demonstrate compliance with community odour standards using dispersion modelling, direct fenceline ambient sampling, and portable <b>odour</b> <b>measurement</b> equipment. Hand-held ambient odour and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) measurement devices were evaluated, and they compared favorably to odour dispersion modelling results for a mid-sized WWTP in the United States. Other methods, such as the electronic nose, were reviewed but not included in this paper because they are better suited for sampling at the odour emission source than for ambient sampling. Electronic noses also tend to have high detection limits for known odourous compounds emitted at a WWTP, which means that the typical WWTP odourous emission concentrations emitted may not be detected by the device. This paper provides insight into ambient sampling approaches using hand-held devices instead of other methods or approaches, including dispersion modelling and/or direct emissions source testing, to determine a WWTP’s off-site odour impacts. Results from this innovative approach, which relies on recent innovations in portable, <b>odour</b> <b>measurement</b> panel equipment, show that a simple strategy exists to prioritize odour sources for controls. The dispersion model results in the case study, using source-measured inputs, were verified at the fenceline using data gathered with hand-held ambient <b>odour</b> <b>measurement</b> and metering devices. 1...|$|E

These due {{to the presence of}} a large number of variables correlated to fast and continuous variability of odours, their low concentration in environment, the meteorological conditions, the difficulty to sampling a representative volume of air. In Europe the dynamic olfactometry method was standardized in 2003 by EN 13725 and was proposed for the measurement of odour emissions.

The high upfront cost of SIFT–MS will lead to potential users wanting compelling evidence that SIFT–MS will meet their needs before they invest in one...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{was made}} in Naantali plant of Finnfeeds Finland Oy. In this thesis the main study was in reducing, controlling, {{measuring}} and processing odour effluents in various methods. Also are considered legislation, marketing issues and environmental requirements of reducing of odour effluents. The literature review introduces odours complications, legislations and various methods of odour removal. There is also a review of volatile organic compounds detection and measuring methods. The experimental section consists TD-GC-MS-measurements and expansive measurements with electronic nose. Electronic nose is a new solution for recognition and measuring industrial odours. In this thesis the electronic nose was adapted into reliable recognition and measuring method. Measurements with electronic nose {{was made in}} betaine factory and main targets were odour removal process and other odours from factory. As a result of experimental work with TD-GC-MS-measurements becomes odour compound of 2 -and 3 - methylbutanal and dimethyldisulfide, which odour is sweet and fug. Extensive study with electronic nose found many developmental subjects. <b>Odour</b> balance <b>measurements</b> of factory and after calculation made adjustment of odour removal process, over all odour effluent to environment will reduce 25 %...|$|R
40|$|The gas sensing {{performances}} of low cost commercial chemical sensors are {{compared to the}} ones of standardized chemical analysers. Real time measurements are performed {{on the field of}} three municipal solid waste plants (MSW). Long-term campaigns of several months have been organised during the period 2010 - 2015. The sensors and the reference analysers have worked simultaneously. The selected sensors are commercial metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors (MOx, Figaro). The sensors-array devices are developed at the ULg laboratory (SAM). Analysers are certified and operated by the official Wallonia public scientific institute (ISSeP). In addition to odour, other target compounds are considered: methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, but also NMHC as limonene, pinene and BTEX The laboratory has a long experience in using chemical sensors for <b>odour</b> in-field <b>measurements,</b> especially for landfills and composting plants. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the {{performances of}} chemo-resistors array for continuous monitoring of compounds typical of municipal wastes in comparison to reference analysers. It highlights weaknesses and strengths of the two kinds of devices. The obtained results are considered for odour event detection as well as for chemical compound quantification and are discussed to evaluate the efficiency of metal oxide sensors for a low cost gas emissions assessment.

40|$|Ammonia {{emission}} {{from animal}} husbandry {{has to be}} reduced in the Netherlands by 70 % in the year 2005, compared with the emission level in 1980. Moreover, new <b>odour</b> legislation requires <b>measurements</b> of the <b>odour</b> emissions of the main conventional and newly developed housing systems. Research was carried out into the emission of ammonia and odour from a naturally ventilated and animal friendly house for pregnant sows. The reducing principle of this house was based on separation of the dunging area by providing a comfortable and spacious lying area with straw bedding. The pens housed 8 sows and provided individual feeding boxes for each of them. The research was carried out during a summer and winter period. The emission of ammonia from the house amounted to 6. 3 (summer period) and to 5. 5 (winter period) kg/year per animal with 5 % correction for under-occupation. The odour emission was 26. 1 OUE /s per animal...|$|R
