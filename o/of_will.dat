40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this article is}} the undeniable experience <b>of</b> conscious <b>willing</b> despite its rejection by scientific research. The article starts a phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> {{at the level of the}} (epi) phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> itself, without assuming its embeddedness in a faculty of the soul, consciousness and so forth. After the introduction, a brief history of the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> is provided, from which the paradoxical conclusion is drawn that, according to phenomenologists like Heidegger and his followers, the dominance <b>of</b> the <b>will</b> is the main characteristic of the current age, whereas scientists deny the existence <b>of</b> a conscious <b>will</b> at all. Then, four structural moments of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> are explored in contrast to traditional characterizations in order to rehabilitate and appreciate the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> in contemporary philosophy: the interconnectedness of the one who wills and that which is willed, the transcendence and demand character of that which is <b>willed,</b> the self-involvement <b>of</b> the one who wills and the ampliative nature of the act <b>of</b> <b>willing.</b> To this end, not only sources from the phenomenological tradition but also the affordance theory of the ecological psychologist James Gibson are critically discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{author of}} the paper {{discusses}} rules relating to will execution formalities, and rules relating to interpretation <b>of</b> <b>wills</b> {{in order to show}} the importance of legal policy and general legal values for interpretation <b>of</b> <b>wills.</b> Aharon Barak’s theory of purposive interpretation is a starting point for the discussion because this theory emphasizes the importance of objective elements for interpretation <b>of</b> <b>wills.</b> The author analyses the main problems that arise in connection with interpretation <b>of</b> <b>wills</b> and indicates possible policy considerations underlying different approaches to interpretation. The author concludes that courts have a justifiably large freedom to interpret the words <b>of</b> the <b>will</b> and that there is convergence between civil law and common law approach to interpretation <b>of</b> <b>wills,</b> and this interpretation is often based on objective rules not connected to the most likely intent of the testator...|$|R

5|$|Rome's {{earliest}} history, {{from the}} time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved.

5|$|After Sesame Streets first season, {{its critics}} forced its {{producers}} and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict.

5|$|Although Mansfield's film {{career was}} short-lived, she had several box-office successes {{and won a}} Theatre World Award and a Golden Globe.

Mansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield. Mansfield's career came to an end when she was killed in a 1967 car accident at the age of 34.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} {{portrayal of the}} excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression <b>of</b> <b>will,</b> especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end.|$|E
5|$|Because the South Korean {{forces had}} {{suffered}} nearly 45,000 casualties {{at the end}} of 1950, most of the South Korean units were composed of raw recruits with little combat training. After inspecting the front just days before the battle, General J. Lawton Collins, the US Army Chief of Staff, concluded that most of the ROK formations were only fit for outpost duties. At the same time, the US Eighth Army was also suffering from low morale due to its earlier defeats, and most of its soldiers were anticipating an evacuation from Korea. The Eighth Army's lack <b>of</b> <b>will</b> to fight and to maintain contact with Chinese forces resulted in a lack of information on Chinese troop movements and intentions. After inspecting the front on December 27, Ridgway ordered the US I and IX Corps to organize a new defensive line around Koyang to Uijeongbu, called the Seoul Bridgehead line, to cover the Han River crossings in case the UN forces were forced to evacuate Seoul.|$|E

Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories.

Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.|$|E
5|$|Foreign operas {{were popular}} among the upper-class {{throughout}} the 19th century, while other styles of musical theater included operettas, ballad operas and the opera bouffe. The English operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan were particularly popular, while American compositions had trouble finding an audience. George M. Cohan {{was the first}} notable American composer of musical theater, {{and the first to}} move away from the operetta, and is also notable for using the language of the vernacular in his work. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, black playwrights, composers and musicians were having a profound effect on musical theater, beginning with the works <b>of</b> <b>Will</b> Marion Cook, James Reese Europe and James P. Johnson; the first major hit black musical was Shuffle Along in 1921.|$|E
5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu.

During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and happy and had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees or wherever they liked.
