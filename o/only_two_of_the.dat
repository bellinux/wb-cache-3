5|$|At {{the time}} of Wurster's and Ganzert's visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the {{springing}} line of the vaults. No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements of the clear span and the pier width could be undertaken. It was, however, possible to calculate {{the dimensions of the}} remaining bays from their exposed sections.|$|E
5|$|Newnes {{stipulated that}} Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} must sail under the British flag, and be styled the British Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink readily agreed to this, even though <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire expedition party were British. This increased the hostility and contempt of Markham, who chastised RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch.|$|E

It's a pretty song, if one that blatantly rides Adele's coattails. Not only does 'Page' employ the same piano/voice arrangement as that star's 'Someone Like You,' Aguilera apes the precise length of Adele's notes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships had bulges {{added to}} them through this program, Maryland (completed 1 August 1941) and Colorado (26 February 1942); {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor {{interrupted}} the refits intended for West Virginia and the two Tennessees. The surprise strike did not touch Colorado, which was at Puget Sound, and did not hurt Maryland very badly; however, West Virginia was severely damaged and needed a major refit at minimum.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the body}} of many species is almost {{radially}} symmetrical, the main axis is oral to aboral (from the mouth to the opposite end). However, since <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canals near the statocyst terminate in anal pores, ctenophores have no mirror-symmetry, although many have rotational symmetry, in other words if the animal rotates in a half-circle it looks the same as when it started.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{failed to}} achieve any of their goals on the first day. Carentan, St. Lô, and Bayeux {{remained}} in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.|$|E
5|$|The Dnestr/Dnepr radars were {{intended}} {{to be replaced by}} the newer Daryal radars starting in the 1990s. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planned Daryal radars became operational, due to issues such as the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As of 2012, the Russian early warning network still consists of some radars of this vintage.

5|$|The {{ability to}} verify British claims against the British' main opponents in 1941 and 1942, JG 26 and JG 2, is very limited. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 30 volumes of War Diaries {{produced}} by JG 26 survived the war.

5|$|The section {{immediately}} {{south of}} Highway401 is often congested at all hours. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes {{to the number}} of lanes merging from Highways401 and404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway404, but <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five lanes lead to it.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice of Villa Giusti {{signed by}} the Austro-Hungarians on 3 November 1918, Bosna was {{operated}} by the navy of the Hungarian People's Republic between 6 November and 13 December. She was then crewed by sailors of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in 1918–19. Under {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye concluded in September 1919, Bosna was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors, but was officially handed over to the KSCS Navy and renamed Vardar in 1920. In 1925–26, Vardar was refitted, but by the following year <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice of Villa Giusti {{signed by}} the Austro-Hungarians on 3 November 1918, Körös was {{operated}} by the navy of the Hungarian People's Republic between 6 November and 13 December.

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships had been commissioned, with the third being brought into service three months after the war started. Their only significant pre-war task was undertaken by Beograd in May 1939, and involved the transportation of a large portion of Yugoslavia's gold reserve to the United Kingdom for safekeeping. On 24 January 1940, Ljubljana ran into a reef off the Yugoslav port of Šibenik. The hull side was breached and despite efforts to get the ship into the port, it sank close to shore, and some of the crew swam to safety. One crew member died, and the captain was arrested pending an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{spirited}} {{resistance from}} the largest British merchant ship, Windham, {{the failure of the}} other Indiamen to support their leader and the size and power of the French ships forced the British to withdraw: all the HEIC ships were subsequently captured by the larger, faster French warships. A month later, Hamelin's raiding campaign skirted disaster when a winter hurricane on the voyage back to Île de France almost wrecked his flagship Vénus. Vénus only survived with the co-operation of the British prisoners aboard, who brought the ship safely to port. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captured Indiamen were successfully brought to Ile de France: the same storm that nearly destroyed Vénus scattered the squadron and its prizes, allowing a patrolling British frigate to recapture Windham {{just a few miles from}} the French island.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's elder sister, Elizabeth, {{was born}} in 1827. His younger sisters were Mary Hannah and Emma, who were born in 1832 and 1834 respectively. Mary Hannah died five months before Emma's birth, and Emma herself died in 1848. Douglas married Elizabeth Edmunds, a farmer's {{daughter}} from Bangor-is-y-Coed, Flintshire, on 25 January 1860 in StDunawd's Church in the village, a church he was later to restore. Initially the couple lived over the office at 6Abbey Square, and later they moved next door to No.4. Their five children were born in these houses, John Percy in 1861, Colin Edmunds in 1864, Mary Elizabeth in 1866, Sholto Theodore the following year, and Jerome in 1869. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children survived to adulthood; Mary Elizabeth died from scarlet fever in 1868, Jerome lived {{for only a few}} days, and John Percy died aged 12 in 1873.|$|E

5|$|Gregoras {{reports that}} 6,400 cavalrymen and 8,000 infantrymen {{fell in the}} battle, the same number he gives for Walter's forces. According to Muntaner, 20,000 infantrymen were killed, and <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven hundred knights survived the battle, Roger Deslaur and Boniface of Verona. Like the numbers for {{the overall number of}} troops {{involved}} in the battle, these numbers are unverifiable and probably exaggerated, but they are nevertheless indicative of the scale of the Athenian defeat. In addition, other senior members of the Frankish nobility are known to have survived: Nicholas Sanudo, later Duke of the Archipelago, managed to escape the battlefield, and a few others such as Antoine le Flamenc, who is known to have participated in and survived the battle, were probably captured and later ransomed. Walter's head was severed by the Catalans, and many years later was taken to Lecce in Italy, where his son buried him in the Church of Santa Croce.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} armistice, Enns was crewed by sailors of the KSCS in 1918–19.

Her sister ship Inn was transferred to Romania and renamed Besarabia.

5|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.|$|E
