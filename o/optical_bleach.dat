40|$|Overestimation of {{equivalent}} dose (De) values due to thermal transfer was observed for quartz {{when using the}} single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol (SAR) to recover a small known dose (1. 74 Gy) given after an <b>optical</b> <b>bleach.</b> Both the fast and medium components resulted in overestimation, with the effect being larger for the medium component and the effect {{could be seen in}} De (t) plot as stimulation time increased. The dose-generated OSL signal can be distinguished from the thermally transferred signal based on the linear relationship between the initial and final parts of the thermally transferred OSL curves. A method is proposed to correct for thermal-transfer effects using the OSL signals measured in repeated heat/OSL cycles incorporated into the SAR protocol. This approach was applied to artificially irradiated and optically bleached samples, and {{it was found that the}} thermal-transfer effects can be removed when using only a single aliquot. In dose recovery tests, the known dose (1. 74 Gy) could be obtained using this approach and a value of 0. 074 ± 0. 026 Gy was obtained for optically bleached aliquots. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Recently a new dating {{procedure}} {{has been}} suggested, {{which is based}} on the thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) signal that is measured after irradiated quartz is optically bleached and then preheated. Experimentally the TT-OSL signal was measured after a high temperature preheat (for 10 s) following an <b>optical</b> <b>bleach</b> at for 270 s to deplete the fast and medium OSL components. The TT-OSL signal was measured for 90 s at {{in order to avoid the}} effect of re-trapping of electrons in the trap of quartz. The luminescence sensitivity changes were monitored by the OSL response to a test dose. In this paper, we use a modified version of a comprehensive model to simulate the complete experimental sequence of the new protocol, and to fit the experimental dose?response graphs of the OSL, TT-OSL and basic-TT-OSL signals for doses up to 4000 Gy. Two possible mechanisms for the production of the TT-OSL signals in this quartz are discussed, namely the double transfer mechanism suggested for the recuperation effect, and a single transfer mechanism in which the TT-OSL signal is due to the thermal transfer of charge from a ?source trap? into the fast OSL trap of quartz. The results of the simulation indicate that the latter mechanism is more likely to be responsible for the observed TT-OSL dose growth in fine-grained quartz extracted from Chinese loess.

40|$|Experiments are {{described}} in this thesis on the <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> at room temperature of F centres in freshly cleaved single crystal KBr, coloured by fast electron (50 KV) irradiation and illuminated with light from a focused helium-neon laser. Using a specially constructed microspectrophotometer bleaching apparatus, which is described in Chapter Two, data was obtained on <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> at illuminating power densities up to 10 KW. cm- 2 in KBr having initial F centres concentrations of 10 (18) - 10 (19) centres cm. - 3. The bleaching light intensity is some 10 (6) times greater than that used in previous experiments, and the initial defect concentrations produced by electron irradiation are considerably higher than {{those found in the}} additively coloured specimens used in earlier experiments. Essentially, there have been no previous studies made on the <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> of electron irradiated alkalil halide, and very little work has been done on the laser bleaching of this material coloured by any of the other methods possible. It is found that KBr which has been coloured by electron irradiation at room temperature bleaches by the random aggregation of F centres, a process which also occurs in additively coloured material. Prolonged bleaching, to absorbed doses of > 4 x 10 (8) J. oa- 3, does not result in a complete disappearance of absorption in the F band region, but leads to the formation of a residual coloration which is due to excited states of the M and R centres. A technique of optical modulation spectroscopy described in Chapter Five, showed that R+ centres are formed during illumination, which points to the importance of the F +o M+ and M+∝ -> R+ reactions in the aggregation process. In marked contrast, a vacancy interstitial recombination mechanism occurs in KBr which has been coloured by electron irradiation at 90 K warmed in the dark to room temperature for bleaching. There is a direct proportionality between the height of the V band and the total number of vacancies present in F, M and R centre throughout the <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> ot KBr coloured at low temperature. Prolonged bleaching leads to the complete disappearance of the F, M, R and V bands, and the optical absorption spectrum of the crystal is similar to that seen prior to coloration. The atomic mechanisms responsible for bleaching under illumination at room temperature in KBr coloured additively, and by fast electron irradiation at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures, are discussed at length in Chapters Four and Five. Chapter Six describes investigations into the coloration and bleaching properties of the sodalites using a dark trace cathode ray tube with an aluminised chlorosodalite powder screen.

Radiation Measurements, 42 (8), 1285 - 1293. Sponsorship: NERC EFCHED GrantSeveral {{characteristics of the}} isothermal thermoluminescence (ITL) signal from quartz grains held at 310 degrees C are investigated. The effect oil the TL signal of holding the quartz at this temperature for different periods of time is recorded. It is shown that the TL and ITL data cannot be explained by a single trap obeying non-first order kinetics. The pattern of TL signal loss implies that probably two TL peaks are removed, one by holding for similar to 5 s at 310 degrees C and the other by holding for 500 s. The ITL decay curves that result from holding the sample at 310 degrees C is analysed using the Sum of three first order decay functions, and these are termed fast, medium and slow ITL. Two signal integrals, 0 - 5 and 50 - 100 s, {{are considered to be}} representative of the fast and medium ITL components. These are investigated with regard to their response to laboratory irradiation, {{thermal stability}} and the effects of <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching.</b> The (0 - 5 s) signal shows all order of magnitude higher for saturation level with laboratory dose than the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signal, and has a thermal stability that is very sintilar to published values for the OSL or the 325 degrees C TL peak. Bleaching with a solar simulator reduces both parts of the ITL signal to a low, but non-zero level in a few thousand seconds. This result is supported by an equivalent dose estimate oil a modern river sample from Zambia of 11 +/- 2 Gy.

The principle aims of the project, {{at a time when}} statutory changes involving strict labelling rules were anticipated, were to consolidate the thermoluminescence technique already developed at SURRC and to investigate it's extension to fruits and vegetables. The TL procedures for mineral separation were further developed by the incorporation of pre-concentration steps. These steps were introduced in order to improve the the sensitivity of the TL signal, particularly, where the separation technique resulted in low mineral yield for commercially clean samples. This has resulted in an order of magnitude increase in the absolute, TL, signal levels and provides a means of obtaining larger quantities of minerals for any further quantification, thus reducing the ambiguity of interpretation of data. An EC interlaboratory trial was instigated, using the full mineral separation method with reirradiation on a set of calibrated reference materials and paired (irradiated and unirradiated) samples of 12 commercial grade herbs and spices. Despite the diversity of experience and equipment employed, results from all laboratories showed {{that it was possible to}} determine which samples were irradiated. This demonstrated the strength of the separation method that its implementation could be successfully achieved in other laboratories. The procedure was then formally recognised and published, by MAFF, for detection of irradiated food for enforcement of UK legislation. As the mineral debris responsible for TL in herbs and spices occurs ubiquitously on all foodstuffs, which have been exposed to wind and soil, investigating the application of TL to fruits and vegetables was a natural extension of the previous work. An extensive survey was conducted of TL signals from fruits and vegetables, including exotic varieties. Minerals were separated from duplicated pairs of irradiated and unirradiated samples of 22 fruits and 20 vegetables. TL results demonstrated unambiguous discrimination between irradiated and unirradiated vegetables provided that concordance diagrams were used. For soft fruits in particular water based separation produced more variable results. However, subsequent analyses using a full density separation with HCI wash were more successful. It was recognised that whereas herbs and spices are largely protected from exposure to light during production and distribution, this is unlikely to be the case for fruits and vegtables. Since light exposure is known to reduce TL signal intensity, a set of illumination experiments was conducted to investigate the implications of <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> for identification. Light boxes were constructed and characterised to simulated <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> under controlled conditions. Two series of experiments were conducted with irradiated and control mangos. In the first experiment the effects of exposure to two different light sources at a level of 1 J cm- 2 were investigated using 40 mangos. In the second experiment the influence of duration of exposure from 1 - 128 J cm- 2 was examined for artificial daylight illumination of a further 96 mangos. The results of these studies show that although the TL signal is reduced as a result of exposure to daylight, there exists a residual unbleachable component comprising upto 40 - 50...|$|R
