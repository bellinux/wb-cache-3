The Icelandic Coastguard viewed this as a violation of international law, and took many photographs of the trawlers displaying these signs; including a picture taken on 5 September 1972 of a ship believed to be the trawler Peter Scott (H103). The Icelandic strategy involved the use of net-cutters, invented by Commander Péter Sigurǒsson, Director of the Coast Guard, with assistance from Friŏrik Teitsson from the Icelandic lighthouse institution and Tómas Sigurǒsson, who were both ironmongers.

50|$|The {{large body}} size (see also Bergmann's rule) and {{distribution}} of Steller's sea eagle suggests it is a glacial relict, meaning it evolved in a narrow subarctic zone of the northeasternmost Asian coasts, which shifted its latitude according to ice age cycles, and never occurred anywhere else. This bird nests in two habitats: along sea coasts and alongside large rivers with mature trees. They nest on large, rocky outcroppings or at the tops of large trees. Usually, areas with large Erman's birches (Betula ermanii) and floodplain forests of larches, alders, willows and poplar {{seem to be the}} preferred nesting spots. Some eagles, especially those that nest in sea coast, may not migrate. The timing, duration, and extent of migration depends on ice conditions and food availability. On Kamchatka, eagles overwinter in forests and river valleys near the coast, but are irregularly distributed over the peninsula. Most wintering birds there appear to be residential adults. Steller's sea eagles that do migrate fly down to winter in rivers and wetlands in Japan, but will occasionally move to mountainous inland areas as opposed to the sea coast. Each winter, drifting ice on the Sea of Okhotsk drives thousands of eagles south. Ice reaches Hokkaido in late January. Eagle numbers peak in the Nemuro Strait in late February. On Hokkaido, eagles concentrate in coastal areas and on lakes near the coast, along with substantial numbers of white-tailed eagles. Eagles depart between late March and late April, adults typically leaving before immatures. Migrants tend to follow sea coasts and are usually observed flying singly. In groups, migrants are typically observed flying 100 - 200 m apart. On Kamchatka, most migrants are birds in transitional plumages. They are also occasionally seen flying over the northern <b>ocean</b> or <b>perching</b> on sea ice during the winter.|$|R
50|$|Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> {{are mostly}} planktivorous (Carlson and Haight 1976, Yang 1993, 1996, Yang and Nelson 2000, Yang 2003). In {{a sample of}} 600 {{juvenile}} perch stomachs, Carlson and Haight (1976) found that juveniles fed on an equal mix of calanoid copepods and euphausiids. Larger juveniles and adults fed primarily on euphausiids, {{and to a lesser}} degree, copepods, amphipods and mysids (Yang and Nelson 2000). In the Aleutian Islands, myctophids have increasingly comprised {{a substantial portion of the}} Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> diet, which also compete for euphausiid prey (Yang 2003). It has been suggested that Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> and walleye pollock compete for the same euphausiid prey. Consequently, the large removals of Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> by foreign fishermen in the Gulf of Alaska in the 1960s may have allowed walleye pollock stocks to greatly expand in abundance.|$|E

50|$|The {{red gurnard}} perch or jock stewart, Helicolenus percoides, is a {{rockfish}} {{of the family}} Sebastidae, found on the continental shelves of Australia and New Zealand at depths of between 20 and 750 m.

50|$|This {{seasonal}} {{pattern is}} probably related to summer feeding and winter spawning. Although {{small numbers of}} Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> are dispersed throughout their preferred depth range on the continental shelf and slope, most of the population occurs in patchy, localized aggregations (Hanselman et al. 2001). Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> are {{generally considered to be}} semi-demersal but there can at times be a significant pelagic component to their distribution. Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> often move off-bottom at night to feed, apparently following diel euphausiid migrations.

50|$|The fishery for Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> {{developed}} nearly synchronously {{from the}} U.S. West Coast to the Bering Sea. The Gulf of Alaska fishing history captures a typical catch history: A Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> trawl fishery by the U.S.S.R. and Japan {{began in the}} Gulf of Alaska in the early 1960s. This fishery developed rapidly, with massive efforts by the Soviet and Japanese fleets. Catches peaked in 1965, when a total of nearly 350,000 metric tons (t) was caught. This apparent overfishing resulted in a precipitous decline in catches in the late 1960s. Catches continued to decline in the 1970s, and by 1978 catches were only 8,000 t. Foreign fishing dominated the fishery from 1977 to 1984, and catches generally declined during this period. Most of the catch was taken by Japan (Carlson et al. 1986). Catches reached a minimum in 1985, after foreign trawling in the Gulf of Alaska was prohibited.|$|E

50|$|The Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> (Sebastes alutus), {{also known}} as the Pacific rockfish, Rose fish, Red bream or Red perch has a wide {{distribution}} in the North Pacific from southern California around the Pacific rim to northern Honshū, Japan, including the Bering Sea. The species appears to be most abundant in northern British Columbia, the Gulf of Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands (Allen and Smith 1988).|$|E

Other seafood available includes <b>ocean</b> <b>perch,</b> swordfish, shark, lobster, octopus and oysters, which are commonly served fried.|$|E
50|$|There is much {{uncertainty}} about the life history of Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch,</b> although generally more is known than for other rockfish species (Kendall and Lenarz 1986). The species appears to be viviparous (the eggs develop internally and receive at least some nourishment from the mother), with internal fertilization {{and the release of}} live young. Insemination occurs in the fall, and sperm are retained within the female until fertilization takes place ~2 months later. The eggs hatch internally, and parturition (release of larvae) occurs in April-May.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{strategy of}} spreading reproductive output {{over many years}} {{is a way of}} ensuring some reproductive success through long periods of poor larval survival (Leaman and Beamish 1984). Fishing generally selectively removes the older and faster-growing portion of the population. If there is a distinct evolutionary advantage of retaining the oldest fish in the population, either because of higher fecundity or because of different spawning times, age-truncation could be ruinous to a population with highly episodic recruitment like rockfish (Longhurst 2002). Recent work on black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) has shown that larval survival may be dramatically higher from older female spawners (Berkeley et al. 2004, Bobko and Berkeley 2004). The black rockfish population has shown a distinct downward trend in age-structure in recent fishery samples off the West Coast of North America, raising concerns about whether these are general results for most rockfish. De Bruin et al. (2004) examined Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> (S. alutus) and rougheye rockfish (S. aleutianus) for senescence in reproductive activity of older fish and found that oogenesis continues at advanced ages. Leaman (1991) showed that older individuals have slightly higher egg dry weight than their middle-aged counterparts. Such relationships have not yet been determined to exist for Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> or other rockfish in Alaska.|$|E
50|$|Sebastes is a genus {{of fish in}} {{the family}} Sebastidae (though some include this in Scorpaenidae), most of which have the common name of rockfish. A few are called <b>ocean</b> <b>perch,</b> sea perch or redfish instead. Most of the Sebastes species live in the north Pacific, {{although}} two (Sebastes capensis and Sebastes oculatus) live in the south Pacific/Atlantic and four (Sebastes fasciatus, Sebastes mentella, Sebastes norvegicus and Sebastes viviparus) live in the north Atlantic. The coast off South California is the area of highest rockfish diversity, with 56 species living in the Southern California Bight.|$|E
50|$|Information {{on early}} life history is very sparse, {{especially}} {{for the first year}} of life. Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> larvae are thought to be pelagic and drift with the current, and oceanic conditions may sometimes cause advection to suboptimal areas (Ainley et al. 1993) resulting in high recruitment variability. However, larval studies of rockfish have been hindered by difficulties in species identification since many larval rockfish species share the same morphological characteristics (Kendall 2000). Genetic techniques using allozymes (Seeb and Kendall 1991) and mitochondrial DNA (Li 2004) are capable of identifying larvae and juveniles to species, but are expensive and time-consuming.|$|E
50|$|Post-larval {{and early}} young-of-the-year Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> have been {{positively}} identified in offshore, surface {{waters of the}} GOA (Gharrett et al. 2002), which suggests {{this may be the}} preferred habitat of this life stage. Transformation to a demersal existence may take place within the first year (Carlson and Haight 1976). Small juveniles probably reside inshore in very rocky, high relief areas, and by age 3 begin to migrate to deeper offshore waters of the continental shelf (Carlson and Straty 1981). As they grow, they continue to migrate deeper, eventually reaching the continental slope, where they attain adulthood.|$|E
50|$|Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> is a {{very slow}} growing species, with a low rate of natural {{mortality}} (estimated at 0.06), a relatively old age at 50% maturity (10.5 years for females in the Gulf of Alaska), and a very old maximum age of 98 years in Alaska (84 years maximum age in the Gulf of Alaska) (Hanselman et al. 2003). Age at 50% recruitment to the commercial fishery has been estimated to be between 7 and 8 years in the Gulf of Alaska. Despite their viviparous nature, the fish is relatively fecund with number of eggs/female in Alaska ranging from 10,000-300,000, depending upon size of the fish (Leaman 1991).|$|E
50|$|The {{deepwater}} redfish (Sebastes mentella), {{also known as}} the beaked redfish, <b>ocean</b> <b>perch,</b> Atlantic redfish, Norway haddock, red perch, golden redfish, or hemdurgan, may reach a size of 55 - 70 cm, but is usually less than 45 cm. It lives in comparatively high concentrations in the North Atlantic, for example in the Irminger Sea where considerable numbers are fished. It occupies depths between 300 and 1000 m and is often pelagic, i.e. far off the bottom. The deep-sea redfish feeds on a variety of food organisms, for example small fishes. In contrast to most fishes that spawn unfertilised eggs, the {{deepwater redfish}} has internal fertilisation and spawns free-living larvae.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 150 plant {{species in the}} flora of the islands, and about 80 types of insect have been identified.The waters around the Vestmannaeyjar contain some of the North Atlantic's richest fishing grounds.

40|$|Relative to the 1999 final SAFE, the {{following}} substantial {{changes have been}} made: The stock assessment for slope rockfish was updated to include results from the 1999 trawl survey. The trawl survey biomass estimates for Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> and northern rockfish in 1999 were both greatly influenced by one extremely large catch. One haul in the Chirikof area had a catch for Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> of nearly 16 mt, which is the highest single catch ever recorded for this species {{in any of the}} triennial surveys. The large biomass for Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>perch</b> in the Chirikof area in 1999 can be mostly attributed to this one haul. Likewise, one haul in the Kodiak area produced the largest catch of northern rockfish (nearly 8 mt) that has ever been seen in the triennial surveys, and it also resulted in an extremely large biomass estimate. In addition, these anomalously high catches were responsible for high variances associated with the Gulfwide biomass estimates for each species.
