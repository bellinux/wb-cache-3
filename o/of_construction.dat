40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to natural language understanding based on a computable grammar <b>of</b> <b>constructions.</b> A <b>construction</b> consists <b>of</b> a set of features of form and a description of meaning in a context. A grammar is a set <b>of</b> <b>constructions.</b> This kind <b>of</b> grammar is the key element of mincal, an implemented natural language speech-enabled interface to an online calendar system. The architecture has two key aspects: (a) the use <b>of</b> <b>constructions,</b> integrating descriptions <b>of</b> form, meaning and context into one whole; and (b) the separation of domain knowledge (about calendars) from application knowledge (about the particular on-line calendar). 1 Introduction: {{an overview of the}} system We present {{an approach to}} natural language understanding based on a computable grammar <b>of</b> <b>constructions.</b> A <b>construction</b> consists <b>of</b> a set of features of form and a description of meaning in a context.

40|$|We {{describe}} a pair <b>of</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> Eisenstein lattices from ternary codes, and a corresponding pair <b>of</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> conformal field theories from lattices which {{turn out to}} have a string theoretic interpretation.

We therefore make some comments regarding a series <b>of</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> V^. In addition, we present a complete <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Niemeier lattices from ternary codes, which in view of the above analogies should prove to be of great importance in the problem of the classification of self-dual c= 24 conformal field theories. Other progress towards this problem is summarised, and some comments arise from this discussion regarding the uniqueness of the Monster conformal field theory.

40|$|Introduction Boomborg-PC is a proof-checker <b>of</b> Calculus <b>of</b> <b>Constructions</b> {{that runs}} on a buffer of GNU Emacs. Calculus <b>of</b> <b>Constructions,</b> {{proposed}} by Thierry Coquand and G'erard Huet [2], {{is one of the}} so-called higher-order typed -calculi [1]. A typed -calculus is a formal system for writing typed -terms, and Boomborg-PC is a program that typechecks -terms written by the rules <b>of</b> Calculus <b>of</b> <b>Constructions.</b> A typed -calculus is called higher-order, if it has variables ranging over types. Higher-order typed -calculi, including Calculus <b>of</b> <b>Constructions,</b> are also called general logic or logical framework, because they {{can be used as a}} general framework to implement various kinds of logical system such as first-order predicate calculus.

This measures the social cost <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services. This allows consideration of the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy.
