5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Soviet, literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some of {{the functions of the}} Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of the Council of Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Soviet. When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E

5|$|In 1867 a {{commission}} {{was created to}} look into issues with the central courts, and the outcome were the Judicature Acts, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature, with the three central common law courts becoming {{three of the five}} divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court; this was not designed to be permanent, but rather to avoid having to retire or demote two of the three Chief Justices to allow a single head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court, as this would have violated the constitutional principle that senior justices were irremovable. By sheer chance Fitzroy Kelly and Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of England respectively both died in 1880, allowing the merger of the common law divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court into a single division, the Queen's Bench Division, under John Coleridge, who had been Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and became Lord Chief Justice of England, by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. At this point, the Exchequer of Pleas formally ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, after Nikita Khrushchev's ouster, a plenum of the Central Committee (CC) forbade {{any single}} {{individual}} {{to hold the}} two most powerful posts of the country (the office of the General Secretary and the premier), and Kosygin {{was in charge of}} economic administration in his role as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. However Kosygin's position was weakened when he proposed an economic reform in 1965. Under the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government of the USSR. The premier was the chief of the executive branch and head of the union government as a whole, the premiership was the highest governmental office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition until the establishment of the Presidency in 1990. The premier was responsible and accountable to the Supreme Soviet, and in the period between sessions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Soviet, accountable to the Presidium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Soviet. The premier was tasked with resolving all state administrative duties within the jurisdiction of the USSR to the degree that it did not come under the competence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Soviet or the Presidium. The premier managed the national economy, formulated the five-year plans and ensured socio-cultural development.|$|E
