According to Larson Powell and Brenda Bethman, musicality is a very important aspect of the book: they argue that Jelinek (herself a former student of the Vienna Conservatory) uses musicality to underscore the perversity of the main character, who participates in a musical tradition that trains women to play the piano in order to attract a husband. Erika's failure as a pianist is a sign of her perversion: both the pervert and the artist attain pleasure, but where the artist reaches pleasure as a sublimity, thus becoming a desiring subject, the pervert fails to achieve subjectivity and remains bound to <b>object</b> <b>status.</b> Thus, Erika remains the object of her mother's desire, unable to attain subjectivity which the principles of her musical education had denied her in the first place.|$|E

In {{response}} to the primacy of the male body, Export created her own version of Actionism: Feminist Actionism. In her manifesto, Export surveys a history of female artists within Surrealism, Kinetics, Tachism, Happenings, Art Informel and other contemporary movements. She finds the traces of feminine objectification within a phallocentric world. She declares: Feminist Actionism shall free men's products, that is, women, from their thing-character. Just as action aims at achieving the unity of actor and material, perception and action, subject and object, Feminist Actionism seeks to transform the object of male natural history, the material [...] "woman," [...] subjugated and enslaved by the male creator, into an independent actor and creator, subject of her own history.As opposed to Viennese Actionism, which used materiality and the object to overcome subjecthood, Export’s Feminist Actionism removed women from their <b>object</b> <b>status</b> by [...] "enacting," [...] to gain subject-hood through [...] "doing."

The results confirm the conformity hypothesis: conform to the social image that the school system bestows on them, and independent from their social class background, adolescents in academic tracks were less likely to use the mobile phone as a <b>status</b> <b>object.</b> The compensation hypothesis was partially confirmed: adolescents who lag behind in combination with a drop to a non-academic school track, and adolescents with a negative academic self-concept were more likely to use the mobile phone as a <b>status</b> <b>object,</b> but no direct relationship was found with lagging behind. The resistance hypothesis was fully supported: a negative attitude towards school mediates the relationship between lagging behind, school track, academic self-concept {{and the use of the}} mobile phone as a <b>status</b> <b>object.</b> Finally, self-esteem was found to relate positively to the use of the mobile phone as a <b>status</b> <b>object,</b> which suggests that adolescents who use the mobile phone as a <b>status</b> <b>object</b> have achieved a successful identity in other domains than the academic domain.

40|$|Object {{perception}} {{is necessary to}} our understanding of the visual world, yet its neural mechanism remains poorly understood. The goal of this dissertation is to shed light on this mechanism. Current computational models of object perception suggest that regions on opposite sides of a shared border compete, with the winner perceived as the shaped object and the loser as its locally shapeless background (or ground). Recent behavioral work indicates that the result of this competition is suppression of the ground at the level of object shape [...] a finding not predicted by models. Here, I present three studies that extend this previous research on ground suppression as a mechanism by which object {{perception is}} accomplished. I first show that the amount of suppression applied to the ground depends on the amount of competition for <b>object</b> <b>status</b> (Salvagio, Cacciamani, & Peterson, 2012). I then provide the first neural evidence of ground suppression from shape-level competition at both high and low levels of the visual hierarchy, with the latter arising from top-down feedback (Cacciamani, Scalf, & Peterson, submitted). Finally, I show that semantic information pertaining to the ground is accessed prior to the assignment of <b>object</b> <b>status,</b> but unlike shape information, is not suppressed (Cacciamani, Mojica, Sanguinetti, & Peterson, 2014). Together, the three studies that comprise this dissertation demonstrate that ground suppression arising from shape-level competition underlies object perception. This research contradicts traditional theories stating that objects are processed unidirectionally through the visual system in a single feedforward pass; instead, it supports theories of object perception entailing dynamical feedforward and feedback processes...|$|E
40|$|Like {{many other}} languages, Maltese shows some peculiarities in the {{behavior}} of its experiential verbs. While the case-marking and agreement properties of these verbs point to (direct or indirect) <b>object</b> <b>status</b> of the experiencer argument, several behavioral properties make the experiencer argument appear more similar to subjects. Different sub-types of experiential verbs can be distinguished, and a number of individual verbs (most notably the possessive verb ghandu/kellu 'have', well-known from the earlier literature) show further peculiarities. The various groups of verbs or individual verbs can be arranged on a continuum which shows an increasing number of subject properties of the experiencer (or possessor) argument. Thus, subject properties are not distributed in a clear-cut manner, and we observe a certain amount of "subject diffuseness"...|$|E
40|$|Multiple objects {{compete for}} {{representation}} in visual cortex. Competition may also underlie {{the perception of}} a single object. Computational models implement object perception as competition between units {{on opposite sides of}} a border. The border is assigned to the winning side, which is perceived as an object (or “figure”), whereas the other side is perceived as a shapeless ground. Behavioral experiments suggest that the ground is inhibited to a degree that depends {{on the extent to which}} it competed for <b>object</b> <b>status,</b> and that this inhibition is relayed to low-level brain areas. Here, we used fMRI to assess activation for ground regions of task-irrelevant novel silhouettes presented in the left or right visual field (LVF or RVF) while participants performed a difficult task at fixation. Silhouettes were designed so that the insides would win the competition for <b>object</b> <b>status.</b> The outsides (grounds) suggested portions of familiar objects in half of the silhouettes and novel objects in the other half. Because matches to object memories affect the competition, these two types of silhouettes operationalized, respectively, high competition and low competition from the grounds. The results showed that activation corresponding to ground regions was reduced for high- versus low-competition silhouettes in V 4, where receptive fields (RFs) are large enough to encompass the familiar objects in the grounds, and in V 1 /V 2, where RFs are much smaller. These results support a theory of object perception involving competition-mediated ground suppression and feedback from higher to lower levels. This pattern of results was observed in the left hemisphere (RVF), but not in the right hemisphere (LVF). One explanation of the lateralized findings is that task-irrelevant silhouettes in the RVF captured attention, allowing us to observe these effects, whereas those in the LVF did not. Experiment 2 provided preliminary behavioral evidence consistent with this possibility...|$|E

Thus, we argue that the syntactic status of the oblique subject-like NPs has not changed at all from <b>object</b> <b>status</b> to subject status, contra standard claims in the literature. Our evidence stems from Old Icelandic, but the analysis has implications for the other old Germanic languages as well.

30|$|Time scales {{can be used}} to {{describe}} different natural phenomena in our real world and most changes in nature are inundated with periodic and almost periodic natural phenomena, so almost periodic problems of functional dynamic equations are important (see [8 – 13]) (typical examples are time intervals around a celestial body motion, the climate change during a year, the frequency of a tidal flood or an earthquake, etc.). We always study periodic or almost periodic problems assuming that the time scale T is periodic, that is, we always suppose the functions that describe the <b>status</b> of the <b>object</b> are periodic or almost periodic on periodic time scales (i.e., the <b>status</b> of the <b>object</b> is the same or almost the same after an accurately chosen interval; see [14] and its references). However, this is not always the case. Since the <b>status</b> of the <b>object</b> is frequently disturbed by its immediate state, the <b>object’s</b> <b>status</b> is not always the same or almost the same after a precisely equal time interval. In fact frequently the <b>object’s</b> <b>status</b> with periodicity or almost periodicity will be always the same or almost the same after ‘an almost equivalent time interval’, and we say the object has ‘double almost periodicity’. To describe such a situation, recently, the authors introduced a type of time scales called ‘almost periodic time scales’ which can be adopted to accurately describe the status of the assigned object which is almost the same after an almost equivalent time interval (see [15 – 17]), and the authors studied the almost periodic dynamical behavior of impulsive delay dynamic models on almost periodic time scales.|$|R

Nominal groups that function as Complement in the role traditionally referred to as the direct object may be marked or unmarked for definiteness.

First, fractionated spacecraft nomenclature and architecture are clarified, and assessment criteria are analyzed. The {{mean and standard}} deviation of risk adjusted lifecycle cost and net present value (NPV) are defined as assessment metrics. Second, fractionated spacecraft sizing models are briefly described, followed by detailed discussion on risk adjusted lifecycle cost and NPV models. Third, uncertainty sources over fractionated spacecraft lifecycle are analyzed and modeled with probability theory. Then the chronological lifecycle simulation process is expounded, and simulation modules are developed with object oriented methodology to build up the assessment tool. The preceding uncertainty models are integrated in these simulation modules, hence the random <b>object</b> <b>status</b> can be simulated and evolve with lifecycle timeline. A case study to investigate the fractionated spacecraft for a hypothetical earth observation mission is carried out with the proposed assessment tool, and the results show that fractionation degree and launch manifest have great influence on cost and NPV, and generally fractionated spacecraft is more advanced than its monolithic counterpart under uncertainty effect.
