40|$|The {{attached}} report describes {{findings from}} {{the administration of the}} Eleventh Annual Customer Survey in Broward County Public Schools (BCPS) during the 2004 - 05 school year. Notably, one major finding revealed in the report was that 82. 9 % of BCPS teachers, 63. 7 % of students, and 85. 6 % of parents rated their schools with an “A ” or “B ” grade. The Eleventh Annual Customer Survey involved the second year <b>online</b> <b>administration</b> of the Teacher Survey to all district teachers, as well as the first year <b>online</b> <b>administration</b> of the Student Survey to students in grades 3 through 12. In addition, 619 school level administrators completed the survey for the first time. Compared to last year’s response rates, this year’s student response rate decreased from 80. 3 % to 76. 2 %, the teacher response rate decreased from 75. 2 % to 63. 7 %, and the parent response rate increased from 36. 3 % to 38. 3 %. Observed decreases in teacher and student response rates may have been due to the implementation of the <b>online</b> <b>administration.</b> Some schools reported difficulties in surveying all their students during the administration window, {{due to a lack of}} sufficient number of computers. For the upcoming Twelfth Annual Customer Survey administration, high schools will have the option to choose between an online survey administration or a paper and pencil survey administration format.

Does the complexity of a choice task affect reliability and comparability? We answered these questions in a test-retest study.

Students in the low task complexity condition choose between pairs of jobs described by six attributes; students in the high task complexity condition choose between pairs of jobs described by ten attributes. To assess reliability or comparability, we used the number of choices in agreement between test and retest. We observed high reliability and comparability across methods of administration and levels of task complexity...|$|E

While it is not known how the transition from PPT to CBT will impact all RBAs, our findings provide strong evidence that two of the most common concerns with digitizing low-stakes RBAs—shifts in student participation and performance—were not borne out by the data.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional pilot study of the ASTHMA-CAT 2 ̆ 7 s administrative feasibility in a disease management population. METHODS: The ASTHMA-CAT included a dynamic or static Asthma Impact Survey (AIS), Asthma Control Test, and SF- 8 Health Survey. A sample of clinician-diagnosed adult asthmatic patients (N = 114) completed the ASTHMA-CAT. Results were used to evaluate administrative feasibility of the instrument and psychometric performance of the dynamic AIS relative to the static AIS. A prototype aggregate (group-level) report was developed and reviewed by care providers. RESULTS: <b>Online</b> <b>administration</b> of the ASTHMA-CAT was feasible for patients in disease management. The dynamic AIS functioned well compared with the static AIS in preliminary studies evaluating response burden, precision, and validity.

All of these tasks can be easily completed by online platforms, leaving instructors with more time to focus on using the results of the assessments to inform their instruction. Simplifying the process of collecting and analyzing RBA data may lead more instructors to gather this information. By facilitating instructors’ examination of their students’ outcomes, online platforms may also lead more instructors to start using research-based teaching practices that have been shown to improve student outcomes.|$|R
