40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} is to {{describe}} new connections between representation theory and algebraic combinatorics on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> and <b>probability</b> theory on the other side. The central result is a construction, by essentially algebraic tools, {{of a family of}} Markov processes. The common state space of these processes is an infinite dimensional (but locally compact) space Omega. It arises in representation theory as the space of indecomposable characters of the infinite-dimensional unitary group U(infinity). Alternatively, Omega can be defined in combinatorial terms as the boundary of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph [...] - an infinite graded graph that encodes the classical branching rule for characters of the compact unitary groups U(N). We also discuss two other topics concerning the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph: (1) Computation of the number of trapezoidal Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes (one could also say, the number of integral points in a truncated Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope). The formula we obtain is well suited for asymptotic analysis. (2) A degeneration procedure relating the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph to the Young graph by means of a new combinatorial object, the Young bouquet. At the end we discuss a few related works and further developments. Comment: Extended version of invited sectional lecture at ICM 2014, Seou...|$|R
50|$|The {{reason this}} process {{produces}} a fair {{result is that}} the probability of getting heads and then tails must be the same as the probability of getting tails and then heads, as the coin is not changing its bias between flips and the two flips are independent. This works only if getting one result on a trial doesn't change the bias on subsequent trials, which is the case for most non-malleable coins (but not for processes such as the Polya urn). By excluding the events of two heads and two tails by repeating the procedure, the coin flipper is left with the only two remaining outcomes having equivalent probability. This procedure only works if the tosses are paired properly; if part of a pair is reused in another pair, the fairness may be ruined. Also, the coin must not be so biased that <b>one</b> <b>side</b> has a <b>probability</b> of zero.|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} a simple model {{to show that}} the variability of nest structures in the social wasp genus Polistes could result from a simple algorithm modulated by a single parameter. The interplay between the simple algorithm and the geometry of the nest structure resulted in isotropic growth. New construction {{on the sides of the}} comb was initiated according to the size of the sides. Due to the geometry of the comb a new rule emerged: if <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the structure is extended, it decreases the chance that that side will be further extended in the next step (because the number of possible initiation positions decreases), but at the same time construction on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> increases the <b>probability</b> of the extension of that side's neighbours (because their possible initiation positions increase). This emergent isotropic growth keeps the nest almost circular, regardless of nest size, and it ensures well-centred nests. Eccentric nests reflect differences in initiation preference towards particular sides of the previously built structure. Interplay between structural constraints and the simple behavioural algorithm, which is governed by both structural and 'external' information, resulted in nests of different shapes. The model was a good predictor of the range of Polistes nest forms found in nature...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the spread}} is {{intended}} to create {{an equal number of}} wagers on either <b>side,</b> the implied <b>probability</b> is 50% for both sides of the wager. To profit, the bookmaker must pay <b>one</b> <b>side</b> (or both sides) less than this notional amount. In practice, spreads may be perceived as slightly favoring <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> and bookmakers often revise their odds to manage their event risk.|$|R
