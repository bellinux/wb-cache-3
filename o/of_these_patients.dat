5|$|As the autobodies {{are found}} mainly in {{patients}} that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases, the clinical symptoms <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> can vary widely. The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical {{symptoms of the}} individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and scleroderma. Treatment <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, and a number <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E

5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E

25|$|The general {{prognosis}} for PNP is poor. It is more hopeful if the tumor is benign, {{but in the}} case of malignant tumors, the mortality rate is roughly 90%. The two most commonly associated types of tumors are non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma; nearly all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> die within two years of diagnosis. This is attributed to the effects of the tumor combined with the negative side effects of the medication administered to treat PNP.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009 a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the U.S. Senate, 565 and in the House, H.R. 1458 that will extend Medicare coverage of the drugs {{for as long as the}} patient has a functioning transplant.

25|$|A {{study from}} Sweden in 2002 {{attempted}} {{to follow up}} 18 patients for approximately 2 years after having been previously diagnosed with awareness under anesthesia. Four of the nine interviewed patients were still severely disabled due to psychiatric/psychological after-effects. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> had experienced anxiety {{during the period of}} awareness, but only one had stated feeling pain. Another three patients had less severe, transient mental symptoms, although they could cope with these in daily life. Two patients denied any lasting effects from their awareness episode.|$|E
25|$|In the {{dopamine}} {{hypothesis of}} schizophrenia, schizophrenia was hypothesised {{to be caused}} by disturbed dopamine neurotransmission. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter which is involved in other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. There is evidence for increased activity of the mesolimbic pathway, a dopaminergic pathway, in schizophrenia patients. This comes from the discovery of increased L-DOPA decarboxylase levels in the brains <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b> L-DOPA decarboxylase is an enzyme which converts L-DOPA to dopamine by removing a carboxyl group. Animal models were first produced for schizophrenia by altering the dopaminergic system using drugs.|$|E
25|$|People with {{a history}} of head and neck cancer are known to be at higher risk (about 25%) of {{developing}} a second cancer of the head, neck, or lung. This is mainly because in a significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients,</b> the aerodigestive tract and lung epithelium have been exposed chronically to the carcinogenic effects of alcohol and tobacco. In this situation, a field change effect may occur, where the epithelial tissues start to become diffusely dysplastic with a reduced threshold for malignant change.

25|$|Expressive aphasia: Patients {{who suffer}} from this {{condition}} typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex. These patients are described with having severe syntactical deficits, {{which means that they}} have extreme difficulty in forming sentences correctly. Expressive aphasic patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients.

25|$|Ophthalmoplegia or the {{inability}} or difficulty {{to move the}} eye is usually symmetrical. As such, double vision is sometimes a complaint <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b> The progressive ophthalmoplegia is often unnoticed till decreased ocular motility limits peripheral vision. Often someone else will point out the ocular disturbance to the patient.

All directions of gaze are affected; however, downward gaze appears to be best spared. This is in contrast to progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which typically affects vertical gaze and spares horizontal gaze.|$|E

40|$|AbstractExocrine {{pancreatic}} insufficiency (EPI) {{resulting from}} {{conditions such as}} chronic pancreatitis (CP), acute pancreatitis (AP) and upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery increases risk for malnutrition and metabolic problems. Poor nutrition is associated with more complications and higher mortality. Therefore, effective nutritional management should be a high priority in <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b> In CP, poor nutrition {{has been shown to}} significantly affect quality of life and functional status. Clinical study data show that dietary counselling combined with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is effective in improving nutritional status and is therefore recommended in <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b> In AP, early enteral nutrition reduces complications and mortality. However, EPI persists in many cases after the resolution <b>of</b> AP; <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> remain at increased risk for malnutrition and require further nutritional support. In patients undergoing surgery, preoperative weight loss is a risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality; outcomes can be improved considerably by preoperative screening to identify high-risk patients and by providing appropriate perioperative nutritional support. Pre- and perioperative enteral nutrition are cost-effective interventions that can improve outcomes in patients undergoing GI surgery. In all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>patient</b> populations, nutritional management, including risk assessment and individualized nutritional support, is a key component of an effective multimodal therapeutic approach...|$|R
