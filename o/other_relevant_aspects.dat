40|$|Abstract The Industrial Engineering {{undergraduate}} program {{offered at}} the University of Brasília was structured on Project Based Learning (PBL) methodology. This innovative educational proposal allows the students to deploy their technical competencies through real problem solving situations. The methodology also stimulates {{the development of the}} students’ soft skills, by exposing them to a challenging environment. At the end of each project, the results are presented to an external agent, and are subsequently implemented. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the evolution of the PSP courses, which adopt as guidelines both the PMBOK project management framework, as well as content from specific technical courses related to the project’s subject. One <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>aspect</b> of the PSP courses is their involvement of both undergraduate and graduate students from different Engineering areas, such as Industrial, Mechanical and Civil Engineering, which serves to foster a more holistic and integrated problem-solving skillset...|$|R
50|$|In psychology, {{centration}} is {{the tendency}} to focus on one salient aspect of a situation and neglect <b>other,</b> possibly <b>relevant</b> <b>aspects.</b> Introduced by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget through his cognitive-developmental stage theory, centration is a behaviour often demonstrated in the preoperational stage. Piaget claimed that egocentrism, a common element responsible for preoperational children’s unsystematic thinking, was causal to centration. Research on centration has primarily been made by Piaget, shown through his conservation tasks, while contemporary researchers have expanded on his ideas.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} e¤ect of large cash {{transfers}} on {{the consumption of}} food by poor households in rural Mexico.

We estimate an Engel curve for food. We rule out price increases, changes in the quality of food consumed and homotheticity of preferences as explanations for this puzzle.

In the present work, FE analyses of TAV implantation and function have been performed with the aim of investigating the influence of the calcifications of the aortic valve leaflets on TAV performances. Results suggest that the degree and location of calcifications could influence post-implanted TAV configuration as well as TAV-aortic root interactions and TAV dynamics.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of cheap excuses in product choice. If a product {{improves}} upon one ethically relevant dimension, agents may care less about other independent ethical facets of the product. Opting for a product that fulfills one ethical aspect may thus suffice for keeping a high moral self-image in agents, and render it easier to ignore <b>other</b> ethically <b>relevant</b> <b>aspects</b> they would otherwise care about. The use of such cheap excuses could thus lead to a 'static moral self-licensing' effect. This would extend {{the logic of the}} well-known moral self-licensing over time. Our experimental study provides empirical evidence that the static counterpart of moral self-licensing exists. Furthermore, effects spill over to unrelated, ethically relevant contexts later in time. Thus, static moral self-licensing and moral self-licensing over time can amplify each other. Outsiders, though monetarily incentivized for correct estimates, are completely oblivious to the effects of moral selflicensing, both, static and over time...|$|R

Several studies have concluded that there are already unsatisfied demands for communications services in the Arctic, and that adequate solutions must be developed to  meet current and future requirements. Coverage of high-latitude regions (north of, say, 70 º degrees) is not possible (or is seriously limited) from the geostationary orbit. On the other hand, low-altitude orbits require large constellations. In previous investigations (Fantino et al. 2013, Fantino et al. 2015),a family of eccentric, highly-inclined geosyncronous orbits has been proposed and the maintenance (i. e., orbit station keeping) requirements have been analysed.  Once the mission is concluded, the long-term, uncontrolled orbital evolution of these orbits inevitably makes them cross the geostationary ring, with consequent high collision danger for the many telecommunications satellites operating at such altitudes. As a result, a disposal strategy is mandatory and, in agreement with current international space policy, should be conceived and detailed {{as part of the}} mission design.

Furthermore, the growing commercial interest in extending satellite telecommunications service to the high latitude regions gives the study a clear projection into the future of space exploitation. The study aims at identifying and evaluating alternative options for satellite end-of-life disposal from an eccentric highly-inclined geosynchronous orbit.
