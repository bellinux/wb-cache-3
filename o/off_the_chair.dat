25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E

Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] {{was released on}} 10 October 2015. The video takes place at a school dance, where {{a professor in the}} hall (the same man who appeared in their previous single's video [...] "Black Magic") tells everyone that it is the last dance. Jade, Leigh-Anne, Jesy and Perrie are waiting for their dates to arrive. Scenes of the girls waiting for their date are intercut throughout the video of them sitting at a table while all of the other couples are dancing. Unbeknownst to them, the man, played by Hector David Junior, has invited each of them to go to the dance after meeting them in different situations prior to that night. He asked Jade by picking her up in his car to go on a date. As she gets in, he invites her to be his date at the dance and presents her with a corsage to wear on her wrist on the night. He mets Leigh-Anne at a high school basketball game, where she and her girlfriends were watching him and some other boys play on the court. He sees that she is infatuated by how good he is at the sport, walks up to her, and asks her to be his date by giving her a corsage. He asked Jesy to be his date while they were at the cinema as they shared a bucket of popcorn. As he gives her the corsage, she throws the bucket over her shoulder and eagerly jumps on his lap, causing them to fall <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
25|$|The average Egyptian family seldom had chairs, {{and if they}} did, it {{was usually}} only {{the master of the}} {{household}} who sat on a <b>chair.</b> Among <b>the</b> better <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> might be painted to look like the ornate inlaid and carved <b>chairs</b> of <b>the</b> rich, but the craftsmanship was usually poor.|$|R
50|$|When Sauvage {{first started}} {{competing}} in wheelchair racing, <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> all had four wheels and {{were similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> that they used <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track. <b>The</b> <b>chairs</b> {{did not have any}} form of steering. The front wheels were smaller than the back wheels, and when at high speed, they were prone to wobbling. By 1997, racing wheelchairs had basically finished undergoing massive changes to improve them.|$|R

All <b>the</b> covers were <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs,</b> <b>the</b> chandeliers {{taken out of the}} bags, the damask {{curtains}} uncovered, the work and things carried away, and the handsomest albums on the tables. Angelica had her hair in papers: in a word, it was evident {{there was going to be}} a party.|$|R

25|$|Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, {{and stone}} {{represent}} {{those who lost}} their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each.

5000|$|Booth {{is known}} for {{introducing}} {{one of the first}} powered vacuum cleaners. Before Booth introduced his version of the vacuum cleaner, cleaning machines blew or brushed dirt away, instead of sucking it up. As Booth recalled decades later, in 1901 he attended [...] "a demonstration of an American machine by its inventor" [...] at the Empire Music Hall in London. The inventor is not named, but Booth's description of the machine conforms fairly closely to American inventor John S. Thurman blown air design. Booth watched a demonstration of the device, which blew dust <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs,</b> and thought that [...] "...if the system could be reversed, and a filter inserted between the suction apparatus and the outside air, whereby the dust would be retained in a receptacle, the real solution of the hygienic removal of dust would be obtained." [...] He tested the idea by laying a handkerchief on the seat of a restaurant chair, putting his mouth to the handkerchief, and then trying to suck up as much dust as he could onto the handkerchief. Upon seeing the dust and dirt collected {{on the underside of the}} handkerchief, he realized the idea could work.|$|R

There also are hiking trails, and horse riding is permitted everywhere except on the mountain bike trails.

This area is most easily accessed via <b>the</b> Eagle Triple <b>Chair,</b> from <b>the</b> Peabody Base Area. The Brookside learning area, a beginner skiing area, is segregated {{from the rest of}} the mountain. It is serviced by its own triple chairlift as well as two surface lifts.

60|$|Marston was wakened by a lurch that {{threw him}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and getting up stiffly {{he noted the}} sharp slant of deck.

60|$|Mortimer {{had been}} bending forward solicitously. He overbalanced and nearly fell <b>off</b> his <b>chair.</b> <b>The</b> shock had been stunning.

6000|$|The same {{observation}} {{will apply}} mutatis mutandis to Mr. Jones, who {{is built on}} a much slenderer connection. Mr. Jones (or whatever his name was) did not drift away from me. He {{turned his back on}} me {{and walked out of the}} room. It was in a little hotel in the island of St. Thomas in the West Indies (in the year '75) where we found him one hot afternoon extended on three chairs, all alone in the loud buzzing of flies to which his immobility and his cadaverous aspect gave a most gruesome significance. Our invasion must have displeased him because he got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> brusquely and walked out, leaving with me an indelibly weird impression of his thin shanks. One of the men with me said that the fellow was the most desperate gambler he had ever come across. I said: [...] "A professional sharper?" [...] and got for an answer: [...] "He's a terror; but I must say that up to a certain point he will play fair. [...] ." [...] I wonder what the point was. I never saw him again because I believe he went straight on board a mail-boat which left within the hour for other ports of call in the direction of Aspinall. Mr. Jones's characteristic insolence belongs to another man of a quite different type. I will say nothing as to the origins of his mentality because I don't intend to make any damaging admissions.|$|R
