5|$|In {{addition}} to CAP's own corporate fleet, many member-owned aircraft are {{made available for}} official tasking by CAP's volunteers should the need arise.

Additionally, the mission scanner may double as a satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage.
