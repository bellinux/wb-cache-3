25|$|Vertigo*, {{better known}} as {{vestibular}} disease* in dogs, is an uncommon condition in older dogs. Most cases are idiopathic, {{but it can also}} be caused by <b>otitis</b> <b>interna,</b> or inner ear infection, tumors, and encephalitis. Signs include nystagmus, head tilt, circling, vomiting, and falling to one side. Idiopathic vestibular disease will usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.|$|E

40|$|Two {{cases of}} temporohyoid osteoarthropathy (THO) in young Australian horses are described. The {{pathogenesis}} of THO {{is yet to}} be fully elucidated, but current theories include extension of infection from <b>otitis</b> media or <b>interna</b> to the temporohyoid joint or a primary but non-infectious degenerative condition within the temporohyoid joint. The young age of the horses and the unilateral distribution suggested an infectious aetiology. Both horses partially responded to treatment with broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory drugs with concurrent management of ulcerative keratitis. The management of violent head shaking in one horse included the administration of gabapentin, an anticonvulsant known to have antihyperalgesic effects and reduce neuropathic pain...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -year-old {{castrated}} male {{domestic shorthair}} cat {{was referred to}} the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) Emergency Service for evaluation after a 2 -week history of a worsening head tilt, severe ataxia, lethargy, unilateral facial nerve paralysis, and a 2 -day history of anorexia and adipsia. Neurologic deficits and obtundation localized the lesion to his brainstem. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large contrast enhancing lesion extending from the right middle and inner ear into the caudal fossa causing deviation of the brainstem laterally. There was also evidence of mild cerebellar herniation and <b>otitis</b> media and <b>interna</b> bilaterally. The cat was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and underwent bilateral tympanic bulla osteotomies. He did well post-operatively and was discharged 8 days after admission with dramatic improvement. Multiple rechecks and a repeat MRI revealed continued improvement in the months postoperatively. The diagnostic workup, treatment, and prognosis of this catâ€™s brainstem lesion will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Twenty-eight histologically {{confirmed}} {{cases of}} porcine leptomeningitis were examined retro-spectively, with {{focus on the}} pathology of the inner and middle ear, brain, and vestibulocochlear nerve. Tissues were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry for Streptococcus suis serotype 2 antigen, and the bacteriologic results were recorded. Exudative <b>otitis</b> <b>interna</b> was diagnosed in 20 / 28 pigs (71 %). The lesions primarily affected the perilymphatic ducts, with consistent involvement of the scala tympani. Perineuritis of the vestibulocochlear nerve was seen in all but four of the ears affected with <b>otitis</b> <b>interna.</b> Immunohistochemically, S. suis serotype 2 antigen was demonstrated in the leptomeningeal, perineural, and labyrinthine exudates in 11 cases. Otitis media was diagnosed in 10 / 28 pigs (34 %), but evidence of extension to the inner ear was not observed. The findings were highly similar to descriptions of meningogenic labyrinthitis in humans and in laboratory animal models. <b>Otitis</b> <b>interna</b> in pigs can also develop via the meningogenic route and is not always, as generally stated, tympanogenic.

40|$|Herpes simplex {{encephalitis}} (HSE) is {{the most}} frequent cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis in the Western world. Definitive diagnosis by viral PCR of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and treatment with aciclovir have improved the prognosis significantly. Nevertheless, the condition is rare and presents with non-specific symptoms that can easily be mistaken for systemic infection or non-infective encephalopathy. We report a case of HSE which was not recognised by four separate doctors, leading to substantial delay in diagnosis and treatment. Our patient presented with fever, headaches, altered behaviour and generalised bradykinesia. This was initially diagnosed as <b>otitis</b> <b>interna</b> (labyrinthitis) and, subsequently, an ischaemic stroke. There was a delay of 10 days in the initiation of aciclovir from symptom onset. MRI and CSF PCR confirmed herpes simplex virus type- 1 (HSV- 1) infection. The patient improved on aciclovir, but is disabled with word-finding difficulties and cognitive slowing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{pathologic}} and bacteriologic {{study on}} otitis media in swine {{was performed on}} 237 swine, {{ranging in age from}} 1 day to 1 year. These 237 swine from eight selected farms were slaughtered due to unfavorable prognosis associated with clinical signs of illness. One hundred sixty-three (68. 8 %) of the 237 swine were found to be affected with otitis, though only a few swine showed clinical signs characteristic of the disease. One hundred fifty-one (63. 7 %), 53 (22. 4 %), and 39 (16. 5 %) had lesions in the middle, external, and internal ear, respectively. Of the 15 1 cases with otitis media, bilateral and unilateral infection accounted for 114 (75. 5 %) and 37 (24. 5 %), respectively. Only 5 / 53 swine with otitis externa and 6 / 39 swine with <b>otitis</b> <b>interna</b> failed to show otitis media. All swine with infection in the tympanic cavity had inflammatory lesions in the auditory tube. Examination of the swine grouped by age revealed that, regardless of age, incidence of otitis media was 50 - 70 %. In swine younger than 1 month old, otitis media tended to center on the auditory tube, where a mild infiltration of neutrophils into the mucous membrane was frequent. Thereafter, otitis media increased in degree and extent with age. Forty (26. 5 %) of the 15 1 swine affected with otitis media were accompanied by a substantial amount of inflammatory exudate in the tympanic cavity and bulla. Purulent exudate was found in 20 / 40 (50 %) swine. Severe otitis media prevailed in swine between 1 and 4 months of age, showing inspissation of a suppurative exudate in the tympanic cavity and lysis of the underlying osseous wall of the tympanic bulla with subsequen...|$|E
