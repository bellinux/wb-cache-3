He developed and sold film projects to other producers and studios, and arranged loan outs of his contracted artists. Without outside backers he formed David O. Selznick Productions, Inc., which in 1941 became owner of <b>one-fourth</b> <b>of</b> United Artists.|$|E
5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share of the settlement totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed {{that half of the}} settlement be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops. <b>One-fourth</b> <b>of</b> the money would support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, a cause important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E

There are eleven tracks on the album, with origins illustrating death and destruction, war, serial killers, and the Apocalypse. It is the band's first studio album {{to be played}} mostly in E-flat tuning since Divine Intervention. World Painted Blood is the last Slayer album to feature the band's original lineup, as drummer Dave Lombardo was fired from the band and guitarist Jeff Hanneman died of alcohol-related cirrhosis, both in 2013. It also the band's final album to be released through American Recordings.|$|E
5|$|Very heavy {{strategic}} bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing {{synthetic oil}} and gasoline {{as well as}} the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals. The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was no longer possible. Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to <b>one-fourth</b> <b>of</b> its manpower and industry into anti-aircraft resources, which very likely shortened the war.|$|E
5|$|The Liberian open registry, {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a {{corporate}} structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that <b>one-fourth</b> <b>of</b> its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E

5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 {{million barrels per day}} despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than <b>one-fourth</b> <b>of</b> its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E
5|$|As North Korean {{soldiers}} advanced, {{they began}} to envelop both A and B Companies, and 30 minutes after the first shots were fired, both companies were ordered to withdraw, one platoon at a time. C Company, kept in reserve during the engagement, retreated without coming in contact with North Korean forces. A Company, under the heaviest attack, attempted a gradual withdrawal which quickly became disorderly, as men ran from the hill, some without weapons and ammunition, being strafed by North Korean machine guns the entire time. Panic quickly overtook {{many of the men}} of the battalion, and they started running past the designated rally points, all the way to Pyongtaek. Others, too scared to retreat, remained in their foxholes and were captured by the North Korean forces. One officer attempted to stay behind and search for survivors, before he and three others were allegedly captured and executed by North Korean forces. Company commanders gathered what men they could and began moving south, though <b>one-fourth</b> <b>of</b> 1st Battalion was killed, missing or captured immediately after the brief fight. The retreating elements left a trail of equipment behind, littering the road back to Pyongtaek with ammunition, helmets, and rain gear. In the disorderly retreat one platoon from A Company was left behind, and had to retreat through a railway for cover.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the company's deteriorating {{financial}} situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar would subsequently accede to president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a net loss of ¥43.3 billion (US$327.8 million) and a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 (Magic Knight Rayearth being the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and on September 9, 1999 in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and the company announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or nearly <b>one-fourth</b> <b>of</b> its workforce.|$|E
