40|$|The {{dispersion}} performances <b>of</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>powders</b> {{are often}} tested at only one inhalation {{flow rate in}} mechanistic formulation studies. This limited approach is challenged by studies showing that interactions exist between inhalation flow rate and the effects on dispersion performance of several formulation variables. In this note we explain that such interactions with inhalation flow rate are, in fact, always to be expected. Because these interactions may greatly affect conclusions concerning the effects of formulation variables and their underlying mechanisms, the utility of future dry powder inhalation formulation studies may benefit from an approach in which dispersion performance is by default tested over a range of inhalation flow rates.

40|$|Air {{classifier}} technology (ACT) {{is introduced}} {{as part of}} formulation integrated dry powder inhaler development (FIDPI) to optimise the de-agglomeration <b>of</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>powders.</b> Carrier retention and de-agglomeration results obtained with a basic classifier concept are discussed. The theoretical cut-off diameter for lactose of the classifier used, is between 35 and 15 μm for flow rates ranging from 20 to 70 l/min. Carrier retention of narrow size fractions is higher than 80 % for flow rates between 30 and 60 l/min, inhalation times up to 6 s and classifier payloads between 0 and 30 mg. The de-agglomeration efficiency for adhesive mixtures, derived from carrier residue (CR) measurement, increases both with increasing flow rate and inhalation time. At 30 l/min, 60 % fine particle detachment can be obtained within 3 s circulation time, whereas at 60 l/min only 0. 5 s is necessary to release more than 70 %. More detailed information of the change of detachment rate within the first 0. 5 s of inhalation is obtained from laser diffraction analysis (LDA) of the aerosol cloud. The experimental results can be explained with a novel force distribution concept (FDC) which is introduced {{to better understand the}} complex effects of mixing and inhalation parameters on the size distributions of adhesion and removal forces and their relevance to the de-agglomeration in the classifier. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Drug {{particles}} can {{be produced}} in the proper aerodynamic particle size distribution (PSD) for inhalation by techniques such as micronisation or spray drying (1 – 5 [*]µm). However, mixing with coarse carrier particles may change the PSD by agglomeration. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the drug particles on the carrier particles in adhesive mixtures is highly relevant to the dispersion performance <b>of</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>powders.</b> Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy is capable of chemically selective imaging, allowing the distribution of drug particles {{on the surface of}} carrier particles to be visualised. We used CARS microscopy to image the drug distribution for budesonide and salmeterol on the surface of lactose carrier particles. Image analysis was performed to determine the drug PSD that was then compared with the PSD obtained from laser diffraction. Additionally, comparative CARS and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded to allow a direct comparison of the images obtained from CARS microscopy and from SEM. CARS microscopy revealed the drug to be in clusters {{on the surface of the}} carrier particles, while the image analysis identified 68 % of the particles to have a median area of 0. 4 [*]µm 2. Image analysis resulted in measurement of larger particles than laser diffraction, which may be caused by agglomeration during mixing. The combined chemical and morphological information from comparative CARS and SEM analysis resulted in unambiguous identification of the spatial drug distribution over the carrier surface.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of formulation excipients on physical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>inhalation</b> dry <b>powders</b> prepared by spray-drying. The excipients used were a series of amino acids (glycine, alanine, leucine, isoleucine), trehalose and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The particle diameter and the powder density were assessed by laser diffraction and tap density measurements, respectively. The aerosol behaviour of the powders was studied in a Multi-Stage Liquid Impinger. The nature and the relative proportion of the excipients affected the aerosol performance of the powders, mainly by altering powder tap density and degree of particle aggregation. The alanine/trehalose/DPPC (30 / 10 / 60 w/w/w) formulation showed optimal aerodynamic behaviour with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 4. 7 mum, an emitted dose of 94 % and a fine particle fraction of 54 % at an airflow rate of 100 L/min using a Spinhaler inhaler device. The powder had a tap density of 0. 10 g/cm(3). The particles were spherical with a granular surface and had a 4 mum volume median diameter. In conclusion, optimization of the aerosolization properties <b>of</b> <b>inhalation</b> dry <b>powders</b> could be achieved by appropriately selecting the composition of the particles...|$|R

It is found that FP (- 11. 5 kcal/mol) has a higher cohesive strength than Bud (- 9. 9 kcal/mol) or SB (- 7. 8 kcal/mol). The prediction correlated directly to cohesive strength measurements using laser diffraction, where the airflow pressure required for complete dispersion (CPP) was 3. 5, 2. 0, and 1. 0 bar for FP, Bud, and SB, respectively. The highest cohesive strength was predicted for LMH (- 15. 9 kcal/mol), which did not correlate with the CPP value of 2. 0 bar (i. e., ranking lower than FP). High FP-LMH adhesive forces (- 11. 7 kcal/mol) were predicted. However, aerosolization studies revealed that the FP-LMH blends consisted of agglomerated FP particles with a large median diameter (∼ 4 - 5 μm) that were not disrupted by LMH. Modeling of the crystal and surface chemistry of LMH identified high electrostatic and H-bond components of its cohesive energy due {{to the presence of}} water and hydroxyl groups in lactose, unlike the APIs. A direct comparison of the predicted and measured cohesive balance of LMH with APIs will require a more in-depth understanding of highly hydrogen-bonded systems with respect to the synthonic engineering modeling tool, as well as the influence of agglomerate structure on surface-surface contact geometry.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of formulation excipients and physical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>inhalation</b> particles on their in vitro aerosolization performance, and thereby to maximize their respirable fraction. Dry powders were produced by spray-drying using excipients that are FDA-approved for inhalation as lactose, materials that are endogenous to the lungs as albumin and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC); and/or protein stabilizers as trehalose or mannitol. Dry powders suitable for deep lung deposition, i. e. with an aerodynamic diameter of individual particles < 3 microm, were prepared. They presented 0. 04 [...] 0. 25 g/cm(3) bulk tap densities, 3 [...] 5 microm geometric particle sizes, up to 90 % emitted doses and 50 % respirable fractions in the Andersen cascade impactor using a Spinhaler inhaler device.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were (i) to validate electrical zone sensing and laser diffraction {{for the analysis of}} primary particle size in the case <b>of</b> <b>inhalation</b> dry <b>powders</b> and (ii) to study the influence of the aggregation state of the powder on the sizing techniques. Free-flowing dry powders were prepared by spray-drying with a combination of albumin, lactose, and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. The replacement of lactose by mannitol, the removal of albumin, and the atomization at high relative humidity all increased powder cohesion. Automated measurements were compared with primary particle sizes collected by light and electron microscopy. The mass mode obtained by electrical zone sensing and the mass median diameter measured by laser diffraction following dispersion with compressed air at a pressure of 3 bar or following suspension in water and ultrasonic dispersion at a power of 60 W for 30 s each provided primary particle sizes close to microscopy measurements. However, these conditions only applied in the case of slightly to moderately aggregated powders.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the Multistage Liquid Impinger (MSLI) and the Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI) with respect to their power to predict {{differences}} in side effects of salbutamol delivered by a dry powder inhaler. Three preparations with the same nominal dose and the same inhaler device but generating aerosols with different aerodynamic particle size distributions were administered to six healthy volunteers in a randomized, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study. Cumulative doses from 400 up to 1600 mug were given. The serum potassium level (K+-serum) and the heart rate (HR) were measured at baseline and 15 min after each dose. Both the MSLI and ACI showed large differences between the aerodynamic particle size distributions of the three preparations. The decrease in K+-serum revealed significant differences between the three active preparations and was significant for doses of 800 mug and higher. The FIR results showed differences between the active preparations only at a nominal dose of 1600 mug and only for the preparation with the highest fine particle dose (FPD) compared to the other two preparations. The K+-serum appears to be a more sensitive measure for side effects than the HR, In vivo-in vitro correlations (IVIVCs) were established between the amounts of salbutamol deposited on the various cumulative impactor stages and the K+-serum. The best IVIVCs were obtained in the FPD range, resulting in correlation coefficients of at least 0. 78. It is concluded that cascade impactor results in the FPD range of the MSLI as well as the ACI correlate well with the K+-serum.

Particles were rationally designed and produced by advanced spray-drying particle engineering from an organic solution in closed mode (no water) from dilute solution. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that these particles had both optimal particle morphology and surface morphology, and the particle size distributions were suitable for pulmonary delivery. Comprehensive and systematic physicochemical characterization and in vitro aerosol dispersion performance revealed significant differences between these two fluoroquinolone antibiotics following spray drying as drug aerosols and as cospray-dried antibiotic drug: DPPC aerosols. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and confocal Raman microspectroscopy were employed to probe composition and interactions in the solid state. Spray-dried MOXI was rendered noncrystalline (amorphous) following organic solution advanced spray drying. This was in contrast to spray-dried OFLX, which retained partial crystallinity, as did OFLX:DPPC powders at certain compositions. Aerosol dispersion performance was conducted using inertial impaction with a dry powder inhaler device approved for human use.

Among the remaining patients both formulations gave good protection from exercise induced asthma 15 minutes after inhalation, {{and the effect of}} both wore off steadily over the next 6 hours. The spinhaler gave appreciably better protection than the aerosol at 15 minutes after inhalation, and was the only formulation to provide good protection at 2 hours and 6 hours. The more limited effectiveness of the aerosol may be explained by the lower dose of sodium cromoglycate and the more complicated inhalation technique required...|$|R
40|$|Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) {{are widely}} used to deliver {{respiratory}} medication as a fine powder. This study investigates the physical mechanism of DPI operation, assessing the effects <b>of</b> geometry, <b>inhalation</b> and <b>powder</b> type on dose fluidisation. Patient inhalation through an idealised DPI was simulated as a linearly increasing pressure drop across three powder dose reservoir geometries permitting an analysis of shear and normal forces on dose evacuation. Pressure drop gradients of 3. 3, 10 and 30 kPa s? 1 were applied to four powder types (glass, aluminium, and lactose 6 and 16 % fines) and high speed video of each powder dose fluidisation was recorded and quantitatively analysed. Two distinct mechanisms are identified, labelled ‘fracture’ and ‘erosion’. ‘Fracture’ mode occurs when the initial evacuation occurs in several large agglomerates whilst ‘erosion’ mode occurs gradually, with successive layers being evacuated by the high speed gas flow at the bed/gas interface. The mechanism depends on the powder type, and is independent of the reservoir geometries or pressure drop gradients tested. Both lactose powders exhibit fracture characteristics, while aluminium and glass powders fluidise as an erosion. Further analysis of the four powder types by an annular shear cell showed that the fluidisation mechanism cannot be predicted using bulk powder properties...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation is a {{convenient}} way to deliver drugs to the respiratory tract {{in the treatment}} of respiratory diseases. Different types of devices, such as pressurised metered dose inhalers (p-MDI's), nebulizers or dry powder inhalers (DPI's) are used for the pulmonary delivery of drugs. The present thesis focuses on dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalation.</b> <b>Inhalation</b> technology <b>of</b> <b>inhalation</b> therapy with DPI's is not just the administration of powder to the patient, resulting in a clinical effect.
