50|$|Furthermore, {{peanut oil}} is {{recommended}} as the preferred oil to deep fry a turkey in. Aside from its delicious taste, peanut oil {{is one of}} the healthiest oils. It is a vegetable oil that is naturally trans fat-free, cholesterol free, and low in saturated fats. Peanut oil is high in unsaturated fats, especially monounsaturated fat, like olive oil. It is also a source of the antioxidant, vitamin E and phytosterols, which benefit heart-health. Peanut oil is also a perfect choice for healthier frying because it can be heated to a higher temperature than other oils, and this results in lower <b>oil</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> in the food.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of the oil-absorption {{process in}} deep-fat fried potato {{cylinders}} (frying temperatures of 155 degreesC, 170 degreesC, and 185 degreesC) allowed to distinguish 3 oil fractions: structural oil (absorbed during frying), penetrated surface oil (suctioned during cooling), and surface oil. Results {{showed that a}} small amount of oil penetrates during frying because most of the <b>oil</b> was <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> {{at the end of the}} process, suggesting that oil uptake and water removal are not synchronous phenomena. After cooling, oil was located either on the surface of the chip or suctioned into the porous crust microstructure, with an inverse relationship between them for increasing frying times...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "9.5" [...] {{was unusual}} {{in having a}} four {{cylinder}} engine with overhead camshaft. With a capacity of 1087 cc and made in-house, drive was to the rear wheels through a three speed transmission and at first no differential. The engine had no oil pump with lubrication relying on <b>oil</b> being <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the flywheel and being fed by a gallery to the valve gear. The conventional chassis had quarter elliptic springs all round. Braking was by either a transmission brake or a single drum on the solid rear axle. The original coachwork was described as the [...] "Occasional four" [...] indicating that there was just room to squeeze in two rear seat passengers. The de-luxe [...] "Norwood" [...] tourer model was added in 1923.|$|R
50|$|The use of skimmers in {{industrial}} applications is often required to remove oils, grease and fats prior to further treatment for environmental discharge compliance. By removing {{the top layer}} of oils, water stagnation, smell and unsightly surface scum can be reduced. Placed before an oily water treatment system an oil skimmer may give greater overall oil separation efficiency for improved discharge wastewater quality. It should be noted that all <b>oil</b> skimmers will <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a percentage of water with the oil which will need to be decanted to obtain concentrated oil.|$|R

[...] The main bearings were ball bearings and were splash fed. [...] Engine oil from the gallery was also supplied to the 1 : 2 reduction gearbox at the front. This drove the four-bladed propeller at one half engine speed, and the single camshaft was splined into the rear of the short propeller shaft. [...] This arrangement meant that no mechanical oil pump was needed.|$|R
50|$|Body shells {{are painted}} in a semi-clean {{environment}} using solvent-based paint. Shells are dipped in chemical tanks to cleanse them of any <b>oils</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> on the panels during their manufacture in Body Shop. Once bodies have been dipped and cleansed, they are then immersed in an anti-corrosion paint dip called ED (Electrocoat Dip). This 'dip' coats the entire body, {{both inside and}} outside, and is the first paint coating it will receive. Once the 'dipped' body has been stoved in the ED oven, the body progresses to the 'Sealing' Booth. In this booth, the body has its interior panel joints, floor, tailgate, hood and door edges sealed with a PVC based sealant, to prevent water ingress and corrosion as the car is driven on the road. Also within this zone, sound pads {{are added to the}} floor and boot to reduce road noise (standard practice in the motor industry). The next booth it enters is the 'Underbody' Booth. In this booth, similar to 'Sealing' Booth, the body's wheel arches are sealed using the same PVC based sealant. Robots then apply the underseal to the underfloor and wheel arches. Also robots are used to apply the SGC (Stone Guard Coat) layer to the sills: this coating is designed for abrasion resistance, i.e. preventing stone chips, scuffs, etc. From here, the body proceeds into the Undercoat Oven. The next zone is 'ED Sanding' booth where the body is inspected for any minor imperfections received in the ED Coat. The next zone is the 'Surfacer' Booth, where the body receives its second coat of paint, this being the Surfacer Coat, then into the Surfacer Oven. Next is 'Surfacer Sanding' Booth: the same as ED Sanding, this zone inspects the body for any imperfections <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> within the Surfacer coating. Next comes the 'Topcoat' Booth, where the body receives its final coats of paint, these being Topcoat and Clearcoat layers. After being stoved in the Topcoat oven, the body then enters the 'Touch-up' Booth where the body has its final inspection for any imperfections <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> in the Topcoat process. Once the body leaves here, it then moves on to the PBS (Painted Body Store) above Trim and Chassis to await {{the next step in the}} production process.|$|R
5000|$|Crack cocaine is {{frequently}} purchased already in rock form, {{although it is}} not uncommon for some users to [...] "wash up" [...] or [...] "cook" [...] powder cocaine into crack themselves. This process {{is frequently}} done with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), water, and a spoon. Once mixed and heated, the bicarbonate reacts with the hydrochloride of the powder cocaine, forming free base cocaine and carbonic acid (H2CO3) in a reversible acid-base reaction. The heating accelerates the degradation of carbonic acid into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Loss of CO2 prevents the reaction from reversing back to cocaine hydrochloride. Free base cocaine separates as an oily layer, floating on the top of the now leftover aqueous phase. It is at this point that the <b>oil</b> is <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> rapidly, usually with a pin or long thin object. This pulls the oil up and spins it, allowing air to set and dry the oil, and allows the maker to roll the oil into the rock-like shape.|$|R
50|$|Regarding {{trade with}} Iraq, the United States is its main trading partner, with 40.7 {{percent of the}} total amount traded. The EU is second, with 20.7 percent. The EU is also the second largest {{exporter}} to Iraq. Regarding imports, as Iraqi <b>oil</b> production has <b>picked</b> <b>up,</b> so energy exports to Europe have correspondingly increased. Iraq is now tenth among the major energy supplies to Europe. Iraq is responsible, however, for only 1.4 {{percent of the total}} of European energy imports. There is thus {{a long way to go}} before pre-1991 levels of trade are regained. Trade fell sharply in 1991, before <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> again after the beginning of the oil-for-food program in 1997. By 2001, the EU accounted for 33.3 percent of overall trade and 55 percent of Iraq's imports, after which it began to decrease once again.|$|R
40|$|SOME {{factors that}} {{influence}} albumen quality changes during storage of shell eggs have long been known. Tem-perature control and, to some extent, evaporation control {{have been used as}} methods of preserving quality. Reduction of carbon dioxide loss from the albumen and the prevention of evaporation have been made possible by sealing the shell with oil. Oil processing has been success-ful in reducing albumen liquefaction, but undesirable side effects have been found. Fletcher et al. (1959) report that <b>oil</b> treated eggs <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> foreign flavors readily and that the process tends to lower quality. Swanson (1959) reports that these eggs do not peel well after hard cooking. The relationship between the rise in pH of the albumen and albumen liquefac-tion was reported by Sharp (1929). This rise is caused by release of carbon dioxide from the egg. He found that this could be prevented by holding eggs in an atmos-phere containing higher than normal con-centrations of carbon dioxide or by plac-ing freshly laid eggs in a carbon-dioxide-tight container in which the carbon di-oxide content of the eggs quickly reaches equilibrium with that of the surrounding atmosphere. He also observed marked turbidity of the albumen of oil sealed eggs. Wilhelm (1940) reported improved albumen indexes of eggs stored in sealed mason jars with a vacuum carbon di...|$|R
50|$|The RAF 1 {{was based}} on the Renault 70/80 hp engine, being {{intended}} specifically to replace that engine in the B.E.2c. It featured larger cylinders (3.94 x 5.5 in) for a total displacement of 540 cubic inches (8.8 L). It was rated at 92 hp (70 kW) at 1,600 rpm. The heads were cast integrally with the cylinders, with the intake and exhaust valves set one above the other in an upside-down F-head configuration. The engines featured a large diameter lightweight flywheel at the rear, enclosed in a cast housing. Engine <b>oil</b> was <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> {{from the bottom of the}} crankcase and slung into a reservoir at the top. From there it was gravity fed, via a gallery high on the right side of the engine block, to the main bearing caps, and then to the connecting rod journals by centrifugal effect of the turning crankshaft. The main bearings were ball bearings and were splash fed. Engine oil from the gallery was also supplied to the 1 : 2 reduction gearbox at the front. This drove the four-bladed propeller at one half engine speed, and the single camshaft was splined into the rear of the short propeller shaft. This arrangement meant that no mechanical oil pump was needed.Excess engine oil from the flywheel overflowed the reservoir and trickled over the large surface area of the round flywheel cover. Two passages cast into the cover took air-fuel mixture from the carburettor mounted at the bottom to a copper U-shaped inlet manifold mounted between the banks of cylinders, and the flywheel cover acted as a heat exchanger, preheating the fuel-air. In late 1915, the bore was increased to 4.1 in, leading to an increased displacement of 590 cubic inches (9.7 L) and power of 86 kW (115 hp) at 1,800 rpm.|$|R
