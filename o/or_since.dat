5|$|Achilles was recommissioned in 1901 as a depot ship at Malta under a {{succession}} of different names. She was transferred to Chatham in 1914 and was again renamed multiple times before she was sold for scrap in 1923. Achilles had more changes of her rigging and armament than any other British warship, before <b>or</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the season, {{eleven of}} Sewanee's {{victories}} were against SIAA conference rivals, setting the record for the most conference games won in a single season by any team before <b>or</b> <b>since.</b> On College Gameday, November 13, 1999, ESPN featured the University of the South with a four-minute segment on the 1899 football team, and CSX Railroad provided a short train ride in Cowan, which was a re-enactment of an early leg of the Sewanee to Texas train ride.|$|E
5|$|Forest fires {{seasonally}} {{clear the}} park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth. These fires damage the income generated by tourism. The Summer of Fire saw more resources {{dedicated to the}} subject of wildfire than ever before <b>or</b> <b>since</b> in the United States. The Rim Fire in 2013 destroyed nearly $2 billion in assets and revenue, though natural woodland assets are renewable, and closed off much of the park to tourists. This rim fire was the third largest on record, and burned nearly 500 acres of wild habitat.|$|E

5|$|The {{truth is}} that Puerto Rican liberal {{interests}} benefited directly from the Cánovas assassination, since by Cánovas' death a pact made (previous to the event) between the new Spanish prime minister, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after. It allowed {{the establishment of a}} new autonomy charter for the island territory, which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers {{than at any other time}} before <b>or</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by {{his defeat}} to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became {{a series of}} {{experiments}} which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics {{to a point where}} the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile. His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before <b>or</b> <b>since.</b> Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before <b>or</b> <b>since.</b> Coolidge's second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first president whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio. Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee DeForest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making Coolidge the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds. When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and a sound-on-film record of the event exists.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{is placed}} under guard in quarters. McGivers {{is sent to}} brief him on current events. Taking {{advantage}} of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her he means to rule mankind again and needs her help to take over Enterprise. Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to Botany Bay, where he revives {{the rest of his}} people. They return to Enterprise and assume control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression tank, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his cohorts. Khan escapes the gas and heads to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy Enterprise, but Kirk confronts him and a brawl ensues. Though outmatched by Khan's superior strength, Kirk pulls an odd rod-like tool (never seen before <b>or</b> <b>since,</b> in this episode or the entire series) from a wall and uses it as a club to knock the superman unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943January 17, 2008) was an American chess {{grandmaster}} and {{the eleventh}} World Chess Champion. Many consider {{him to be}} the greatest chess player of all time. In 1972, he captured the World Chess Championship from Boris Spassky of the USSR in a match held in Reykjavík, Iceland, publicized as a Cold War confrontation, which attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before <b>or</b> <b>since.</b> In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, the game's international governing body, over one of the conditions for the match. This allowed Soviet GM Anatoly Karpov, who had won the qualifying Candidates' cycle, to become the new world champion by default under FIDE rules.|$|E
50|$|The DRV {{is located}} and {{registered}} as a non-profit organisation in Hannover and combines the 13 regional unions (Landesverbände) with 11,656 members {{total of which}} 10,023 are male and 1,633 are female players. The 108 registered clubs have 319 referees (as of January 2011).

5|$|When all {{the ballots}} were counted, fewer than 2,000 votes {{separated}} Garfield and Hancock, the closest popular vote of any American presidential election before <b>or</b> <b>since.</b> The voters showed {{their interest in}} the election by turning out in record numbers; 78 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, among largest percentages in American history. Each major party candidate earned just over 48 percent of the vote. Weaver won more than 3 percent, tripling the Greenback total of four years earlier. The other minor party candidates fared far worse, as Dow and Phelps earned 0.1 and 0.01 percent, respectively. The narrow victory carried over into the Congressional vote, as the Republicans won the House by a twelve-seat margin and the Senate was evenly divided. Garfield carried the crucial state of New York by 20,000 votes out of 1.1 million cast there. Other states were much closer; Hancock’s margin of victory in California was only 144 votes.|$|E
5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before <b>or</b> <b>since.</b> In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E
5|$|The current voting format {{introduced}} in 1999 is a positional voting system, {{similar to that}} used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points, which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions <b>or,</b> <b>since</b> 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Each jury award 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2011, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points. The song with the highest number of points {{at the end of the}} voting is the winner.|$|E
