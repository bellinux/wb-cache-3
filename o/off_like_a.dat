25|$|Newspaper opinion editor Michael Young {{posits that}} Halberstam saw Vietnam {{as a moral}} tragedy, with America's hubris {{bringing}} about its downfall.

25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. â€“ John Power.|$|E

25|$|In an {{n-channel}} 'depletion-mode' device, {{a negative}} gate-to-source voltage causes a depletion region {{to expand in}} width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the active region expands to completely close the channel, {{the resistance of the}} channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> switch (see right figure, when there is very small current). This is called 'pinch-off', and the voltage at which it occurs is called the 'pinch-off voltage'. Conversely, a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily (see right figure, when there is a conduction channel and current is large).|$|E
25|$|Asafa {{opened his}} 2011 season on 16 April at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica. He ran the 200m {{where he came}} in third after {{what looked to be}} a good first 140m, slowing down {{significantly}} at {{the last quarter of the}} race. His time was 20.55s for the race behind Yohan Blake and Daniel Bailey. Powell ran his next race was the 4x100m relay USA vs The World at the Penn Relays 2011, on 28 April. He ran the unusual first leg for Jamaica as he blasted <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bullet to give Jamaica the lead. Jamaica won the event in a world leading time of 38.33s, ahead of USA Red and USA Blue teams respectively. He stated after the run that he was in good shape and was looking forward to do great things in the year ahead. Powell next ran the 200m at the Jamaica International Invitational Meet on 7 May. He looked promising in the first 120m, after which he slowed down drastically, finishing in last place with a time of 21.40s, in a race won by Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade. He later stated that he felt a minor pain in his hamstring and he backed off as a precaution, but insisted that it was nothing serious.|$|E
500|$|The single {{was heavily}} {{compared}} to My Bloody Valentine; in their {{review of the}} track, Sputnikmusic stated that it [...] "comes <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> My Bloody Valentine song with intelligible vocals, with a sliding, reverb heavy hook and pummeling drums", while AllMusic writer Jack Rabid drew similar comparisons. Patrick Carmosino of West Net stated that with [...] "You Don't Know Anything", Ivy [...] "have an indie-ethic rock side that compliments their pop sensibilities to the tee".|$|E

When {{the list was}} revised in 2012, to {{accommodate}} a number of albums released since 2003, the album was repositioned at number 364. Stereogum named it the Doors' second best album, with the website's Ryan Leas adding, [...] "It traveled the same raw blues-rock lane as its predecessor, but now the Doors sounded ragged, bleary. It's one of those early-'70s records that comes <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> beleaguered hangover {{from the end of}} the '60s." ...|$|E
500|$|Chell {{said the}} drink was an {{immediate}} hit with the restaurant's patrons, claiming it [...] "took <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rocket". Within five years of its introduction, the Caesar had become Calgary's most popular mixed drink. It spread throughout Western Canada, then to the east. [...] Coinciding with its 40th anniversary, a petition was launched in 2009 {{in the hopes of}} having the Caesar named the nation's official mixed drink. In Calgary, Mayor Dave Bronconnier celebrated the drink's anniversary by declaring May 13, 2009 as Caesar Day in the city.|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli observed, [...] "Catch Me if You Can never takes {{itself or}} its {{subjects}} too seriously, and contains more genuinely funny material than about 90% {{of the so-called}} 'comedies' found in multiplexes these days". In addition Berardinelli praised John Williams' film score, which he felt was [...] "more intimate and jazzy than his usual material, evoking (intentionally) Henry Mancini". Peter Travers was one of few who gave the film a negative review. Travers considered Catch Me if You Can to be [...] "bogged down over 140 minutes. A film that took <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hare on speed ends like a winded tortoise." ...|$|E

Writing for PopMatters, Jesse Fox felt that the record is [...] "obviously not perfect", but suggested that its enjoyable nature helped Perry [...] " [...] it <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bright, flamboyant, short-lived, explosive, nearly abrasive, gasps-inspiring firework." [...] A writer for Blogcritics appreciated The Complete Confections musical diversity, and thought that the lyrical content made the album a [...] "journey in love, life and everything in between." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sea Harrier is a subsonic {{aircraft}} designed to fill strike, reconnaissance and fighter roles. [...] It features a single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine with two intakes and four vectorable nozzles. It has two landing gear on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear on the wings. The Sea Harrier {{is equipped with}} four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying weapons and external fuel tanks. Use of the ski jump allowed the aircraft to take off from a short flight deck with a heavier loadout than otherwise possible, although it can also take <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> conventional loaded fighter without thrust vectoring from a normal airport runway.|$|E
500|$|... "Pusher Love Girl" [...] {{opens with}} a [...] "swirling" [...] of [...] "luscious" [...] strings, which Nate Jones of Popdust cited as being [...] "straight from a Hollywood classic". Allan Raible of ABC News wrote that the [...] "stringed fanfare" [...] is {{something}} {{you would expect to}} hear on the red carpet of an awards ceremony. Jim Farber of the Daily News called the opening [...] "classic enough" [...] for Michael Jackson. After the [...] "sweeping" [...] orchestral intro, the song transcends into a [...] "funky main section", which, according to Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, is a [...] "sweet slice of funk-soul seduction". According to Thomas, [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] starts <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "classic Sinatra song": with a [...] "rise of strings" [...] that [...] "hit a pitch before dropping into a neo-soul sound".|$|E

500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Gilligan {{revealed that}} he wrote {{the character of the}} genie, Jenn, with Janeane Garofalo in mind, but she was unavailable at the time of filming. However, he was ultimately very pleased with Paula Sorge's performance, stating [...] "In fact, she was even better than how I had written the character. In Paula's audition, she came <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> world-weary wise-ass who was not only tough and smart, but had a heart of gold. She made it a really fun character." [...] The casting process to find an actress for the part took so long that an idea Gilligan had to give the character double pupils had to be scrapped when the production team ran out of time to source them. Instead, she wore contacts over her already blue eyes to make them brighter, and a blue jewel on her cheekbone.|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "Incredible" [...] starts <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{love song}} but reveals {{itself to be}} a plea to someone to start over, while {{changing}} its composition from the interlude. According to MTV, the shift in the structure reflected Madonna's own confusion about how she felt about her lover in the song. [...] "Can't get my head around it", she sang. [...] "I, I {{need to think about}} it." [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featuring West, has a 70s R meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West. Williams has commented that Madonna's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before. That is reflected in songs like [...] "Spanish Lesson" [...] where she sings the line [...] "If you do your homework/ Baby I will give you more". It also has influences of Spanish music. Groove inspired music is present in [...] "Dance 2Night", which featured Timberlake.|$|E
500|$|In March 1902, Joss {{signed with}} Cleveland. Toledo sportswriters took {{exception}} to Joss, one writing that [...] "he voluntarily {{signed a contract}} [...] for this season but when Bill Armour of Cleveland showed him the $500 bill he forgot his pledge and sneaked <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> whipped cur." [...] Stroebel later argued that Joss had returned only $100 of the $150 advance. [...] For not returning the entire advance, Joss was charged with a felony and Stroebel pursued legal action. Joss made his major league debut with the Bronchos on April 26, and two days later he arrived in Toledo to turn himself in, accompanied by Bronchos majority owner Charles Somers, who was also American League vice president. The court set bond at $500 ($). Stroebel also filed a civil suit against the Bronchos, stating that his business had been interfered with, but Stroebel agreed to withdraw his charges in July when he accepted Bronchos pitcher Jack Lundbom.|$|E

500|$|The College Dropout {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 25 reviews. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times dubbed it [...] "2004's first great hip-hop album". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised its [...] "substance, social commentary, righteous anger, ornery humanism, dark humor, and even Christianity", calling it [...] "one of those wonderful crossover albums {{that appeal to}} a huge audience without sacrificing a shred of integrity". Dave Heaton of PopMatters called the album [...] "musically engaging", writing that [...] "every single one of these songs comes <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> genuine extension of Kanye's personality and experiences". URB wrote that the album [...] "manages to be both visceral and emotive, sprinkling the dancefloors with tears and sweat." [...] Mojo dubbed the album [...] "manna for hip hop fans starved of basic but ballistic beats-and-breaks fare in an increasingly litigious age." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from contemporary critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the cover [...] "a useless remake, {{which seems to}} exist solely for its video". Spence D. of IGN said that the lyrics fit perfectly with Spears's relationship with the media at the time. He also added, [...] "As for her interpretation, it's an interesting chameleonic diversion that comes <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mash-up between vintage Prince-styled production, Cameo swagger, and Madonna sultriness, but never seems to capture the gloss and glory {{of any of the}} aforementioned influences". Christy Lemire of msnbc.com called it [...] "utterly unnecessary". Louis Pattison of the New Musical Express commented that [...] "judging by the fuck-you sentiments" [...] of the cover, Spears liked {{to play the role of}} [...] " [...] pop brat careering off the rails". Sarah Hepola of Salon.com wrote in an article about contemporary teen idols that the cover [...] "became an anthem for teen-idol rebellion". American director Quentin Tarantino included the song in a playlist that inspired him during production of his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds.|$|E
500|$|The Jonas Brothers are parodied in [...] "The Ring" [...] {{and play}} a {{prominent}} role in the episode's plot. In a television column written before [...] "The Ring" [...] was broadcast, Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post suggested Parker and Stone were using the Jonas Brothers in the thirteenth season debut as a means of improving the show's ratings; Comedy Central executives insisted Jonas Brothers fans do not fit into South Parks demographic of males between the ages 18 and 49. The scenes with the Jonas Brothers using hoses to shoot foam into the faces of their female fans were inspired by actual scenes in Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. Matt Stone said some viewers found it so unusual they believed the writers made it up themselves. [...] The Walt Disney Company, the Disney Channel and the Mickey Mouse cartoon character are also prominently featured, and spoofed, in the episode; even when Mickey Mouse says callous things or physically assaults people, he follows up most sentences with the character's trademark high-pitched [...] "Ha-ha!" [...] laugh, which in context comes <b>off</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nervous tic.|$|E
