The nurse has it <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital stockroom and asks the inmate Biu to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives solitary confinement. After being released from solitary, Neto writes {{a letter to his}} father and silently gives it to him when he visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto is locked in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic. The films ends as Wilson cries while he and Neto are seem seated side by side curbside.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1746, the Fairfield East Association of Ministers {{contacted}} the Church at the Unity Parish in Trumbull and advised them that Reverend Beebe was ready to become the minister at their parish. Beebe was ordained and installed at Unity Parish in May 1747. Beebe had his work cut <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> though, as the church had become scattered in 1744 by the conversion to Episcopacy by the last pastor, Reverend Richardson Miner. Under Beebe's leadership, 167 parishioners {{were added to the}} Unity Church rolls. Reverend Beebe's ministry in Trumbull lasted for 38 years until he died in office on September 8, 1785, in his 68th year.|$|E

He confesses his deception to Greggs, who in turn informs Daniels, now the BPD's Deputy Commissioner for Operations. Daniels and Pearlman subsequently meet with Acting Commissioner Rawls, State's Attorney Rupert Bond, and the mayor's office. Daniels and Rawls confront McNulty, informing him {{that this will be}} his last CID case.|$|E

25|$|Koerner {{was one of}} the {{participants}} at the Hambach Festival in spring of 1832 which was held to prepare a free, democratic, and unified state in Germany. The German Confederation's legation of sovereigns, the Bundestag (officially called the Bundesversammlung, Federal Assembly), was located in the Palais Thurn und Taxis in the center of Frankfurt, Koerner's native city. During the Frankfurter Wachensturm in 1833, a failed attempt by students to start a revolution in all states of the German Confederation, Koerner was injured and, to avoid being prosecuted by the authorities and held captive for high treason which would threaten capital punishment, he escaped in female dress to France. A warrant was <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He is counted as one of the Dreissiger.|$|E
25|$|The person {{called up}} to read from the Torah – the summons is called an aliyah and the person so honored is called an oleh – hastens from his seat to the desk, going {{directly}} to the desk without any interruptions. Although around the world, including North America, many congregations will have a trained scroll reader for the actual recitation, the very considerable honor of the reading is attributed to the oleh. If there was a previous portion read, the previous oleh then steps aside from the desk. The oleh takes his place at the desk facing the open scroll, the verse where his portion begins is pointed <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> he may kiss the scroll (usually by kissing {{the corner of his}} prayer shawl or the Torah wrapping and then touching that to the margin – not the writing – of the scroll), and then he may close his eyes, or avert his face, or otherwise indicate that the blessing he is about to recite is not being read from the text of the Torah. While reciting the blessings he holds both handles of the scroll, and if the actual scroll reading is done by someone else, the oleh steps to the side but continues to hold with one hand one of the scroll's handles.|$|E
500|$|There {{is a local}} {{tradition}} that Hylton Castle is haunted by the spirit of Robert Skelton, known as the Cauld (a pronunciation of [...] "cold" [...] in Mackem) Lad of Hylton. Various versions of how he was killed exist, the most popular being that he was decapitated by Sir Robert Hylton (later de jure 13th Baron Hylton), after falling asleep and failing to get his master's horse ready on time. Skelton's spirit then began to haunt the castle and would move objects, either misplacing them or tidying up. The spirit {{was said to have}} been finally laid to rest when the castle servants put a cloak <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|Reviewers were {{generally}} {{satisfied with the}} conclusion, and some like Bill Keveney of the USA Today felt the episode does not stray far from [...] "the series formula – a mix of sci-fi adventure, relationships and humor". Jason Van Horn of IGN enjoyed the humor, [...] "the amount of heart and pure emotion running rampant this episode", which he thought served as a symbol for the entire show that will stay {{in the public mind}} through re-runs and DVDs. Two scenes that stood <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as [...] "powerful", [...] "heart-wrenching" [...] and [...] "the icing on the cake", were Mitchell's breakdown and Vala's seduction of Daniel signaling [...] "the beginning of a very long lasting and loving relationship". Vala's emotional response to Daniel was interpreted as an example of her character growth, while another reviewer felt the [...] "Vala/Daniel argument [...] a tad overwrought [...] the motivation is clear". The emotional death of Landry appealed to several reviewers, as did the resolution via Teal'c's heroic sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{worked at}} a number of jobs, {{including}} lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy. Eastwood has said that he tried to enroll at Seattle University [...] but was then drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War. [...] "He always dropped the Korean War reference, hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and might be some sort of hero. Actually, he'd been a lifeguard at Fort Ord in northern California for his entire stint in the military," [...] commented Eastwood's former longtime companion, Sondra Locke. Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> when names came up for postings. While returning from a prearranged tryst in Seattle, Washington, he was a passenger on a Douglas AD bomber that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near Point Reyes. Using a life raft, he and the pilot swam [...] to safety.|$|E

500|$|In {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver David Coulthard, Nico Rosberg expressed excitement {{over how the}} end of the season had worked <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> describing the race in the United States as his [...] "low point". Speaking about racing his teammate Hamilton, he called him [...] "one of the best out there" [...] and said that it was [...] "an even better feeling to win, definitely against such opposition". Hamilton in turn praised his team for their performance over the whole season, saying that they had [...] "surpassed their own expectations", albeit confessing that he was happy that the season was over. During the press conference, third-placed Kimi Räikkönen said: [...] "It’s never nice to finish third but I’ll take it after previous races", pointing to a season that had been marred with small mistakes and misfortunes for him. He also stated that securing fourth place in the World Championship did not mean much to him, dismissing the idea of a [...] "Finnish championship" [...] between himself and Valtteri Bottas.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] portrayed D'Angelo {{as a sex}} symbol to {{mainstream}} music audiences, which had repercussions on The Voodoo Tours second half. During the tour, female fans yelled <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to take his clothes off, while others tossed clothes onto the stage. As trumpeter Roy Hargrove recounted, [...] "We couldn't get through one song before women would start to scream {{for him to take}} off something [...] It wasn't about the music. All they wanted him to do was take off his clothes." [...] This led to frustration and both onstage and offstage outbursts by D'Angelo, with him breaking stage equipment. Questlove later said, [...] "He'd get angry and start breaking shit. The audience thinking, 'Fuck your art, I wanna see your ass!', made him angry." [...] Although some were cancelled due to D'Angelo's throat infection during the tour's mid-March dates, many shows were cancelled due to his personal and emotional problems. D'Angelo chose on several occasions to not perform on scheduled dates, and delayed others to do physical workouts like stomach crunches. According to Questlove, three weeks worth of concert dates were cancelled, including two weeks worth of shows in Japan. He elaborated on the experience in a 2003 interview for The Believer, saying that: ...|$|E
500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense {{that he was the}} one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the current}} leaders of Russian psychiatry, {{especially}} those who {{were related to the}} establishment in Soviet period, have resiled from their avowal read at the 1989 General Assembly of the WPA that Soviet psychiatry had been systematically abused for political purposes. Among such leaders who did so is Aleksandr Tiganov, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, the director of its Mental Health Research Center, and the chief psychiatrist of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. In 2011, when asked whether ill or healthy were those examined because of their disagreements with authority, Tiganov answered, [...] "These people suffered from sluggish schizophrenia and were on the psychiatric registry." [...] According to Tiganov, it was rumored that Snezhnevsky took pity on dissenters and gave them a diagnosis required for placing in a special hospital to save them from a prison, but it is not true, he honestly did his medical duty. The same ideas are voiced in the 2014 interview by Anatoly Smulevich, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; he says what was attributed to Snesnevsky was that he recognized the healthy as the ill, it did not happen and is pure slander, it is completely ruled <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to give a diagnosis to a healthy person.|$|E
500|$|The final {{song on the}} record, [...] "Whipping Post," [...] {{was written}} shortly after Allman {{returned}} to Jacksonville. The song came to him shortly before bed, but {{he was unable to}} acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas, as there was a child asleep in the room and he could not turn on the lights. Turning to his next best alternative, he struck two kitchen matches (one for light and one, later blown out, as a charcoal writing utensil) and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board. [...] "Whipping Post" [...] was similar in composition to [...] "Dreams" [...] in its first incarnation, with Oakley later creating the heavy bassline that starts off the track. Duane and Betts take quick solos before the track builds to an [...] "anguished climax," [...] leading to Gregg Allman's solo voice, singing the song's refrain: [...] "Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'." [...] Allman had no idea the intro was written in 11/4 time — [...] "I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with" [...] — until his brother pointed it <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "My brother told me — I guess the day I wrote it — he said, 'That's good, man. I didn’t know you understood 11/4.' Of course I said something intelligent like, 'What's 11/4?' Duane just said, 'Okay, dumbass, I'll try to draw it up on paper for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero and filmed in Los Angeles, California. Spears first contacted Piliero {{and asked him to}} put together a concept for the video. The main idea for Marrs Piliero came from the lyric [...] "be a little inappropriate", which stood <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> but {{he did not want to}} make a video about sexual inappropriateness. Piliero wrote the opening press conference scene as a tribute to the film Half Baked (1998), which he is a fan of. He explained, [...] "That scene resonates with everyone as the epitome of the greatest way to quit your job, and just blow people off. [...] I felt like that would just be such a perfect way for her to tell the reporters to eff off." [...] Marrs Piliero first asked actor Kellan Lutz to co-star the clip with Spears; however, Lutz turned down the role, saying that [...] "there were a couple of weird things about the part that didn't make sense", including the scene where he was going to pour milk on himself. Piliero then thought of asking one of the stars of Half Baked, Guillermo Díaz, to be part of the video, explaining that it [...] "would make it come full circle." [...] Piliero watched all of Spears' videos and wanted to pull what he loved from them, but also give it something fresh. Piliero felt that all of her references to the paparazzi in her previous videos had been more of a statement than an action, and for [...] "I Wanna Go", he wanted her to have the opportunity to fight back.|$|E
