Between 1960 and 1976, {{when he left the}} Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Irvine</b> and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E

25|$|In 1974 Frank Sherwood Rowland, Chemistry Professor at the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Irvine,</b> and his {{postdoctoral}} associate Mario J. Molina {{suggested that}} long-lived organic halogen compounds, such as CFCs, might {{behave in a}} similar fashion as Crutzen had proposed for nitrous oxide. James Lovelock had recently discovered, during a cruise in the South Atlantic in 1971, that almost all of the CFC compounds manufactured since their invention in 1930 were still present in the atmosphere. Molina and Rowland concluded that, like , the CFCs would reach the stratosphere where they would be dissociated by UV light, releasing chlorine atoms. A year earlier, Richard Stolarski and Ralph Cicerone at the University of Michigan had shown that Cl is even more efficient than NO at catalyzing the destruction of ozone. Similar conclusions were reached by Michael McElroy and Steven Wofsy at Harvard University. Neither group, however, had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of stratospheric chlorine—instead, they had been investigating the possible effects of HCl emissions from the Space Shuttle, which are very much smaller.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s in California, the American Medical Association (AMA) {{spent nearly}} $8million {{to end the}} {{practice}} of osteopathic medicine in the state. In 1962, Proposition 22, a statewide ballot initiative in California, eliminated the practice of osteopathic medicine in the state. The California Medical Association (CMA) issued M.D. degrees to all DOs {{in the state of}} California for a nominal fee. [...] "By attending a short seminar and paying $65, a doctor of osteopathy (D.O.) could obtain an M.D. degree; 86 percent of the DOs in the state (out of a total of about 2000) chose to do so." [...] Immediately following, the AMA re-accredited the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Irvine</b> College of Osteopathic Medicine as the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, an M.D. medical school. It also placed a ban on issuing physician licenses to DOs moving to California from other states. However, the decision proved to be controversial. In 1974, after protests and lobbying by influential and prominent DOs, the California Supreme Court ruled in Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California v. California Medical Association, that licensing of DOs in that state must be resumed. Four years later, in 1978, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific opened in Pomona, and in 1997 Touro University California opened in Vallejo. [...] As of 2012, there were 6,368 D.O.s practicing in California.|$|E
500|$|The fifth {{installment}} of the Bound for Glory chronology was first announced in late 2008, when TNA released their PPV event schedule for February through October 2009.

The location for Bound for Glory was first announced during a promotional video package which aired during TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June 21, 2009, stating {{that it would be}} held in Los Angeles, California. Later that evening, TNA issued their first public written statement regarding the event via a press release announcing that Bound for Glory would be held at the Bren Events Center located on the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Irvine</b> campus in Irvine, California; contradicting their earlier promotional video package proclaiming it would be held in Los Angeles. Tickets for the event went on sale August 1, 2009.

40|$|University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Irvine’s</b> {{medical school}} {{is one of}} many {{programs}} that have transitioned to iPad based instruction. Release of iBooks Author, a development tool for electronic books, in January 2012 enabled the creation of “iBooks” that transitioned the iPad from an instructional content viewer to an advanced learning experience including interactivity and multimedia. This tool {{was the first time that}} instructors could develop customized instructional content for the iPad without prior programming experience. However, there currently lack any guidelines for iBook development, and there have been few evidenced-based research projects utilizing the tool. Therefore, the purpose of this instructional design project was to design, develop, and evaluate a prototype iBook intended to inform development decisions for instructional designers. The iBook design focused on integration of The First Principles of Instruction (Merrill, 2013), Principles of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2001), and iOS Human Interface Guidelines (Apple, 2012). Improved test scores, increased skill confidence, and positive participant responses indicate that selected theories and guidelines were applicable to iBooks development. The author suggests that these implications could be broadly applied to eBook development, and discusses additional design concerns for future research...|$|R

He was also praised for carrying out what he himself described as the historian's task [...] "to tell what is almost always an uncomfortable story and explain why the discomfort is part of the truth we need to live well and live properly. A well-organised society is one in which we know the truth about ourselves collectively, not one in which we tell pleasant lies about ourselves". Mark Levine, a professor of history at the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Irvine,</b> said that Judt's [...] "writings on European history and the need for a new social contract between rulers and ruled can inspire a new generation of scholars and activists in other cultures".

2500|$|The OLPC {{project has}} also been criticized for {{allegedly}} adopting a [...] "one-shot" [...] deployment approach {{with little or no}} technical support or teacher training, and for neglecting pilot programs and formal assessment of outcomes in favor of quick deployment. Some authors attribute this unconventional approach to the OLPC promoters' alleged focus on constructivist education and 'digital utopianism'. Mark Warschauer, a Professor of University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Irvine</b> and Morgan Ames, at the time of writing, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, have pointed out that the laptop by itself does not completely fill the need of students in underprivileged countries. The [...] "children’s machines", as they have been called, have been deployed to several countries, for example Uruguay, Peru, and in the US, Alabama, but after a relatively short time, their usage has declined considerably, sometimes because of hardware problems or breakage, in some cases, as high as 27% to 59% within the first two years, and sometimes {{due to a lack of}} knowledge on the part of the users on how to take full advantage of the machine. However, another factor has recently been acknowledged; a lack of a direct relation to the pedagogy needed in the local context to be truly effective. Uruguay reports that only 21.5% of teachers use the laptop in the classroom on a daily basis, and 25% report using it less than once a week. In Alabama, 80.3% of students say they never or seldom use the computer for class work, and Peru, teachers report that in the first few months, 68.9% use the laptop three times per week, but after two months, only 40% report such usage. Those of a low socio-economic level tend to not be able to effectively use the laptop for educational purposes on their own, but with scaffolding and mentoring from teachers, the machine can become more useful. According to one of the returning OLPC executives, Walter Bender, the approach needs to be more holistic, combining technology with a prolonged community effort, teacher training and local educational efforts and insights.|$|E
