40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the rapid microwave synthesis and subsequent structural characterisation {{of the group}} 13 carbides; specifically aluminium carbide, Al 4 C 3 and boron carbide, typically B 4 C or B 13 C 2. Due to practical considerations, which will be described in Chapters Three and Four, syntheses were conducted using elemental precursors. Using a multi-mode microwave cavity (MMC) with an operating frequency of 2. 45 GHz {{it was necessary to}} make use of a sealed and inert environment for the synthesis of oxide-free products. This was rationalised by the high stability of the oxides of aluminium (for example, Al 2 O 3 ΔH= - 1675. 69 kJ mol- 1, Al 4 C 3 ΔH= - 206. 9 kJ mol- 1). For boron carbide, this observation was explained by the tendency for the <b>oxides</b> <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> to volatilise (for example as B 2 O 3). The use of sealed, evacuated tubes facilitated the synthesis of high-purity carbide products in 30 minute timescales. This represents the first report of successful Al 4 C 3 synthesis in a microwave cavity. In addition, the synthesis of boron carbide was achieved in air in just 90 seconds using a 2. 45 GHz single-mode microwave cavity (SMC) for the first time. Following synthesis, products were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), powder neutron diffraction (PND), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). PXD was used for phase identification and preliminary structure refinement. Raman spectroscopy offered supporting information to PXD to confirm phase identity. SEM-EDX offered an insight into product morphology, for example, as a function of time, microwave power and cavity type, along with quantitative purity information. There was no PXD or EDX evidence for oxygen contamination across carbide samples. PND was used to probe defect structure and structural stability at elevated temperature. Microwave synthesised Al 4 C 3 was structurally stable up to 1000 °C and boron carbide up to 400 °C (the maximum temperatures of the respective experiments). Aluminium carbide is reported elsewhere to interact with water. Some initial experiments surrounding the nature of this interaction have been conducted. The preliminary results have indicated potential for intercalation of water into the aluminium carbide structure. Obtaining a definitive structural model for boron carbide is complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between boron and carbon experimentally. Boron and carbon are neighbours in the periodic table and near-isoelectronic. This complicates characterising the boron-carbon system by PXD, since PXD is mediated by electrons. There are also challenges posed by the system when using PND. The 10 B isotope has an extremely high absorption cross section for neutrons; 3835. 0 (9) barn for 2200 m s- 1 neutrons. In addition, the bound coherent neutron scattering length of 11 B is very similar to that of carbon; C: 6. 6460 fm and 11 B: 6. 65 fm. In this thesis, natural boron (abundance typically 80...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{development}} of seawater desalination applications using membrane technology {{in recent years}} has reignited the issue <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in drinking water. This is reflected by an increasing number of scientific investigations on the removal <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> by reverse osmosis (RO) {{and to a lesser extent}} by nanofiltration (NF) membranes over the last decade. This review provides a summary of the current knowledge relevant to the removal <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> by NF/RO membranes in seawater desalination applications. In seawater, boron exists almost exclusively in the form of boric acid. The speciation of boric acid and other physicochemical properties are delineated and systematically related to the rejection <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> by NF/RO membranes. Studies investigating the rejection <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> by NF/RO membranes reported to date are summarised and reviewed to comprehensively elucidate key factors governing the transport <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in a typical NF/RO filtration process. The speciation of boric acid as a function of the feed solution pH appears to be the single most important factor governing the rejection <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> by NF/RO membranes. In addition, results reported in the literature reveal an intricate relationship between the speciation of boric acid and several other operating parameters. Some of these operating parameters such as feed solution temperature and ionic strength can directly influence the rejection <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> and at the same time alter the intrinsic dissociation constant of boric acid, hence, indirectly affecting boron rejection by NF/RO membranes. This review also delineates key mathematical modelling approaches, capable of describing the transport <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in NF/RO filtration processes. The studies included in this review highlight the potential for further process optimisation to enhance the removal <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in seawater desalination applications. However, the discussions provided also emphasize the need for more fundamental research to improve the scientific understanding <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> rejection by NF/RO membranes.

The yields of corn and alfalfa were related to the amount <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> fertilizer applied for several soils studied. The level <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in the whole plant was determined and was correlated with the amount <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> applied and the amount of hot water soluble boron in the soil. The conclusions drawn from this study may be applied only to soils of similar texture and of similar climatological factors. On the selected soils the soil boron level ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 31 ppm HWS boron. The critical level <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in the alfalfa plant is approximately 15 ppm. The critical level <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in the corn plant could not be accurately determined because existing soil boron levels seemed to be sufficient to grow and maintain corn for the short growing season used in this study. The level was estimated to be less than 10 ppm B. The hot water soluble boron level in the soil needed for the normal growth of alfalfa may be as high as 0. 30 ppm for certain conditions. The hot water soluble boron level in the soil for the normal growth of corn seems to be less than 0. 20 ppm, but the relative adequacy <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> for corn did not allow a more precise determination. The hot water soluble level <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in the soil is directly influenced by the amount <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> applied.

The parameters are the diffusion coeffi-cient <b>of</b> <b>boron,</b> the evaporation coefficient <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> from silicon, and the silicon evaporation rate in a hydrogen ambient. The value of the diffusion coefficient <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> is already well known while the values for the other two parameters have not been determined over the temperature range usually used for epi-taxial growth. The evaporation coefficient <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> in silicon in a hydro-gen ambient was experimental ly determined to be h = 1. 674 • 10 T e- 2. 4 s/kT where h is in microns per minute, the energy is expressed in electron volts, and temperature is in degrees Kelvin. The evaporation rate of silicon in a hydrogen ambient was measured as 0. 013 _ _ 0. 003 microns/min in a hydrogen ambient. These results were obtained in the temperature range from 1190 ~ to 1380 ~ These results allowed the accurate prediction <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> back surface "auto...|$|R
5000|$|Boric acid (16.5%boron), borax (11.3% boron) or SoluBor (20.5% boron) can {{be applied}} to soils to correct boron deficiency. Typical {{applications}} <b>of</b> actual <b>boron</b> are about 1.1 kg/hectare or 1.0 lb/acre but optimum levels <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> vary with plant type. [...] Borax, Boric Acid or Solubor can be dissolved in water and sprayed or applied to soil as a dust. Excess boron is toxic to plants so care must be taken to ensure correct application rate and even coverage. Leaves of many plants are damaged by boron; therefore, when in doubt, only apply to soil. Application <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> may not correct boron deficiency in alkaline soils because even with the addition <b>of</b> <b>boron,</b> it may remain unavailable for plant absorption. [...] Continued application <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> may be necessary in soils that are susceptible to leaching such as sandy soils. [...] Flushing soils containing toxic levels <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> with water can remove the boron through leaching.|$|R
