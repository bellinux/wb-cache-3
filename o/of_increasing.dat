5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

40|$|The {{realized}} and intrinsic rates <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> several meiobenthic {{populations are}} compared.

The result is investigated in the light of Vandermeer's (1975) Beta-competition. There is also a remarkable agreement between the values of the predator Protohydra leuckarti and its principal prey Tachidius discipes. The intrinsic rates <b>of</b> natural <b>increase</b> vary more, but are a linear function of temperature in all species investigated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} anatomic {{patterns and}} clinical importance <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake in bones of horses used for show jumping, hunting, and eventing. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 141 horses evaluated because of lameness. PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed, {{and information on}} results of physical examination, radiography, and scintigraphy were obtained. Scintigrams were evaluated to identify areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radio-pharmaceutical uptake. RESULTS: 834 areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake were identified. Scintigraphy of the vertebral column was performed in 78 horses, and 50 had areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake involving the spinous processes. Scintigraphy of the proximal phalanx of the forelimb was performed in 88 horses. Similarly, scintigraphy of the proximal phalanx of the hind limb was performed in 99 horses, and scintigrams of 374 proximal phalanges were available for review. One hundred fifty-five scintigrams had areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake. Scintigraphy of the tarsal joint was performed in 99 horses, and scintigrams of 198 joints were available for review. Eighty-five had areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake. Overall, 214 of 834 areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake were definitively associated with lameness. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results {{of this study suggest}} that jumping creates unique stresses on the bones of horses. The distinctive patterns <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake identified in this study suggest that horses used for jumping may have a predilection to develop orthopedic disease at specific sites distinct from those in racehorses.
