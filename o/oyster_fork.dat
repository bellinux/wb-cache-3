50|$|The cutlery to {{the right}} of the service plate is, from the outside in, the <b>oyster</b> <b>fork</b> resting in the bowl of the soup spoon, the fish knife, the meat knife and the salad knife (or fruit knife). On the left, from the outside in, are the fish fork, the meat fork and a salad fork (or fruit fork). If both a salad and a fruit course are served, the {{necessary}} extra flatware is brought out on a platter, as it is bad form to have more than three knives or forks on the table at once, the <b>oyster</b> <b>fork</b> excepted.|$|E
50|$|It {{should not}} be {{necessary}} for the diner to distinguish between types of forks; forks are used in order from outside to inside, {{with the exception of}} <b>oyster</b> <b>forks,</b> which are placed on the right side, the tines nested {{in the bowl of a}} spoon.|$|R
5000|$|Warren {{moved back}} to Ludington after he {{graduated}} from Notre Dame in 1887 to work with his father in various lumber businesses. He married Catherine (Kate) Dempsey on May 22, 1888. The city of Ludington embraced the newlyweds in a grandeur manner showering them with spledid wedding gifts, including table linens, silver spoons, pearl-handled fruit knives, <b>oyster</b> <b>forks,</b> teapots, pickle castors, decortive vases, and poetry books. [...] Their marriage produced 3 children: Warren Ray, Morgan Edward and Vincent George.|$|R
50|$|Tyler's father calls Linda, who is {{surprised}} {{to hear from him}} and believes that she is receiving a surprise, to come down to the club immediately. Linda excitedly dresses up in a sailing outfit and heads down to the club to find out the surprise is not what she expected. She discovers that the kids have stolen regatta pennants and <b>oyster</b> <b>forks,</b> in addition to several trays of food that Gene has eaten, and that Bob has not been taking the kids for sailing lessons but instead is still trying to beat Jimmy Pesto.|$|R
6000|$|Jervy, {{watching}} {{her from the}} opposite side of the table, with Phoebe close by him as usual, had his own motives for encouraging her to talk, by the easy means of encouraging her to drink. He sent for another glass of the hot grog. Phoebe, daintily picking up her <b>oysters</b> with her <b>fork,</b> affected to be shocked at Mrs. Sowler's coarse method of eating and drinking. She kept her eyes on her plate, and only consented to taste malt liquor under modest protest. When Jervy lit a cigar, after finishing his supper, she reminded him, in an impressively genteel manner, of the consideration which he owed to the presence of an elderly lady. [...] "I like it myself, dear," [...] she said mincingly; [...] "but perhaps Mrs. Sowler objects to the smell?" ...|$|R
5000|$|We see a {{spinning}} globe, then {{the front of}} the agency store, where we see several displays of banners and posters of different countries. Then as we see one poster/banner for each country, we hear a song tied to the country or a pun on the name. For example, with a picture of Bombay harbor, we see exploding bombs! There's a little tour of the world at first, with appropriate songs, which then stray into puns about food. [...] "Food's an Education," [...] so we go to Hungary, Turkey, the Sandwich Islands, Hamburg, Chili, <b>Oyster</b> Bay, Twin <b>Forks</b> and Java. The Thief of Bagdad uses the Florida Keys to break into the Kimberly Diamond Mine, and then pawns them with the Pawnee Indians. He is chased by the soldiers and police of different nations, but gets away by forming an [...] "unusual alliance" [...] with the Lone Stranger: [...] "Well, you're not alone now, Beeg Boy!" ...|$|R
