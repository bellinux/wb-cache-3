5|$|Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and {{the valley}} itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense {{fighting}} flagged {{with the onset}} of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions. The plebiscite was never held, and on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India came into force in Kashmir, but with special provisions made for the state. India did not, however, secure administrative control over all <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir.</b> The northern and western portions <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir</b> came under Pakistan's control in 1947, and are today Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In the 1962 Sino-Indian War, China occupied Aksai Chin, the north-eastern region bordering Ladakh, which it continues to control and administer.|$|E
5|$|Khaplu Palace {{was built}} in 1840 by the Yabgo Raja Daulat Ali Khan of Khaplu after the Dogra <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir</b> who {{captured}} the region decided to move the seat of government from the old fort. The site of the palace was chosen by rolling a large stone down from a nearby cliff; it stopped at the Doqsai village, and the palace was built there. The earlier fort was located near {{the location of the}} present-day palace. Khaplu Palace replaced the former fort as the royal residence after its completion. According to Jane E. Duncan, the people of Khaplu used to live inside this fort and were not allowed to build their homes outside its premises. This practice was changed after Maharaja <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir</b> took control of the area, resulting in a cessation of conflict among neighbouring rulers.|$|E

5|$|The 7th {{and first}} half of the 8th century are {{generally}} considered to be the era in which the Tang reached the zenith of its power.

5|$|The {{presence}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti found in Kashmir and north West India predating 10th century suggests {{the worship of}} Vishnu in this form in the era. The form developed a cult between 8th to 10th century CE. The 12th century chronicle Rajatarangini also mentions about the installation of this form of Vishnu. The icon received royal patronage from King Avantivarman, the founder of Utpala dynasty (reign: 855-883 CE); temples built in his reign often depict Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Vaikuntha Chaturmurti became the tutelary deity of the Karkotas and Utpala dynasties <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir.</b> It was also popular in the regions adjoining Kashmir.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir.</b> In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, the Pandits made {{up about}} 6 percent <b>of</b> the <b>Kashmir</b> Valley's {{population}}. By 1950, their population declined to 5 per cent as many Pandits moved {{to other parts}} of India due to the uncompensated land redistribution policy, the unsettled nature <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir's</b> accession to India and the threat of economic and social decline.|$|R
25|$|Kashmiri {{scholars}} say that India's reneging on promise of plebiscite, violations of constitutional provisions <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir's</b> autonomy and subversion {{of the democratic}} process led to the rebellion of 1989–1990.|$|R

5|$|Pakistan, {{attempting}} {{to force the}} issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir</b> wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared {{that it would have}} to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{independence}} in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most nations. In the 1950s, it strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia {{and played a}} lead role in the Non-Aligned Movement. In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad {{at the invitation of}} neighbouring countries: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in Maldives. India has tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir,</b> while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh. After waging the 1962 Sino-Indian War and the 1965 war with Pakistan, India pursued close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir</b> to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E

5|$|In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is {{initially}} {{described as an}} animal that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. In defining the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and the aroma of meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir,</b> Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{component of}} the brigade was formed from three cavalry regiments, each of four squadrons: the 1st Hyderabad Lancers commanded by Major Mahomed Azmatullah Bahadur with twenty-seven officers (one British) and 533 other ranks, the Mysore Lancers (including two troops of Bhavnagar Lancers and one troop <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir</b> Lancers) commanded by Regimentdar B. Chamraj Urs Bahadur with thirty-two officers (one British) and 487 other ranks, and the Patiala Lancers commanded by Colonel Nand Singh Sardar Bahadur with twenty-six officers and 528 other ranks. This formation remained the same until May 1916, when the Patiala Lancers were transferred {{to serve in the}} campaign in Mesopotamia. The brigade regained its own third regiment in May 1918 when the Jodhpur Lancers, commanded by Colonel Thakur Pratap Singh Sardar Bahadur, which had been serving on the Western Front in France, arrived in the theatre. The final unit assigned to the brigade was the Imperial Service Machine-Gun Squadron formed on 10 June 1918 by amalgamating the three cavalry regiment's machine-gun sections into one unit. Some sources refer to the squadron as the 15th Imperial Service Brigade Machine-Gun Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is {{generally}} depicted standing. He wears rich clothes (generally in sculpture, only a dhoti) {{as well as}} various ornaments like a crown, armbands, necklaces etc., symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita (sacred thread). In his eight arms, he is prescribed in the texts to carry gada (mace), sword, arrow and the Sudarshana Chakra in his left hands and shankha (conch), shield, bow and lotus in his right hands. However, in sculpture, he is often four-armed and in two of his hands, he holds a lotus and a conch, while his other hands rest on the heads of his personified weapons (ayudhapurusha) - Gadadevi or Gadanari (gada as a female) on his right and Chakrapurusha on his left, who stand as small figures besides his legs. They both look upwards towards him and hold fly whisks. A tiny figurine of the earth goddess Prithvi (who associated with Varaha and Vishnu as his consort) rises from the pedestal in between his feet, as though supporting the deity. A short dagger or sword may be tucked up in the waist belt of the god near the right hip, a peculiar feature <b>of</b> <b>Kashmir</b> icons. Attendants or devotees may be also shown besides or below Vishnu. Sometimes, Brahma and Shiva and the ten avatars of Vishnu may be depicted in the background.|$|E
