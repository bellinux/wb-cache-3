An industry-sponsored study (pdf) by Pennsylvania State University estimates there will be 200,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania by 2020 if shale is developed to its full potential, however since 2007 the natural gas companies have been hiring experienced crews from Texas and Oklahoma for the high-paying work <b>on</b> <b>drilling</b> rigs that operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{has responded to}} the challenges in various ways, including through a ban <b>on</b> <b>drilling</b> new wells, the introduction of more efficient irrigation techniques, the reduction of water losses, an ambitious municipal wastewater treatment program, and the gradual concentration of industries in newly created industrial estates. However, there are no limits on the extraction of water from more than 25,000 existing wells, water distribution losses remain high, the use of efficient irrigation techniques remains limited and untreated wastewater continues to be discharged into the environment. The challenges thus are far from being resolved. In 2006 the {{government has}} temporary revived plans for an expensive scheme to bring in water from the Euphrates river, located more than 400km from Damascus.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, {{the site}} was cleared of mobile cabins {{associated}} {{with the construction of}} Phase 2, and there was a small crane on site, along with diggers. On 29 May 2008, a Soilmec SR-70 hydraulic rotary rig owned by Bachy Solentache began work <b>on</b> <b>drilling</b> piles on the site managed by Bachy's Project Manager, Chris Wallbank. After the excavation of earth and assembly of two cranes on site, two slipform structures were assembled in November 2008. In December 2008, these two slipform structures began to rise and the two cores for the building were constructed and topped out. The plaza level was then cleared of construction materials, although the two tower cranes remained in position. Construction stalled in January 2009 following the financial issues with Anglo Irish Bank.|$|E

40|$|Geological site {{characterisation}} programmes typically rely <b>on</b> <b>drill</b> cores {{for direct}} information on subsurface rocks. However, porosity, transport properties and porewater composition measured <b>on</b> <b>drill</b> cores can deviate from in-situ values due to two main artefacts caused by drilling and sample recovery: (1) mechanical disruption that increases porosity and (2) {{contamination of the}} porewater by drilling fluid. We investigated the effect and magnitude of these perturbations <b>on</b> large <b>drill</b> core samples (12 – 20 cm long, 5 cmdiameter) of high-grade, granitic gneisses obtained from 350 to 600 m depth in a borehole on Olkiluoto Island (SW Finland). The drilling fluid was traced with sodium–iodide. By combining out-diffusion experiments, gravimetry, UV-microscopy and iodide mass balance calculations, we successfully quantified the magnitudes of the artefacts: 2 – 6...|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even <b>on</b> many <b>drill</b> presses, handheld drills, and lathes, which have chucks (such as a drill chuck or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. <b>On</b> <b>drills,</b> drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|R

2500|$|The {{incident}} {{spawned a}} generation of safety regulations that require the industry to designate hazardous drilling targets as [...] "critical wells" [...] and to use elaborate safety precautions at the drill site. The new regulations imposed much more stringent drilling procedures at critical wells, required specialized safety features <b>on</b> <b>drilling</b> and other equipment, and forced companies to develop detailed emergency response plans before beginning to drill. Combined, these additional costs can range from $250,000 to $500,000 for a single deep sour gas well. Thus, the indirect costs of the blowout have probably been {{on the order of}} $1 billion.|$|E
