5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Maria Theresa ever completely recovered from the smallpox attack in 1767, as 18th-century writers asserted. She suffered from shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> fatigue, cough, distress, necrophobia and insomnia. She later developed edema.|$|E

5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.|$|E
5|$|In those {{receiving}} heparin {{through an}} intravenous infusion, {{a complex of}} symptoms ("systemic reaction") may occur when the infusion is started. These include fever, chills, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> and chest pain. This happens in {{about a quarter of}} people with HIT. Others may develop a skin rash consisting of red spots.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive Support Ventilation is a {{positive}} pressure mode of mechanical ventilation that is closed-loop controlled. In this mode, the frequency and tidal volume <b>of</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> a patient on the ventilator are automatically adjusted based on the patient’s requirements. The lung mechanics data are used to adjust the depth and rate <b>of</b> <b>breaths</b> to minimize the work rate of breathing. In the ASV mode, every breath is synchronized with patient effort if such an effort exists, and otherwise, full mechanical ventilation is provided to the patient.|$|R

5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 2005, Cheney {{underwent}} a six-hour endo-vascular procedure to repair popliteal artery aneurysms bilaterally, a catheter treatment technique {{used in the}} artery behind each knee. The condition was discovered at a regular physical in July, and was not life-threatening. Cheney was hospitalized for tests after experiencing shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> five months later. In late April 2006, an ultrasound revealed that the clot was smaller.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{seen with}} the syndrome include developmental delay, growth retardation, pulmonary stenosis (an obstruction of blood-flow from the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery) with associated dyspnea (shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath),</b> and renal agenesis (failure of the kidneys to develop during the fetal period). Undescended testes, hyperactivity and aggressive behavior have also been noted.|$|E

5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are {{the leading cause of}} death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of COPD {{should be considered}} in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> a chronic cough, sputum production, or frequent winter colds and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. Screening those without symptoms is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss or loss of appetite, shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, petechiae (flat, pin-head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent infections.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of COPD are sputum production, shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> and a productive cough. These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms {{that may or may not}} occur with COPD.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E

5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
