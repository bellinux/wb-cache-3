Calcification is a setback to IOLs that needs to be further studied so that possible solutions can be found. The effects of sterilisation and incubation in an extreme calcific environment, namely a metastable calcium salt solution at pH 7. 4 at 37 [degrees]C, on the properties of gamma-irradiated and ethylene-oxide-sterilised medical grade PMMA, was analysed over a period of nine weeks. From these initial studies, energy dispersive X-ray analysis identified deposits containing calcium, chlorine and potassium as soon as one day after incubation. It was proposed that calcification occurred as a result of diffusion of water into the PMMA, which then attracted calcium-containing deposits to accumulate on the surface.

In this work, a method to fabricate and passivate nanowire-pyramid hybrid structures formed on a silicon surface via wet chemical processing is presented. These high surface area structures can be utilised on the front surface of back contact silicon solar cells to maximise light absorption therein. Hemispherical reflectivity under varying incident angles is measured to study the optical enhancement conferred by these structures. The significant reduction in reflectivity (< 2 %) under low incident angles is maintained at high angles by the hybrid textured surface compared to surfaces textured with nanowires or pyramids alone. Finite Difference Time Domain simulations of these dual micro-nanoscale surfaces under varying angles supports the experimental results. In order to translate the <b>optical</b> <b>benefit</b> of these high surface area structures into improvements in device efficiency, they must also be well passivated. To this end, atomic layer deposition of alumina is used to reduce surface recombination velocities of these ultra-black silicon surfaces to below 30 cm/s.

40|$|Ocular {{pathology}} that manifests at {{an early}} age has the potential to alter the vision dependent emmetropisation mechanism which coordinates eye growth throughout childhood. The disruption of this feedback mechanism in children with congenital or early onset vision impairment often results in the development of significant ametropia, including high levels of spherical refractive error, astigmatism, and anisometropia. This review examines the use of contact lenses as a refractive correction, low vision aid, and therapeutic intervention in the rehabilitation of patients with bilateral, irreversible vision loss due to congenital ocular disease. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of contact lenses for increased magnification (telescopes and microscopes) or field expansion (reverse telescopes) are discussed, along with the benefits and practical considerations for the correction of pathological high myopia. The historical and present use of therapeutic tinted contact lenses to reduce photosensitivity and nystagmus in achromatopsia, albinism, and aniridia are also presented, including clinical considerations for the contact lens practitioner. In addition to the known <b>optical</b> <b>benefits</b> in comparison to spectacles for high levels of ametropia (an improved field of view for myopes, and fewer inherent oblique aberrations), contact lenses may be of significant psycho-social benefit for patients with low vision, due to enhanced cosmesis and reduced conspicuity, and potential related effects of improved self-esteem and peer acceptance. The contact lens correction of patients with congenital vision impairment can be challenging for both practitioner and patient, but should be considered as a potential optical or therapeutic solution in modern low vision rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the biometry accuracy, visual outcomes, and long-term changes in intraocular pressure after implantation {{of the black}} diaphragm intraocular (BDI) lens in cases of aniridia. DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: Forty eyes of 35 patients with aniridia (15 eyes of congenital origin and 25 {{as a result of}} trauma). METHODS: Patient demographics, clinical evolution, and treatment were analyzed for each case undergoing implantation with the Morcher 67 F BDI lens (Morcher GmBH, Stuttgart, Germany). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Biometry accuracy, visual outcome, and the development of glaucoma and other complications in these eyes over a mean of 3. 5 years. RESULTS: Using the recommended A constant of 118. 7, the mean biometry prediction error was - 0. 12 +/- 0. 44 diopters (D), with a mean absolute error of 1. 47 +/- 0. 29 D, equivalent to 80 % of target eyes being within 2 D of predicted refraction. The prevalence of glaucoma increased from 10 (25 %) of 40 eyes before surgery, to 22 (55 %) of 40 eyes at 1 year after surgery. The best-corrected visual acuity in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units improved significantly in the 25 eyes with traumatic aniridia, from 1. 34 +/- 0. 22 to 0. 54 +/- 0. 16 (20 / 400 to 20 / 70; P< 0. 001). In contrast, no significant improvement was seen in the 15 eyes with congenital aniridia, whose preoperative logMAR visual acuity of 1. 17 +/- 0. 14 improved to 1. 01 +/- 0. 21 (20 / 300 to 20 / 200; P = 0. 20). CONCLUSIONS: Biometry is reasonably accurate when implanting the BDI lens for aniridia. Glaucoma is the main complication and occurred immediately after surgery, suggesting a possible direct mechanical effect of the large BDI lens. Significantly better visual outcomes were seen when using the 67 F BDI lens for traumatic aniridia compared with congenital aniridia. Implantation of the BDI lens in congenital aniridia therefore should be approached with caution, because the recreation of an iris diaphragm does not confer the expected <b>optical</b> <b>benefits</b> in these eyes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{healthcare}} utilization {{and costs of}} previously uninsured rural children. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Four years of claims data from a school-based health insurance program located in the Mississippi Delta. All children who were not Medicaid-eligible or were uninsured, were eligible for limited benefits under the program. The 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) {{was used to compare}} utilization of services. STUDY DESIGN: The study represents a natural experiment in the provision of insurance benefits to a previously uninsured population. Premiums for the claims cost were set with little or no information on expected use of services. Claims from the insurer were used to form a panel data set. Mixed model logistic and linear regressions were estimated to determine the response to insurance for several categories of health services. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The use of services increased over time and approached the level of utilization in the NMES. Conditional medical expenditures also increased over time. Actuarial estimates of claims cost greatly exceeded actual claims cost. The provision of a limited medical, dental, and <b>optical</b> <b>benefit</b> package cost approximately $ 20 -$ 24 per member per month in claims paid. CONCLUSIONS: An important uncertainty in providing health insurance to previously uninsured populations is whether a pent-up demand exists for health services.

40|$|To provide {{patients}} with the best vision possible practitioners undertake comprehensive visual examinations and optical dispensing procedures.   Ensuring proper frame alignment {{is an important part}} of the spectacle dispensing process.   Ideally, for maximum optical benefit, patients should look through the optical centers of their lenses.   Rays entering a lens at any point other than the optical center will be deviated as long as the lens has power, thus inducing prismatic effects.   These prismatic effects may lead to visual complaints such as asthenopia,blurry vision and headaches.   The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of induced prismatic effects due to poorly fitting spectacle frames.   A sample of 100 spectacle wearing subjects was selected as participants.   Questionnaires were completed and any symptoms experienced recorded.   The habitual spectacle position in the primary position of gaze was noted, pupil and optical centers marked and where relevant, induced prism was calculated.   Data was analysed using the ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests.   On initial observation of frame position, about 45 % of subjects were wearing their spectacles incorrectly.   A comparison of the marked pupil centers in primary gaze and optical centers revealed that 100 % of participants were found to not be looking through the optical centers of their lenses.   Fifty one percent were within horizontal and 3. 12 % within vertical ANSI tolerances.   Symp- toms were reported by 50 % of subjects experiencing base-out, 0 % base-in and 47 % vertical induced prismatic effects.   However, no correlation existed between those subjects experiencing induced prism and symptoms reported.   Prism adaptation may account for some participants being asymptomatic.   Sixty three percent of subjects were not aware of the importance of properly fitted spectacle frames.   Proper optical dispensing with associated patient education is necessary to achieve optimal <b>optical</b> <b>benefits</b> of spectacles and careful attention should be given to this aspect by practitioners.   It is recommended that patients return periodically to their optometrists to have the frame alignment assessed and the fit modified if necessary.

40|$|Incumbent {{telecommunication}} lasers emitting at 1. 5 µm {{are fabricated on}} InP substrates and {{consist of}} multiple strained quantum well layers of the ternary alloy InGaAs, with barriers of InGaAsP or InGaAlAs. These lasers have been seen to exhibit very strong temperature dependence of the threshold current. This strong temperature dependence leads to a situation where external cooling equipment is required to stabilise the optical output power of these lasers. This results in {{a significant increase in}} the energy bill associated with telecommunications, as well as a large increase in equipment budgets. If the exponential growth trend of end user bandwidth demand associated with the internet continues, these inefficient lasers could see the telecommunications industry become the dominant consumer of world energy. For this reason there is strong interest in developing new, much more efficient telecommunication lasers. One avenue being investigated is the development of quantum dot lasers on InP. The confinement experienced in these low dimensional structures leads to a strong perturbation of the density of states at the band edge, and has been predicted to result in reduced temperature dependence of the threshold current in these devices. The growth of these structures is difficult due to the large lattice mismatch between InP and InAs; however, recently quantum dots elongated in one dimension, known as quantum dashes, have been demonstrated. Chapter 4 of this thesis provides an experimental analysis of one of these quantum dash lasers emitting at 1. 5 µm along with a numerical investigation of threshold dynamics present in this device. Another avenue being explored to increase the efficiency of telecommunications lasers is bandstructure engineering of GaAs-based materials to emit at 1. 5 µm. The cause of the strong temperature sensitivity in InP-based quantum well structures has been shown to be CHSH Auger recombination. Calculations have shown and experiments have verified that the addition of bismuth to GaAs strongly reduces the bandgap and increases the spin orbit splitting energy of the alloy GaAs 1 −xBix. This leads to a bandstructure condition at x = 10 % where not only is 1. 5 µm emission achieved on GaAs-based material, but also the bandstructure of the material can naturally suppress the costly CHSH Auger recombination which plagues InP-based quantum-well-based material. It has been predicted that telecommunications lasers based on this material system should operate in the absence of external cooling equipment and offer electrical and <b>optical</b> <b>benefits</b> over the incumbent lasers.

40|$|Numerous {{possible}} micromechanism applications (e. g. three-way switches, mechanical {{memory and}} multiplex <b>optical</b> switches) could <b>benefit</b> from a device with three stable equilibrium positions. In this paper, {{we present a}} new class of tristable mechanisms called double tensural tristable mechanisms (DTTMs) which are fully compliant (i. e. they are monolithic and get their motion from the deflection of elastic components) and can be fabricated at the micro scale. A pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) for the DTTM has been developed. DTTMs were fabricated in polysilicon using the SUMMiT V process and tested for tristability and force–deflection characteristics. The results successfully demonstrate tristable behavior and show that the PRBM can be used to identify tristable configurations and predict their performance.
