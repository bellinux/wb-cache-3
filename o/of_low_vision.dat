Based on the findings from the study, recommendations were forwarded to the integrated primary school principal and teachers who are responsible for the support <b>of</b> learners with <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Ethical measures were adhered to as participants were told that their interview was voluntary and they were free to withdraw at any time if they felt uncomfortable. The researcher also kept strict confidentiality to protect identity of the participants. The participants in this research work were seven learners with <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> one principal and three teachers in one of the integrated primary schools. In this study the researcher used qualitative methodology with purposive sampling technique to select respondents and used descriptive design. It was found that in most cases the attitude of teachers and sighted learners towards learners with <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> was negative, social isolation and withdrawal <b>of</b> learners with <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> from sighted group were the main problems. During this research process respondents reported that there was lack of learning resource materials and modification of teaching materials to suit the needs <b>of</b> learners with <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Therefore, the study recommends that learners with <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> should be included not only physically, but socially and psychologically. The teachers in the integrated schools should have a close relationship with these learners, give them support and the curriculum as well learning material or resources should be adapted to suit the need of the learners with <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> The regular inclusive schools should know the importance of early acceptance and benefits of early identification and intervention to encourage social development <b>of</b> learners with <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Inclusive EducationM.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence <b>of</b> binocular <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and underlying eye diseases among institutionalised elderly people in a Dutch urban population and the size of remediable visual disability as the result <b>of</b> inappropriately corrected <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> METHODS: The design was a cross-sectional survey of 284 subjects with <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> (corrected binocular vision < 0. 4) in nursing homes and homes for the elderly in the Netherlands. RESULTS: 284 of 610 eligible residents were examined. The prevalence <b>of</b> binocular <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> was 31. 3 %. Among elderly residents with <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> prevalence <b>of</b> cataract, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy was 77. 9, 37. 7, 5. 2 and 5. 2 %, respectively. In 32 residents (41. 6 %), (non) -use of low-vision aids was considered inappropriate. In 50 residents (64. 9 %), visual disability was considered at least partially remediable, either through better use of low-vision aids, or through cataract extraction. Residents who were not optimally corrected for <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> were significantly more functionally impaired compared with their peers who were optimally corrected. CONCLUSION: <b>Low</b> <b>vision</b> is likely to be highly prevalent among institutionalised elderly. A significant amount of the associated visual disability may be remediable...|$|R

The diabetic patients with low vision included in the observation group, another 2 times the number of cases of diabetes with normal vision were selected as control group. Logistic regression was used to analyze the related history data of two groups of patients were investigated, to analyze the risk factors to low vision. RESULTS: Of the 2000 diabetic patients involved in visual acuity examination, there were 189 patients(276 eyes) with poor vision, the incidence rate was 6. 90 %. Among them, 102 patients(102 eyes) with monocular vision deficit(2. 55 %), binocular vision was poor in 87 cases(174 eyes, 4. 35 %).
