The Genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) were used to select the descriptors and to generate the correlation models that relate the structural features to the biological activities. The final equations consist of 15 and 10 molecular descriptors calculated using the paDEL molecular descriptor software.

40|$|Abstract—E-commerce {{has become}} a {{thriving}} business model. With easy access to various tools and third-party cashiers, it is straightforward to create and launch e-commerce web applica-tions. However, it remains difficult to create secure ones. While third-party cashiers help bridge the gap of trustiness between merchants and customers, the involvement of cashiers as a new party complicates logic flows of checkout processes. Even a small loophole in a checkout process may lead to financial loss of merchants, thus logic vulnerabilities pose serious threats {{to the security of}} e-commerce applications. Performing manual code reviews is challenging because of the diversity of logic flows and the sophistication of checkout processes. Consequently, it is important to develop automated detection techniques. This paper proposes the first static detection of logic vulner-abilities in e-commerce web applications. The main difficulty of automated detection is the lack of a general and precise notion of correct payment logic. Our key insight is that secure checkout processes share a common invariant: A checkout process is secure when it guarantees the integrity and authenticity of critical payment status (<b>order</b> <b>ID,</b> order total, merchant ID and currency). Our approach combines symbolic execution and taint analysis to detect violations of the invariant by tracking tainted payment status and analyzing critical logic flows among merchants, cashiers and users. We have implemented a symbolic execution framework for PHP. In our evaluation of 22 unique payment modules, our tool detected 12 logic vulnerabilities, 11 of which are new. We have also performed successful proof-of-concept experiments on live websites to confirm our findings. I...|$|E
40|$|Present {{value based}} asset pricing models are {{explored}} empirically in this thesis. Three contributions are made. First, it is {{shown that a}} market timing strategy may be implemented in an excessively volatile market such as the S&P 500. The main premise of the strategy is that asset prices may revert to the present value over time. The present value is computed in real-time where the present value variables (future dividends, dividend growth and the discount factor) are forecast from simple models. The strategy works well for monthly data and when dividends are forecast from autoregressive models. The performance of the strategy relies on how discount rates are empirically defined. When discount rates are defined by the rolling and recursive historic average of realized returns, the strategy performs well. The discount rate and dividend growth can also be derived using a structural approach. Using the Campbell and Shiller log-linearized present value equation, and assuming that expected and realized dividend growth are unit related, a state space model is constructed linking the price-dividend ratio to expected returns and expected dividend growth. The model parameters are estimated from the data and, are used to derive the filtered expected returns and expected dividend growth series. The present value is computed using the filtered series. The trading rule tends to perform worse in this case. Discount rates are again {{found to be the}} major determinant of its success. Although the structural approach offers a time series of discount rates which is less volatile, it is on average higher than that of the historical mean model. The filtered expected returns is a potential predictor of realized returns. The predictive performance of expected returns is compared to that of the price-dividend ratio. It is found that expected returns is not superior to the price-dividend ratio in forecasting returns both in-sample and out-of-sample. The predictive regression included both simple Ordinary Least Squares and Vector Autoregressions. The second contribution of this thesis is the modeling of expected returns using autoregressive fractionally integrated processes. According to the work of Granger and Joyeux(1980), aggregated series which are derived from utility maximization problems follow a Beta distribution. In the time series literature, it implies that the series may have a fractional <b>order</b> (<b>I(d)).</b> Autoregressive fractionally models may have better appeal than models which explicitly posit unit roots or no unit roots. Two models are presented. The first model, which incorporates an ARFIMA(p,d,q) within the present value through the state equations, is found to be highly unstable. Small sample size may be a reason for this finding. The second model involves predicting dividend growth from simple OLS models, and sequentially netting expected returns from the present value model. Based on the previous finding that expected returns may be a long memory process, the third contribution of this thesis derives a test of long memory based on the asymptotic properties of the variance of aggregated series {{in the context of the}} Geweke Porter-Hudak (1982) semiparametric estimator. The test makes use of the fact that pure long memory process will have the same autocorrelation across observations if the observations are drawn at repeated intervals to make a new series. The test is implemented using the Sieve-AR bootstrap which accommodates long range dependence in stochastic processes. The test is relatively powerful against both linear and nonlinear specifications in large samples. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceUniversity of ExeterGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

We develop a model in which limit order traders have {{asymmetric}} information {{on the cost of}} limit order trading (which is determined by the exposure to informed trading).

Informed bidders exploit this effect by bidding as if the cost of liquidity provision were large when indeed it is small. This bluffing strategy is less effective when traders cannot distinguish between informative and uninformative limit orders. Hence informed bidders act more competitively in the anonymous market.

Our empirical analysis is based on a model of limit order trading in which traders have information on future price volatility. As limit orders have option-like features, this information is valuable for limit order traders. We analyze limit order traders' bidding strategies in 2 different market structures : (a) an anonymous market (limit <b>order</b> traders' <b>IDs</b> are concealed) and (b) a non-anonymous market (traders' IDs are disclosed). Limit order traders bid less aggressively when they expect volatility to rise. For this reason, in either market design, an increase in the bid-ask spread foreshadows increased volatility. Moreover, when information on future volatility is public, the informational content of the bid-ask spread and market liquidity are identical in each market structure. In contrast, when some traders possess superior information on future volatility, a switch to anonymity alters the informational content of the bid-ask spread and market liquidity. For our sample stocks, we find that the switch to anonymity in Euronext paris has significantly reduced the average quoted spread and the average effective spread. We also find that the size of the bid-ask spread is positively related the magnitude of future price movements. But the strength of this association is weaker after the switch to anonymity. Overall, the empirical findings are consistent with the version of our model in which traders possess private information about future volatility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Implementations {{of state}} machine {{replication}} are prevalently using variants of Paxos or other leader-based protocols. Typically these protocols are also leader-centric, {{in the sense}} that the leader performs more work than the non-leader replicas. Such protocols scale poorly, because as the number of replicas or the load on the system increases, the leader replica quickly reaches the limits of one of its resources. In this paper we show that much of the work performed by the leader in a leadercentric protocol can in fact be evenly distributed among all the replicas, thereby leaving the leader only with minimal additional workload. This is done (i) by distributing the work of handling client communication among all replicas, (ii) by disseminating client requests among replicas in a distributed fashion, and (iii) by executing the <b>ordering</b> protocol on <b>ids.</b> We derive a variant of Paxos incorporating these ideas. Compared to leader-centric protocols, our protocol not only achieves significantly higher throughput for any given number of replicas, but also increases its throughput with the number of replicas...|$|R
