Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon Charles W.

Under the 1876 Texas Constitution, which he had helped write, the governor was granted the power to be commander-in-chief, to convene the legislature, to act as executor of the laws, to direct trade with other states, to grant pardons, and to veto bills. His campaign had focused on land use reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues.

40|$|In {{the context}} of globalization, finance often seems to be all number but it is {{fundamentally}} social rather than mathematical. It {{is a product of}} society. Modern finance consists of promises that are accepted. The Latin root of “Credit” illustrates this aspect –credere is to believe or entrust.

This paper upholds the view that finance cannot be separated from risk. The opposite of risk is confidence. Finance harmonizes these opposites when risk is sufficiently offset by confidence, transactions occur and value is created. Finance therefore cannot exist without confidence. The relationship between value risk and confidence is triangular. In {{the context of}} globalization, finance often seems to be all number but it is fundamentally social rather than mathematical.

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky {{threatened}} to sue Shenandoah <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, {{which led to the}} band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than 2 million dollars on court settlements and legal fees. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label.|$|E
5|$|He {{then set}} about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the {{geometrical}} rate law and assuming an egg-shaped ovoid orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon {{the idea of}} an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked. Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus—Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova, though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.|$|E
