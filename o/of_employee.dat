5|$|On December 9, 2003, the Stellamare, a Dutch-owned ship, capsized at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The {{ship was}} hauling General Electric {{generators}} when it overturned. The United States Coast Guard determined that poor communication {{resulting from the}} supervisors speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian, with English {{being used as a}} relay, was a contributing factor to mismanagement of ballast tanks. In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper. This in turn led to investigations <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and a maintenance foreman for larceny. In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association. One award was for customer satisfaction and the other for being the most improved port in the United States for handling heavy lift cargo.|$|E

50|$|Part-time and {{temporary}} employees are counted {{the same as}} full-time employees. § 121.106(b)(2). Where the number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> fluctuates {{over the course of}} a year, the number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> may be taken to be the average number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> over the preceding 12 calendar months. § 121.106(b)(1). The average number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> a business concern with affiliates is calculated by adding the average number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the business concern with the average number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> each affiliate. § 121.106(b)(4)(i). If a concern has acquired an affiliate or been acquired as an affiliate during the applicable period of measurement or before the date on which it self-certified as small, the employees counted in determining size status include the <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the acquired or acquiring concern. Furthermore, this aggregation applies for the entire period of measurement, not just the period after the affiliation arose. The <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> a former affiliate are not counted if affiliation ceased before the date used for determining size. § 121.106(b)(4)(ii). This exclusion <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> a former affiliate applies during the entire period of measurement, rather than only for the period after which affiliation ceased.|$|R

25|$|In 2013, {{the average}} teacher salary in Boyertown Area School District was $54,585 a year. The {{district}} employed 611 teachers and administrators, {{with a top}} salary of $165,000. Pennsylvania teacher salaries (2013–14) are searchable in a statewide database provided by TribLive News. Boyertown Area School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, Pennsylvania public school teachers and administrators can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment.
