5|$|I {{believe that}} my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E
5|$|As Link and his clones {{wander the}} overworld of Hyrule Field on {{their quest to}} restore peace to Hyrule, they learn that the {{creation}} of Link's evil counterpart and the release of Vaati is only a small part in an insidious plot to take control of Hyrule. Things complicate as the dimension of the Dark World appears and people are being abducted throughout Hyrule. The four Links learn that not <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> knights of Hyrule mysteriously disappeared, but evil versions of them have been creating havoc. Hyrule castle has been taken over and monsters are appearing everywhere. The four Links agree that they will defeat Vaati, and then rescue Zelda to restore peace to Hyrule.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Not <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{symbionts}} {{and specific}} species {{been shown to}} shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court, {{reversing}} the Fifth Circuit, {{held that the}} NLRB decision was appropriate because its interpretation of the NLRA was permissible. The Court explained that the NLRB is entrusted with the responsibility to adapt the NLRA to changing times and {{that as a result}} courts reviewing its decisions <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> authority to reject its interpretations of the NLRA if those decisions are impermissible under it. This also led to the Court's observation that the NLRB can change its interpretation of the NLRA over time and is not required to comply with its earlier decisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} {{the option to}} choose which side they wish to command at the {{beginning}} of the game. If the German side is picked, the objective of the game is to evade the Royal Navy fleet by either sailing to Iceland or heading to the safety of Nazi occupied France. The player will <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to control the Bismarck itself, and must defend themselves against Royal Navy and Royal Air Force attacks if compromised. If the British side is chosen, then the player must command the hunting Royal Navy fleet in order to search and destroy the Bismarck. To achieve both these ends, the player will be able to access an in-game command centre, which will give out alerts depending on the side chosen. If controlling the Bismarck, the player will be reported of hostile British U-boat sightings. If controlling the Royal Navy fleet, they will be told of radio intercepts, which will pinpoint the Bismarcks approximate location.|$|E

5|$|Two {{scenes from}} the book were {{ultimately}} excised, with Spielberg removing the opening sequence with Procompsognathus attacking a young child as he previously found it too horrific, and Koepp cutting for budgetary reasons the T. rex chasing Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon. Both parts eventually saw inclusion in the film sequels. Spielberg suggested {{the addition of the}} scene where the T. rex pursues a jeep, which at first would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> characters driving away after listening to the dinosaur's footsteps.|$|E

25|$|The Arlanda Line in its {{entirety}} {{is owned by the}} state-owned Arlanda Infrastructure, which also owns platforms 1 and 2 at StockholmC. A-Train holds a monopoly on the right to transport passengers from Stockholm to Arlanda; other train operators <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to transport passengers to the airport from other towns and cities. In 2008, the cost of a boarding or embarking passenger at ArlandaC was SEK75. This results in a ticket from Uppsala to Arlanda costing SEK136, while a ticket on the same train but traveling onwards to StockholmC only costs SEK64. Similarly the cost of a ticket to the airport with the Arlanda Express is considerably higher than that of a ticket to Uppsala, which is twice as far away.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{word order}} of a Hurrian {{sentence}} is SOV. Within noun phrases, the noun regularly comes at the end. Adjectives, numbers, and genitive modifiers come before the noun they modify. Relative clauses, however, tend to surround the noun, {{which means that the}} noun the relative clause modifies {{stands in the middle of}} the relative clause. Hurrian has at its disposal several paradigms for constructing relative clauses. It can either use the relative pronouns iya and iye, which has already been described under 'pronouns' above, or the nominalising suffix -šše attached to a verb, which undergoes Suffixaufnahme. The third possibility is for both these markers to occur (see example 16 below). The noun, which is represented by the relative clause, can take any case, but within the relative clause can <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> function of the absolutive, i.e. it can only be the subject of an intransitive relative clause or the object of a transitive one.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the 4 RAR/NZ Regimental Medical Officer, Captain Dave Lewis had commandeered a Bell H-13 Sioux light {{observation}} helicopters from 161st Reconnaissance Flight {{and flew}} in {{to assist the}} treatment of the casualties. Despite his efforts however, one of the most badly injured soldiers succumbed to their wounds. The remainder of the casualties were then moved by helicopter to the Australian Field Hospital at Vung Tau. The Australians then called-in artillery fire which was adjusted onto the bunker system, with the 105mm guns of the 104th Field Battery being augmented by those of the 102nd Field Battery in the neighbouring AO, and American 155mm self-propelled guns. A number of air strikes were also directed onto the position, while Reynolds planned an attack to destroy the Viet Cong force. Gradually B Company gained the upper hand and prepared to assault the position, returning heavy fire with small arms while the tanks continued to engage the bunkers from close range. The contact had continued until late afternoon, however with the truce due to come into effect for Tet, American fire support would cease to be available at 17:00, after which a 24-hour cease-fire would commence. Circling overhead in another Sioux helicopter Greville protested, and although Pearson had supported him the Americans refused to provide offensive support despite the contact having been initiated by the Viet Cong. Reynolds could continue the assault if he wished, but he would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> limited fire support from the two tanks capable of firing and the Australian field artillery, while the battalion mortars were out of range and would have been inadequate nonetheless.|$|E
