5|$|Juan José Castelli (July 19, 1764 – October 12, 1812) was an Argentine lawyer. He was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> May Revolution, {{which started}} the Argentine War of Independence. He led an ill-fated {{military}} campaign in Upper Peru.|$|E
5|$|While the Ottomans thus {{temporarily}} therefore {{gained the}} Christian {{regions of the}} disintegrating Safavids, Yesai was blamed for this failure by some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian army as {{they were forced to}} fend for themselves against the Turkish invasions.|$|E
5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. He had some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E

5|$|In {{the group}} of people {{gathered}} below the king, in another acknowledgement of the burghers' importance, is burgher Jan Kiliński (24), one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kościuszko Uprising. To his right, {{at the edge of}} the crowd, is the priest Clemens Maria Hofbauer (25), who ran an orphanage and a school in Warsaw and is canonized as a saint in the Catholic church.|$|E
5|$|An intense {{propaganda}} campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{campaign against}} Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry, and he {{along with other}} magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, convened a trial on 5October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, {{he was forced to}} surrender due to lack of support from the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Aqil angered the kaimakam (district governor) of Acre, Muhammad Kubrisi, for his {{intervention}} {{in a dispute}} between two factions of the Catholic Church in Nazareth. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided {{to take matters into}} his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of sedition. Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the Beni Sakhr tribe.|$|E
5|$|Black Hawk {{and most}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Band were not {{immediately}} captured following {{the conclusion of}} hostilities. On 20 August, Sauk and Fox under Keokuk turned over Neapope and several other British Band chiefs to Winfield Scott at Fort Armstrong. Black Hawk, however, remained elusive. After fleeing the battle scene with White Cloud and {{a small group of}} warriors, Black Hawk had moved northeast toward the headwaters of the La Crosse River. The group camped for a few days and was eventually counseled by a group of Ho-Chunk, which included White Cloud's brother, to surrender. Though they initially resisted the pleas for surrender, the group eventually traveled to the Ho-Chunk village at La Crosse and prepared to surrender. On 27 August 1832, Black Hawk, White Cloud and the remnants of the British Band surrendered to Joseph M. Street at Prairie du Chien.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{served as}} a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then {{relocated}} to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also concerned that he was wavering on {{his belief in the}} doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines of the orthodox Calvinism and became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E

5|$|Béla's and Agnes-Anna's first child, Emeric, {{was born}} in 1174. Emeric's sister, Margaret, who was renamed Maria in Constantinople, {{was born in}} 1175. At the age of nine or ten, she was given in {{marriage}} to the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who was about 30 the time. Maria's husband died in 1204, before the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. Margaret–Maria married one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat, who seized Thessaloniki {{after the fall of}} the Byzantine Empire. Historian Makk writes that in about 1210, Maria married Nicholas I of Saint Omer after the death of Boniface, but scholar Peter Lock says that Saint Omer's wife and Margaret–Maria were not identical.|$|E
5|$|Clark's major {{military}} achievements occurred before his thirtieth birthday. Afterwards, he led militia {{in the opening}} engagements of the Northwest Indian War but was accused of being drunk on duty. He was disgraced and forced to resign, despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations. He left Kentucky {{to live on the}} Indiana frontier but was never fully reimbursed by Virginia for his wartime expenditures. He spent the final decades of his life evading creditors and living in increasing poverty and obscurity. He was involved in two failed attempts to open the Spanish-controlled Mississippi River to American traffic. He became an invalid after suffering a stroke and the amputation of his right leg. He was aided in his final years by family members, including his younger brother William, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lewis and Clark Expedition. He died of a stroke on February 13, 1818.|$|E
5|$|Cutzinas was {{of mixed}} stock: {{his father was}} a Berber, while his mother came from the Romanized {{population}} of North Africa. Following the reconquest of North Africa by the East Roman (Byzantine) Empire in the Vandalic War (533–534), several uprisings by the native Berber tribes occurred in the North African provinces. Cutzinas is mentioned by the eyewitness historian Procopius of Caesarea as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebellion in the province of Byzacena, alongside Esdilasas, Medisinissas and Iourphouthes. In spring 535, however, the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine military commander Solomon in the battles of Mammes and Mount Bourgaon, and Cutzinas was forced to flee west to Mount Aurasium in Numidia, where he sought the protection of the local Berber ruler, Iaudas.|$|E

5|$|De Mena {{was born}} into a Creole family in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, and {{obtained}} her education in the United States before marrying a Nicaraguan and moving to Central America. After a decade in which she raised a daughter and taught school, she divorced, returned to the U.S., and joined the UNIA. Quickly rising in the ranks from a translator, because she was fluent in Spanish, de Mena became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pan-African movement. She was responsible for increasing the membership of the organization in the Caribbean and Latin America. When Garvey left the U.S. and relocated to Jamaica, de Mena became Garvey's official representative in New York and was the first woman to carry such a high distinction in the organization.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{signing the}} Kano Accord, Libya was incensed that the GUNT {{did not include}} any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Volcan Army and had not {{recognized}} Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April {{there had been some}} minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support was provided to the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.|$|E
5|$|Governor Luis Fortuño and his party, New Progressive Party (PNP), campaigned {{in favor}} of the {{proposed}} amendments.

Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, asked voters to participate of the referendum and encouraged them to vote {{in favor of}} the amendments.

5|$|In May 1798, {{the arrest}} of a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Irishmen {{provoked}} the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a widespread uprising across Ireland. The Rebellion took the British authorities by surprise, but the introduction of regular British Army troops rapidly defeated the Irish armies and the last resistance was brought {{to an end in}} September with the surrender of a small French force at the Battle of Ballinamuck. The French authorities had also been taken by surprise by the uprising, and were consequently unprepared: the forces they deployed were inadequate to face the much larger British armies operating in Ireland at the time. News of this defeat had still not reach the continent by October, when a second French invasion force set out. Closely watched by the Royal Navy as soon as it left Brest, the squadron was defeated on 12 October 1798 at the Battle of Tory Island: fewer {{than a third of the}} French ships returned to France.|$|E
5|$|In November 1918, {{soldiers}} from Emir Faisal's army entered Antioch and were welcomed by the city's Arab inhabitants. In late November, French troops {{landed on the}} coast of the Gulf of Alexandretta and entered the city of Alexandretta, prompting anti-French uprisings in Antioch, al-Hamammat and Qirqkhan and the al-Amuq area. In December, French troops occupied Antioch and replaced the Arab flag on its governmental headquarters with the French flag. The revolts continued in the city's countryside, namely in the vicinity of Harbiya and al-Qusayr. The local uprisings spread from the Antioch region to Aleppo's countryside as far as the Euphrates. The rebels consisted of small, disorganized ′iṣābāt (bands) and launched guerrilla-style attacks against French targets, but they also engaged in banditry and highway robberies. An early attempt to coordinate the various rebel groups took place when one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Antiochian uprising and Alawite notable, Najib al-Arsuzi, developed contacts with rebel leaders from Jisr al-Shughur and other areas.|$|E
5|$|Judah Beer was {{a leader}} of the Berlin Jewish {{community}} and maintained a private synagogue in his house which leaned towards reformist views. Jacob Beer wrote an early cantata for performance at this synagogue. Both Judah Herz Beer and his wife were close to the Prussian court; when Amalia was awarded in 1816 the Order of Louise, she was given, by Royal dispensation, not the traditional Cross but a portrait bust of the Queen. The Beer children were provided with a fine education; their tutors included two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enlightened Jewish intelligentsia, the author Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn and Edmund Kley, (later a reform movement rabbi in Hamburg) to whom they remained attached into their maturity. The brothers Alexander von Humboldt, the renowned naturalist, geographer and explorer, and the philosopher, linguist and diplomat Wilhelm von Humboldt were close friends of the family circle.|$|E
