50|$|This {{section is}} more {{specific}} {{with regard to}} how the ground is investigated using methods such as excavating or drilling. Frequency of sampling and testing can be decided with the following in mind, {{the determination of the}} character and structure of all the strata and ground water conditions, the determination of the properties of the strata and the use of special techniques should ‘normal’ techniques not give satisfactory results. Shallow trial pits go to a maximum depth of 4-5 metres, comprehensive records should include the location and orientation of the pit and the face logged. Samples should be taken as soon as the pit is opened and closed as soon as possible properly - there are however advantages to leaving them open for a time. Samples are taken from deep trial pits and shafts at certain sites if necessary and if below the water table can become a more complicated process. Boring augers are in common use. There are two types of rotary drilling, <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> and core drilling. The selection of the type and method used can depend on ground conditions and time and cost constraints. Recovered cores should be maintained as near as possible to its natural state until it is stored. In most cases it is inevitably disturbed. Another method is wash boring which is most applicable to sands, silts, and clays. However, these are not representative of the character and consistency of the penetrated strata. Ground water conditions are determined from water level in boreholes and the use of standpipe, hydraulic, electrical and pneumatic piezometers. Water samples should be representative and stored in appropriate containers. Backfilling should be well compacted to obviate the flow of groundwater to any aquifer below and/or settlement. The use of cement based grout can be used - bentonite is also used to decrease shrinkage. Sampling quality can be classified to determine depending on their disturbance and other factors such as, wet or dry ground. Samplers should conform to the standard. Sampling takes different forms i.e. - continuous sampling, the sand and window sampler and block sampling. Due to the cost of sample acquisition, samples should be treated with great care. Good methods of handling and labelling should be established.|$|E
40|$|Deep {{boreholes}} in {{polar ice}} sheets {{have to be}} filled with a liquid in order to prevent hole closure due to the overburden pressure of the ice. In Greenland, at ice temperatures of - 32 ℃, the limit for <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> is 400 m. In Antarctica, a depth of 900 m has been obtained in an open hole. All drilling to deeper depths needs to be performed in a liquid. The borehole liquid should have a density close to that of ice, be non-toxic, available in quantities at reasonable cost, compatible with the materials in the drill, non-aggressive to ice, and have a low viscosity to allow rapid drill movement in the borehole. In practice, no liquid has been available that can fulfill all the requirements. In the past, ethanol/water mixture, DFA/Glycol, DFA/TCE, JET-A 1 /PCE, DFA/F 113,nbutyl acetate, and D 60 /F 113 have been used. All liquids have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the use of all have involved severe compromises.

30|$|A {{numerical}} example to examine multilateral junction stability in <b>open</b> <b>holes</b> during <b>drilling</b> and production is presented. The oil production process is simulated by applying a drawdown pressure {{at the walls}} of the main and lateral wells. The results show the development of localized failure zone proximate to the area where the two wellbore tracks join, particularly on the side with sharp approaching angle, which would significantly increase the risk of wellbore collapse at the junction. High shear stress concentration around the multilateral junction and drilling-induced damage represent increased risk towards rock failure around the wellbore. Fluid flow due to hydrocarbon production and resulting pore pressure depletion further increase the stress concentration and therefore may lead to failure at the junction.|$|R

30|$|Blowout preventers {{have several}} functions, {{but the most}} {{important}} is the ability to prevent large blowouts of hydrocarbons from the well (Østby 2008). Kick is described as the unwanted influx of formation fluid into a wellbore during drilling operation as a result of pressure differences in the wellbore. This influx is unwanted because it can flow to the surface and create a blowout, harming people, the environment and causing property damage (Januarilham 2012). Kicks are early signs of potentially disastrous blowouts (Ajienka and Owolabi 1991), and there are several cases where such blowouts may occur, including high pressure in the well and platform drift-off (Østby 2008). In the event of primary control loss resulting from a sudden increase in formation pressure or lost circulation, it becomes necessary to seal off the well by some other means to prevent uncontrollable flow, or blowout, of formation fluids (Vujasinovic 1986). The blowout preventer (BOP) is one of several barriers in the well to prevent kicks and blowouts and is the most important and critical piece of equipment as it is the last line of protection against blowouts during well interventions (Januarilham 2012). It may be defined as one or more valves installed at the wellhead to prevent the escape of pressure, either in the annular space between the casing and the drill pipe or in the <b>open</b> <b>hole</b> during <b>drilling</b> or completion operations (Huse and Alme 2013).|$|R

McLean and Addis (1994) used finite element methods to predict wellbore stability parameters. Chatterjee and Mukhopadhyay (2003) used ANSYS finite element software and investigated stress around a wellbore to {{study the effects of}} fluid pressure during drilling. Hoang et al. (2004) investigated wellbore stability in multilateral junctions using finite element method and showed that orientation of junction and in situ stresses both have significant impact on well completion and stability. Wang and Sterling (2007) performed numerical analyses named finite element to investigate the stability of a borehole wall during horizontal directional drilling in loose sand with an emphasis {{on the role of the}} filter cake in borehole stability. Muller et al. (2007) performed wellbore stability analysis with a finite element program that incorporates coupled fluid-mechanical effects and elastoplastic behavior of the rock. Alberto et al. (Alberto and Sepehrnoori 2008) used commercial finite element software to investigate wellbore stability in multilateral <b>open</b> <b>holes</b> during <b>drilling</b> and production times and concluded that the most unstable region in multilaterals is the junctions (lateral wells).

40|$|Drilling is a {{standard}} process for producing holes in metal materials. With an increased hole depth the demands increase on both machine and tool. Deep <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> is a complex process which ischaracterized by a high metal removal rate and hole accuracy. A hole deeper than ten times the diameter {{can be considered a}} deep hole which requires a specialized drilling technique. During adeep <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> process, the forces generated on the deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> give a rise to a resultant radial force. The resultant radial force pushes the drill in a radial direction during a drilling operation. The radial force direction is of crucial importance in regard of tool guidance, stability and hole size accuracy. This force affects tool performance, reduces tool life and has an impact on the bore surface. Due to the complex nature of deep <b>hole</b> <b>drilling,</b> Sandvik Coromant wishes to get {{a better understanding of how}} their current deep <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> tools are balanced. The purpose of this study is to conduct a survey of a number of drills of Sandvik Coromant deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> assortment.

The forces are calculated with the aid of a calculation program and test-runs on a number of drills. This report presents the calculated magnitude and direction of the resultant radial force duringentrance, full intersection and at the exit of the workpiece. In addition to the measured values of theresultant radial force during entry and full intersection. Four different drill geometries are evaluated which of two are competitor <b>drills.</b> A deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> geometry is re-modified in aspect to drill stability based on the outcome of the measured and calculated results.
