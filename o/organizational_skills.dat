5|$|In 1950, the ACLU {{board of}} {{directors}} asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling that he lacked the <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> to lead the 9,000 (and growing) member organization. Baldwin objected, but {{a majority of the}} board elected to remove him from the position, and he was replaced by Patrick Murphy Malin. Under Malin's guidance, membership tripled to 30,000 by 1955the start of a 24-year period of continual growth leading to 275,000 members in 1974. Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates.|$|E
5|$|White middle-class Indiana women learned <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> {{through the}} {{suffrage}} and temperance movements. By the 1890s they were applying their new {{skills to the}} needs of their home communities, by organizing women's clubs, the combined literary activity with social activism focused on such needs as public health, sanitation, and good schools. Hoosier women worked at both {{the state and local level}} to materialize Progressive Era reforms. In Lafayette, for example, the suffragists concentrated in the Lafayette Franchise League, while those oriented toward social concerns worked through the Lafayette Charity Organization Society (LCOS), the Free Kindergarten and Industrial School Association (FKISA), and the Martha Home. Albion Fellows Bacon led statewide and national efforts at housing reform. A native of Evansville, Bacon worked to pass tenement and housing legislation in Indiana in 1909, 1913, and 1917. She also held leadership roles in Indiana Child Welfare Association; the Child Welfare Committee, a part of the Women's Section of the Indiana State Council of Defense; the Indiana Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Juvenile Advisory Commission of Indiana's Probation Department. Women in Indiana would officially gain the right to vote in 1920 when the 19th Amendment is ratified for the United States constitution.|$|E

Evidence of the plant's minimal cognition of spacial awareness {{can be seen in}} their root allocation in regards to neighboring plants. The organization of these roots have been found to originate from the root tip of plants.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Pompey is usually {{considered}} an outstanding strategist and organizer, who could win campaigns without displaying genius on the battlefield, but simply by constantly outmaneuvering his opponents and gradually pushing {{them into a}} desperate situation. Pompey was a great forward planner, and had tremendous <b>organizational</b> <b>skill,</b> which allowed him to devise grand strategies and operate effectively with large armies.

50|$|A Midwife's Tale was {{not only}} methodologically {{influential}} for scholars, but also theoretically important. By showing clearly the economic contributions that midwives made to their households and local communities, and demonstrating the <b>organizational</b> <b>skill</b> of multitasking {{as a source of}} female empowerment, the book revises the understanding of prescribed gender roles. While A Midwife's Tale is obviously limited in terms of time (1785-1812) and place (rural Maine), it has attracted sustained attention of historians—especially those interested in gender relations and wage-earning, the economic value of domestic labor, and women's work before industrialization.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese people's {{feeling of}} {{dependence}} lessened gradually as the disastrous results of World War II subsided {{into the background}} and trade with the United States expanded.

This situation {{gave rise to a}} general desire for greater independence from United States influence. During the 1950s and 1960s, this feeling was especially evident in the Japanese attitude toward United States military bases on the four main islands of Japan and in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying the southern two-thirds of the Ryukyu Islands.|$|R

Certainly the <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> she learned as the Praemonstratrix of the Golden Dawn served Farr in her new position, and due to her tolerance and respect for the Tamil traditions, the school thrived under her administration.

25|$|Franklin's {{parents were}} both pious Puritans. The family {{attended}} the Old South Church, {{the most liberal}} Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706.

Franklin's first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a widely known sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather, but his <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.|$|E

25|$|Some {{governments have}} begun to {{approach}} slums as a possible opportunity to urban development by slum upgrading. This approach was inspired {{in part by the}} theoretical writings of John Turner in 1972. The approach seeks to upgrade the slum with basic infrastructure such as sanitation, safe drinking water, safe electricity distribution, paved roads, rain water drainage system, and bus/metro stops. The assumption behind this approach is that if slums are given basic services and tenure security – that is, the slum will not be destroyed and slum residents will not be evicted, then the residents will rebuild their own housing, engage their slum community to live better, and over time attract investment from government organizations and businesses. Turner argued to demolish the housing, but to improve the environment: if governments can clear existing slums of unsanitary human waste, polluted water and litter, and from muddy unlit lanes, {{they do not have to}} worry about the shanty housing. Squatters have shown great <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> in terms of land management and will maintain the infrastructure that is provided.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s the European powers had {{divided up}} {{almost all of}} Africa (only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of {{nationalism}} grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria, Kenya and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of nationalism drew upon the <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.|$|E
25|$|Camp Bucca {{has been}} {{described}} as playing an important role in shaping the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The detention of large numbers of Jihadists and ex-Ba’athists during the Iraqi insurgency provided them with the opportunity to forge alliances and learn from each other, combining the ideological fervour of the former with the <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> of the latter. Former Camp Bucca detainees who went on to become leaders in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant include Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, detained between 2005 and 2010 during the Iraq conflict and who is now an ISIS senior leader, its chief spokesman and is said to be running the entire country of Syria. Al-Adnani, in 2014, called for lone wolf attacks throughout the world and is thought to be the inspiration for terrorist attacks throughout France. He was killed in an airstrike in Northern Syria on 31 August 2016. Others include Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the ISIL; Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, al-Baghdadi's deputy; Haji Bakr, who spearheaded ISIL's expansion into Syria; Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi, the military leader responsible for planning the seizure of Mosul; and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another senior military leader.
