5|$|Gilbert's final {{disposition}} of the libretto came in 1911, when it {{was included in the}} fourth volume <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Original</b> Plays. However, Gilbert died before he could correct proofs for that edition, and so it reprinted the 1871 text, correcting only a few spelling mistakes.|$|E
5|$|Tandy's {{home was}} struck by fire in 1962, and most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> {{paintings}} and sketches were destroyed. As a result, the Tandy dust-jackets are considered very valuable by collectors.|$|E
5|$|The John Deere House and Shop {{is located}} in the unincorporated village of Grand Detour, Illinois, near the Lee County city of Dixon. The site is known as the {{location}} where the first steel plow was invented by John Deere in 1837. The site includes Deere's house, a replica <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> blacksmith shop, a gift shop, and an archaeological exhibit showing the excavation site <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> blacksmith shop. The Deere House and Shop is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it joined that list in 1966, the year the Register was established. Prior to that, it was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964.|$|E

5000|$|Scott Yanow of Allmusic states: [...] "Giuffre {{is heard}} on clarinet, tenor, soprano, flute and bass flute on eight obscure pieces, {{including}} four <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals.</b> Although often electronic, the music has the typical thoughtfulness of Giuffre's relaxed approach and some picturesque moments".|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars with its review by Scott Yanow stating, [...] "This is a {{particularly}} strong solo performance by the unique pianist Randy Weston. He interprets eight <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals,</b> all <b>of</b> which are to an extent influenced by African music".|$|R
5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Tippett {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society. The {{following}} few years saw journeys to Java and Bali—where he was much attracted by the sounds of gamelan ensembles—and to Australia, where he conducted a performance of his Fourth Symphony in Adelaide. In 1979, with funds available {{from the sale of}} some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those scholarship recruits that signed early, former professional baseball player Jai Miller and high school quarterback Luke Del Rio enrolled in order compete for roster spots as invited walk-ons. Miller is a 28-year-old who {{out of high school}} signed to play baseball and football at Stanford, but ended up playing professional baseball out of high school after being drafted by the Florida Marlins in 2003. Based on the terms <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> contract, the Marlins will pay for Miller's tuition at Alabama.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states [...] "Murray {{stretches}} out on four <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> (which clock in between eight and twelve-and-a-half minutes) and shows plenty of fire {{but also a}} healthy dose of lyricism. This is exciting music very much in the avant-garde".|$|R
50|$|During World War I, {{he turned}} some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{paintings}} into postcards, which were sold {{for the benefit}} of soldiers' families, and created posters promoting donations to help victims of the Polish occupation. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> have been lost or destroyed and survive only in the form of these postcards.|$|R
50|$|At {{least one}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{drawings}} {{is on display}} at the Changi Museum and Chapel, Singapore, but the majority <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> are in the permanent collection of the Imperial War Museum, London, along with the works of other POW artists. The best known of these are John Mennie, Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky and Ashley George Old.|$|R
5|$|Several other {{characters}} (such as Bo Peep, RC, Etch, and Wheezy) are only seen in flashbacks or briefly mentioned. The character of Slinky Dog {{appeared to be}} in limbo after the death <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> voice actor Jim Varney on February 10, 2000, three months after Toy Story 2 was released. Varney was replaced by Blake Clark. After Clark was cast to play Slinky Dog, the producers realized that Clark and Varney had coincidentally been close friends since they appeared in the 1989 film Fast Food, making the transition a lot easier.|$|E
5|$|Songs by George Harrison {{contains}} {{the lyrics to}} 60 of Harrison's compositions, for each of which West hand-lettered the words. Harrison provided text commenting on the story behind some of the songs, along with facsimiles <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> lyric sheets. The book was bound inside a black leather cover, and ran to 176 pages, measuring 175 by 250 millimetres.|$|E
5|$|Subjective {{ownership}} {{would occur}} if subjects knowingly chose the letters {{from their own}} name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> study {{were able to find}} a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.|$|E
50|$|Night Dreamer is {{the fourth}} album by American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter. It was {{released}} in November 1964 by Blue Note Records. With a quintet that includes trumpeter Lee Morgan, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Reggie Workman and drummer Elvin Jones, Shorter performed six <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> on this April 29 session.|$|R

5|$|The first {{appearance}} {{of this species}} in the literature was in 1890, under the name Colus fusiformis, when Eduard Fischer wrote a description based on a painting he found in the Paris Museum of Natural History. In his 1944 monograph on the Gasteromycetes of Australia and New Zealand, Gordon Herriot Cunningham considered this naming to be a nomen nudum—not published with an adequate description. However, it was valid under {{the rules of the}} International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. In 1899 Penzig described the species Colus javanicus based on a single specimen found on Java, and a year later Fischer amended the name <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> Colus fusiformis to Colus javanicus, as he was not satisfied with the quality <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> description. Despite his doubts on the validity of his description, his original naming is both legitimate and has priority over C.javanicus.|$|E
5|$|An outspoken {{advocate}} of prohibition, he made substantial {{donations to the}} Prohibition Party and Indiana's prohibitionist leader Frank Hanly. Haynes ran an unsuccessful campaign in Indiana for the U.S. Senate in 1916 as a prohibition candidate and remained active in the party until prohibition became law. Later, he became a philanthropist and served two terms {{as president of the}} YMCA, five years on the Indiana Board of Education, and was {{an active member of the}} Presbyterian church. After his death from complications arising from influenza, his Kokomo mansion was converted into the Elwood Haynes Museum and is open to the public where many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> inventions and automobiles are on display.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness. The amalgamation of these ideas into a theological system involving earlier cosmological theories of yin and yang {{as well as the}} five phases (i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man) was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE). Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E
5000|$|In his Allmusic review, {{music critic}} Scott Yanow wrote [...] "Kelly was renowned as an accompanist, {{but as he}} shows on a set {{including}} three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> and four familiar standards (including [...] "Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise" [...] and [...] "Willow Weep for Me"), {{he was also a}} strong bop-based soloist too. A fine example <b>of</b> <b>his</b> talents." ...|$|R
50|$|In Our Lifetime is {{the third}} album by trumpeter Dave Douglas. It was {{released}} on the New World label in 1995 and features performances by Douglas, Josh Roseman, Chris Speed, Marty Ehrlich, Uri Caine, James Genus and Joey Baron. The album features Douglas' interpretations of three compositions by Booker Little and nine <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "Murray, who doubles here on bass clarinet, tears into five <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> (best known are [...] "Sweet Lovely" [...] and [...] "Flowers for Albert"). The improvising is quite free, exploratory, and {{sometimes}} violent, {{although there are}} a few strong melodies".|$|R
5|$|Brought {{up during}} times of inter-war strife in Germany, Trautmann joined the Luftwaffe early in the Second World War, serving as a paratrooper. He fought on the Eastern Front for three years, earning five medals, {{including}} an Iron Cross. Later in the war, he {{was transferred to the}} Western Front, where he was captured by the British as the war drew to a close. One of only 90 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> 1,000-man regiment to survive the war, he was transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire. Trautmann refused an offer of repatriation, and following his release in 1948, settled in Lancashire, combining farm work with playing goalkeeper for a local football team, St Helens Town.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his defeat}} of Metatron {{and access to}} Heaven having been restored, Castiel {{continues}} to face challenges on a personal and large scale, as some angels prefer to remain on Earth and his stolen Grace continues to consume him. Although Metatron has hinted {{that he may be}} able to help Castiel with a remaining fragment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> Grace, Castiel has rejected the option of making a deal with Metatron to save his own life. Sam and Dean remain ignorant of Castiel's fate, although Crowley is aware of Castiel's condition, at one point killing another angel to transfer her Grace to Castiel so that Castiel could help Sam cure the now-demonic Dean after he was transformed by the Mark of Cain.|$|E
5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which {{found its way}} into the {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> Epimedium monograph.|$|E

50|$|The {{text of the}} {{fragments}} preserved is in very unsatisfactory shape, owing to insufficient collation of the manuscripts. How much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> Alexander himself omitted is difficult to say, {{in view of the}} corrupt state of the text of Eusebius, where most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fragments are to be found. Abydenus—the Christian editor of Alexander’s works—evidently had a different text before him from that which Eusebius possessed.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states [...] "the {{brilliant}} but ill pianist is reunited with the rhythm team {{that he had}} recorded with in 1969... Actually, despite his health problems, Newborn was always superlative on records, and his playing on five straight-ahead standards (including [...] "No Moon at All" [...] and [...] "Love for Sale") and three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> is excellent".|$|R
5|$|His {{social and}} {{political}} activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant {{as the beginning of}} a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> Trilogy, and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte then {{sailed to}} rejoin Sercey and the {{corvette}} Brûle-Gueule at Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for a planned junction with an allied Spanish squadron at Manila. This combined force then attacked an East India Company convoy {{gathering in the}} Pearl River in January 1799, but in the ensuing Macau Incident they were driven off by the Royal Navy escort squadron. Dispirited, Sercey returned westwards to Île de France, narrowly avoiding an unequal battle with a large British squadron blockading the port. On arrival he discovered that Preneuse and Brûle-Gueule were the only ships remaining <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> command, the others having returned to France or been lost in battle.|$|E
5|$|Norman's {{position}} as the Goblin King was quickly usurped by the Goblin Knight (Phil Urich). However, a mysterious man with a bandaged face is soon shown to be selling Goblin-based weaponry globally to attack Parker Industries. This man reveals himself to be Norman Osborn, alive again post-Secret Wars and still planning on getting revenge on Spider-Man. He is revealed to have {{played a part in}} the recent coup of Symkaria. He restores a semblance <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original</b> features via a twisted form of plastic surgery but also resembles the Green Goblin's facets, and intends to release {{a modified version of the}} Goblin formula to turn the whole country into Goblin-powered soldiers programmed to be loyal to him.|$|E
5000|$|Sigmund Freud is {{the clone}} {{of the famous}} Austrian psychologist. He {{commonly}} views the actions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fellow students through the lens <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>original's</b> theories about parental complexes and sexual drives, and always assumes the worst about anti-clone movements. Though {{he does have a}} rather stable place in the main characters' circle of friends due to his intelligence, they are often put off by his constant mockery.|$|R
