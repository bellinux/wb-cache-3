25|$|He {{points out}} that “Christian {{morality}} is not a form of stoicism, or self-denial, or merely a practical philosophy, or a catalogue of sins and faults.

25|$|Four newly raised ranging companies, {{have all}} been organized, and taken their several {{stations}} on our frontier. We are much pleased.

That they may be permanently retained in the service on our frontier is extremely desirable, and we cannot permit <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> doubt such will be the case.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{sidebands}} are on {{both sides}} of the carrier, their count is doubled, and then multiplied by the modulating frequency to find the bandwidth. For example, 3kHz deviation modulated by a 2.2kHz audio tone produces a modulation index of 1.36. Suppose that we limit <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> only those sidebands that have a relative amplitude of at least 0.01. Then, examining the chart shows this modulation index will produce three sidebands. These three sidebands, when doubled, gives us (6 * 2.2kHz) or a 13.2kHz required bandwidth.|$|E
25|$|The Rosary is a devotion for the {{meditation}} of {{the mysteries}} of Jesus and Mary.“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives {{us an opportunity to}} open <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.|$|E

It made sense because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).|$|E

25|$|We may preach till we {{are tired}} of the theme, the {{necessity}} of disinterestedness in republics, without making a single proselyte. The virtuous declaimer will neither persuade himself nor any other person to be content with a double mess of porridge, instead of a reasonable stipend for his services. We might as soon reconcile <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> the Spartan community of goods and wives, to their iron coin, their long beards, or their black broth. There is a total dissimulation in the circumstances, as well as the manners, of society among us; and it is as ridiculous to seek for models in the simple ages of Greece and Rome, as it would be to go in quest of them among the Hottentots and Laplanders.|$|E
25|$|In Section II, Kant {{starts from}} scratch and {{attempts}} to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the Groundwork by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that even when we take <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> be behaving morally, we cannot be at all certain that we are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves {{when it comes to}} evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they are acting merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the fact that we see ourselves as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.|$|E
25|$|Von Hartmann is a pessimist, for {{no other}} view of life recognizes that evil {{necessarily}} belongs to existence and can cease only with existence itself. But {{he is not an}} unmitigated pessimist. The individual's happiness is indeed unattainable either here and now or hereafter and in the future, but he does not despair of ultimately releasing the Unconscious from its sufferings. He differs from Schopenhauer in making salvation collective by the negation of the will to live depend on a collective social effort and not on individualistic asceticism. The conception of a redemption of the Unconscious also supplies the ultimate basis of von Hartmann's ethics. We must provisionally affirm life and devote <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> social evolution, instead of striving after a happiness which is impossible; in so doing we shall find that morality renders life less unhappy than it would otherwise be. Suicide, and all other forms of selfishness, are highly reprehensible. His realism enables him to maintain the reality of Time, and so of the process of the world's redemption.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, in ethics, he {{declared}} that “the original goal (the proton oikeion) towards which we tend is <b>ourselves</b> in relation <b>to</b> <b>ourselves.</b> In agreement with that view, he says {{that we do not}} love anyone in preference <b>to</b> <b>ourselves</b> and finally that we only love others in reference to ourselves”.|$|R

25|$|In October 1980, {{the dozen}} or so {{erstwhile}} nuns held their first fundraiser, a bingo game and Salsa dance that was well-attended {{in large part because of}} the write-up in The San Francisco Chronicle by Herb Caen the same day, who printed their organization name, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The benefit was for San Francisco's Metropolitan Community Church Cuban Refugee Program, and it netted $1,500 ($ in 2009). The Sisters began making regular appearances at Castro events that focused on sexual tolerance or provided a showcase for drag. They also developed a mission statement:The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a leading-edge Order of queer nuns. Since our first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters have devoted <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> community service, ministry and outreach to those on the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual enlightenment. We believe all people have a right to express their unique joy and beauty and we use humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry, complacency and guilt that chain the human spirit.|$|E
25|$|In every discourse, {{whether of}} the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive {{with those of the}} universe itself. But more usually we confine <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.|$|E
25|$|It is true {{there are}} cases in which, if we confine <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> {{the effects of the}} first order, the good will have an incontestable {{preponderance}} over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? … It is not on account of the evil of the first order {{that it is necessary to}} erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.|$|E

25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E
