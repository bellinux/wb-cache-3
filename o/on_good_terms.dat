5|$|Hiroyuki, usually {{referred}} to as Yuki, is a tall and attractive trans woman living with her boyfriend Shiina. Yuki takes an early interest in Yoshino when she believes Yoshino to be a boy, though remains <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with Yoshino even after learning of Yoshino's assigned sex, and gives Shuichi and Yoshino helpful advice when they are troubled. Despite the differences between their situations, Yuki sees a lot of herself in Shuichi: when they were growing up, Shiina was the only friend who stood by the young Hiroyuki, as she was called then, while girls teased her and the boys bullied her to change. Yuki always keeps up a positive attitude, and runs a gay bar. Since her transition, {{she has not been}} <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with her parents, who run a uniform store.|$|E
5|$|Jane Elizabeth Manning James died April 16, 1908, in Salt Lake City. Despite her circumstances, it is {{apparent}} that she died <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with the LDS Church. Church President Joseph F. Smith spoke at her funeral, which, according to The Deseret News, was attended by many.|$|E
5|$|Back in Sicily, Cascioferro {{rose to the}} {{position}} of a local notable. He was the capo elettore (ward heeler) of Domenico De Michele Ferrantelli, the mayor of Burgio and member of Parliament for the district of Bivona, as well as <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with the Baron Inglese. He exercised influence over several Mafia cosche (clans) in the towns of Bisacquino, Burgio, Campofiorito, Chiusa Sclafani, Contessa Entellina, Corleone, and Villafranca Sicula, as well as some districts in the city of Palermo.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, May {{confirmed}} that pre-production work was continuing. He said the band had approved {{a team to}} start filming later in 2011, and Baron Cohen's eagerness had been the key to progress. However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen {{dropped out of the}} role due to creative differences with the members of Queen. May said they had parted <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> and said that the band had felt Cohen's presence would have been distracting.|$|E
5|$|Isa's {{relations}} with Baybars were generally <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms,</b> {{though there were}} occasional exceptions. Isa accompanied al-Mustansir, the newly inaugurated Abbasid caliph, on his Mamluk-sponsored campaign to reclaim Iraq from the Mongols in 1260. However, al-Mustansir was killed en route to Baghdad in a Mongol ambush. The next year, Isa was present in Cairo to bear witness that al-Mustansir's successor and kinsman, al-Hakim, was indeed {{a member of the}} Abbasid line.|$|E
5|$|Jænberht was a monk at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury {{before being}} {{selected}} as abbot of that monastic house. He {{came from a}} prominent family {{in the kingdom of}} Kent, and a kinsman of his, Eadhun, was the reeve of King Egbert II of Kent. Jænberht himself was <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with Egbert.|$|E

5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often {{cooperated with}} Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms,</b> and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, {{in which one}} source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.|$|E
5|$|After John succeeded Richard in 1199, {{he decided}} to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but {{continued}} to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome. Some of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and {{for a short time}} peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two appear to have been <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms,</b> a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent large sums of money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E

5|$|After {{the move}} to Exeter, Leofric worked to {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was {{a supporter of the}} cult of Leo IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo's death.|$|E
5|$|All of McCain's {{family members}} are <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with him, and he has defended them {{against some of the}} {{negative}} consequences of his high-profile political lifestyle. His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV ("Jack") graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the navy. His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in the debate {{about the future of the}} Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc {{had too many}} characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} three o'clock when Roger and Phil came in. As my old readers know, the senator's son and Dave's sister were <b>on</b> unusually <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with each other, and the {{greeting}} between them was very cordial.|$|R
50|$|He was <b>on</b> {{generally}} <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with Daniel O'Connell, {{though the}} latter was to accuse the government of using Blake as a token catholic. Blake's catholic enemies portrayed him as an ambitious layman, with interests inimical to the church.|$|R
50|$|Although divorced, McQuade is <b>on</b> very <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> {{with his}} ex-wife, and loves his teenage {{daughter}} Sally. McQuade {{also seems to}} like Sally's boyfriend Bobby, who is enlisted in the US Army and is respectful of McQuade being a retired Marine.|$|R
5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> afterwards.|$|E
5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with him after the president left office.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was <b>on</b> <b>good</b> <b>terms</b> with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E
