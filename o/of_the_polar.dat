5|$|The {{jet stream}} moves from West to East {{bringing}} changes of weather. Meteorologists now {{understand that the}} path of jet streams affects cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere, and so knowledge of their course has become {{an important part of}} weather forecasting. For example, in 2007 and 2012, Britain experienced severe flooding as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> jet staying south for the summer.|$|E

50|$|Meiotic errors {{can lead}} to {{aneuploidy}} in <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> bodies, which, in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> cases, produces an aneuploid zygote. Errors can occur during either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two meiotic divisions that produce each polar body, but are more pronounced if they occur during <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>polar</b> body, because <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>polar</b> body influences <b>the</b> chromosomal makeup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second. For example, predivision (<b>the</b> separation <b>of</b> chromatids before anaphase) in <b>the</b> first <b>polar</b> body can induce <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> an aneuploid <b>polar</b> body. Therefore, <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>polar</b> body is an especially important factor in forming a healthy zygote.|$|R

5|$|Despite much speculation, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} explanation of either Linnaeus fils or Herbert's thinking. For instance the 'Knight's Star' {{has been compared to}} Linnaeus' decoration as a Knight of the Order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polar</b> Star. The Latin word equestris (of a knight, or horseman) may have been confused with equi (of a horse), or possibly Herbert was making a literary Knight's Move on the Linnaean term. The flower name has even been compared to the mediaeval weapon, the spoked mace or Morning Star which it superficially resembles.|$|E
5|$|Glycerophospholipids, usually {{referred}} to as phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, {{as well as being}} involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based on the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polar</b> and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus {{published}} Species Plantarum, {{the work}} {{which is now}} internationally accepted {{as the starting point}} of modern botanical nomenclature, in 1753. The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year. The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species. The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polar</b> Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order's insignia.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} thought to have diverged from a {{population}} of brown bears, Ursus arctos, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.|$|E
5|$|Taurus {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing the spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> bear. Aldebaran represents the bear, with {{the remainder of the}} stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.|$|E

5|$|The main {{geographical}} {{results of}} the expedition were the discovery of King Edward VII Land; the ascent of the western mountains and the discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polar</b> Plateau; the first sledge journey on the plateau; the Barrier journey to a Furthest South of 82°17′S. The island nature of Ross Island was established, the Transantarctic Mountains were charted to 83°S, and the positions and heights of more than 200 individual mountains were calculated. Many other features and landmarks were also identified and named, and there was extensive coastal survey work.|$|E
5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra and in the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.|$|E
5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the high-pressure areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.|$|E

5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural drift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> ice when, in 1884, he read the theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current, flowing from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1911, Scott {{revealed}} {{his plans for}} the South Pole march. Sixteen men would set out, using the two remaining motor sledges, ponies and dogs for the Barrier stage of the journey, which would bring them to the Beardmore Glacier. At this point the dogs would return to base and the ponies would be shot for food. Thereafter, twelve men in three groups would ascend the glacier and begin the crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> plateau, using man-hauling. Only one of these groups would carry on to the pole; the supporting groups would be sent back at specified latitudes. The composition of the final polar group would be decided by Scott during the journey. For the return journey, Scott ordered that the dogs teams set off again from the base camp to replenish depots and meet the Polar party between latitude 82 and 82.30 on 1 March to assist the party home.|$|E
