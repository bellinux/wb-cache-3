5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Baroni Urbani {{described}} a new Baltic fossil species, {{of which he}} named it Prionomyrmex janzeni. After examining specimens of the new species and Nothomyrmecia macrops, Baroni Urbani stated that the newly described species and Nothomyrmecia macrops {{belong to the same}} genus (Prionomyrmex), in which he synonymised Nothomyrmecia as a genus and treated the tribe Prionomyrmecini as a subfamily, known as Prionomyrmecinae. Prior to this, John S. Clark, the original author who described Nothomyrmecia, noted that the genus was similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex; both the heads and mandibles were identical, but the nodes were different. As the mandibles of Prionomyrmex are similar to that of Nothomyrmecia, this suggests that they are intermediate to each other. This classification was short-lived, as Nothomyrmecia was separated and treated as a valid genus from Prionomyrmex by Dlussky & Perfilieva in 2003, on the base of the fusion of an abdominal segment. Other studies published in the same year came to the same conclusions of Dlussky & Perfilieva, and the subfamily Prionomyrmecinae would later be treated as a tribe in Myrmeciinae. However, Baroni Urbani would treat the tribe as a subfamily again in both his 2005 and 2008 publications, suggesting additional evidence in favor of his former interpretation as <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Ward and Brady's arguments. In 2012, P. wappleri was described by Gennady M. Dlussky, based on a fossilised worker from the Late Oligocene, Aquitanian stage. This subsequent report that described new fossil myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald et al. and Ward & Brady without comment on the views of Baroni Urbani.|$|E

25|$|From 1894 {{difficult}} discussions {{took place}} between the NBR and the Wemyss Estate and its coalmaster tenants. The NBR was continuing to advance the benefits of developing Burntisland, and Wemyss as a Director of the NBR was heartily <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> as being wasteful for the NBR. His position was anomalous as his interests in the WCC were also contrary to any development of harbours elsewhere than at Methil. Conacher and {{a section of the}} NBR directors favoured Burntisland and were reluctant to expend money on developing Methil. The negotiations ended on 20 February 1896 with a thirling agreement (that is, a mutually binding limitation agreement) in which the coalmasters and Wemyss himself undertook for 21 years to ship all their coal from NBR harbours, and not to condone the construction of any rival railway wholly or partly in Fife. Short private colliery railway connections were allowed under the agreement.|$|E
25|$|The 7th Annual Washington State Convention {{was held}} May 4–5, 1907 in Seattle. The first test of {{strength}} came {{shortly after the}} 10:10 am opening, when moderate T.E. Latimer and left winger David Burgess stood off in an election for temporary chairman. Latimer was narrowly defeated by Burgess by a count of 25 to 23 — the best show of strength for the moderates of the convention. The Credentials Committee again brought up the case of Walter Thomas Mills, with the majority reporting that Mills should be denied his seat because he was under charges. This {{was followed by a}} resolution by Seattle left wing delegate J.A. McCorkle that the convention officially note that Mills stood under charges preferred by the Socialist Party of Canada for supporting candidates <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> party in the recent British Columbia provincial elections. A massive storm of protest erupted, with heated debate occupying the entire afternoon session. In the evening session the question was finally called and the convention voted that Mills was indeed under charges by a vote of 47 to 27. Mills recorded a formal protest and an alternate delegate was seated in his stead. The convention reaffirmed the SPW's strict anti-fusion policies and moved state headquarters from Everett to Tacoma. A new State Executive Committee was elected by referendum vote of the membership following completion of the convention.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1992, the UN {{responded to}} Serbian offensives {{in the former}} Yugoslav {{republic}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a full embargo on trade with Serbia by all member nations. The sanctions placed Greece, which had recognized the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina shortly after its declaration in 1992, in a difficult position. Serbia was an important trading partner with strong religious and historical ties to Greece, and Serbia had initially supported the Greek position on the Macedonia naming dispute. Beginning in 1992, the Konstantinos Mitsotakis and Andreas Papandreou governments, fearing that the Bosnian war would spread {{in a direction that}} would involve Turkey, Albania and Greece, undertook long series of peace-negotiations with Serbia's president, Slobodan Milošević, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić, and the Bosnian government without results. Meanwhile, food, oil, and arms were reported moving from Greece into Serbia in violation of the UN embargo. Before, during, and after its 1994 presidency of the EU, Greece was the only EU nation to back the Serbian position that Serbian forces had entered Bosnian territory. In early 1994, Greece incurred the displeasure of its European allies by voting against NATO air strikes on Serbian positions. Greece also refused the use of its NATO air bases at Preveza on the Ionian Sea for such attacks and refused to supply Greek troops to the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. In NATO, Greece's position was diametrically <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Turkey, which supported the Bosnian government.|$|E
500|$|Thomas F. Madden {{represents}} a view almost diametrically <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Asbridge; while the crusade was certainly linked to church reform {{and attempts to}} assert papal authority, he argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, [...] "had suffered mightily {{at the hands of}} the Turks". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam, the significance of which is dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge. Christopher Tyerman incorporates both arguments in his thesis; namely, that the Crusade developed out of church reform and theories of holy war as much as it was a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East. In Jonathan Riley-Smith's view, poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that [...] "most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism".|$|E
500|$|Debussy {{was widely}} {{held to be}} an impressionist {{composer}} – a label he intensely disliked. Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and {{the works of the}} two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre. Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not. Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship. Ravel wrote that Debussy's [...] "genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy... I think I have always personally followed a direction <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of [...] symbolism". During {{the first years of the}} new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works. Nichols calls the quartet [...] "at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence".|$|E

500|$|Robert Francis Engs's Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited: Samuel Chapman Armstrong and Hampton Institute, 1839–1893 is {{the first}} {{biography}} of General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, {{the founder of the}} Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute. The book was published by the University of Tennessee Press in 1999. It challenges several long-standing ideas about this period: that the [...] "Hampton-Tuskegee system" [...] and its adherents stunted the progress of African Americans, that the Hampton Institute ideology was <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of historically black and historically white colleges, and that the positions of W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington were diametrically opposed. Engs writes Armstrong as a symbol of postbellum America's conflicts over race, class, religion, and gender. Engs's Armstrong, in [...] "paternal ... arrogance" [...] believed that he and others of higher status could best determine how to improve the lots of those suppressed by [...] "lack of opportunity and discrimination", such as African Americans and American Indians. This intuition, of knowing [...] "what was best for the freedmen", was influenced by his experience in missionary work, where his parents treated the indigenous Hawaiians as misbehaving children with behavior to be corrected. The biography distills Armstrong's philosophy, demeanor, and understanding of African Americans from his experiences as a missionary, student of Williams College, and leader in the American Civil War. Engs dismisses polarized interpretations of Armstrong's legacy as either a savior or a handicap for uneducated blacks. Instead, Armstrong is portrayed as a complex man who believes both in [...] "black inferiority" [...] and that freedmen could improve their lives through his lessons.|$|E
