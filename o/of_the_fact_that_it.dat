5|$|In April 1936, {{he and the}} Minister of the Interior Ion Inculeț {{allowed the}} a youth {{congress}} to gather in Târgu Mureș, aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was masking a fascist gathering; delegates to the congress, traveling in a special train commissioned by the government, vandalized Ion Duca's memorial plate in Sinaia train station, and, upon their arrival in Târgu Mureș, made public their violent anti-Semitic agenda. It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions, leading {{to the murder of}} Mihai Stelescu, a former associate, in June of the next year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was already being considered {{one of his most}} important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E

5|$|Domitian's {{campaign}} against Dacia was overall unsuccessful; however, the Romans winning {{in a minor}} skirmish allowed him to claim it as a victory, even though he ended up paying the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of eight million sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome, and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian {{had been given the}} title of Imperator for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting that the populace, or at least the senate, was aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been a less than successful war, despite Domitian's claims otherwise. However, in 89AD, Domitian invaded the Iazyges, along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details are known of this war, but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} is whether the name should be Leopoldia. In 1819 Herbert had {{proposed}} Leopoldia as a nomen provisorium (provisional name) for the same taxon as he called Hippeastrum in 1821. Although Leopoldia was subsequently validated (i.e. became the correct name), this was overlooked, and Hippeastrum rather than Leopoldia {{was used for the}} genus of New World amaryllids. Following Filippo Parlatore in 1845, the name Leopoldia was used for a genus of grape hyacinth species, allied to Muscari. In order to preserve the widespread usage of both Hippeastrum and Leopoldia, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed in 1970 that Herbert's Hippeastrum and Parlatore's Leopoldia should be conserved and Herbert's Leopoldia rejected. This was accepted and Hippeastrum Herb. is now a nomen conservandum (conserved name), i.e. the correct name regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not have priority over Leopoldia.|$|E

25|$|The invading German {{force was}} {{equipped}} with 2000 modern war planes, which were deployed on 1 September 1939 at dawn in Operation Wasserkante, thus opening the September Campaign against Poland; there was no declaration of war. The Luftwaffe's first sorties of the war targeted Polish cities with no military targets of any kind; for example, the city of Wieluń was destroyed almost completely by 70 metric tons of munitions dropped within several hours in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had no strategic importance to the Germans, {{and the city of}} Warsaw was bombed as well.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a former}} Wall Street Journal columnist, figures used in human {{trafficking}} estimates rarely have identifiable sources or transparent methodologies behind them and in most (if not all) instances, they are mere guesses. Dumienski and Laura Agustin argue {{that this is a}} result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is impossible to produce reliable statistics on a phenomenon happening in the shadow economy. According to a UNESCO Bangkok researcher, statistics on human trafficking may be unreliable due to overrepresentation of sex trafficking. As an example, he cites flaws in Thai statistics, who discount men from their official numbers because by law they cannot be considered trafficking victims due to their gender.|$|E
25|$|The Shinkansen {{has used}} the {{electric}} multiple unit configuration from the outset, with the 0 Series Shinkansen having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations (e.g. Talgo used the locomotive configuration with the AVE Class 102 and continues with it for the Talgo AVRIL on account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is not possible to}} use powered bogies as part of the Talgo Pendular system). In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.|$|E

25|$|Milan {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} clubs in Italy, having won a total of 30 major domestic trophies, and was the most successful club in the world in terms of international trophies with 18 trophies until February 2014, when Al Ahly SC claimed that title (now this title is claimed by Real Madrid with 23 official international trophies). It is now the third-most successful club behind Real Madrid (23) and Al Ahly (20). Milan has earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has won at least ten scudetti. In addition, the club is permanently allowed to display a multiple-winner badge on its shirt as it has won more than five European Championship Cups.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{fields are}} {{possible}} by optimising the spherical design {{to take account}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is composed of point dipoles (and not line dipoles). This results in the stretching of the sphere to an elliptical shape and having a non-uniform distribution of magnetization over the component parts of the sphere. Using this method, as well as soft pole pieces within the design, 4.5T in a working volume of 20mm3 was achieved by Bloch et al. in 1998, and this was increased further to 5T in 2002, although over a smaller working volume of 0.05mm3. As hard materials are temperature-dependent, refrigeration of the entire magnet array can increase the field within the working area further as shown by Kumada et al. This group also reported development of a 5.16T Halbach dipole cylinder in 2003.|$|E
25|$|S. septentrionalis is preyed upon by {{numerous}} species. This is largely because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> resides at {{an elevation of}} 300 meters above sea level, a lower elevation than most paper wasps. Specifically, army ants will regularly feed on them along with other species of paper wasps. This prevalent predation has resulted in S. septentrionalis making numerous adaptations, some of which include forming a complex nest structure, choosing a nest-site that reduces exposure to predators, and establishing defensive mechanisms. S. septentrionalis has also been known to defend against army ants by piling their bodies up against the nest entrance. However, army ant predation can be extreme enough to regulate the density of a colony and keep populations of S. septentrionalis and other species of paper wasps regulated.|$|E

25|$|But now {{suppose that}} the {{electrons}} in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed {{on one side of}} the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −eV added to it, where −e is the charge of the electron and V the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the many}} Gothic {{sculpture}}s {{from the early}} 16th century, the Archangel Gabriel, crucifixion and small sculpture of Christ sufferer by Master Paul have been preserved. The original sculpture of Calvary on beam of triumphal arch allegedly damaged fire in the 17th century. The monumental sculpture of the crucified has extremely high artistic quality and its dramatic expressive comprehension is the evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was created {{under the influence of}} German art {{in the first half of}} the 14th century. From the Gothic wing altars on both sides 14 painted panels were preserved, originally belonged to the altar of St. Nicholas and the Virgin Mary. They are traditionally attributed to craftsman Peter and Albert Molers from Presov; they worked on them in 1497-1506. Older written sources mention also the panel painting of St. Anny Samotretia who got to Nemzeti Museum in Budapest. A Gothic temple facilities also include mural paintings on the north wall of the middle presbytery from the late 15th and the early 16th century, which displays a knight on horseback and female figures.|$|E
25|$|From {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} through most of the 20th century, this part of Mexico City {{suffered}} a severe decline. This house was adapted to rent space to lower-class tenants and by end of the 1950s had become tenements, in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been declared a national monument in 1931. In 1960, the Mexico City government acquired the building from the descendents of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya in 1960. The City decided to convert this building into a museum. It hired architect Pedro Ramirez Vazques to remodel it, converting the old rooms into exhibition halls. In 1964, the Museum of the City of Mexico was inaugurated, focusing on what Mexico City was and what Mexico City hoped to be. However, by 1992, the Museum was in disarray. The museum closed and there were plans to convert it into lodging for guests of the city, but this never came to pass. In 1997, the Museum was reorganized and reopened dedicated to exhibitions about Mexico City's past, present and future, working in cooperation with the Museo Nacional de Antropología, the Museo de Arte Moderno the Museo de Virreinato and the Galería de Historia.|$|E
