40|$|Abstract: Although {{established}} as a mainstream mechanism for delivering public services, the adoption of electronic government (e-government) has not been uniform. One of the problems mentioned in prior research relates {{to the fact that}} e-government services are perceived as being distant and impersonal from a user or citizen perspective. In this paper, the authors argue that complementing existing e-government services {{through the use of a}} video-to-video platform could alleviate this problem. This paper presents the concept of the LiveCity project which proposes the delivery of high definition video over existing Internet infrastructure to enhance public services. The potential benefits of <b>overlaying</b> <b>video</b> on top of e-government applications are examined through use case scenarios. ...|$|R

25|$|DirectShow 6.0, {{released}} {{as part of}} DirectX Media introduced the Overlay Mixer renderer designed for DVD playback and broadcast video streams with closed captioning and subtitles. The Overlay Mixer uses DirectDraw 5 for rendering. Downstream connection with the Video Renderer is required for window management. Overlay Mixer also supports Video Port Extensions (VPE), enabling it to work with analog TV tuners with <b>overlay</b> capability (sending <b>video</b> directly to a video card via an analog link rather than via the PCI bus). Overlay Mixer also supports DXVA connections. Because it always renders in <b>overlay,</b> full-screen <b>video</b> to TV-out is always activated.|$|R

40|$|Combining the {{advantages}} of Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) content distribution concept and metadata driven adaptation of videos in compressed domain, in this paper, we propose a simple but scalable design of distributed adaptation and overlay streaming using MPEG- 21 gBSD, called DAg-stream. The objective {{is not only to}} shift the bandwidth burden to end participating peers, but also to move the computation load for adapting video contents away from dedicated media-streaming/adaptation servers. It is an initiative to merge the adaptation operations and the P 2 P streaming basics to support the expansion of context-aware mobile P 2 P systems. DAg-stream organizes mobile and heterogeneous peers into <b>overlays.</b> For each <b>video,</b> a separate <b>overlay</b> is formed. No control message is exchanged among peers for overlay maintenance. We present a combination of infrastructure-centric and application end-point architecture. The infrastructure-centric architecture refers to a tree controller, named DAg-master, which is responsible for tree/overlay administering and maintenance. The application end-point architecture refers to video sharing, streaming and adaptation by the participating resourceful peers. The motivation for this work is based on the experiences and lessons learned so far about developing a video adaptation system for heterogeneous devices. In this article, we present our architecture and some experimental evaluations supporting the design concept for <b>overlay</b> <b>video</b> streaming and online adaptation...|$|R

40|$|While a tree {{topology}} is often advocated for <b>overlay</b> <b>video</b> streaming {{due to its}} scalability, it suffers from discontinuous playback under highly dynamic network environments. On the other hand, gossip protocols using random message dissemination, though robust, fail to meet the real-time constraints for streaming applications. In this master thesis, I proposed TAG, a Tree-Assisted Gossip protocol, which adopts a tree structure with time indexing to accommodate asynchronous requests, and an efficient pull-based gossip algorithm to mitigate the impact of network dynamicity. It seamlessly integrates these two approaches and realizes their best features, namely, low delay with a regular {{tree topology}}, and robust delivery with smart switching among multiple paths, thus making effective use of the available bandwidth. Performance of TAG was evaluated under various settings, and the results demonstrate that it is quite robust {{in the presence of}} local and global bandwidth fluctuations...|$|R

The driver software informs the <b>video</b> <b>overlay</b> device about the desired position of the video window on screen. Because of the much greater processing power of modern graphics cards, and the awkwardness of adding additional analog hardware signal processing path, this method is now little used.|$|R
