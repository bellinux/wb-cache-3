5|$|About 6% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> {{epilepsy}} have seizures {{that are}} often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} social and {{psychological}} well-being. These effects may include social isolation, stigmatization, or disability. They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes. Learning disabilities are common in those with the condition, and especially among children with epilepsy. The stigma of epilepsy can also affect the families <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> the disorder.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common serious {{neurological}} disorders affecting about 39 million people as of 2015. It affects 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. It is more common in males than females with the overall difference being small. Most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> the disorder (80%) are in the developing world.|$|E

5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, {{most of the time}} they have the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome and 90% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|More than 40% {{of people}} with {{cirrhosis}} develop hepatic encephalopathy. More than half <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> cirrhosis and significant HE live less than a year.

5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with {{low back pain}}. Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{progressive}} MS {{occurs in}} around 65% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission. Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear. The most common {{length of time}} between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19years.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> a chlamydial infection and 40 percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Although spiders {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. Spiders will only bite humans in self-defense, and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee-sting. Most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> medically serious bites, such as recluse spiders and widow spiders, would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years. They have been deemed to be the world's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% {{of individuals}} with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> autism, and are considered core features by some, {{although there is no}} good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.|$|E

5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> plantar fasciitis.

The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
