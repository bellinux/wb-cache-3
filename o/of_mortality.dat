5|$|According to a 2005 review, due to {{the high}} levels <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> and {{morbidity}} caused by malaria—especially the P.falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, {{and the absence of}} Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{interpreted as}} the result of a single catastrophe, the Bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events. According to this interpretation, at least three occasions <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> are recorded, and though numerous individuals would have died in a geologically short time span (?10–100 years), this does not necessarily mean these Iguanodon were herding animals.|$|E
40|$|In this Bachelor thesis {{there is}} the {{development}} <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> in the Czech Republic documented by basic indicators <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> in the period 1950 - 2009. There are also the indicators <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> compared and position of the Czech Republic among select countries was determined. In conclusion, the development and intensity <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> <b>of</b> the Czech Republic is compared with the development and intensity <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> <b>of</b> Slovakia. In the part the method of biometric analysis <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> is applied. An alternative approach of finding {{the location of the}} line representing endogenous deaths through the differences of cumulative number of deaths is suggested for this method...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{regional}} differentiation <b>of</b> avoidable <b>mortality</b> in the Czech Republic Abstract The main {{goal of the}} thesis is the evaluation of development <b>of</b> avoidable <b>mortality</b> in the Czech Republic during 1994 - 2012. According to concept <b>of</b> avoidable <b>mortality</b> {{there are two main}} categories which differ among the authors in terms of selection of avoidable causes of deaths. Indicators based on category <b>of</b> preventable <b>mortality</b> show efficiency <b>of</b> prevention, indicators based on category <b>of</b> treatable <b>mortality</b> correspond with quality of health care and health policies. The intention is to compare a development <b>of</b> avoidable <b>mortality</b> from three different aspects using three different lists of causes of avoidable deaths focusing on regional differentiation. Results of the thesis indicate that the intensity <b>of</b> avoidable <b>mortality</b> was declining during 1994 - 2012 in all the regions. The level <b>of</b> this <b>mortality</b> differed depending on a list of avoidable causes of deaths and also among districts.

5|$|Coyotes rarely kill healthy adult red foxes, {{and have}} been {{observed}} to feed or den alongside them, though they often kill foxes caught in traps. Coyotes may kill fox kits, {{but this is not}} a major source <b>of</b> <b>mortality.</b> In southern California, coyotes frequently kill gray foxes, and these smaller canids tend to avoid areas with high coyote densities.|$|E

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes {{are still}} widely persecuted as pests, with human-caused deaths {{among the highest}} causes <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in the species. Annual fox kills are: UK 21,500–25,000 (2000); Germany 600,000 (2000–2001); Austria 58,000 (2000–2001); Sweden 58,000 (1999–2000); Finland 56,000 (2000–2001); Denmark 50,000 (1976–1977); Switzerland 34,832 (2001); Norway 17,000 (2000–2001); Saskatchewan (Canada) 2,000 (2000–2001); Nova Scotia (Canada) 491 (2000–2001); Minnesota (US) 4,000-8,000 (average annual {{trapping}} harvest 2002-2009); New Mexico (US) 69 (1999–2000).|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{competition}} and chemicals introduced to females through mating {{have a negative}} effect on females and their lifespan. In males, production of the spermatophore, sperm, and secondary chemicals reduces their lifespan. As the number of copulations increase, the rate <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> also increases in both sexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the animal is at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in Whippets.|$|E
50|$|Malaria is {{the leading}} cause of death for Tanzanian {{children}} and is a major cause <b>of</b> maternal <b>mortality.</b> Tanzania is making considerable progress in the reduction <b>of</b> child <b>mortality.</b> In that respect, Tanzania is likely to achieve MDG 4 <b>of</b> reducing child <b>mortality.</b> The most significant contribution to the reduction <b>of</b> under-five <b>mortality</b> is improved control measures of malaria, Acute Respiratory Infections, diarrhea; improved personal hygiene, environmental sanitation; and preventive, promotive as well as curative health services. Tanzania's average annual rate of reduction <b>of</b> child <b>mortality</b> over the last 15 years was 4.6%, while, the Millennium Development Goal rate set by UN is an annual average rate of reduction of 4.3 percent.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the spatial variation <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> in Malawi between 1977 and 1987. Data from the 1977 and 1987 censuses {{are used in}} simple correlation and forward stepwise regression analysis to explain and/or predict the variation and change <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> at district (county) level. The results indicate that, at the macro-level, the variation <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> is strongly associated {{with a number of}} demographic and socioeconomic variables. Region in which a district finds itself also matters as far as levels <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> are concerned. With a rapidly expanding population, the study concludes that the reduction <b>of</b> infant <b>mortality</b> throughout the country should be vigorously pursued by the government of Malawi.

5|$|Women's life {{expectancy}} is {{greater than that of}} men, and they have lower death rates throughout life, regardless of race and geographic region.

5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and the patterns <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E
5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> being shown.

5|$|According to the Bills <b>of</b> <b>Mortality,</b> {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon {{estimated}} that the true number of mortalities was probably twice that figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London {{for the whole of}} the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them by their parents.|$|E
