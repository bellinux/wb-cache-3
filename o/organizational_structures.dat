However, it is still unable to explain the direction of interaction of organizational culture and <b>organizational</b> <b>structure</b> in real day-to-day operation. This paper explains this relationship {{through the application of}} Information-Processing Theory. It has been established that, on one hand, <b>organizational</b> <b>structure</b> modifies <b>organizational</b> culture and, on the other hand, organizational culture determines <b>organizational</b> <b>structure.</b> Based on the Information-Processing Theory, it is hypothesized that a good fit between <b>organizational</b> <b>structure</b> and <b>organizational</b> culture, has a positive relationship with the effectiveness of the organization. This model is illustrated by an empirical study of the Facilities Management Unit (FMU) of a public health care institution. The information-processing requirements of organizational culture and information-processing capacities of <b>organizational</b> <b>structure</b> of FMU are measured through a questionnaire adopted from the Competing Values Model and a self-administered questionnaire respectively. Preliminary results show that the information-processing requirement of the FMU is high as the organizational culture is dominated by clan.

25|$|One of {{the newest}} <b>organizational</b> <b>structures</b> {{developed}} in the 20th century is team and the related concept of team development or team building. In small businesses, the team structure can define the entire organization. Teams can be both horizontal and vertical. While an organization is constituted {{as a set of}} people who synergize individual competencies to achieve newer dimensions, the quality of organizational structure revolves around the competencies of teams in totality. For example, every one of the Whole Foods Market stores, the largest natural-foods grocer in the US developing a focused strategy, is an autonomous profit centre composed of an average of 10 self-managed teams, while team leaders in each store and each region are also a team. Larger bureaucratic organizations can benefit from the flexibility of teams as well. Xerox, Motorola, and DaimlerChrysler are all among the companies that actively use teams to perform tasks.|$|E

Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to “stimulate the appreciation of science and art”. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel’s rapid population growth {{in the latter half of}} the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former <b>organizational</b> <b>structures.</b> The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active collection policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.|$|E
