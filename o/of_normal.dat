A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E

40|$|Our article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} flexibly estimating a multivariate density while also attempting to estimate its marginals correctly. We do so by proposing two new estimators that try to capture the best features <b>of</b> mixture <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> and copula estimators while avoiding some of their weaknesses. The first estimator we propose is a mixture <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> copula model that is a flexible alternative to parametric copula models such as the normal and t copula. The second is a marginally adapted mixture <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> estimator that improves on the standard mixture <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> by using information contained in univariate estimates of the marginal densities. We show empirically that copula based approaches can behave much better or much worse than estimators based on mixture <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> depending on {{the properties of the}} data. We provide fast and reliable implemen- 1 tations of the estimators and illustrate the methodology on simulated and real data...|$|R

30|$|Regarding {{empirical}} studies, Rodríguez (2010 a) finds {{evidence in}} favor of the presence of non-linearities in Peruvian GDP and of asymmetries in its cyclical component. In consequence, one could establish the existence <b>of</b> mixtures <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> in the trend level, in its growth rate, and in the cyclical component of output. One could even allow the presence of a mixture <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> in the measurement equation that would capture the effect of atypical output changes or outliers. For example, natural disasters that drastically affect the level of Peruvian output, and take place irregularly, would be mistakenly estimated within the cyclical component. However, according to Wada and Perron (2006), the inclusion of all disturbances as mixtures <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> implies an unstable estimation algorithm.|$|R
40|$|The q-Gaussians are {{discussed}} {{from the point}} of view of variance mixtures <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> and exchangeability. For each q< 3, there is a q-Gaussian distribution that maximizes the Tsallis entropy under suitable constraints. This paper shows that q-Gaussian random variables can be represented as variance mixtures <b>of</b> <b>normals.</b> These variance mixtures <b>of</b> <b>normals</b> are the attractors in central limit theorems for sequences of exchangeable random variables; thereby, providing a possible model that has been extensively studied in probability theory. The formulation provided has the additional advantage of yielding process versions which are naturally q-Brownian motions. Explicit mixing distributions for q-Gaussians should facilitate applications to areas such as option pricing. The model might provide insight into the study of superstatistics.
