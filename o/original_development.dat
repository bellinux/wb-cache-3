5|$|Bourdon House {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{properties}} in Mayfair. It was constructed by Thomas Barlow between 1723–5 as part of the <b>original</b> <b>development</b> plan. An additional storey was added around 1864-5. In 1909, the 2nd Duke of Westminster ordered major refurbishments and the expansion of a three-storey wing. He moved out of Grosvenor House in 1916 into this, where he stayed until his death in 1953.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, forty {{prefabricated}} {{houses were}} built on adjacent {{land on a}} former holiday camp to rehouse residents {{of some of the}} most dilapidated properties. Despite winning several architectural awards and being praised by the local council, only five of the older properties were demolished. The <b>original</b> <b>development</b> along Brooklands has faced demolition, particularly with respect to dilapidated properties, and vacant sites nearby have been purchased to provide new homes. New permanent residences in Brooklands are prohibited by council regulations. Tendring District Council hope that by 2026, the area will change sufficiently to be attractive for development, and to provide a self-sufficient service based economy for tourism.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{section of}} Riverside is Silvertown, a {{subdivision}} developed in 1887 for African Americans. Initially isolated from largely white Riverside to the east, it was eventually {{absorbed into the}} growing neighborhood. As such, Silvertown residents became some of the few black plantation house owners in Riverside through the period of segregation. A few one-story wood-frame houses in the area may date to the <b>original</b> <b>development,</b> including one pantation house owned by a woman and then her daughter from 1887 into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Schafer noted at {{the time}} of Grim Fandango <b>original</b> <b>development,</b> {{retention}} of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} remade with 3D {{graphics}} for the Nintendo DS {{as part of}} the Final Fantasy series' 20th anniversary, and was released as Final Fantasy IV in Japan on December 20, 2007, in North America on July 22, 2008, and in Europe on September 5, 2008. The remake adds a number of features not present in the original, such as voice acting, minigames, and some changes to the basic gameplay. The game was developed by Matrix Software, the same team responsible for the Final Fantasy III DS remake, and was supervised by members of the <b>original</b> <b>development</b> team: Takashi Tokita served as executive producer and director, Tomoya Asano as producer and Hiroyuki Ito as battle designer. Animator Yoshinori Kanada storyboarded the new cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|A playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII was {{included}} in the Japanese version of , released on April 16, 2009. Toriyama stated that the release of the demo, which was not in the <b>original</b> <b>development</b> schedule, helped the team recognize a shared vision for what the game should look and feel like, a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then. It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done, which increased the development speed {{for the remainder of the}} project. The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used. The English localization began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases. The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3, but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game's development cycle. The Xbox version, due to technical limitations, runs at a lower resolution (720p maximum) than the PlayStation version and is spread across 3 discs.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Spire was a supertall {{skyscraper}} {{project at}} 400 N. Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, Illinois that failed financially after beginning construction. When originally proposed as the Fordham Spire in July 2005, the design had 116 stories {{and would have}} included a hotel and condominiums and been topped with a broadcast antenna mast. The design was by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, and Chicago developer Christopher T. Carley of the Fordham Company was spearheading the project. On 16 March 2006, the initial design of the building passed unanimously during that day's meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission. A court ruling on 4 November 2014 brought to a close the <b>original</b> <b>development</b> plan and the extended litigation over the nine-year-old project; developer Garrett Kelleher signed over the property location to the project's biggest creditor, Related Midwest, who announced {{that they would not}} build the Spire.|$|E

50|$|The {{buildings}} {{in the area are}} predominantly detached or semi-detached houses. There is much inconsistency in style in the <b>original</b> <b>developments</b> of the inter-war years because different builders had purchased single plots.

The streets typically have a grass verge with trees between road and pavement.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' <b>original</b> <b>development</b> team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Relic Entertainment {{was bought}} by THQ, which {{confirmed}} in 2007 that it had acquired {{the rights to the}} series from Relic and Sierra. No further game in the series was made before THQ declared bankruptcy in 2013; on April 22, 2013, Gearbox Software announced that they had bought the rights to the series at auction for US$1.35 million. On July 19, 2013, Gearbox announced the production of remakes of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as Homeworld HD, later renamed Homeworld Remastered Collection. The following month, collection producer Brian Burleson stated that Gearbox had purchased the property with the express purpose of making a collection including the original and remastered versions of the game. He also noted that neither game had code in a releasable or playable state when purchased, and they ended up recreating many of the <b>original</b> <b>development</b> tools {{with the assistance of the}} Homeworld mod community. A later posting by a developer at Gearbox further praised the mod community for their assistance in getting the original code to be playable on modern computers. The stand-alone expansion Homeworld: Cataclysm was not announced for a remake, despite the outspoken interest of Gearbox, as they were unable to find the original source code for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{staff at}} Square Enix works mainly from Japanese to English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, {{as well as}} Russian, Korean and Mandarin {{for a number of}} titles. In 2016, Final Fantasy XV became the first major title from the company to release in Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Minor titles are occasionally localized from English to European languages. Prior to the merger of Square and Enix in 2003, Enix did not initially have a localization department and outsourced its Western releases to translators who had no close contact with the <b>original</b> <b>development</b> teams, as was the case for Dragon Quest VII. Square also did not initially have a localization department, though a number of localizers such as Kaoru Moriyama and Ted Woolsey worked with them regularly on a contractual basis in the early 1990s. Moriyama described the work at the time as leaving very little leeway for polishing text due to the limitations of the ROM sizes. She also commented Hironobu Sakaguchi was not willing to put extra work for the English version at that time. Following the massive international success of Final Fantasy VII, however, the company looked into improving the quality of its translated products-the game was widely criticized for its rushed English translation, which had been handled entirely by Michael Baskett, the company's only in-house translator at the time. To that end, Square tasked Richard Honeywood, originally a programmer, with creating a dedicated localization team in the Tokyo headquarters. His first major project was Xenogears. While there were only two members at first, including Honeywood, the staff grew to include more than 40 employees by 2007, and over 70 in 2015. The success of Final Fantasy VII also {{led to the creation of}} a London-based European office in 1998, which would handle marketing and quality assurance for the PAL market.|$|E

5|$|The next title, Tomb Raider Chronicles, {{depicted}} the late Lara Croft via her friends' flashbacks. The game introduced stealth attacks, which would {{carry over to}} the next game, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. While the <b>original</b> <b>development</b> team worked on Chronicles, Core Design assigned a new team to develop Angel of Darkness for the PlayStation 2. Anticipating innovative changes from next generation consoles, Adrian Smith—co-founder of Core Design—wanted to reinvent the character {{to keep pace with}} the updated technology. Core Design conducted market research, including fan polls, to aid in Angel of Darknesss development. The development team felt it could not alter the character and instead opted to place her in a situation different from previous games. The PlayStation 2 hardware allowed for more manoeuvres and a more detailed character model; the number of polygons in Croft's model increased to 4,400. The team sought to add more melee manoeuvres to better match Lara Croft's portrayal as an expert fighter in her backstory. Movement control was switched from the directional pad to the analogue control stick to provide more precision. After the original team finished Chronicles, it joined the development of Angel of Darkness. Excess content, missed production deadlines, and Eidos's desire to time the game's launch to coincide with the release of the 2003 Tomb Raider film resulted in a poorly designed game; Croft was brought back to life without explanation and the character controls lacked precision.|$|E
