30|$|The work [12] {{pointed out}} that {{evaluating}} the safety and trust level of vehicles is important to ensure the reliability of applications. The work {{also points out that}} traditional trust level is evaluated by monitoring the message generation and the behavior of the <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> nodes. However, the attacker can interrupt the regular communication among vehicles by creating a case of None Line of Sight. In addition, the case of None Line of Sight can prevent <b>vehicles</b> from monitoring <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> nodes. To solve the problem, the work proposes a location information-based trust evaluation model. The model can be used to evaluate the trust level of <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> nodes.|$|R

5|$|The {{characters}} {{can travel}} between {{a variety of}} locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which, when selected, will present the player {{with a list of}} available destinations. The DeSoto is also used for several driving sequences, usually involving pursuing or fleeing criminals in <b>other</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In these driving sequences, the player can use Sam's gun, the car's horn, or have Max attempt to communicate with <b>other</b> <b>vehicles</b> via a megaphone. In addition, special inventory items may be used to complete specific puzzles within these sequences. Driving sequences are also used for several minigames, such as pulling innocent drivers over for fabricated felonies. In keeping with the developer's heritage from the LucasArts adventure games, Sam & Max Save the World is designed so that the player characters cannot die or reach a complete dead-end.|$|E

Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move <b>other</b> <b>vehicles</b> around the system, while ballast motor cars are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|E

Airborne Israeli infantry {{was committed to}} support the armor, and in the ensuing battle, another 12 tanks and 6 half-tracks were destroyed. Some 30 soldiers of the brigade were killed, while the Sa'iqa company lost 75 dead. In addition to delaying Israeli reserves, commandos carried out sabotage operations.|$|E

5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or <b>other</b> <b>vehicles,</b> common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and <b>other</b> <b>vehicles</b> relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E
5|$|A {{few seconds}} after Pajota {{and his men}} heard Murphy fire the first shot, they fired on the alerted Japanese {{contingent}} situated across the Cabu River. Pajota had earlier sent a demolitions expert to set charges on the unguarded bridge to go off at 19:45. The bomb detonated at the designated time, and although it did not destroy the bridge, it formed a large hole over which tanks and <b>other</b> <b>vehicles</b> could not pass. Waves of Japanese troops rushed the bridge, but the V-shaped choke point created by the Filipino guerrillas repulsed each attack. Oneguerrilla, who had been trained to use the bazooka {{only a few hours}} earlier by the Rangers, destroyed or disabled four tanks that were hiding behind a clump of trees. A group of Japanese soldiers made an effort to flank the ambush position by crossing the river away from the bridge, but the guerrillas spotted and eliminated them.|$|E
