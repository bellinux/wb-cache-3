5|$|During {{the debate}} <b>on</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform,</b> Franken {{was one of}} the strongest {{supporters}} of a single-payer system. He authored an amendment, called the Medical Loss Ratio, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies spend at least 80% of premiums on actual health care costs, rising to 85% for large group plans. On September 30, 2013, Franken voted to remove a provision that would repeal the medical device tax in Obamacare from a government funding bill. Although Franken says he is in favor of the provision, he disagreed with it being used as a condition in preventing the 2013 federal government shutdown.|$|E

25|$|A nationally {{recognized}} leader {{on health care}} policy, Altmire authored the legislation that ended the late enrollment penalty for low-income seniors participating in the Medicare Part D program, and he played a decisive role in preventing a proposed 2007 Medicare budget cut for hospitals. In 2008, he successfully led the effort to delay the Medicare durable medical equipment competitive bidding program, and in 2009, he introduced legislation that became the template for the hospital value-based purchasing demonstration project included as part the Affordable Care Act. Altmire was a key participant in the congressional debate <b>on</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> in 2009 and 2010. Because of his professional background in health care, his vote was sought after by both sides and he withstood heavy pressure from the White House and Democratic party leaders before voting against the bill on March 21, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The Recommendation clause {{imposes a}} duty, but its {{performance}} rests solely with the President. Congress possesses {{no power to}} compel the President to recommend, as he alone is the [...] "judge" [...] of what is [...] "necessary and expedient." [...] Unlike the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article I, which limits Congress's discretion to carrying out only its delegated powers, the phrase [...] "necessary and expedient" [...] implies {{a wider range of}} discretion for the President. Because this is a political question, there has been little judicial involvement with the President's actions under the clause as long as Presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), the Supreme Court noted that the Recommendations Clause serves as a reminder that the President cannot make law by himself: [...] "The power to recommend legislation, granted to the President, serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the Congress to legislate." [...] The Court made a similar point in striking down the line-item veto in Clinton v. City of New York (1998). When President Bill Clinton attempted to shield the records of the President's Task Force <b>on</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Reform</b> as essential to his functions under the Recommendations Clause, a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in Ass'n of American Physicians & Surgeons v. Clinton (1993): [...] "he Recommendation Clause is less an obligation than a right. The President has the undisputed authority to recommend legislation, but he need not exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or, for that matter, any subject." ...|$|E
