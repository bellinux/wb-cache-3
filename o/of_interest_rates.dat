5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E

ABSTRACT: The paper {{examined the relationship between}} term structure <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and economic activity and also investigated the relationship between term structure <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and inflation rate in Nigeria. This was with a view of providing additional evidence on the predictive power of term structure <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> in Nigeria. The study employed quarterly time series data, from 1986 - 2008. The period was chosen based on the availability of one of the data used(14 years government bond). The study employed Dynamic Ordinary Lest Square(DOLS) techniques in the analysis. The diagnostics test conducted showed that the results obtain is valid and reliable. The estimated result shows that term structure <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> being the difference between <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> different maturities had positive and long run relationship with economic activity and inflation rate in Nigeria. The study concluded that the positive and significant of term structure <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> indicated that, term structure <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> in Nigeria does contain information about future inflation rate and economic activities. The study suggested that monetary authority should be consistent in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> policy formulation and Government should also bolster its activity in the Government securities market, as all these will improve the predictive ability of term structure <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> about future activities in Nigeria...|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Malaysia was {{shaken by the}} Asian {{financial}} crisis, which damaged Malaysia's assembly line-based economy. Mahathir combated it initially with IMF approved policies. However, the devaluation of the Ringgit and the deepening recession caused him to create his own programme, based on protecting Malaysia from foreign investors and reinvigorating the economy through construction projects and the lowering <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The policies caused Malaysia's economy to rebound by 2002, but brought disagreement between Mahathir and his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who backed the IMF policies. This led to the sacking of the Anwar, causing political unrest. Anwar was arrested and banned from politics on what are considered trumped up charges. In 2003 Mahathir, Malaysia's longest serving prime minister, voluntarily retired in favour of his new deputy, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. In November 2007 two anti-government rallies occurred, precipitated by allegations of corruption and discrepancies in the election system that heavily favoured the ruling political party, National Front, {{which has been in}} power since Malaya achieved independence.|$|E

The nonparametric spot <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> process is estimated from the observed short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> following a robust estimation procedure and the market price <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk is estimated as implied from the historical term structure data.

The parametric models with closed form solutions for bond and bond option prices, namely the Vasicek (1977) and CIR (1985) models, are also estimated for comparison purpose. The empirical results not only provide strong evidence that the traditional spot <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models and market prices <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk are severely misspecified but also suggest that different model specifications have significant impact on term structure dynamics and prices <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> derivative securities. ...|$|R
