40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} degree and pattern of {{monetary}} policy activism in the United States, Canada, West Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan {{during the recent}} period in which managed-floating exchange rates prevailed. Floating exchange rates enhance the potency of a discretionary monetary policy. Yet central banks in these countries shifted toward less discretionary monetary targeting during the late 1970 s in response to rising inflationary pressures and expectations. But whether such targeting actually reduced policy activism is unclear since targets were expressed in wide ranges and often were missed. Following 1981, {{at least three of}} these countries-the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom-reverted to an avowedly more discretionary pattern of response to changes in real demand pressures, interest rates, and exchange rates. Since mid- 1986, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan-and, to a lesser extent, Canada-have intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market and so have greatly increased their <b>official</b> dollar <b>holdings.</b> Moreover, through August 1987, the effects of this intervention on these countries' domestic money supplies apparently have been sterilized only partially.

40|$|Well-developed {{financial}} markets are {{a necessary condition}} for a currency to play a role as a reserve currency. The introduction of the euro greatly improved the functioning of euro {{financial markets}}. This paper investigates whether euro financial markets have developed sufficiently to facilitate the emergence of the euro as a reserve currency on par with the US dollar. We find that the liquidity and breadth of euro financial markets are fast approaching those of dollar markets, and as a result the euro is eroding some of the advantages that have historically supported the pre-eminence of the US dollar as a reserve currency. This strengthens the incentive for monetary authorities to reconsider the currency composition of their reserves. Nevertheless, the introduction of the euro has not yet resulted in a significant change in the currency composition of <b>official</b> reserve <b>holdings.</b> The US dollar has maintained its place as the dominant reserve currency, supported perhaps by the edge that dollar financial markets still have over euro markets in terms of size, credit quality, and liquidity, as well as inertia in the use of international currencies.

40|$|Rumors {{about the}} actual or {{potential}} currency diversification of countries’ foreign exchange holdings out of dollars are not a new phenomenon. This working paper argues that such concerns about reserve diversification are exaggerated. We present evidence that the extent of actual diversification has been modest to date. Nevertheless, the potential for reserve diversification adds volatility to foreign exchange markets and can catalyze abrupt exchange rate movements. We argue that policymakers acting in their own national interests can do something constructive to reduce the volatility introduced into foreign exchange and financial markets by rumors of large-scale international foreign exchange reserve diversification. We propose the voluntary adoption by major foreign exchange reserve holders in particular of an International Reserve Diversification Standard consisting of two elements: (1) routine disclosure of the currency composition of <b>official</b> foreign exchange <b>holdings</b> and (2) a commitment by each adherent to adjust gradually the actual currency composition of its reserves to any new benchmark for those holdings.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY In this thesis, I {{describe}} {{the time and}} return dynamics of the disposition effect. The Disposition effect is an empirical fact that investors hold on to losing stocks and sell their profitable investments more eagerly. While {{the existence of the}} disposition effect is an empirical fact, it lacks concise and unifying theory. Previous literature hints of a possible time varying component in the propensity to sell on capital gain. This previous evidence of change over the dimension of the time, and over the dimension of the level of capital gain, introduces an empirical gap in the research. What is the true level of the disposition effect in different periods of the holdings and different level of gains? My research fulfills this gap in the literature. METHODOLOGY AND DATA My primary dataset is the unique dataset of Euroclear Finland. The official registry called the Book Entry System. This is the complete <b>official</b> registry of <b>holdings</b> of all Finnish publicly quoted companies on an individual investor and daily level. The dataset spans twenty years from January 1 st, 1995 to January 1 st, 2015 and contains over 280 million initial balance records and changes in ownership. I purposely depart from the conventional hypothesis-testing framework for this study. Instead, I combine many of the approaches of the previous empirical research to simultaneously model the dynamics of the disposition effect over the dimensions of the level of gains and along the duration of the holding period. I apply the Cox proportional duration model modified for estimation for large datasets to disentangle the time and gain dynamics of the disposition effect from the baseline hazard. MAIN FINDINGS I find that the magnitude of the disposition effect changes asymmetrically over the duration of the holding period and differently in the domain of gains compared to the domain of losses. On short holding period durations, it shows a distinct V-shape over the dimension of the level of gain. I additionally find that the functional form of the disposition effect changes easily, depending on for example, whether the share was acquired by a subscription in an equity issue versus being bought from open markets. When investors acquire shares in an equity issue, the propensity to sell those shares is lower, especially if the holding period return is high. This finding is against the main findings on the disposition effect in the existing literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{countries}} of the European periphery are experiencing a balance of payments crisis stemming from persistent current account deficits and sharply lower private capital inflows, a condition known as a sudden stop. In countries with fixed exchange rates, sudden stops typically drain foreign reserves, forcing currency depreciation which eventually shifts the current account from deficit to surplus. However, the sudden stop has not prompted the European periphery countries to move toward devaluation by abandoning the euro, in part because capital transfers from euro-area partners have allowed them to finance current account deficits. A balance of payments crisis typically arises when a country can’t finance its foreign transactions. A country’s balance of payments can be separated into two main parts: the current account, which reflects the trade balance in goods and services; and the financial account, which reflects the balance on net international financial transactions. In turn, the financial account {{can be broken down}} into, one, the balance on international private capital flows; and, two, changes in <b>official</b> <b>holdings</b> of foreign reserve assets, such as gold, foreign currency, and foreign sovereign debt.

40|$|Management of <b>official</b> <b>holdings</b> {{of foreign}} assets, in {{particular}} in sovereign wealth funds, {{has become a major}} focus of national and international economic and financial policy. The principal reasons are their size, lack of transparency, potential to disrupt financial markets, and the risk that political objectives might influence their management. Moreover, such large cross-border holdings in official hands are at sharp variance with today's market-based global economy and financial system. These investment activities of governments have become sufficiently significant that an internationally agreed standard should be established to guide these activities. The standard should apply to the gamut of international investments of governments, including traditional foreign exchange reserves, stabilization funds, nonrenewable resource funds, sovereign wealth funds, and government-owned or controlled entities such as pension funds. The standard should ensure that international investments of governments are based on clearly stated policy objectives and investment strategies. It should set out the role of the government and the managers of the investment mechanism/entity and ensure that the operations of the investment mechanisms are as transparent as possible. Depending on the type of mechanism, its size, and the scope of its activities, behavioral guidelines with respect to its management should be established. Such a standard would contribute not only to financial stability in the countries directly involved but also to international financial stability by increasing the transparency, accountability, and predictability of the operations of governments in managing their international investments and discharging their obligations to current and future generations. ...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The {{exchange}} {{rate of the}} dollar is largely determined by the market—the supply and demand for dollars in global foreign exchange markets associated with the buying and selling of dollar denominated goods, services, and assets (e. g., stocks, bonds, real property) on global markets. In most circumstances, however, international asset-market transactions will tend to be dominant, with the size and strength of inflows and outflows of capital ultimately determining whether the {{exchange rate}} appreciates or depreciates. A variety of factors can influence the size and direction of cross-border asset flows. Of principal importance are the likely {{rate of return on}} the asset, investor expectations about a currency’s future path, the size and liquidity of the country’s asset markets, the need for currency diversification in international investors’ portfolios, changes in the <b>official</b> <b>holdings</b> of foreign exchange reserves by central banks, and the need for and location of investment safe havens. All of these factors could themselves be influenced by economic policy choices. To give Congress the economic context in which to view the dollar’s recent and prospective movement, this report analyzes the evolution of the exchange rate since its peak in 2002. It examines several factors that are likely to influence the dollar’s medium-term path, what effects a depreciating dollar could have on the economy, and how alternative policy measures that could be taken by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the 112 th Congress might influence the dollar’s path...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThis thesis {{examines}} how government accumulation {{of foreign exchange}} reserves affect interest rates in an open economy. In the first essay, I examine this issue from an empirical perspective. I estimate the impulse response of the 10 year Treasury yield to an exogenous innovation in Foreign <b>Official</b> <b>Holdings</b> of U. S. Long Term Treasury securities in an identified VAR model. I find that a market valuation adjustment done to the data is behind a seemingly negative effect of holdings on yields, and that once we control for this adjustment, the effect is not negative. Hence, I find no conclusive evidence of {{a negative effect on}} U. S. interest rates from foreign official accumulation of treasury bonds. In the second essay, I analyze the same question from a theoretical perspective. I present a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which central banks accumulate reserves and investigate whether the impulse response of one country’s interest rate is significantly negative after an exogenous shock to the other country’s foreign exchange reserve policy. I find that even {{in a world in which}} Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) does not hold, which renders different currency assets imperfect substitutes, the response of the foreign interest rate to a home country reserve accumulation shock is likely to be negative but small in magnitude. In the third essay, I test for evidence on the mechanism used in the second essay to make different currency assets imperfect substitutes. Specifically, I estimate the elasticity of investments in foreign currencies with respect to expected excess returns. I find that currency flows help predict excess returns, and are statistically significant forecasting variables even in the presence of additional control variables. This means that demand for different currency assets is less than perfectly elastic, which lends support to the channel proposed in the second essay to introduce deviations from UIP...|$|E
