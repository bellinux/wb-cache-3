5|$|About 20 minutes later, Bariko {{launched}} a helicopter to check <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> winch {{which was to}} collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged {{and had to be}} towed out ten days later.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} ended {{three days}} before Christmas 1977, on the Choctawhatchee Bay, near Destin, Florida. The actors had to put ice cubes in their mouths to prevent their breath showing on camera. The final sequence to be filmed was the shark being electrocuted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> In mid-January, the crew reconvened in Hollywood {{with some of the}} teenage actors for five weeks of post-production photography.|$|E

5|$|Queer Eye is an American reality {{television}} series that premiered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> television network Bravo during July 2003. The program's original name Queer Eye for the Straight Guy was changed {{after the third}} season to generalize the scope of its content. The series was created by executive producers David Collins and Michael Williams along with their producing partner David Metzler; it was produced by their production company, Scout Productions.|$|E
5|$|Standard USB has {{a minimum}} rated {{lifetime}} of 1,500 cycles of insertion and removal, the mini-USB receptacle increases this to 5,000 cycles, and the newer Micro-USB and USB-C receptacles are both {{designed for a}} minimum rated lifetime of 10,000 cycles of insertion and removal. To accomplish this, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> side of the connection. This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear.|$|E

Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing {{a few feet from}} U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an audience}} of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.|$|E
5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, can result in very {{complicated}} and long lasting waveforms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E
50|$|When The Eliminator started, Sting were slowly racing {{ahead with}} great {{teamwork}} while Claw were struggling and wobbling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> Claw {{fell off a}} lot of times and even dropped their totem pole but Sting managed to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boards the whole way even after wobbling in the middle. When Sting were almost at the end, Eilidh and Tyson started to use two decks instead of three which made them go a lot faster {{but it was too late}} and Sting smashed their skull before Claw. Eilidh cut her leg near the end when her knees were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> so she had to go to the medic after the challenge.|$|R

5000|$|On December 19, 2012, {{cold weather}} caused ice to {{accumulate}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> supporting <b>cables,</b> periodically dropping {{to the car}} deck below, dubbed [...] "ice bombs". ICBC, the vehicle insurance entity in British Columbia, reported 60 separate claims of ice damage during the incident. In addition, one driver required an ambulance due to injuries. The RCMP closed the bridge between 1:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. while engineers investigated. The Government installed collars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> that are manually released when conditions for ice accumulation are expected. They are installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tops of <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> towers and are released, falling down <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> by gravity to remove any snow build up.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} first aired in the United States <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> {{television}} channel Comedy Central on February 25, 1998. It received a Nielsen rating in the 8.0 range. In Canada, the episode premiered on The Comedy Channel on August 20, 1998, {{it was the}} last of a three-week South Park marathon aired by the network. A little over 300,000 viewers watched the episode, which was a record for the channel, which had only been part of Canada's cable networks for ten months. The complete three-week marathon was watched by an average 186,307 viewers per minute per day.|$|E
5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most durable {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors have a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B connectors increased this to 5,000. The micro connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind, so have a design life of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the receptacles. Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, parts that provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> side.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} faced {{criticism}} from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death, as a whole, Meerkat Manor enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term, intimate {{look into the}} lives of its meerkat stars, breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries. In 2007, Meerkat Manor was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards. It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas. The first three series of the programme have been released to DVD in both Region 1 and Region 2. In 2007, a book entitled Meerkat Manor – The Story of Flower of the Kalahari was released in the UK, detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series' filming began. A television film, , documenting Flower's birth and rise to matriarch of the Whiskers aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008.|$|E

50|$|It {{was finally}} {{determined}} that the problem was vortices of wind forming {{in the lee of}} <b>the</b> <b>cables,</b> causing far heavier vibrations than expected during design. A solution was found by applying additional dampers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> Unfortunately this caused an extra delay of a month in the opening of the bridge, since the contractor initially mounted the dampers incorrectly.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{unsupported}} hoop about {{a planet}} is unstable: it would {{crash into the}} Earth if left unattended. The orbital ring concept requires <b>cables</b> to <b>the</b> surface to stabilize it, with the outward centrifugal force providing tension <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables,</b> and <b>the</b> tethers stabilizing the ring.|$|R
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV {{may have led}} him to the murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E
