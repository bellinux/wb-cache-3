His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist.|$|E
5|$|Be Reasonable is {{a monthly}} {{interview}} show that engages guests with ideas <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> scientific consensus, {{such as a}} member of the Flat Earth Society. In the first episode, on 28 January 2013, hosts Hayley Stevens (until June 2014) and Michael Marshall described the show as an examination of their guests' beliefs and their structure, and the evidence they believe supports these beliefs. Guests have discussed past life therapy, aura photography and the presence of aliens on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Heterodox economists {{adhere to}} {{theories}} sufficiently <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> to be marginalized and treated as irrelevant by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular {{groups in the}} late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals rather {{than those of the}} mainstream and eschew formal modeling in favor of more abstract theoretical work.|$|E
5|$|Mr Albert is Galaxity's contact on 20th century Earth. He {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} in Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia. He is a retired gentleman who drives an obsolete Renault 4CV and lives {{in the suburbs of}} Paris, France. He maintains a wide range of contacts in government and scientific circles as well as with many experts in fields <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> such as ufology, telepathy, and sorcery. He is also a pigeon fancier and uses his carrier pigeons to relay messages between some of his contacts. Unlike Valérian he tries to avoid getting involved {{in the thick of the}} action and never acts impulsively, always preferring to take his time about things. He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes to take things easy.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the missiles were already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made them very vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} of carcinogenesis and cancer treatment that fall <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of scientific opinion, due to lack of scientific rationale, logic, or evidence base.

He fought the removal of community gardens, including the Chico Mendez Mural Garden on the Lower East Side, named after Brazilian activist Chico Mendes. Will was an active participant in protests across the country, usually for various social justice and human rights causes, and was involved with environmental movements such as Earth First! and the Fall Creek Tree Village in the Willamette National Forest outside Eugene, Oregon.|$|E
25|$|Extremism within Islam {{goes back}} to the 7th century, to the Khawarijes. From their {{essentially}} political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. They were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed worthy of death. Other scholars have also described the group not as Sunnis, but as Khawarij. Sunni critics, including Salafi and jihadist muftis such as Adnan al-Aroor and Abu Basir al-Tartusi, say that ISIL and related terrorist groups are not Sunnis, but are instead modern-day Kharijites (Muslims who have stepped <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of Islam) serving an imperial anti-Islamic agenda.|$|E

25|$|While {{it is an}} {{emerging}} and developing field, {{the question of whether}} life exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of scientific inquiry. Though once considered <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist David Grinspoon calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory. NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. NASA's Viking missions to Mars, launched in 1976, included three biology experiments designed to look for metabolism of present life on Mars.|$|E
25|$|Several annual festivals {{take place}} in Budapest, such as Sziget Festival, {{one of the largest}} outdoor music festival in Europe, the Budapest Spring Festival {{presents}} on concerts at several venues across the city. The Budapest Autumn Festival brings free music, dance, art, and other cultural events to the streets of the city. Budapest Wine Festival and Budapest Pálinka Festival occurs each May and gastronomy festivals focus on culinary pleasures. Budapest Pride (or Budapest Pride Film and Cultural Festival) occurs annually across the city, and usually involves a parade on the Andrássy Avenue. Other festivals include the Budapest Fringe Festival, which brings more than 500 artists in about 50 shows to produce a wide range of interesting works in alternative theatre, dance, music and comedy <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> The LOW Festival was a multidisciplinary contemporary cultural festival held in Hungary in the cities Budapest and Pécs from February till March. The name of the festival alludes to the Low Countries, the region encompassing the Netherlands and Flanders. Budapest Jewish Summer Festival, in late August, {{is also one of the}} largest in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Sanbō Kyōdan {{was also}} {{influential}} in introducing charismatic authority in Western Zen, by its dependency on {{the authority of}} Yasutani, while simultaneously standing <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of Japanese Zen. It was transplanted into a culture that is unaware of the specific characteristics of Japanese culture regarding authority. The stress on kenshō as means of authority, coupled to the primacy of maintaining the correct dharma transmission, led to institutional problems when Yasutani's heir Yamada Koun died, {{in the view of}} some disaffected former members. Shortly before his death in 1989 Yamada Koun passed on the leadership of the Sanbo Kyodan directly to Kubota Jiun Roshi, who was its abbot until 2004, whereupon the abbacy passed to Yamada Ryoun Roshi. While a handful of Western teachers authorized by Sanbo-Zen left the organization, some 40 or so remain within it, and the institution itself has evolved and shows signs of growing strength and resilience. The direct lineage of the “Three Clouds” (Harada, Yasutani and Yamada) maintains a strong core and trunk in today's Sanbo-Zen. Seeing one's nature gives an autonomous confirmation of Zen's ultimate truth, which may conflict with the need to maintain institutions and traditions. On the other hand, it may foster a renewal and revitalization of the core of Zen teaching, and allow for styles of Zen practice to emerge that are more relevant to non-Japanese contexts.|$|E
