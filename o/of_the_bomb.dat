5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember <b>the</b> victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> For <b>the</b> tenth anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> <b>the</b> city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as <b>the</b> National Week <b>of</b> Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, <b>the</b> tenth anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking <b>the</b> moment <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> went off, with <b>the</b> traditional 168seconds <b>of</b> silence—onesecond for each person who was killed as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blast.

5|$|The Committee's mandate did {{not include}} the use of the bomb—its use upon {{completion}} was presumed. Following a protest by scientists involved in the project, {{in the form of the}} Franck Report, the Committee re-examined the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b> In a June 21 meeting, it reaffirmed that there was no alternative.|$|E
5|$|The stolen Ford Escort {{belonged to}} a man from Portadown, who {{according}} to Captain Fred Holroyd, had links {{with one of the}} UVF bombers and the driver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> car which had been left to explode in Parnell Street, Dublin on 17 May 1974. He {{was also one of the}} prime suspects in the sectarian killing of Dorothy Traynor on 1 April 1975 in Portadown.|$|E
5|$|All of the inert {{versions}} {{went from}} the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, where they were used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b> Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a slurry, solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.|$|E
50|$|Operation Freedom Deal {{followed}} and expanded <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> Cambodia conducted under Operation Menu in 1969 and 1970.

5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, von Neumann {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b> Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 {{to draw up a}} list of targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|In August 1945, the Fat Man was {{assembled}} on Tinian by Project Alberta personnel. When {{the physics}} package was fully assembled and wired, it was placed inside its ellipsoidal aerodynamic bombshell and wheeled out, {{where it was}} signed by nearly 60 people, including Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell and Captain William S. Parsons. It was then wheeled to the bomb bay of the B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar after its normally assigned command pilot, Captain Frederick C. Bock, who flew The Great Artiste with his crew on the mission. Bockscar was flown by Major Charles W. Sweeney and his crew, with Commander Frederick L. Ashworth from Project Alberta as the weaponeer in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1984, a short was {{produced}} titled <b>The</b> Maintenance <b>of</b> Silence. <b>The</b> film portrays {{a young man}} named Eric probing into <b>the</b> facts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> <b>The</b> protagonist is disturbed by being awakened in Auckland at <b>the</b> exact moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> in Wanganui.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference. He was there {{when he learned that}} the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the U.S. was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though {{this was the first time}} the Soviets had been officially given {{information}} about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> project, having learned about it (through espionage) long before Truman did.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the figures}} used in the {{calculation}} of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the terminal velocity {{was based on the}} type of bomb being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> would be when dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal velocity and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{offensive}} began and Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because of the dangers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was split open. The operations did last long and by August 1944 the Mosquitoes were back on bomber support missions.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{perpetrators}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{are unknown}} but were {{purported to be}} connected to <b>the</b> Islamic Republic <b>of</b> Iran. <b>The</b> motivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> is suspect to have been punishment against Kuwait, America and France for their military and financial assistance to Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War.|$|R

5|$|On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car {{containing}} 500lb of home-made explosives in {{the centre}} of Omagh, County Tyrone. The bombers {{could not find a}} parking space near the intended target of the courthouse, and the car was left 400 metres away. As a result, three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was located outside the courthouse. They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer to the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b> Shortly after, the bomb exploded killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.|$|E
5|$|Press {{coverage}} in the following days, after Howe's statement that no bomb had been found, continued {{to focus on the}} act planned by the IRA; several newspapers reported a search for a fourth member of the team. Reports of the discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> in Marbella appeared to vindicate the government's version of events and justify the killings. Several MPs made statements critical of the operation, while a group of Labour MPs tabled a condemnatory motion in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 {{contributed to}} Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 (Afghanistan/Southwest Asia), {{providing}} {{the ability to}} loiter high above the battlefield and provide Close Air Support (CAS) {{through the use of}} precision guided munitions, a mission which previously would have been restricted to fighter and ground attack aircraft. In late 2001, ten B-52s dropped a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> tonnage in Afghanistan. B-52s also played a role in Operation Iraqi Freedom, which commenced on 20 March 2003 (Iraq/Southwest Asia). On the night of 21 March 2003, B-52Hs launched at least one hundred AGM-86C CALCMs at targets within Iraq.|$|E

5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> bay. Only a few of the E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{had sent}} telephoned {{warnings}} about 90 {{minutes before the}} bomb detonated. At least 75,000 people were evacuated from the area, but the bomb squad were unable to defuse the bomb in time. More than 200 people were injured {{but there were no}} fatalities despite the strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> which has been largely credited to the fast response of emergency services. At the time, England was hosting the Euro '96 football championships and a Russia vs Germany match was to take place in Manchester the following day.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hiroshima's {{military}} death toll, only 150 Japanese {{soldiers were}} killed instantly, including thirty-six from the 134th AAA Regiment of the 4th AAA Division.
