25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E
500|$|We... between {{fear and}} despair and hope. And that formed itself {{into such a}} heap of stuff, that I can't really {{describe}} it – how it was and what it was. Every evening, we went to pieces and during the night, we tried to build <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> again, so we could go into the street... and look like human beings again... And [...] was {{like being in a}} windmill; it turned and moved.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard {{was adamant}} {{that despite the}} defeat Liverpool would come back {{stronger}} next season: [...] "We've got to pick <b>ourselves</b> <b>up,</b> have a good rest {{in the summer and}} then go again next season." [...] Gerrard thought that although Liverpool controlled the first half, they did not control the match as much in the second half as they would have liked. Gerrard echoed his manager's sentiments in regards to new players joining the club: [...] "We need to strengthen and bring some quality into the club. The manager and the people in charge of the club know that and it will be an interesting summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even borium!" [...] we exclaimed, delighted, {{and writing}} rapidly in our notebook. Already we saw <b>ourselves</b> writing <b>up</b> as our {{headline}} Borium Shares Properties of Thorium.|$|R
60|$|We headed {{through the}} marvellous country {{straight}} across the plain on which Kioto stands, till {{we reached the}} range of hills on the far side, and found <b>ourselves</b> mixed <b>up</b> with half a mile of lumber-yard.|$|R
5000|$|Critic Robert Daudelin {{stated that}} “At last we were {{confronted by a}} film which really belonged to us, one in which we were happy to {{recognize}} ourselves and see <b>ourselves</b> close <b>up.</b> It was (and remains) the image of our most recent awakenings.” ...|$|R
500|$|Lessing {{dedicated}} Shikasta to her father. While she {{was still}} a child in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, [...] "Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn't really matter if we did blow <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> – plenty more where we came from." [...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America. Lessing {{said in an interview that}} its followers had written to her and asked, [...] "When are we going to be visited by the gods?", and she told them that the book is [...] "not a cosmology. It's an invention", and they replied, [...] "Ah, you're just testing us".|$|E
500|$|As part of Obama's {{call for}} responsibility, he said [...] "what is {{required}} of us now is {{a new era of}} responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American" [...] and [...] "those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account." [...] Obama quoted the lyrics of the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields song [...] "Pick Yourself Up" [...] from the musical comedy Swing Time, saying that [...] "starting today, we must pick <b>ourselves</b> <b>up,</b> dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America." [...] In an article for The New York Times, columnist and former drama critic Frank Rich noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address [...] "one subtle whiff of the Great Depression".|$|E
500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was {{acutely aware that}} there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... We go to the theater to cheer <b>ourselves</b> <b>up.</b> We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Do not,” he exclaimed, “turn back, {{now that}} we have {{proceeded}} thus far; for I tell you that neither of us will have the courage to repeat the attempt, if once more we find <b>ourselves</b> looking <b>up</b> to where we now are from the bottom of these rocks!” ...|$|R
60|$|About {{eleven o'clock}} we found <b>ourselves</b> going <b>up</b> the old stone {{steps to the}} castle. It was {{the last day of}} a fair which had been holden {{in this part of the}} country, and crowds of the common people were {{flocking}} to the castle, men, women, and children pattering up the stairs before and after us.|$|R
60|$|One {{would have}} said that the old man had always lived in this place, so {{directly}} and swiftly did he go to the desired point, which was a portion of the flooring where was a trap-door, evidently used to dump the refuse, for suddenly we found <b>ourselves</b> climbing <b>up</b> a heap of what appeared to be husks and cobs of corn.|$|R
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
2500|$|Burstyn {{described}} her collaboration with director Martin Scorsese, {{making his first}} Hollywood studio production, as [...] "one of the best experiences I've ever had". The director agreed with his star that the film should have a message. [...] "It's a picture about emotions and feelings and relationships and people in chaos," [...] he said. [...] "We felt like charting all that and showing the differences and showing people making terrible mistakes ruining their lives and then realizing it and trying to push back when everything is crumbling – without getting into soap opera. We opened <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> {{to a lot of}} experimentation." ...|$|E
60|$|But Darius had not returned, and {{we could}} not give <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> to slumber while he {{remained}} absent.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} midnight, {{and all were}} in bed but <b>ourselves,</b> who sat <b>up,</b> one in each chimney-corner; she, needles in hand, indefatigably {{knitting}} a sock; I, pipe in mouth, indolently weaving my vapors.|$|R
50|$|The {{attack of}} a {{position}} is becoming notably {{more difficult than}} its defense. The defensive during {{the first phase of}} battle offers a decisive superiority. The task of a skillful offensive will consist of forcing our foe to attack a position chosen by us, and only when casualties, demoralization, and exhaustion have drained his strength will we <b>ourselves</b> take <b>up</b> the tactical offensive.... Our strategy must be offensive, our tactics defensive.|$|R
60|$|I did not answer. I let him {{drag the}} vehicle up dark, steep ways, until I saw lights under a low roof of little trees and two children, one oddly beautiful, playing at ball. Then we found <b>ourselves</b> filling <b>up</b> the strict {{main street of}} a tiny hamlet, and across the wall of its inn was written in large letters, LE BOUT DU MONDE--the end of the world.|$|R
60|$|COKESON. [With an indulgent smile] We shan't {{want to set}} <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> {{against the}} law. Your father wouldn't waste his time doing that.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity," [...] said Gaff, [...] "to knock <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> together. You'd better lie down, cap'n, an' I'll pull both oars for a spell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Row steadily, Ruthven," [...] he shouted; [...] "don't spurt. We {{have a long}} row {{before us}} and must not knock <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> at the beginning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Gilbert, we must {{be getting}} on in years," [...] said Anne, with a half-rueful smile, [...] "when {{children}} who were six when we thought <b>ourselves</b> grown <b>up</b> are old enough now to have beaux. Dora's is Ralph Andrews--Jane's brother. I remember him as a little, round, fat, white-headed fellow who was always {{at the foot of}} his class. But I understand he is quite a fine-looking young man now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Traleg Kyabgon states: [...] "When this happens, {{instead of}} {{persisting}} with the meditation, {{it is better}} to try to refresh <b>ourselves</b> by getting <b>up</b> and going for a walk or washing our face, after which we return to our meditation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{certainly}} didn't hurt <b>ourselves</b> piling <b>up</b> the carts, and {{the time}} was well spent, if only {{for the sake of}} the precaution," [...] said George; and then, stopping suddenly, after they had walked nearly a mile, he pointed to a second track, which led directly into the woods a few yards ahead of them. [...] "They have been to the end of the road, and come back," [...] he whispered. [...] "Perhaps they have just turned in here after hearing us." ...|$|R
60|$|Unless we were {{concealed}} {{from view}} within half an hour, {{we might as}} well march straight to the nearest sentinel and give <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> as prisoners.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is to {{be short}} rations for awhile," [...] he said cheerfully. [...] "That will be better than to fill <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> now, and suffer afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear mama,' rejoined Kate, 'don't {{say a word}} to him, but let us {{run away}} as fast as we can, and shut <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> till Nicholas comes home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you can, and new ribbons, gloves, and {{slippers}} as well. You {{are so small}} it doesn't take much, and {{we can make it}} right <b>up</b> <b>ourselves.</b> So run and collect all your little finery, while I go and do the shopping at once." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{successful}} {{partnership with}} EMI {{led to the}} deal being extended, only to fall foul of EMI’s sale to venture capital company Terra Firma and the label being dropped in 2009. This came {{as something of a}} shock to Heavenly. [...] "There was a change of landscape in the industry and there was a change of landscape in our bank balance," [...] Barrett said in 2015. [...] "We were at a point in our lives where {{for the first time we}} probably considered <b>ourselves</b> grown <b>ups</b> and that scared us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But there's {{nothing like}} a {{striking}} appearance to help a man over a difficulty,--I've found that before and since. People like <b>ourselves,</b> who're <b>up</b> to diving dresses by the time we're seven, can scarcely imagine the effect of one on a simple-minded savage. One or two of these niggers cut and run, the others started in a great hurry trying to knock their brains out on the ground. And on I went as slow and solemn and silly-looking and artful as a jobbing plumber. It was evident they took me for something immense.|$|R
60|$|Jacob {{insisted that}} the old soldier and I give <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> to slumber while he kept guard, for {{he did not need}} the rest as much as we.|$|E
6000|$|... "We wrap <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> in {{curtains}} and bright things instead of dressing," [...] she explained. [...] "We {{have a sort}} of wardrobe of fancy dresses. Do you mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me dear boy,"--he began; {{and stopped}} {{abruptly}} in some confusion. Silence once more brooded over {{us as we}} played <b>ourselves</b> <b>up</b> the fairway {{and on to the}} green.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have another}} idea, captain," [...] Ned said, {{just as they}} were about to push off. [...] "As we saw when we were passing the ship we are {{drifting}} stern foremost. If we can fasten a long line to her stern we can hang on to it. They {{will not be able to}} see us if we are twenty fathoms astern. Then, if they anchor, and, as is likely enough, leave two or three men on board, we can haul <b>ourselves</b> noiselessly <b>up</b> with the rope and board her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think {{what it is}} to see {{the sins}} we sin, the tempting look, the word idle or unkind--aye, even the selfish thought or struggle, multiplied ten thousandfold and more eternal than <b>ourselves,</b> spring <b>up</b> upon the {{universal}} bosom of the earth to be the bane of a million destinies, whilst the everlasting Finger writes its endless count, and a cold voice of Justice cries in our conscience-haunted solitude, 'Oh! soul unshriven, behold the ripening harvest thy wanton hand did scatter, and long in vain for the waters of forgetfulness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently I {{talked to}} the Staff Officer, who chanced {{to be a friend}} of mine, and chanced, besides, to be a man with a {{capacity}} for sustained thought, an eye for country, and some imagination. He said: 'I don't like the situation; there are more of them than we expected. We have come down off our high ground. We have taken all the big guns off the big hills. We are getting <b>ourselves</b> cramped <b>up</b> among these kopjes in the valley of the Tugela. It will be like being in the Coliseum and shot at by every row of seats.' ...|$|R
