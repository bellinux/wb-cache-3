A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift <b>of</b> <b>healing</b> by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art <b>of</b> <b>healing.</b> Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment.

On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E

5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs <b>of</b> <b>healing</b> while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E

5|$|In popular memory, Tamar's {{image has}} {{acquired}} a legendary and romantic façade. A diverse set of folk songs, poems and tales illustrate her as an ideal ruler, a holy woman onto whom certain attributes of pagan deities and Christian saints were sometimes projected. For example, in an old Ossetian legend, Queen Tamar conceives her son of a sunbeam which shines through the window. Another myth, from the Georgian mountains, equates Tamar with the pagan deity of weather, Pirimze, who controls winter. Similarly, in the highland district of Pshavi, Tamar's image fused with a pagan goddess <b>of</b> <b>healing</b> and female fertility.|$|E
5|$|One Velociratoptor mongoliensis skull bears two {{parallel}} rows of small punctures that match the spacing {{and size of}} Velociraptor teeth. Scientists believe that the wound was likely inflicted by another Velociraptor during a fight. Further, because the fossil bone shows no sign <b>of</b> <b>healing</b> near the bite wounds, the injury probably killed it. Another specimen, found with the bones of an azhdarchid pterosaur within its stomach cavity, was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to its ribs. From evidence on the pterosaur bones, which were devoid of pitting or deformations from digestion, the Velociraptor died shortly after, possibly from the earlier injury.|$|E
5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs <b>of</b> <b>healing</b> that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E

40|$|Effects of topical {{application}} of Bis[benzyl N′-(indol- 3 -ylmethylene) -hydrazinecarbodithioato]-zinc(II) (BHCZ) on wound <b>healing</b> and histology <b>of</b> <b>healed</b> wound were assessed. Sprague Dawley rats were experimentally induced {{wound in the}} posterior neck area. Tween 20 (0. 2 ml of 10 %) was applied to rats in Group 1 (negative control). Intrasite gel (0. 2 ml) was applied topically to rats in Group 2 as reference. BHCZ at the concentrations 0. 2 ml of 25, 50 and 100 mg/ml were applied to Group 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Wound dressed with BHCZ significantly healed earlier than those treated with 10 % Tween 20. Also wound dressed with 100 mg/ml BHCZ accelerated the rate <b>of</b> wound <b>healing</b> compared to those dressed with intrasite gel and, 25 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml BHCZ. Histological analysis <b>of</b> <b>healed</b> wound with BHCZ showed comparatively less scar width at wound enclosure and the healed wound contained less macrophages and large amount of collagen with angiogenesis compared to wounds dressed with 10 % Tween 20. Results of {{this study showed that}} wounds dressed with 100 mg/ml of BHCZ significantly enhanced acceleration of the rate <b>of</b> wound <b>healing</b> enclosure, and histology <b>of</b> <b>healed</b> wounds showed comparatively less macrophages and more collagen with angiogenesis...|$|R
