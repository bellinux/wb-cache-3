Take tenant farming. I know a ranch in my county where the land was worth a hundred and twenty-five an acre. And it gave its return at that valuation. When the old man died, the son leased it to a Portuguese and went to live in the city. In five years the Portuguese skimmed the cream and dried up the udder. The second lease, with another Portuguese for three years, gave one-quarter the former return. No third Portuguese {{appeared}} to <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> it. There wasn't anything left. That ranch was worth fifty thousand when the old man died. In the end the son got eleven thousand for it. Why, I've seen land that paid twelve per cent., that, after the skimming of a five-years' lease, paid only one and a quarter per cent." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{applicant}} {{alleged that}} the respondent's conduct had been motivated by commercial racism, which the respondent strenuously denied.

50|$|The Victorian Football League {{also took}} a keen {{interest}} in the dispute. The Association grounds were of good quality and high capacity in suburbs with strong population growth, and the League feared that the councils would lease the grounds to other sports, such as rugby and soccer, giving those sports a fillip which would be detrimental to football's long-term popularity in Melbourne. The Preston council, for example, already had a better <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> its ground to the local soccer club. As such, the League expressed a willingness to intervene, and potentially play some of its own games at Olympic Park, or even take over the Association's lease, as a means of providing some financial incentive or compensation to Melbourne Carnivals Limited should it allow the Association to break its lease.|$|E

The Caledonian offered 6% dividend in perpetuity and all profits of up to 8%, and the YN&BR offered 6% for 3 years, and 7% thereafter. The N&CR shareholders met on 31 May 1848, and contrary to the view of the directors, voted that Hudson's (YN&BR) offer be accepted.

In 1808 they employed Scotsman James Drummond (1787-1863) to lay out the gardens. In 1822 the garden was described (Power: Botanist's guide to the County of Cork, 1845) as having approximately six acres and a glasshouse in a walled enclosure of 1 acre. Drummond was a noted field botanist during his time in Cork (and subsequently in Western Australia). The Government grant was withdrawn in 1830 and the Governors declined Drummond's <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the gardens and opted to surrender the lease. The lands were then let to Fr.

C&W £20 shares were now being quoted at £36-£40 but this was partly due to a widespread expectation that the new connections {{would lead to a}} takeover.

Hudson was concerned with {{the progress of the}} Great Northern Railway, that was building a railway north from London; if it succeeded in linking up with the Great North of England Railway at York, traffic between England and Scotland would be diverted from the Y&NMR, to his detriment. In 1845 Hudson made a generous <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the GNER and buy it within five years, and that year GNER shares increased in value by 44 per cent as the N&DJR took over operations on 1 July 1845. On 27 July 1846 the N&DJR changed its name to the York and Newcastle Railway and on 9 August 1847, less than a year later, merging with the Newcastle and Berwick Railway. The combined company was named the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway.|$|E
40|$|This report {{explores the}} role of Indian {{agricultural}} companies that {{have been involved in}} the recent trend in large-scale overseas acquisitions of farmland, criticised as “land grabbing”. While many international companies have traditionally grown cash crops abroad, and more recently crops for producing biofuels for global markets, this report is focused especially on the issue of Indian companies that invest in food production overseas. The report examines the various factors driving the “outsourcing ” of domestic food production. Primary among these are the Indian Government’s growing strategic concerns about ensuring the country’s long-term food security, and its concerns about diminishing ground water tables in Northern and Central India. Other factors include the allure for Indian foreign investors of much cheaper land and more abundant water sources in overseas locations and the eager welcome of many developing country governments, many of which have courted Indian agricultural investors. In many cases, such countries have offered special incentives, including the <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> massive tracts of arable land at very generous terms, including access to water and the ability to fully repatriate profits generated. The report also lists the major ways in which the Indian Government has been increasingly pro-active in taking steps to facilitate this trend for overseas agricultural investment by Indian companies, such as high-level trade diplomacy and lines of credit from the Export-Import Bank. India's outward foreign direct investment has been enabled by a series of reforms and modifications over the last decade to India’s rules and regulations on Indian companies investing in overseas operations. Also reviewed are the pro-active roles played by national Indian business associations such a...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of the First edition of Fourteen previously unedited documentary Greek papyri belonging to the Egypt Exploration Society, London. The papyri all come From Egypt during the period when {{it was part of}} the Roman Empire, and range in date From the First century A. D. to the sixth century A. D. Eight of them concern the issuing of seed-corn by the Roman authorities to the Farmers and these texts are preceded by a general introduction in which this practice is discussed. Texts 1 - 5 are applications sent in by the Farmers to the authorities requesting the issue of seed-corn; three of them belong to the year A. D. 99 and number 4 is From the same regnal year A. D. 99 / 100, whereas number 5 is a much later example and dates From the early third century A. D. Texts 6 - 8 are orders From the authorities to the distributors of seed-corn to proceed with the issuing of the appropriate amount of seed-corn to the Farmers. All these three texts date From the year A. D. 99 and may well be the orders corresponding to the applications preserved in Texts numbers 1 - 3. Texts 9 - 14 are of a miscellaneous character. Text number 9 dates From the same period as numbers 1 - 8; it is probably an application For the refund of the price of requisitioned wheat which the Farmers have supplied to the government. Text number 10 is an <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> land, which dates from the very end of the second century A. D. and has several peculiarities in its Format. Texts numbers 11 - 12 are undertakings by a sailor to serve on the boats which are transporting corn From the Arsinoite nome. These texts, and number 13, a receipt For the return of the boat, all date From the reign of the emperor Gallienus. Finally, number 14 is a receipt For wages which belongs in the sixth century A. D.
