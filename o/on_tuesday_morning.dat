5|$|The drama ended <b>on</b> <b>Tuesday</b> <b>morning,</b> May 12, 1863, when a {{group of}} {{officers}} and soldiers forced their way into the Rova and seized the king. His wife, Queen Rabodo, pleaded for his life to be spared and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed. The soldiers threw a lamba over Radama's head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead, thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Under Grace's {{leadership}} at Lord's, the Gentlemen batted {{very well and}} totalled 310 {{on the first day}} before reducing the Players to 39–4 at the close. Grace scored 90, his highest score of the season so far, and was well supported by Alfred and Edward Lyttelton. The Players recovered <b>on</b> <b>Tuesday</b> <b>morning,</b> thanks to a seventh wicket century stand by John Selby and Tom Emmett, to reach 231 all out which left the Gentlemen with a first innings lead of 79. Grace took 2–31. In the second innings, Grace was bowled by Shaw for 2 with the score at 6–1 but his opening partner A. P. Lucas steadied the innings with 91 and was well supported by Ridley, Edward Lyttelton and Steel. The Gentlemen finally amassed 326 to leave the Players needing 406 to win. They were never in the hunt and, although Selby was defiant with another half-century, Grace took 4–55 to lead the Gentlemen to victory.|$|E

5|$|Grace {{returned}} to London and played {{in his next}} match, starting on Monday, 13 May, for MCC against an England XI at Lord's. This was another first-class fixture, scheduled for three days but completed in two, the mostly professional England XI winning by 3 wickets. MCC won the toss, batted first and totalled 93, half of which were scored by Grace himself with 47. England reached 75–6 at the close and were all out for 115 <b>on</b> <b>Tuesday</b> <b>morning,</b> but MCC were then dismissed for only 58, Grace having been first out for 1. Nevertheless, England struggled to complete their victory and lost 7 wickets in scoring the necessary 37 runs. In cold, damp conditions it was therefore a bowlers' match. Grace was dismissed in both innings by Tom Emmett, who was well supported by Billy Midwinter and Alex Watson. The MCC attack was led by Alfred Shaw, who took 10 wickets. Grace bowled in the first innings only and returned figures of 3–43. Grace's 47 in the first innings was the top score in the game, the second highest being 30 by Arthur Shrewsbury for England. Grace sustained a thumb injury during the match which prevented him {{taking part in the}} England second innings.|$|E

25|$|On 20 September 2011, a power fault {{disrupted}} train {{services on}} all 16 stations on the Circle Line. The four hours delay left thousands of commuters stranded during rush-hour.

Train services were gradually restored from 8am and all services were restored just before 10am. Dakota and Mountbatten stations were the last two to resume operations. Investigations were carried out.

25|$|The Essex v Northamptonshire {{match was}} played at Valentines Park, Ilford 17 to 20 May. Northamptonshire won the toss {{and decided to}} bat, scoring 215 all out with a top score of 49 by Vince Broderick while Essex's Test leg break and googly bowler Peter Smith took four for 65. By close of play on Saturday, Essex had replied to 170 for 4 with opener Chick Cray on 90 not out. He {{completed}} his century, exactly 100, on Monday morning and Essex went on to total 267 all out.

Timms was out for 112 <b>on</b> <b>Tuesday</b> <b>morning</b> and Peter Smith completed ten in the match by taking six for 84 in the Northamptonshire total of 291. Essex therefore needed 240 to win with ample time left on the final day.

By the thirty-second ballot, Blaine had dropped six votes from the night before, and Grant had increased his total to 309.

[...] On the thirty-third ballot, nine Wisconsin delegates shifted their support from Grant to Elihu Washburne.

Garfield [...] "challenge the correctness of the announcement", claiming that without his consent, {{he should not be}} receiving votes. Hoar dismissed Garfield's question, claiming later that he denied Garfield because {{he did not want to}} see a presidency be undone by a simple point of order, meaning he did not want Garfield to stop the momentum for his own candidacy. After the ballot, the vote totals for the major candidates stood at 312 for Grant, 275 for Blaine, 107 for Sherman, and 17 for Garfield. In the thirty-fifth ballot, Benjamin Harrison of Indiana announced that his state would shift all twenty-seven of its votes (mostly coming from the Blaine column) to Garfield.
