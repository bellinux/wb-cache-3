5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and the closeness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date {{to those of the}} later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and many experts do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E
5|$|The Old Norse {{feminine}} proper noun Hel {{is identical}} to the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> over which she rules, Old Norse Hel. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English hell (and thus Modern English hell), Old Frisian helle, Old Saxon hellia, Old High German hella, and Gothic halja. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *xaljō or *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.|$|E
