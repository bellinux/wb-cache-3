5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} to the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Manchester University, Williams recruited his TRE colleague Tom Kilburn on secondment. By the autumn of 1947 the pair had increased the storage capacity of the Williams tube from <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> to 2,048, arranged in a 64 by 32-bit array, and demonstrated that {{it was able to}} store those bits for four hours. Engineer Geoff Tootill joined the team on loan from TRE in September 1947, and remained on secondment until April 1949.|$|E

5000|$|The Longitudinal Redundancy Check byte was {{the only}} {{character}} that could have other than four <b>one</b> <b>bits.</b> This byte contains a zero in each bit position where the data record contained an even number of <b>one</b> <b>bits,</b> and <b>one</b> where an odd number. [...] "Idle characters and control sequences {{are not included in}} the LRS.|$|R
50|$|It can get worse. If parity is {{specified}} {{and we use}} 2 stop bits, {{the overhead}} for carrying <b>one</b> 8 <b>bit</b> character is 4 <b>bits</b> (<b>one</b> start <b>bit,</b> <b>one</b> parity <b>bit</b> and two stop bits) - or 50%! In this case a 9600 bit/s connection will carry 9600/12 byte/s (800 byte/s). Asynchronous serial interfaces commonly will support bit transmission speeds of up to 230.4 kbit/s. If it is set up to have no parity and <b>one</b> stop <b>bit,</b> this means the byte transmission rate is 23.04 kbyte/s.|$|R
5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{accepts a}} 32-bit floating-point number as the input and stores a halved value for later use. Then, treating the bits representing the floating-point number as a 32-bit integer, a logical shift right by <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> is performed {{and the result}} subtracted from the magic number 0x5F3759DF. This is the first approximation of the inverse square root of the input. Treating the bits again as a floating-point number, it runs one iteration of Newton's method, yielding a more precise approximation.|$|E
5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a little boy mysteriously reappears after having been kidnapped for ten years. However, he has not aged <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> after his disappearance. While the case stirs up painful memories for Doggett, suspicion stirs that the boy is not all he seems.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.2 was {{released}} on August 8, 2005 and added the option of <b>One</b> <b>Bit</b> Audio, used on Super Audio CDs, at up to 8 channels. To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported formats be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would {{not be required to}} support YCBCR output.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, coded mark {{inversion}} (CMI) is a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) line code. It encodes zero bits as a half {{bit time}} of zero {{followed by a}} half <b>bit</b> time of <b>one,</b> and while <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> are encoded as a full bit time of a constant level. The level used for <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> alternates each time one is coded.|$|R

5|$|Finance chair Walter M. Gibson, {{supported}} by Minister of the Interior Samuel G. Wilder, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase {{gold and silver}} bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was one {{means by which the}} government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his world tour of 1881. During this journey, he was contacted by the owner of a New Caledonia nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono (The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, fifty cents, twenty-five cents, and twelve and one-half cents. Twelve and one-half cents, or <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> (one Spanish colonial real) was sometimes the day's pay for a laborer.|$|E
25|$|Flash memory stores {{information}} in {{an array of}} memory cells made from floating-gate transistors. In single-level cell (SLC) devices, each cell stores only <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> of information. Multi-level cell (MLC) devices, including triple-level cell (TLC) devices, can store more than <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> per cell.|$|E

50|$|Each 8-bit output symbol {{contains}} 4 zero <b>bits</b> and 4 <b>one</b> <b>bits,</b> so {{the code}} can, like a parity bit, detect all single-bit errors.|$|R
25|$|The {{computer}} had 2048 {{words of}} erasable magnetic core memory and 36 kilowords of read-only core rope memory. Both had cycle times of 11.72microseconds. The memory word length was 16 bits: 15 bits {{of data and}} <b>one</b> odd-parity <b>bit.</b> The CPU-internal 16-bit word format was 14 <b>bits</b> of data, <b>one</b> overflow <b>bit,</b> and <b>one</b> sign <b>bit</b> (ones' complement representation).|$|R
25|$|Any other {{value is}} an invalid response. There {{can only be}} <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> set at most.|$|E

5000|$|Independently, Commodore Business Machines (CBM) {{created a}} group coded {{recording}} scheme for their Commodore 2040 {{floppy disk drive}} (launched {{in the spring of}} 1979). The relevant constraints on the 2040 drive were that no more than two zero bits could occur in a row, and no more than eight <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> in a row; the drive imposed no special constraint on the first bit in a byte. This allowed the use of a scheme similar to that used in [...] bpi tape drives. Every four bits of data are translated into five bits on disk, according to the following table:Inhere, no code starts with two zero bits, nor ends with two zero bits. This ensures that regardless of the input data, the encoded data will never contain more than two zero bits in a row. With this encoding not more than eight <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> in a row are possible. Therefore, Commodore used sequences of ten or more <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> in a row as synchronization mark.|$|R
5000|$|Between computers, {{the most}} common {{configuration}} used was [...] "8N1": eight <b>bit</b> characters, with <b>one</b> start <b>bit,</b> <b>one</b> stop <b>bit,</b> and no parity bit. Thus 10 Baud times are used to send a single character, and so dividing the signalling bit-rate by ten results in the overall transmission speed in characters per second.|$|R
25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{maximum capacity}} of an optic fibre {{is more than}} 1015 <b>bits</b> (<b>one</b> petabit or <b>one</b> quadrillion <b>bits)</b> per second.|$|R
25|$|A /24 network may {{be divided}} into the {{following}} subnets by increasing the subnet mask successively by <b>one</b> <b>bit.</b> This affects {{the total number of}} hosts that can be addressed in the /24 network (last column).|$|E
25|$|When {{incorporated}} into an embedded system, serial flash requires fewer wires on the PCB than parallel flash memories, since it transmits and receives data <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> at a time. This may permit {{a reduction in}} board space, power consumption, and total system cost.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{complementary}} bits come in sets {{designed to}} facilitate the joinery used in frame and panel construction. <b>One</b> <b>bit</b> is designed to cut the grove in the rail and stile pieces while the other shape {{the edge of the}} panel to fit in the grove.|$|E
5000|$|The four-of-eight {{code was}} a 64 {{character}} set plus six control characters, encoded in eight bits. Exactly four bits of each character were <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> [...] - [...] there are 70 such possible bit combinations.|$|R
50|$|The {{disparity}} of a {{bit pattern}} {{is the difference}} in the number of <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> vs the number of zero bits. The running disparity is the running total of the disparity of all previously transmitted words.|$|R
50|$|The {{residual}} {{effect on the}} stream {{to the number of}} zero and <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> transmitted is maintained as the running disparity (RD) and the effect of slew is balanced by the choice of encoding for following symbols.|$|R
25|$|If a {{compression}} {{scheme is}} lossless—that is, {{you can always}} recover the entire original message by decompressing—then a compressed message has the same quantity of information as the original, but communicated in fewer characters. That is, it has more information, or a higher entropy, per character. This means a compressed message has less redundancy. Roughly speaking, Shannon's source coding theorem says that a lossless compression scheme cannot compress messages, on average, {{to have more than}} <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> of information per bit of message, but that any value less than <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> of information per bit of message can be attained by employing a suitable coding scheme. The entropy of a message per bit multiplied by the length of that message is a measure of how much total information the message contains.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} to use all four privilege levels, because the current Operating Systems like Windows, Linux, etc. mostly are using Paging mechanism and Paging only has <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> to specify the privilege level which is either Supervisor or User (U/S Bit). Windows NT uses the two-level system.|$|E
25|$|RFC 3021 {{specifies}} {{an exception}} to this rule for 31-bit subnet masks, which means the host identifier is only <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> long for two permissible addresses. In such networks, usually point-to-point links, only two hosts (the end points) may be connected and a specification of network and broadcast addresses is not necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Packets {{sent to the}} {{broadcast}} address, all <b>one</b> <b>bits,</b> are received by all stations on a local area network. In hexadecimal {{the broadcast}} address would be FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. A broadcast frame is flooded and is forwarded to and accepted by all other nodes.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>one</b> <b>bits</b> is checked by the {{receiver}} to tell if an error {{has occurred in the}} transmission of the character. There should be three ones in each character received. The return channel will include the RQ signal if an error is detected.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the eight}} {{character}} repetition cycle, Channel A is encoded ↓↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ (43333333) and channel B is marked ↑↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ (34444444). The combination marking pattern ↓↓↑↑↑↓↑↓↑↓↑↓↑↓↑↓ (4433343434343434 <b>one</b> <b>bits).</b> [...] In practice the eight character repetition cycle {{has not been}} observed in use on the airwaves.|$|R
