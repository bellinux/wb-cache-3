Rarely, it can develop into a primary bone cancer known as Paget's sarcoma. Often Paget's disease is localised to only a few bones in the body. The pelvis, femur, and lower lumbar vertebrae are the most commonly affected bones.

Since then, Paget's disease has been placed among the clinical conditions which lead to congestive heart failure accompanied by high cardiac output, the other conditions being systemic arterio-venous aneurysm, beri-beri, severe anemia, hyperthyroidism and emphysema. 8 11 Edholm, Howarth and McMichael believed that <b>osteitis</b> <b>deformans</b> could give rise to con-ditions similar to those created by systemic arteriovenous aneurysms and that it is prob-able that direct, communications between ar-teries and veins exist in the bones of patients with Paget's disease.

30|$|Paget disease (also {{known as}} <b>osteitis</b> <b>deformans)</b> is a chronic {{skeletal}} disorder characterised by abnormal and excessive bone remodelling. Paget disease {{is estimated to}} affect approximately 3 â 4 % of individuals older than 40 Â years [2, 5, 23 â 26]. It is a progressive disorder that evolves through various stages or phases of activity. Three major phases are recognised: the lytic phase (incipient active), in which osteoclastic resorption predominates; the mixed phase (active), {{in which there is}} both osteoblastic and osteoclastic hyperplasia with predominantly osteoblastic activity; the sclerotic or blastic phase (late inactive), in which the osteoblastic activity gradually declines. This anarchic bone behaviour produces disorganised new bone in a mosaic pattern [2, 6, 23, 24]. Paget affects the skull in 28 â 42 % of cases, particularly the frontal and occipital bones. Other locations affected by Paget are the lumbar spine (30 â 75 %), pelvis (30 â 75 % of cases), sacrum (30 â 60 %) and femur (25 â 65 %). Polyostotic disease is more common than monostotic disease [23, 24].|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Pagetâs {{disease of}} bone (<b>osteitis</b> <b>deformans)</b> {{is a rare}} {{metabolic}} disorder of bone remodeling with complex etiology. In the most cases, it is detected by coincidence, during nuclear medicine and radiological diagnostic procedures. Herein we report a case of advanced prostate cancer coexisting with asymptomatic Pagetâs disease. Case report. We present a 69 -year-old patient, with biochemical recurrence two years after radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer and period of stable remission. During the evaluation of metastatic spread of prostate cancer, the bone scintigraphy with technetium diphosphonate showed diffuse areas of increased radiotracer uptake in the left leg long bones and focal changes in the axial part of the skeleton. Scintigraphic findings led to a differential diagnostic dilemma regarding etiology of bone changes, so it was supplemented by standard radiologic methods and laboratory evaluation of bone metabolism parameters. The existence of asymptomatic polyostotic Pagetâs disease and metastatic bone changes was found at the same time. Conclusion. Metastatic bone lesions, in this case from prostate cancer, and asymptomatic Pagetâs disease may closely resemble each other. They both need careful evaluation {{in order to determine}} the proper stages of malignant disease and selection of appropriate therapies for patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Osteitis</b> <b>deformans,</b> {{also known}} as Paget's disease, is {{characterized}} by accelerated osteoclastic activity followed by ineffective osteoblastic activity resulting in a deformed and fragile bone. It is more prevalent in Western Europe and relatively rare in Eastern Asia. It predominantly involves the lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur, frequently as polyostotic and rarely as monostotic disease. Here, we report a 64 -year-old female, who presented with severe progressive back pain with no neurological symptoms. Radiographs revealed a picture frame L 1 vertebra which was deformed and enlarged with loss of normal alignment. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bone marrow changes involving all columns of L 1 vertebra. Whole-body technetium- 99 bone scan showed a solitary increased uptake of radioisotope by L 1 vertebra. Considering the possibility of metastatic tumors, blood investigations were drawn for tumor markers which were within normal limits. A computed tomography-guided biopsy was done to facilitate diagnosis. Histopathology sections showed a mosaic pattern of bony trabeculae with multinucleated osteoclasts causing erosions and tunneling. A diagnosis of monostotic Paget's disease was made which satisfactorily responded to single-dose zoledronic acid treatment. A comprehensive literature review is provided...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY An {{automated}} {{method is}} described, using standard continuous flow techniques, for {{the determination of}} urine fluoride ion concentration using a fluoride ion selective electrode. It is shown that the kinetics of the electrode response to changes in fluoride ion {{can be used for}} the accurate measurement of fluoride ion concentration in urine, and that equilibration of the electrode response is not a prerequisite for the measurement of fluoride ion. Recovery experiments are in the range 83 to 90 %; in-batch precision is between 0 Â· 9 and], 6 %and carryover 2 Â· 5 %or less. One of the numerous agents used in the treatment of osteoporosis and <b>osteitis</b> <b>deformans</b> (Paget's disease of the bone) has been sodium fluoride, with doses varying from 20 mg to 60 rng a day.

40|$|A {{study of}} two {{siblings}} {{with a severe}} infantile form of familial idiopathic hyperphosphatasia is reported. A girl aged one year was followed for two years while receiving intermittent treatment with porcine calcitonin.

Her sister aged two months received porcine calcitonin for three weeks, during which clinical improvement, {{no change in the}} serum level of alkaline phosphatase and a marked decrease of the excretion of hydroxyproline were recorded. A rare disorder of bone in childhood has been reported in the literature under different names. Its main features are progressive skeletal deformity with generalised conversion of long bones to coarsely tra-beculated radiolucent widened bone, coxa vara, pro-tusio acetabuli and diaphysial bowing, and high levels of both serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary excretion of hydroxyproline.

The aim of this review is, starting from a background on inflammatory processes and bone remodelling, to give an update on the use of bisphosphonates, outlining the possible side effects and proposing new trends for the future. Starting from a brief introduction on inflammation and bone remodelling, we collect and analyze studies involving the use of bisphosphonates for treatment of inflammatory conditions and pathologies characterized by bone loss. Selected articles, including reviews, published between 1976 and 2011, were chosen from Pubmed/Medline {{on the basis of their}} content.

Many conditions and diseases have been named for scientists who were supposed either to have discovered them or initially described them. Historians sometimes find that the conditions were actually described earlier by other investigators, but because their findings were published in obscure journals or in a different language they were not given the proper credit.

The exact etiology {{of the disease}} is uncertain, although genetic and environmental factors {{are believed to be}} important. Bisphosphonate is the main class of medication being used to control disease activity via its antiresorptive effect. This review discusses the controversies concerning the use of bisphosphonates in the treatment of Pagetâs disease of bone, the efficacy of different bisphosphonates in controlling disease activity, and the possible rare side effects of bisphosphonates. Symptoms are the main indication for treatment in Pagetâs disease of bone. As treatment benefits in asymptomatic individuals remain controversial and nonevidence based, the decision to treat these patients should be individualized to their risk and benefit profiles. There are several trials conducted to evaluate and compare the efficacy of different regimes of bisphosphonates for treating Pagetâs disease of bone. Most trials used biochemical markers rather than clinical symptoms or outcomes as parameters for comparison. Zoledronate is an attractive option as it can achieve high rates of biochemical remission and sustain long duration of suppression by a single dose. Atypical femoral fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw are two rare and severe side effects reported, possibly related to the use of bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis and malignancy-induced hypercalcemia. As the regimes of bisphosphonates used for treating Pagetâs disease of bone are different from those two diseases, the risks of developing these two possible side effects are expected to be very low, although this remains unknown. Vitamin D and calcium supplement should be given to patients at risk of vitamin D insufficiency when given zoledronate, as symptomatic hypocalcemia may develop. For those intolerant of bisphosphonates, subcutaneous calcitonin can be used for a limited period due to its associated risk of malignancy.

40|$|<b>OSTEITIS</b> <b>deformans</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Sir James Paget of Lon don in 1876. Although uncommon, it {{can hardly be}} regarded as a rare disease. In 1915, Da Costa et al. (1) reviewed the literature and found 213 cases, including 5 amongst their own records. Since then, the literature has greatly increased; there are to date 245 additional references. In 1925, Lewin (2) stated there were about 251 cases in the literature and on this basis Van Hazel and Andrews (3) concluded that the disease was rare. Since there were 213 cases prior to 1915, it would appear, according to Lewin's observation, that 38 cases only were reported between 1915 and 1925. As a matter of fact, the writer found 115, bringing the total number to 328 to the end of 1924. Since then 206 other cases have been reported, making a total of 534 to date. That the incidence of this disease is probably still greater is suggested from the rate of increase with the more general use of X-Rays. As is well known, X-Rays afford practically the only means of detecting this disease in its very early stages. With still more general use of this laboratory procedure, it appears reasonable that the incidence of this disease will probably be found to be still greater. From the available literature, it is difficult to arrive at the true age and sex incidences, because these factors have received relatively little con sideration in a large number of reports. A common practice appears to have been to report one case in detail and mention incidentally only the number of other cases met with. However, from the available data, the ages ranged from 6 to 89 years; the average was 56. 8 years. There appeared to be more males than females; the ratio was about 1. 5 to 1. The pathology of this disease has frequently been dealt with in detail and, for purposes of brevity, will not be discussed here, except for relevant facts in the interpretation of our data.
