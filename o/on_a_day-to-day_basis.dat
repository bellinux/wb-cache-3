5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>day-to-day</b> <b>basis</b> airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E

Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>day-to-day</b> <b>basis</b> than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside {{the home and the}} mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

40|$|Health {{sciences}} libraries {{have considerable}} potential as resources for both formal continuing professional education, {{as well as}} the informal continuing education that results from the professional's efforts to solve problems in daily practice. While there is a growing interest in making the resources of health sciences libraries more accessible to practitioners <b>on</b> <b>a</b> routine, <b>day-to-day</b> <b>basis,</b> there also needs to be more awareness of how, when, where, and why professionals look for information in the context of practical problems. This paper reviews recent research that identifies the context in which physicians seek information and advice from external sources, the information sources that physicians access, and the factors that influence which particular sources are sought. The results indicate that physicians vary in their information needs, preferences, motivations, and strategies for seeking information. This diversity suggests that health sciences libraries, in their efforts to be more accessible, should consider "market research" to determine the needs, preferences, and use patterns of the library's targeted users. Libraries may also benefit from exploring alternative methods of improving access to their resources...|$|R

The literature lacks both qualitative and quantitative studies that address staff nurse views of CBE {{or the use of}} CBE data for clinical decision making. Purpose The specific aim {{of this study was to}} explore the decision making of medical-surgical nurses who use CBE as their method of documentation. Method Grounded theory was used to explore how medical-surgical nurses decide whether to follow <b>a</b> CBE policy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>day-to-day,</b> patient-by-patient <b>basis.</b> Approval of the AMSN Research Committee and the Rutgers University Institutional Review Board was obtained. Telephone interviews were conducted with 16 registered nurses, recruited from the AMSN membership, working in staff nurse positions <b>on</b> <b>an</b> acute care medical-surgical unit who described their perspectives and experiences in using CBE to document clinical data. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and these data were analyzed using the constant comparative method as described by Glaser (1998). Findings The theory that emerged is a three-step process which includes Coming to Terms with the Method, Being Responsible in Documentation, and Creating a Protective Picture (CAPP). CAPP is the core category that explains how the participants resolved their main concern - creating documentation they believed would be protective of their patients, themselves, and/or their employers.

"Midsummer" is an ironic romantic comedy, in which the happy ending is, on reflection, deeply problematic. "Ground Zero" is darker in tone, dealing with dissolution and disintegration. "Pesadilla Beach" involves memory and different generations in the same community.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{widespread}} pain (CWP) affects 10 % {{of adults}} and often causes significant disability in everyday life. Research on time in chronic conditions {{has focused on}} biographical disruption and perceptions of past and future. However, more mundane aspects of time are also disrupted in a condition such as CWP, which is uncertain <b>on</b> <b>a</b> minute-to-minute, <b>day-to-day</b> <b>basis,</b> {{as well as in}} the longer term. The results presented here are part of a wider study, the aim of which was to explore how people with CWP experience and give meaning to their 'condition'. This article focuses on how mundane, repetitive and taken-for-granted aspects of everyday life are disrupted for people with CWP. Methods Eight people aged 40 – 60 years living with CWP took part in multiple in-depth interviews, diaries and family interviews, exploring the meanings and interpretations of participants and individuals' experiences in a social context. Results The findings illuminate the ways in which the experience of time is changed by CWP: carrying out the tasks of everyday life takes longer, routines are disrupted, and changes are needed in how time is managed. Some strategies for managing these tasks rely on ability to control one's time. However, this is not always possible and, for some, the experience of CWP becomes characterised by lack of such control. Conclusion This study explored the concept of controllable time in the experience of CWP. Regaining control over time is an important element in coping with chronic pain, and helping patients to regain such control has potential as a target for health professionals involved in pain management. </p...|$|R
