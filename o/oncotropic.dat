40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{highlighted}} {{the use of}} parvoviruses as potential vectors for tumour-cell-targeted gene therapy. The <b>oncotropic</b> properties of the prototype strain of minute virus of mice (MVMp) suggest that this virus might be a useful vehicle for introducing selectively therapeutic genes, e. g. lymphokine or suicide genes, into tumour cells and preferentially expressing them. But the low titre of recombinant virus stocks (105 - 106 infectious units per ml) and their high level of contamination by cell proteins make it practically impossible to evaluate their efficacy in in vivo systems.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to enhance {{selectively}} the immunostimulatory properties of tumor cells. Based on their <b>oncotropic</b> properties, we used autonomous recombinant parvoviruses to transduce the genes coding for the constimulatory molecules CD 80 (B 7 - 1) or CD 86 (B 7 - 2) specifically into tumor cells without transducing normal cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After infection of tumor cells by these viruses, surface expression of CD 80 and CD 86 molecules was assessed by FACS and enhancement of immunostimulatory properties was assessed in alloreactions with G- 10 purified T cells. RESULTS: Infection of normal and transformed cells with recombinant MVM- B 7 - 1 or B 7 - 2 viruses leads to expression of costimulatory molecules only by tumor cells and confers on them the capacity to sensitize naive T cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: This approach should ultimately lead to selective expression of costimulatory molecules in tumor tissues in vivo without affecting normal cells. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|AbstractGalectin- 3 has {{previously}} {{been found to be}} required by the parvovirus minute virus of mice prototype strain (MVMp) for infection of mouse fibroblast cells. Since MVMp is an <b>oncotropic</b> virus, and galectin- 3 is a multifunctional protein implicated in cancer metastasis, we hypothesized that galectin- 3 and Mgat 5, the Golgi enzyme that synthesizes high-affinity glycan ligands of galectin- 3, might play a role in MVMp infection. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of galectin- 3 in mouse cells transformed with polyomavirus middle T antigen and Mgat 5 −/− mouse mammary tumor cells, we found that galectin- 3 and Mgat 5 are both necessary for efficient MVMp cell entry and infection, but not for cell binding. Moreover, we found that human cancer cells expressing higher levels of galectin- 3 were more efficiently infected with MVMp than cell lines expressing lower galectin- 3 levels. We conclude that galectin- 3 and Mgat 5 are involved in MVMp infection, and propose that galectin- 3 is a determinant of MVMp oncotropism...|$|E
40|$|The {{prototype}} {{strain of}} minute virus of mice [MVM(p) ] is an autonomous parvovirus with a tropism for cells expressing a neoplastically transformed phenotype. To generate gene transfer vectors for tumor-specific gene expression, human interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and murine interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) genes were cloned {{under the control}} of the p 38 late promoter of MVM(p). Upon transfection into permissive cells, the recombinant MVMIL 2 or MVMIL 4 DNA was excised, amplified, and, in the presence of a helper plasmid, packaged into recombinant viral particles. The recombinant viruses were able to transfer fully functional IL- 2 and IL- 4 genes to permissive t cells and retained the <b>oncotropic</b> host range properties of the parental virus. Following infection with MVMIL 2, nontransformed fibroblasts of rodent (FR 3 T 3) or human (MRC- 5) origin produced minimal IL- 2 compared with the high levels of IL- 2 production observed in their transformed derivatives (FREJ 4 and MRC- 5 V 1).

Herein, we performed an experimental preclinical study {{to validate the}} anti-tumour effect of talaporfin sodium-mediated PDT (t-PDT) for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. We used human ESCC cells derived from various differentiation grades or resistant to 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU). The cytotoxic effect of t-PDT was determined by evaluating cell viability, apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, the anti-tumour effect of t-PDT was assessed using an anchorage-independent cell-growth assay and xenograft transplantation models. t-PDT induced potent cytotoxicity in ESCC cells independent of their differentiation grade or 5 -FU resistance. Moreover, t-PDT induced robust apoptosis, as indicated by cell shrinkage, perinuclear vacuolization, nuclear fragmentation and induction of annexin V-positive cells. This apoptotic response was accompanied by concurrent activation of ROS, and induction of DNA double-strand breakage. Importantly, t-PDT suppressed efficiently anchorage-independent cell growth as well as ESCC-xenografted tumor formation. In aggregate, t-PDT showed anti-tumor potential for ESCC cells with variou...|$|E
40|$|Oncolytic viruses (OVs) have {{attracted}} increasing attention as novel {{weapons in the}} fight against cancer. Nowadays, more than 20 viruses have been recognized as poten-tial OVs, with new candidates continuing to emerge while established viruses enter clinical trials. Among OVs, non-modified rodent parvoviruses (PVs) are especially interesting, as they are non-pathogenic for humans and possess <b>oncotropic</b> and oncolytic features. 1 Recent work from our group focused on the ability of the parvo-viruses Minute Virus of Mice (MVMp) and rat parvovirus H- 1 (H- 1 PV) to trigger, direct and indirectly, the activation of the immune system against tumor cells. In terms of direct effects on the immune system, our work showed that in vitro infection of immune cells includ-ing human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and mouse dendritic cells (DCs) by PVs is abortive, since virus can enter cells, but fails to replicate and pro-duce new virions. 2, 3 However, infection of human immune cells does not remain completely silent.

40|$|Notch is {{a highly}} conserved transmembrane protein that is {{involved}} in cell fate decisions and is found in organisms ranging from Drosophila to humans. A human homologue of Notch, TAN 1, was initially identified at the chromosomal breakpoint of a subset of T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias/lymphomas containing a t(7; 9) chromosomal translocation; however, its role in oncogenesis has been unclear. Using a bone marrow reconstitution assay with cells containing retrovirally transduced TAN 1 alleles, we analyzed the oncogenic potential of both nuclear and extranuclear forms of truncated TAN 1 in hematopoietic cells. Although the Moloney leukemia virus long terminal repeat drives expression in most hematopoietic cell types, retroviruses encoding either form of the TAN 1 protein induced clonal leukemias of exclusively immature T cell phenotypes in " ~ of transplanted animals. All tumors overexpressed truncated TAN 1 of the size and subcellular localization predicted from {{the structure of the}} gene. These results show that TAN 1 is an oncoprotein and suggest that truncation and overexpression are important determinants of transforming activity. Moreover, the murine tumors caused by TAN 1 in the bone marrow transplant model are very similar to the TANl-associated human tumors and suggest that TAN 1 may be specifically <b>oncotropic</b> for T cells...|$|E
40|$|Osteonecrosis of the maxillary or mandibular bone is an {{infrequent}} {{but often}} severe event occurring {{in patients who}} undergo prolonged treatment with bisphosphonates. Histology is in some cases mandatory to differentiate it from neoplastic osteolysis, but a biopsy can further contribute to bone damage. Functional imaging obtained by a tracer that shows <b>oncotropic</b> properties, such as Tc 99 m-sestamibi, in comparison to a non-tumor-specific substance such as FDG-PET, can support the differential diagnosis, thus avoiding invasive procedures. Four patients affected by multiple myeloma and jaw osteonecrosis were prospectively evaluated by sestamibi and FDG-PET scans. Local diagnosis was performed by clinical, radiological and, in some cases, histological evaluations. Each patient was studied by Tc 99 m-sestamibi, performed by planar anterior and posterior whole-body scans and SPECT {{of the head and}} neck, and by PET/CT. Two nuclear medicine physicians, unaware of the final diagnosis, reviewed the images. No sestamibi uptake was evident in the four patients with jaw osteonecrosis, while FDG-PET/CT showed focal uptake in all of them. Our study suggests that the combined use of sestamibi scintigraphy and FDG-PET/CT could support the clinical diagnosis of oral osteonecrosis avoiding the risks of a surgical biopsy. Studies on higher number of patients are necessary to validate these preliminary observations...|$|E
40|$|The rat {{parvovirus}} H- 1 (H- 1 PV) attracts high {{attention as}} an anticancer agent, {{because it is}} not pathogenic for humans and has <b>oncotropic</b> and oncosuppressive properties. The viral nonstructural NS 1 protein is thought to mediate H- 1 PV cytotoxicity, but its exact contribution to this process remains undefined. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the H- 1 PV NS 1 protein on human cell proliferation and cell viability. We show that NS 1 expression is sufficient to induce the accumulation of cells in G 2 phase, apoptosis via caspase 9 and 3 activation, and cell lysis. Similarly, cells infected with wild-type H- 1 PV arrest in G 2 phase and undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, we also show that both expression of NS 1 and H- 1 PV infection lead to higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), associated with DNA double-strand breaks. Antioxidant treat-ment reduces ROS levels and strongly decreases NS 1 - and virus-induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, indicating that NS 1 -induced ROS are important mediators of H- 1 PV cytotoxicity. Members of the genus Parvovirus are small, icosahedral, nonenveloped viruses which infect vertebrates.

40|$|Parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVMp) is {{endowed with}} <b>oncotropic</b> {{properties}} so far ascribed {{only to the}} dependency of the virus life cycle on cellular factors expressed during S phase and/or modulated by malignant transformation. For other viruses oncotropism relies on their inability to circumvent type I interferon (IFN) -induced innate antiviral mechanisms, {{the first line of}} defense triggered by normal cells against viral infections. These agents propagate, therefore, preferentially in transformed/tumor cells, which often lack functional antiviral mechanisms. The present study aimed at investigating whether antiviral processes also contribute to MVMp oncotropism. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to MVMp-permissive transformed mouse A 9 fibroblasts, freshly isolated normal counterparts (mouse embryonic fibroblasts [MEFs]) mount, through production and release of type I IFNs upon their infection, an antiviral response against MVMp lytic multiplication. Pretreatment of MEFs with a type I IFN-β-neutralizing antibody, prior to MVMp infection, inhibits the virus-triggered antiviral response and improves the fulfillment of the MVMp life cycle. Our results also show that part of the A 9 permissiveness to MVMp relies on the inability to produce type I IFNs upon parvovirus infection, a feature related either to an A 9 intrinsic deficiency of this process or to an MVMp-triggered inhibitory mechanism, since stimulation of these cells by exogenous IFN-β strongly inhibits the parvovirus life cycle. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that parvovirus infection triggers an innate antiviral response in normal cells and suggest that the MVMp oncotropism depends at least in part on the failure of infected transformed cells to mount such a response...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMinute Virus of Mice (MVM) shares {{inherent}} <b>oncotropic</b> properties {{with other}} members of the genus Parvovirus. Two elements responsible, at least in part, for this oncoselectivity have been mapped to an Ets 1 binding site adjacent to the P 4 TATA box of the initiating promoter, P 4, and to a more distal cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE), located within the telomeric hairpin stem. Here the CRE overlaps one half-site for the binding of parvoviral initiation factor (PIF), which is essential for viral DNA replication. We used a degenerate oligonucleotide selection approach to show that CRE binding protein (CREB) selects the sequence ACGTCAC within this context, rather than its more generally accepted palindromic TGACGTCA recognition site. We have developed strategies for manipulating these sequences directly within the left-end palindrome of the MVM infectious clone and used them to clone mutants whose CRE either matches the symmetric consensus sequence or is scrambled, or in which the PIF binding site is incrementally weakened with respect to the CRE. The panel of mutants were tested for fitness relative to wildtype in normal murine fibroblasts A 9 or transformed human fibroblasts 324  K, through multiple rounds of growth in co-infected cultures, using a differential real-time quantitative PCR assay. We confirmed that inactivating the CRE substantially abrogates oncoselectivity, but found that improving its fit to the palindromic consensus is somewhat debilitating in either cell type. We also confirmed that reducing the PIF half-site spacing by one basepair enhances oncoselectivity, but found that a further basepair deletion significantly reduces this effect...|$|E
40|$|Tumour pretargeting is a {{promising}} strategy for cancer diagnosis and therapy {{allowing for the}} rational use of long circulating, highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for both non-invasive cancer radioimmunodetection (RID) and radioimmunotherapy (RIT). In contrast to conventional RID/RIT where the radionuclides and <b>oncotropic</b> vector molecules are delivered as presynthesised radioimmunoconjugates, the pretargeting approach is a multistep procedure that temporarily separates targeting of certain tumour-associated antigens from delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic radionuclides. In principle, unlabelled, highly tumour antigen specific mAb conjugates are, in a first step, administered into a patient. After injection, sufficient time is allowed for blood circulation, accumulation at the tumour site and subsequent elimination of excess mAb conjugates from the body. The small fast-clearing radiolabelled effector molecules with a complementary functionality directed to the prelocalised mAb conjugates are then administered in a second step. Due to its fast pharmacokinetics, the small effector molecules reach the malignant tissue quickly and bind the local mAb conjugates. Thereby, corresponding radioimmunoconjugates are formed in vivo and, consequently, radiation doses are deposited mainly locally. This procedure results in a much higher tumour/non-tumour (T/NT) ratio and is favourable for cancer diagnosis and therapy as it substantially minimises the radiation damage to non-tumour cells of healthy tissues. The pretargeting approach utilises specific non-covalent interactions (e. g. strept(avidin) /biotin) or covalent bond formations (e. g. inverse electron demand Diels–Alder reaction) between the tumour bound antibody and radiolabelled small molecules. This tutorial review descriptively presents this complex strategy, addresses the historical as well as recent preclinical and clinical advances and discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of different available variations...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prostate cancer (PCa), a disease, is {{characterized}} by abnormal cell growth in the prostate - a gland in the male reproductive system. Although older age and {{a family history of}} the disease have been recognized as the risk factors of PCa, the cause of this cancer remains unclear. Currently, PCa {{is one of the leading}} causes of cancer death among men of all races. Method: In this review study, we first discuss the controversy of the contribution of virus infection to PCa, and subsequently summarize the development of oncolytic virotherapy for PCa in the past several years. Results: Mounting evidence suggests that infections with various viruses are causally linked to PCa pathogenesis. Published studies have provided strong evidence that at least two viruses (RXMV and HPV) contribute to prostate tumourigenicity and impact on the survival of patients with malignant PCa. Traditional therapies including chemotherapy and radiotherapy are unable to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, which are a significant drawback and leads to toxicities for PCa patients undergoing treatment. So far, few other options are available for treating patients with advanced PCa. For PCa treatment, oncolytic virotherapy appears to be much more attractive, which uses live viruses to selectively kill cancer cells. Oncolytic viruses can be genetically engineered to induce cancer cell lysis through virus replication and expression of cytotoxic proteins. Conclusion: Virotherapy is being developed to be a novel therapy for cancers, which uses <b>oncotropic</b> and oncolytic viruses with their abilities to find and destroy malignant cells in the body. As oncolytic viruses are a relatively new class of anti-cancer immunotherapy agents, several important barriers still exist on the road to the use of oncolytic viruses for PCa therapy...|$|E

The parvovirus H 1 {{was used to}} generate recombinant viruses (rH 1) that carried transgenes encoding either human interleukin 2 (IL- 2) or monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP- 1), in replacement of part of the capsid genes. Such rH 1 viruses {{have been shown to}} retain in vitro the intrinsic <b>oncotropic</b> properties of the parental virus. On infection with the recombinant viruses at an input multiplicity of 1 replication unit (RU) per cell, HeLa cultures were induced to release 4 - 10 mu g of cytokine per 10 (6) cells over a period of 5 days. The expression of the rH 1 -transduced human cytokine/chemokine could also be detected in tumor material recovered from nude mice that had been subcutaneously engrafted with in vitro-infected HeLa cells. The formation of tumors from HeLa xenografts was reduced by 90 % compared with wild-type or mock-infected cells Its a result of cells preinfected with IL- 2 -expressing virus at an input multiplicity as low as 1 RU per cell. Tumors arising from HeLa cells infected with transgene-free or MCP 1 -expressing vectors or with wild-type H 1 virus were not rejected at this virus dose. Tumors infected with rH 1 /IL- 2 virus displayed markers indicative of their infiltration with NK cells in which the cytocidal program was activated, whereas little NK activity was detected in wild-type virus or mock-infected tumors. Altogether, these data show that the IL- 2 expressing H 1 vector was a more potent antineoplastic agent than the parental virus, and point to the possible application of recombinant autonomous parvoviruses toward therapy of some human tumors. status: publishe...|$|E

Due to better contrast resolution, cross sectional and 3 D images, SPET plays a useful complementary tool to bidimensional planar scintigraphy in certain clinical conditions, while representing the procedure {{of choice in}} others. However, high resolution SPET with pinhole collimator (P-SPET) can improve conventional SPET sensitivity with parallel hole collimators. This review summarizes data on the employment of conventional SPET and P-SPET in breast cancer, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and hyperparathyroidism patients, using the cationic lipophilic complexes [(99 m) Tc]metoxy isobutyl isonitrile (sestaMIBI) and [(99 m) Tc]tetrofosmin as <b>oncotropic</b> radiotracers. In breast cancer patients, SPET with these radiotracers {{can play an important}} complementary role to planar scintimammography in detecting primary tumors, especially when non palpable and small in size, whereas SPET and particularly P-SPET represents the procedure of choice in preoperative axillary lymph node status evaluation in which planar is almost always irrelevant. In DTC follow-up patients, SPET and P-SPET with cationic lipophilic radiotracers are indicated in both locoregional and distant metastasis detection, especially in patients with high Tg serum levels and negative radioiodine scanning in whom these procedures represent a reliable alternative to diagnostic (131) I scanning. Moreover, the combined use of [(99 m) Tc]tetrofosmin P-SPET and US can identify recurrences and lymph node metastases in the neck, both fixing and non fixing iodine, downstaged or negative at (131) I scanning. SPET can also be a useful complementary tool to planar parathyroid scintigraphy in the detection and localization of small and ectopic parathyroid adenomas in the neck or mediastinum, while neck P-SPET seems to also significantly increase planar sensitivity in hyperplastic glands.
