25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, intermediate {{optical amplification}} sites in DWDM systems may {{allow for the}} dropping and adding of certain wavelength channels. In most systems deployed as of August 2006 this is done infrequently, because adding or dropping wavelengths requires manually inserting or replacing wavelength-selective cards. This is costly, and in some systems requires that all active traffic {{be removed from the}} DWDM system, because inserting or removing the wavelength-specific cards interrupts the multi-wavelength <b>optical</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{intermediate}} optical terminal, or optical add-drop multiplexer. This is {{a remote}} amplification site that amplifies the multi-wavelength signal {{that may have}} traversed up to 140km or more before reaching the remote site. Optical diagnostics and telemetry are often extracted or inserted at such a site, to allow for localization of any fiber breaks or signal impairments. In more sophisticated systems (which are no longer point-to-point), several signals out of the multi-wavelength <b>optical</b> <b>signal</b> may be removed and dropped locally.|$|E

40|$|A gradual {{transition}} from electrical to optical networks is accompanying the rapid progress of telecommunication technology. The urge for enhanced transmission capacity and speed is dictating this trend. In fact, {{large volumes of}} data encoded on <b>optical</b> <b>signals</b> can be transported rapidly over long distances. Their propagation along specific routes across a communication network is ensured {{by a combination of}} optical fibers and optoelectronic switches. It is becoming apparent, however, that the interplay between the routing electrical stimulations and the traveling <b>optical</b> <b>signals</b> {{will not be able to}} support the terabit-per-second capacities that will be needed in the near future. Electrical inputs cannot handle the immense parallelism potentially possible with <b>optical</b> <b>signals.</b> Operating principles to control <b>optical</b> <b>signals</b> with <b>optical</b> <b>signals</b> must be developed. Molecular and supramolecular switches are promising candidates for the realization of innovative materials for information technology. Binary digits can be encoded in their chemical, electrical, or optical inputs and outputs to execute specific logic functions. We have developed a simple strategy to gate <b>optical</b> <b>signals</b> with <b>optical</b> <b>signals</b> by using a photoactive molecular switch. We have demonstrated that NAND, NOR, and NOT operations can be implemented exclusively with optical inputs and optical outputs coupling from one to three switching elements.

25|$|An {{optical fiber}} is a {{cylindrical}} dielectric waveguide (nonconducting waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, {{by the process}} of total internal reflection. The fiber consists of a core surrounded by a cladding layer, both of which are made of dielectric materials. To confine the <b>optical</b> <b>signal</b> in the core, the refractive index of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in step-index fiber, or gradual, in graded-index fiber.|$|E
25|$|Attenuation {{in fiber}} optics, {{also known as}} {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the <b>optical</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Event-related <b>optical</b> <b>signal</b> (EROS) is a brain-scanning {{technique}} {{which uses}} infrared light through optical fibers to measure changes in optical properties of active {{areas of the}} cerebral cortex. Whereas techniques such as diffuse optical imaging (DOT) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measure optical absorption of haemoglobin, and thus are based on blood flow, EROS {{takes advantage of the}} scattering properties of the neurons themselves, and thus provides a much more direct measure of cellular activity. EROS can pinpoint activity in the brain within millimeters (spatially) and within milliseconds (temporally). Its biggest downside is the inability to detect activity more than a few centimeters deep. EROS is a new, relatively inexpensive technique that is non-invasive to the test subject. It was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where it is now used in the Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory of Dr. Gabriele Gratton and Dr. Monica Fabiani.|$|E

25|$|A DWDM {{terminal}} demultiplexer. At {{the remote}} site, the terminal de-multiplexer consisting of an optical de-multiplexer {{and one or}} more wavelength-converting transponders separates the multi-wavelength <b>optical</b> <b>signal</b> back into individual data signals and outputs them on separate fibers for client-layer systems (such as SONET/SDH). Originally, this de-multiplexing was performed entirely passively, except for some telemetry, as most SONET systems can receive 1,550nm signals. However, {{in order to allow}} for transmission to remote client-layer systems (and to allow for digital domain signal integrity determination) such de-multiplexed signals are usually sent to O/E/O output transponders prior to being relayed to their client-layer systems. Often, the functionality of output transponder has been integrated into that of input transponder, so that most commercial systems have transponders that support bi-directional interfaces on both their 1,550nm (i.e., internal) side, and external (i.e., client-facing) side. Transponders in some systems supporting 40GHz nominal operation may also perform forward error correction (FEC) via digital wrapper technology, as described in the ITU-T G.709 standard.|$|E
25|$|Dense {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (DWDM) refers originally to optical signals multiplexed {{within the}} 1550nm band so as to leverage the capabilities (and cost) of erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are effective for wavelengths between approximately 1525–1565nm (C band), or 1570–1610nm (L band). EDFAs were originally developed to replace SONET/SDH optical-electrical-optical (OEO) re-generators, which they have made practically obsolete. EDFAs can amplify any <b>optical</b> <b>signal</b> in their operating range, regardless of the modulated bit rate. In terms of multi-wavelength signals, {{so long as the}} EDFA has enough pump energy available to it, it can amplify as many optical signals as can be multiplexed into its amplification band (though signal densities are limited by choice of modulation format). EDFAs therefore allow a single-channel optical link to be upgraded in bit rate by replacing only equipment at the ends of the link, while retaining the existing EDFA or series of EDFAs through a long haul route. Furthermore, single-wavelength links using EDFAs can similarly be upgraded to WDM links at reasonable cost. The EDFA's cost is thus leveraged across as many channels as can be multiplexed into the 1550nm band.|$|E
