40|$|As {{computers}} and their networks {{continue to be}} developed, our day-to-day lives are being surrounded by increasingly more complex instruments, and we often have {{to ask questions about}} using them. At the same time, large collections of texts to answer these questions are being gathered. Therefore, there are potential answers to many of <b>our</b> <b>questions</b> that exist as texts somewhere. However, there are various gaps between <b>our</b> various <b>questions</b> and the texts, and these prevent us from accessing appropriate texts to answer <b>our</b> <b>questions.</b> The gaps are mainly composed of both expression and vagueness gaps. When we seek texts for answers using conventional keyword-based text retrieval systems, we often have trouble locating them. In contrast, when we ask experts on instruments or operators of call centers, they can resolve the various gaps, by interpreting <b>our</b> <b>questions</b> flexibly, and by producing some ask-backs. The problem with experts and call centers is that they are not always available. Two approaches have been studied to resolve the various gaps: the extension of keyword-based text retrieval systems, and the application of artificial intelligence techniques. However...|$|R
