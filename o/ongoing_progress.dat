5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the <b>ongoing</b> <b>progress</b> of individual tasks.|$|E

2500|$|The Swiss Agency for Energy Efficiency (SAFE) uses {{a concept}} that {{promises}} to be of great use in the diagnosis and design of road lighting, [...] "consommation électrique spécifique (CES)", which can be translated into English as [...] "specific electric power consumption (SEC)". Thus, based on observed lighting levels {{in a wide range}} of Swiss towns, SAFE has defined target values for electric power consumption per metre for roads of various categories. Thus, SAFE currently recommends an SEC of 2 to 3 watts per meter for roads of less than 10 metre width (4 to 6 watts per metre for wider roads). Such a measure provides an easily applicable environmental protection constraint on conventional [...] "norms", which usually are based on the recommendations of lighting manufacturing interests, who may not take into account environmental criteria. In view of <b>ongoing</b> <b>progress</b> in lighting technology, target SEC values will need to be periodically revised downwards.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ongoing</b> <b>progresses</b> in the {{knowledge}} of the pathogenic mechanisms of various inflammatory or immune-mediated diseases and the availability of innovative biotechnological approaches have lead to the development of new drugs which add to conventional treatments. TNF-alpha inhibitors (Infliximab, Adalimumab and Etanercept) have demonstrated efficacy either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-inflammatory or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The efficacy and safety profile of the TNF-alpha inhibitors can be considered, in general, as a class effect. Nevertheless, some differences may exist among the three agents.

40|$|Stochastic {{backgrounds}} of gravitational waves are intrinsic fluctuations of spacetime {{which lead to}} an unavoidable decoherence mechanism. This mechanism manifests itself as a degradation of the contrast of quantum interferences. It defines an ultimate decoherence border for matter-wave interferometry using larger and larger molecules. We give a quantitative characterization of this border in terms of figures involving the gravitational environment {{as well as the}} sensitivity of the interferometer to gravitational waves. The known level of gravitational noise determines the maximal size of the molecular probe for which interferences may remain observable.

40|$|Multipartite viruses {{have one}} of the most puzzling genetic {{organizations}} found in living organisms. These viruses have several genome segments, each containing only a part of the genetic information, and each individually encapsidated into a separate virus particle. While countless studies on molecular and cellular mechanisms of the infection cycle of multipartite viruses are available, just as for other virus types, very seldom is their lifestyle questioned at the viral system level. Moreover, the rare available "system" studies are purely theoretical, and their predictions on the putative benefit/cost balance of this peculiar genetic organization have not received experimental support. In light of <b>ongoing</b> <b>progresses</b> in general virology, we here challenge the current hypotheses explaining the evolutionary success of multipartite viruses and emphasize their shortcomings. We also discuss alternative ideas and research avenues to be explored in the future in order to solve the long-standing mystery of how viral systems composed of interdependent but physically separated information units can actually be functional...|$|R
