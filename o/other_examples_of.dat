5|$|A common path {{interferometer}} is a {{class of}} interferometer in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along the same path. Fig.4 illustrates the Sagnac interferometer, the fibre optic gyroscope, the point diffraction interferometer, and the lateral shearing interferometer. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> common path interferometer include the Zernike phase contrast microscope, Fresnel's biprism, the zero-area Sagnac, and the scatterplate interferometer.|$|E

5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|An {{amplitude}} splitting interferometer uses {{a partial}} reflector {{to divide the}} amplitude of the incident wave into separate beams which are separated and recombined. Fig.6 illustrates the Fizeau, Mach–Zehnder and Fabry–Pérot interferometers. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> amplitude splitting interferometer include the Michelson, Twyman–Green, Laser Unequal Path, and Linnik interferometer.|$|E
5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|E

5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are <b>other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
5|$|Like the Septuagint, the Greek {{translation}} of the Hebrew Bible that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek. Some Jews writing in Greek during the late Hellenistic and early Imperial period—notably the philosopher Philo and the historian Josephus—included gentiles among their intended audience. The Sibylline Oracles and the Wisdom of Solomon are <b>other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> Jewish literature in Greek from this general period.|$|E

Coe and his colleagues argue that it is very unlikely that a forger would have known about this deity before it was described elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|These {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate isomerase, aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some <b>other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).|$|E

5|$|Fungi have a {{worldwide}} distribution, and grow {{in a wide}} range of habitats, including extreme environments such as deserts or areas with high salt concentrations or ionizing radiation, as well as in deep sea sediments. Some can survive the intense UV and cosmic radiation encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for {{a worldwide}} decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Hoysala {{architecture}} is the building style developed {{under the rule}} of the Hoysala Empire between the 11th and 14th centuries, in the region known today as Karnataka, a state of India. Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the Southern Deccan Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at Belavadi, Amruthapura, Hosaholalu, Mosale, Arasikere, Basaralu, Kikkeri and Nuggehalli. Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible Indo-Aryan influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> flags {{that could}} be {{confused}} with the Polish one include the civil flags of the following regions: Cantabria, Spain; Kranj, Slovenia; Thuringia, Germany; Upper Austria and Tyrol, Austria; as well the city of Honda, Colombia. Furthermore, the Dutch city of Maastricht used a similar design between 1938–1994 but reinstitated its old flag to avoid confusion. There are currently two independent states – Indonesia and Monaco – whose national flags are horizontal bicolors of red and white, reversing the Polish flag. The Monaco and Indonesia flags differ in proportions and shades of the colors (see Flag of Indonesia and Flag of Monaco).|$|E

5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most <b>other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
