In 2008, there were around 60,000 chiropractors practicing in North America.

2500|$|Increasingly, psychiatrists are {{limiting}} their practices to psychopharmacology (prescribing medications), {{as opposed to}} previous practice in which a psychiatrist would provide traditional 50-minute psychotherapy sessions, of which psychopharmacology would be a part, {{but most of the}} consultation sessions consisted of [...] "talk therapy." [...] This shift began in the early 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s. A major reason for this change was the advent <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> <b>care</b> insurance plans, which began to limit reimbursement for psychotherapy sessions provided by psychiatrists. The underlying assumption was that psychopharmacology was at least as effective as psychotherapy, and it could be delivered more efficiently because less time is required for the appointment. For example, most psychiatrists schedule three or four follow-up appointments per hour, as opposed to seeing one patient per hour in the traditional psychotherapy model. Because of this shift in practice patterns, psychiatrists often refer patients whom they think would benefit from psychotherapy to other mental health professionals, e.g., clinical social workers and psychologists.|$|E
