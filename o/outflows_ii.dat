40|$|VERITAS is a {{ground-based}} gamma-ray observatory {{that uses the}} imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique and operates in the very high-energy (VHE) region of the gamma- ray spectrum from 100 GeV to 50 TeV. The observatory consists of an array of four 12 m-diameter imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located in southern Arizona, USA. The four-telescope array has been fully operational since September 2007, and {{over the last two}} years, VERITAS has been operating with high reliability and sensitivity.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{three-dimensional}} simulations {{of the evolution}} of a microquasar jet inside the binary-star system. The aim is to study the interaction of these jets with the stellar wind from a massive companion and the possible locations of high-energy emission sites. We have simulated two jets with different injection power in order to give a hint on the minimum power required for the jet to escape the system and become visible in larger scales. In the setup, we include a massive star wind filling the grid through which the jet evolves. We show that jets should have powers of the order of 10 ^ 37 erg/s or more in order not to be destroyed by the stellar wind. The jet-wind interaction results in regions in which high energy emission could be produced. These results imply the possible existence of a population of X-ray binaries not detected in the radio band due to jet disruption inside the region dominated by the stellar wind.

40|$|This paper {{solves the}} {{allocation}} puzzle of Chinese capital inflows and outflows. While the saving rate {{is high in}} China, this country invests {{the vast majority of}} its assets abroad whereas FDI are attracted. The study highlights the role of State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) financed by public banks, and the often underestimated impact of moral hazard and capital expropriation on global imbalances. A dynamic general equilibrium growth model differentiating FDI and financial capital is used. The model matches to a large extent the data for the following stylized facts in China: (i) net financial capital <b>outflows,</b> (<b>ii)</b> a higher growth rate of FDI-in than FDI-out, (iii) a large current account sur-plus, (iv) high savings (households and corporate) and low investments growth, (v) a decrease in consumption. The key assumption to replicate the facts is the high TFP growth combined with: (a) economic and financial liberalizations: less SOE and capital controls during the transition (b) capital misallocation due to credit market frictions: moral hazard and heterogeneous credit constraints be-tween SOE and private firms (c) capital expropriation (corruption, lack of property rights protection, [...] .) with a low share of capital in production. Given the variety of sources of capital misallocation, the paper is rather pessimistic about the possibility to reduce global imbalances in the near future. The paper uncovers some potential specific issues for the Chinese economy: capital misallocation slows down firms investments and contribute to a depressed domestic consumption...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} planetary nebulae (PNe) and proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) exhibit aspherical, axisymmetric structures, {{many of which}} are highly collimated. The origin of these structures is not entirely understood, however recent evidence suggests that many observed PNe harbor binary systems, which {{may play a role in}} their shaping. In an effort to understand how binaries may produce such asymmetries, we study the effect of low-mass (< 0. 3 M⊙) companions (planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass main sequence stars) embedded into the envelope of a 3. 0 M ⊙ star during three epochs of its evolution (Red Giant Branch, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), interpulse AGB). We find that common envelope evolution can lead to three qualitatively different consequences: (i) direct ejection of envelope material resulting in a predominately equatorial <b>outflow,</b> (<b>ii)</b> spin-up of the envelope resulting in the possibility of powering an explosive dynamo driven jet and (iii) tidal shredding of the companion into a disc which facilitates a disc driven jet.

40|$|We reanalyze the prompt {{emission}} {{of two of}} the brightest Fermi GRBs (080916 C and 090926 A) with a new model composed of 3 components: (i) a thermal-like component [...] approximated with a black body (BB) [...] interpreted as the jet photosphere {{emission of}} a magnetized relativistic <b>outflow,</b> (<b>ii)</b> a non-thermal component [...] approximated with a Band function [...] interpreted as synchrotron radiation in an optically thin region above the photosphere either from internal shocks or magnetic field dissipation, and (iii) an extra power law (PL) extending from low to high energies likely of inverse Compton origin, even though it remains challenging. Through fine-time spectroscopy down to the 100 ms time scale, we follow the smooth evolution of the various components. From this analysis the Band function is globally the most intense component, although the additional PL can overpower the others in sharp time structures. The Band function and the BB component are the most intense at early times and globally fade across the burst duration. The additional PL is the most intense component at late time and may be correlated with the extended high-energy emission observed thousands of seconds after the burst with the Fermi/Large Area Telescope (LAT). Unexpectedly, this analysis also shows that the additional PL may be present {{from the very beginning of}} the burst. We investigate the effect of the three components on the new time-resolved luminosity-hardness relation in both the observer and rest frames and show that a strong correlation exists between the flux of the non-thermal component and its E$_{peak}$ only when the three components are fitted simultaneously to the data (i. e., F$_i^{NT}$-E$_{peak,i}^{NT}$ relation).

40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{a family of}} simple models for spiral galaxy evolution {{to allow us to}} investigate observational trends in star formation history with galaxy parameters. The models are used to generate broad band colours from which ages and metallicities are derived {{in the same way as}} the data. We generate a grid of model galaxies and select only those which lie in regions of parameter space covered by the sample. The data are consistent with the proposition that the star formation history of a region within a galaxy depends primarily on the local surface density of the gas but that one or two additional ingredients are required to fully explain the observational data. The observed age gradients appear steeper than those produced by the density dependent star formation law, indicating that the star formation law or infall history must vary with galactocentric radius. Furthermore, the metallicity-magnitude and age-magnitude correlations are not reproduced by a local density dependence alone. These correlations require one or both of the following: (i) a combination of mass dependent infall and metal enriched <b>outflow,</b> or (<b>ii)</b> a mass dependent galaxy formation epoch.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the seeds of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is a key {{question}} in cosmology. Direct collapse black holes (DCBH) that form in pristine, atomic-line cooling halos, illuminated by a Lyman-Werner (LW) UV flux exceeding a critical threshold J_crit, represent an attractive possibility. We investigate when and where these conditions are met during cosmic evolution. For the LW intensity, J_LW, we account for departures from the background value {{in close proximity to}} star forming galaxies. For the pristine halo fraction, we account for both (i) supernova driven <b>outflows,</b> and (<b>ii)</b> the inherent pollution from progenitor halos. We estimate the abundance of DCBH formation sites, n_DCBH(z), and find that it increases with cosmic time from n_DCBH(z= 20) ~ 1 e- 12 - 1 e- 7 cMpc^- 3 to n_DCBH(z= 10) ~ 1 e- 10 - 1 e- 5 cMpc^- 3. Our analysis shows the possible importance of galactic winds, which can suppress the predicted n_DCBH by several orders of magnitude, and cause DCBH formation to preferentially occur around the UV-brightest (M_UV ~ - 22 to - 20) star forming galaxies. Our analysis further highlights the dependence of these predictions on (i) the escape fraction of LW photons, (ii) J_crit, and (iii) the galactic outflow prescription.

40|$|We use a {{background}} quasar {{to detect the}} presence of circumgalactic gas around a z = 0. 91 low-mass star-forming galaxy. Data from the new Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope show that the galaxy has a dust-corrected star formation rate (SFR) of 4. 7 +/- 2. 0. M-circle dot yr(- 1), with no companion down to 0. 22 M-circle dot yr(- 1) (5 sigma) within 240 h(- 1) kpc (" 30 "). Using a high-resolution spectrum of the background quasar, which is fortuitously aligned with the galaxy major axis (with an azimuth angle alpha of only 15 degrees), we find, in the gas kinematics traced by low-ionization lines, distinct signatures consistent with those expected for a "cold-flow disk" extending at least 12 kpc (3 x R- 1 / 2). We estimate the mass accretion rate M-in {{to be at least}} two to three times larger than the SFR, using the geometric constraints from the IFU data and the H (I) column density of log N-H (I) /cm(- 2) similar or equal to 20. 4 obtained from a Hubble Space Telescope/COS near-UV spectrum. From a detailed analysis of the low-ionization lines (e. g., Zn II, Cr II, Ti II, MnII, Si II), the accreting material appears to be enriched to about 0. 4 Z(circle dot) (albeit with large uncertainties: log Z/Z(circle dot) = - 0. 4 +/- 0. 4), which is comparable to the galaxy metallicity (12 + log O/H = 8. 7 +/- 0. 2), implying a large recycling fraction from past <b>outflows.</b> Blueshifted Mg <b>II</b> and Fe II absorptions in the galaxy spectrum from the MUSE data reveal the presence of an <b>outflow.</b> The Mg <b>II</b> and Fe II absorption line ratios indicate emission infilling due to scattering processes, but the MUSE data do not show any signs of fluorescent Fe II* emission...|$|R
40|$|Gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt {{emission}} spectra in the keV–MeV energy range {{are usually}} {{considered to be}} adequately fitted with the empirical Band function. Recent observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) revealed deviations from the Band function, sometimes {{in the form of}} an additional blackbody (BB) component, while on other occasions {{in the form of an}} additional power law (PL) component extending to high energies. In this article we investigate the possibility that the three components may be present simultaneously in the prompt emission spectra of two very bright GRBs (080916 C and 090926 A) observed with Fermi, and how the three components may affect the overall shape of the spectra. While the two GRBs are very different when fitted to a single Band function, they look like 2 ̆ 2 twins 2 ̆ 2 in the three-component scenario. Through fine-time spectroscopy down to the 100 ms timescale, we follow the evolution of the various components. We succeed in reducing the number of free parameters in the three-component model, which results in a new semi-empirical model—but with physical motivations—to be competitive with the Band function in terms of number of degrees of freedom. From this analysis using multiple components, the Band function is globally the most intense component, although the additional PL can overpower the others in sharp time structures. The Band function and the BB component are the most intense at early times and globally fade across the burst duration. The additional PL is the most intense component at late time and may be correlated with the extended high-energy emission observed thousands of seconds after the burst with Fermi/Large Area Telescope. Unexpectedly, this analysis also shows that the additional PL may be present from the very beginning of the burst, where it may even overpower the other components at low energy.

40|$|The origin, {{evolution}} {{and role of}} magnetic fields in the production and shaping of proto-planetary and planetary nebulae (PPNe, PNe) is a subject of active research. Most PNe and PPNe are axisymmetric with many exhibiting highly collimated outflows, however, {{it is important to}} understand whether such structures can be generated by isolated stars or require the presence of a binary companion. Toward this end we study a dynamical, large-scale alpha-Omega interface dynamo operating in a 3. 0 M_sun Asymptotic Giant Branch star (AGB) in both an isolated setting and one in which a low-mass companion is embedded inside the envelope. The back reaction of the fields on the shear is included and differential rotation and rotation deplete via turbulent dissipation and Poynting flux. For the isolated star, the shear must be resupplied in order to sufficiently sustain the dynamo. Furthermore, we investigate the energy requirements that convection must satisfy to accomplish this by analogy to the sun. For the common envelope case, a robust dynamo results, unbinding the envelope under a broad range of conditions. Two qualitatively different types of explosion may arise: (i) magnetically dominated, possibly resulting in collimated bipolar <b>outflows</b> and (<b>ii)</b> thermally induced from turbulent dissipation, possibly resulting in quasi-spherical outflows.

40|$|A {{model for}} gas {{outflows}} is proposed which simultaneously explains {{the correlations between}} the (i) equivalent width of low ionization and Ly-alpha lines, (<b>ii)</b> <b>outflow</b> velocity, and (iii) star formation rate observed in Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). Our interpretation implies that LBGs host short-lived (30 +/- 5 Myr) starburst episodes observed at different evolutionary phases. Initially, the starburst powers a hot wind bound by a denser cold shell, which after about 5 Myr becomes dynamically unstable and fragments; afterwards the fragment evolution is approximately ballistic while the hot bubble continues to expand. As the fragments are gravitationally decelerated, their screening ability of the starlight decreases as the UV starburst luminosity progressively dims. LBG observations sample all these evolutionary phases. Finally, the fragments fall back onto the galaxy after approximately 60 Myr. This phase cannot be easily probed as it occurs when the starburst UV luminosity has already largely faded; however, galaxies dimmer in the UV than LBGs should show infalling gas.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} for the rapid variability of the high velocity iron K-shell absorption in the nearby (z= 0. 184) quasar PDS 456. From a recent long Suzaku observation in 2013 (∼ 1 Ms effective duration) {{we find that the}} the equivalent width of iron K absorption increases by a factor of ∼ 5 during the observation, increasing from < 105 eV within the first 100 ks of the observation, towards a maximum depth of ∼ 500 eV near the end. The implied outflow velocity of ∼ 0. 25 c is consistent with that claimed from earlier (2007, 2011) Suzaku observations. The absorption varies on time-scales as short as ∼ 1 week. We show that this variability can be equally well attributed to either (i) an increase in column density, plausibly associated with a clumpy time-variable <b>outflow,</b> or (<b>ii)</b> the decreasing ionization of a smooth homogeneous outflow which is in photo-ionization equilibrium with the local photon field. The variability allows a direct measure of absorber location, which is constrained to within r= 200 - 3500 r_g of the black hole. Even in the most conservative case the kinetic power of the outflow is ≳ 6 % of the Eddington luminosity, with a mass outflow rate in excess of ∼ 40 % of the Eddington accretion rate. The wind momentum rate is directly equivalent to the Eddington momentum rate which suggests that the flow may have been accelerated by continuum-scattering during an episode of Eddington-limited accretion.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system has {{a key role in}} {{regulating}} the circulatory system by modulating the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, pituitary hormone release, and the baroreceptor reflex. Digoxin- and ouabain-like immunoreactive materials were found > 20 years ago in the hypothalamic nuclei. These factors appeared to localize to the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and the nerve fibers at the circumventricular organs and supposed to affect electrolyte balance and blood pressure. The turnover rate of these materials increases with increasing sodium intake. As intracerebroventricular injection of ouabain increases blood pressure via sympathetic activation, an endogenous digitalis-like factor (EDLF) was thought to regulate cardiovascular system-related functions in the brain, particularly after sodium loading. Experiments conducted mainly in rats revealed that the mechanism of action of ouabain in the brain involves sodium ions, epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), all of which are affected by sodium loading. Rats fed a high-sodium diet develop elevated sodium levels in their cerebrospinal fluid, which activates ENaCs. Activated ENaCs and/or increased intracellular sodium in neurons activate the RAAS; this releases EDLF in the brain, activating the sympathetic nervous system. The RAAS promotes oxidative stress in the brain, further activating the RAAS and augmenting sympathetic <b>outflow.</b> Angiotensin <b>II</b> and aldosterone of peripheral origin act in the brain to activate this cascade, increasing sympathetic outflow and leading to hypertension.

In this framework, we assume a star formation rate which follows a linear Schmidt law, and we present new analytical solutions for the evolution of the metallicity (Z) in galaxies. In particular, we take into account environmental effects including primordial and enriched gas infall, outflow, different star formation efficiencies and galactic fountains. The enriched infall is included to take into account galaxy-galaxy interactions. Our main results can be summarized as: (i) when a linear Schmidt law of star formation is assumed, the resulting time evolution of the metallicity Z is the same either for a closed-box model or for an <b>outflow</b> model. (<b>ii)</b> The mass-metallicity relation for galaxies which suffer a chemically enriched infall, originating from another evolved galaxy with no pre-enriched gas, is shifted down in parallel at lower Z values, if compared to the closed box model.

The technique relies on using the doublet nature of the common ions CIV and SiIV that are the principal metal tracers in the intergalactic medium outside of the Ly alpha forest. Optical depths are statistically corrected for contamination by other lines, telluric absorption, bad pixels, continuum fitting, etc. and for incompleteness, and we achieve in this way an increased sensitivity of approximately 0. 5 dex over previous analyses. Unlike existing POD techniques, we do not compare the ion optical depths with HI optical depths; we therefore avoid problems arising from different velocity widths in the ion and HI. We have shown how the conventional analysis can be reproduced using a percolation method to generate pseudo-clouds from ion optical depths. We find that for the higher resolution HIRES data there is a tight relation, tau ~ N^{ 0. 7 }, between the peak optical depth and the column density.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the accretion-ejection process of jets from magnetized accretion disks. We apply {{a novel approach}} to the jet-launching problem {{in order to obtain}} correlations between the physical properties of the jet and the underlying disk. We extend and confirm the previous works of 2009 MNRAS. 400 [...] 820 T and 2010 A&A [...] . 512 A [...] 82 M by scanning a large parameter range for the disk magnetization, μ_ D = 10 ^- 3. 5 [...] . 10 ^- 0. 7. We disentangle the disk magnetization at the foot point of the outflow as the main parameter that governs the properties of the outflow. We show how the four jet integrals known from steady-state MHD are correlated to the disk magnetization at the jet foot point. This agrees with the usual findings of the steady-state theory, however, here we obtain these correlations from time-dependent simulations that include the dynamical evolution of the disk in the treatment. In particular, we obtain robust correlations between the local disk magnetization and (i) the <b>outflow</b> velocity, (<b>ii)</b> the jet mass loading, (iii) jet angular momentum, and (iv) the local mass accretion rate. Essentially we find that strongly magnetized disks launch more energetic and faster jets, and, due to a larger Alfvén lever arm, these jets extract more angular momentum from the underlying disk. These kind of disk-jet systems have, however, a smaller mass loading parameter and a lower mass ejection-to-accretion ratio. The jets are launched at the disk surface where the magnetization is μ(r,z) ≃ 0. 1. The magnetization rapidly increases vertically providing the energy reservoir for subsequent jet acceleration. We find indication for a critical disk magnetization μ_ D≃ 0. 01 that separates the regimes of magnetocentrifugally-driven and magnetic pressure-driven jets. Comment: accepted by Ap...|$|R
40|$|Paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons {{that project}} to {{the spinal cord}} are {{important}} in the control of sympathetic <b>outflow.</b> Angiotensin <b>II</b> (Ang II) can stimulate PVN neurons, but its cellular mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we determined the effect of Ang II on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to spinally projecting PVN neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on PVN neurons labeled by a retrograde fluorescence tracer injected into the thoracic spinal cord of rats. Immunocytochemistry labeling revealed that the immunoreactivity of angiotensin type 1 (AT 1) receptors was colocalized with a presynaptic marker, synaptophysin, in the PVN. Application of 0. 1 – 5 �M Ang II significantly decreased the amplitude of evoked GABAergic IPSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, Ang II decreased the frequency of miniature IPSCs from 2. 56 � 0. 45 to 1. 05 � 0. 20 Hz (p � 0. 05; n � 12), without affecting the amplitude and the decay time constant. The effect of Ang II on miniature IPSCs was blocked by losartan but not PD 123319. However, Ang II {{had no effect on}} the evoked glutamatergic EPSCs and did not alter the frequency and amplitude of miniature EPSCs at concentrations that attenuated IPSCs. Furthermore, Ang II increased the firing rate of PVN neurons from 3. 75 � 0. 36 to 7. 89 � 0. 85 Hz (p � 0. 05; n � 9), and such an effect was abolished by losartan. In addition, Ang II failed to excite PVN neurons in the presence of bicuculline. Thus, this study provides substantial new evidence that Ang II excites spinally projecting PVN neurons by attenuation of GABAergic synaptic inputs through activation of presynaptic AT 1 receptors.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{spectral analysis}} of Suzaku {{data of the}} galactic disk and outflow regions of the starburst galaxy M 82. Thermal modeling of the central disk regions requires at least three temperature components. The Ly ˇ line fluxes of O VIII and Ne X exceed those expected from a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium. The ratios of the Lyˇ=Ly ˛ lines for O VIII and Ne X are {{higher than those of}} collisional ionization equilibrium, which may be caused by the process of charge exchange. In the outflow wind region, the spectra are well reproduced with two-temperature thermal models, and we have derived the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe in the outflow. The ratios of O=Fe, Ne=Fe, and Mg=Fe are about 2, 3, and 2, respectively, relative to the solar value determined by Lodders (2003, ApJ, 591, 1220). Since {{there is no evidence of}} charge exchange in the outflow region, the metal abundances should be more reliable than those in the central region. This abundance pattern indicates that starburst activity enriches the <b>outflow</b> through SN <b>II</b> metal ejection into intergalactic space...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, our {{understanding}} of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) prompt emission has been revolutionized, due {{to a combination of}} new instruments, new analysis methods and novel ideas. In this review, I describe the most recent observational results and the current theoretical interpretation. Observationally, a major development is the rise of time-resolved spectral analysis. These led to (I) identification of a distinguished high energy component, with GeV photons often seen at a delay; and (II) firm evidence for the existence of a photospheric (thermal) component in a large number of bursts. These results triggered many theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the physical conditions in the inner jet regions from which the prompt photons are emitted, as well as the spectral diversity observed. I highlight some areas of active theoretical research. These include: (I) understanding the role played by magnetic fields in shaping the dynamics of GRB <b>outflow</b> and spectra; (<b>II)</b> understanding the microphysics of kinetic and magnetic energy transfer, namely accelerating particle to high energies in both shock waves and magnetic reconnection layers; (III) understanding how sub-photospheric energy dissipation broadens the "Planck" spectrum; and (IV) geometrical light aberration effects. I highlight some of these efforts, and point towards gaps that still exist in our knowledge as well as promising directions for the future.

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{chemical}} evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is presented using theoretical yields of very massive stars (VMSs) and Type II supernovae (SNe II). It is shown that if [Si/C] is indeed as high as ~ 0. 7 in the IGM, then VMSs associated with pair-instability supernovae (PI-SNe) in low-mass halos at high redshift must produce at least 50 % of the Si. The remainder is from later galactic <b>outflows</b> of SN <b>II</b> debris, which also provide most of the C and O. Both sources are required {{to account for the}} metal inventory in the IGM. The early VMS production must continue until redshift z~ 15 so that the efficiency of VMS formation per low-mass halo is significantly below unity. Contributions from the later galactic outflows mainly occur at z~ 4 - 6. Using a Salpeter initial mass function, we infer that the number of VMSs producing massive black holes (MBHs) is 0. 72 times the the number of VMSs associated with PI-SNe. The amount of metals (particularly Si) in the IGM that is attributable to PI-SNe is thus closely coupled with the total mass of MBHs produced in epochs prior to galaxy formation. Production of ~ 50 % of the Si in the IGM by PI-SNe corresponds to an early inventory of MBHs that is comparable to the global mass budget of the central supermassive black holes in present-day galaxies.

40|$|Mapping Mg II {{resonance}} emission scattered by galactic winds {{offers a}} means to determine the spatial extent and density of the warm outflow. Using Keck/LRIS spectroscopy, we have resolved scattered Mg II emission {{to the east of}} 32016857, a star-forming galaxy at z = 0. 9392 with an <b>outflow.</b> The Mg <b>II</b> emission from this galaxy exhibits a P-Cygni profile, extends further than both the continuum and [O II] emission along {{the eastern side of the}} slit, and has a constant Doppler shift along the slit which does not follow the velocity gradient of the nebular [O II] emission. Using the Sobolev approximation, we derive the density of Mg+ ions at a radius of 12 to 18 kpc in the outflow. We model the ionization correction and find that much of the outflowing Mg is in Mg++. We estimate that the total mass flux could be as large as 330 - 500 solar masses per year, with the largest uncertainties coming from the depletion of Mg onto grains and the clumpiness of the warm outflow. We show that confining the warm clouds with a hot wind reduces the estimated mass flux of the warm outflow and indicates amass-loading factor near unity in the warm phase alone. Based on the high blue luminosities that distinguish 32016857 and TKRS 4389, described by Rubin et al. 2011, from other galaxies with P-Cygni emission, we suggest that, as sensitivity to diffuse emission improves, scattering halos may prove to be a generic property of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{originally}} derives the convective {{kinetic energy}} equation under mass-flux subgrid-scale parameterization {{in a formal}} manner based on the segmentally-constant approximation (SCA). Though this equation is long since presented by Arakawa and Schubert (1974), a formal derivation is not known in the literature. The derivation of this formulation is of increasing interests in recent years {{due to the fact}} that it can explain basic aspects of the convective dynamics such as discharge–recharge and transition from shallow to deep convection. The derivation is presented in two manners: (i) for the case that only the vertical component of the velocity is considered and (ii) the case that both the horizontal and vertical components are considered. The equation reduces to the same form as originally presented by Arakwa and Schubert in both cases, but with the energy dissipation term defined differently. In both cases, nevertheless, the energy “dissipation” (loss) term consists of the three principal contributions: (i) entrainment–detrainment, (<b>ii)</b> <b>outflow</b> from top of convection, and (iii) pressure effects. Additionally, inflow from the bottom of convection contributing to a growth of convection is also formally counted as a part of the dissipation term. The eddy dissipation is also included for a completeness. The order-of-magnitude analysis shows that the convective kinetic energy “dissipation” is dominated by the pressure effects, and it may be approximately described by Rayleigh damping with a constant time scale of the order of 102 – 103 s. The conclusion is also supported by a supplementary analysis of a cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulation. The Appendix discusses how the loss term (“dissipation”) of the convective kinetic energy is qualitatively different from the conventional eddy-dissipation process found in turbulent flows...|$|R
40|$|We aim {{to explore}} whether strong {{magnetic}} fields can be effectively generated in low-mass dwarf galaxies and, if so, whether such fields {{can be affected}} by galactic outflows and spread out into the intergalactic medium (IGM). We performed a radio continuum polarimetry study of IC 10, the nearest starbursting dwarf galaxy, {{using a combination of}} multifrequency interferometric (VLA) and single-dish (Effelsberg) observations. VLA observations at 1. 43 GHz reveal an extensive and almost spherical radio halo of IC 10 in total intensity, extending twice more than the infrared-emitting galactic disk. The halo is magnetized with a magnetic field strength of 7 in the outermost parts. Locally, the magnetic field reaches about 29 μG in H ii complexes, becomes more ordered, and weakens to 22 μG in the synchrotron superbubble and to 7 – 10 within H i holes. At the higher frequency of 4. 86 GHz, we found a large-scale magnetic field structure of X-shaped morphology, similar to that observed in several edge-on spiral galaxies. The X-shaped magnetic structure can be caused by the galactic wind, advecting magnetic fields injected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds and supernova explosions. The radio continuum scale heights at 1. 43 GHz indicate the bulk speed of cosmic-ray electrons <b>outflowing</b> from H <b>ii</b> complexes of about 60 km s^- 1, exceeding the escape velocity of 40 km s^- 1. Hence, the magnetized galactic wind in IC 10 inflates the extensive radio halo visible at 1. 43 GHz and can seed the IGM with both random and ordered magnetic fields. These are signatures of intense material feedback onto the IGM, expected to be prevalent in the protogalaxies of the early universe...|$|R
40|$|Low-ionization {{transitions}} {{such as the}} Mg II gamma 2796 / 2803 doublet trace cold gas in {{the vicinity}} of galaxies. It is not clear whether this gas is part of the interstellar medium of large protodisks, part of dwarfs, or part of entrained material in supernova-driven outflows. Studies based on Mg II statistics, e. g., stacked images and clustering analysis, have invoked starburst-driven <b>outflows</b> where Mg <b>II</b> absorbers are tracing the denser and colder gas of the outflow. A consequence of the outflow scenario is that the strongest absorbers ought to be associated with starbursts. We use the near-IR integral field spectrograph SINFONI to test whether starbursts are found around z similar to 1 Mg II absorbers. For 67 % (14 out of 21) of the absorbers with rest-frame equivalent width W-r(lambda 2796) > 2 angstrom, we do detect H alpha in emission within +/- 200 km s(- 1) of the predicted wavelength based on the Mg II redshift, and with impact parameter ranging from 0. 2 '' to 6. 7 '' from the QSO. The star formation rate (SFR) inferred from is H alpha is 1 - 20 M-circle dot yr(- 1), i. e., showing a level of star formation larger than in M 82 by a factor of > 4 on average. Our flux limit (3 sigma) is integral(H alpha) 95 %) for a correlation between SFR and equivalent width, indicating a physical connection between starburst phenomena and gas seen in absorption. In the cases where we can extract the velocity field, the host galaxies of Mg II absorbers with W-r(lambda 2796) 2 angstrom reside in halos with mean similar to 11. 2, in good agreement with clustering measurements...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} results from the {{combined}} IRAC and MIPS c 2 d Spitzer Legacy survey observations and complementary optical and near infrared data of the Chamaeleon II (Cha II) dark cloud. We perform a census of the young population of Cha II, in a mapped area of ~ 1. 75 square degrees, and study the spatial distribution and properties of the cloud members and candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) objects and their circumstellar matter. From the analysis of the volume density of the PMS objects and candidates we find two tight groups of objects with volume densities higher than 25 solar masses per cubic parsec and 5 - 10 members each. These groups correlate well in space with the regions of high extinction. A multiplicity fraction of about 13 % is observed for objects with separations between 0. 8 " and 6. 0 ". Using the results of masses and ages from a companion paper, we estimate the star formation efficiency to be 1 - 4 % significantly lower than for Cha I. This might mean that different star-formation activities in the Chamaeleon clouds reflect a different history of star formation. We also find that the Cha II cloud is turning some 6 - 7 solar masses into stars every Myr, which is low in comparison with the star formation rate in other c 2 d clouds. On the other hand, the disk fraction of 70 - 80 % that we estimate in Cha II is much higher than in other star forming regions and indicates that the population in this cloud is dominated by objects with active accretion. Finally, the Cha <b>II</b> <b>outflows</b> are discussed, with particular regard to the discovery of a new Herbig-Haro outflow, HH 939, driven by the classical T Tauri star Sz 50.
