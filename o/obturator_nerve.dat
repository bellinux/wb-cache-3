25|$|The lumbar plexus {{is formed}} lateral to the {{intervertebral}} foramina by the ventral rami {{of the first}} four lumbar spinal nerves (L1-L4), which all pass through psoas major. The larger branches of the plexus exit the muscle to pass sharply downward to reach the abdominal wall and the thigh (under the inguinal ligament); {{with the exception of}} the <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve</b> which pass through the lesser pelvis to reach the medial part of the thigh through the obturator foramen. The nerves of the lumbar plexus pass in front of the hip joint and mainly support the anterior part of the thigh.|$|E
25|$|The <b>{{obturator}}</b> <b>nerve</b> (L2-L4) passes medially behind psoas major to {{exit the}} pelvis through the obturator canal, after which it gives off branches to obturator externus and divides into two branches passing behind {{and in front of}} adductor brevis to supply motor innervation to all the other adductor muscles. The anterior branch also supplies sensory nerves to the skin on a small area on the distal medial aspect of the thigh. The femoral nerve (L2-L4) is the largest and longest of the nerves of the lumbar plexus. It supplies motor innervation to iliopsoas, pectineus, sartorius, and quadriceps; and sensory branches to the anterior thigh, medial lower leg, and posterior foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{adductor}} {{muscles of}} the thigh are innervated by the <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve,</b> {{with the exception of}} pectineus which receives fibers from the femoral nerve, and the adductor magnus which receives fibers from the tibial nerve. The gracilis arises from near the pubic symphysis and is unique among the adductors in that it reaches past the knee to attach on the medial side of the shaft of the tibia, thus acting on two joints. It share its distal insertion with the sartorius and semitendinosus, all three muscles forming the pes anserinus. It is the most medial muscle of the adductors, and with the thigh abducted its origin can be clearly seen arching under the skin. With the knee extended, it adducts the thigh and flexes the hip. The pectineus has its origin on the iliopubic eminence laterally to the gracilis and, rectangular in shape, extends obliquely to attach immediately behind the lesser trochanter and down the pectineal line and the proximal part of the linea aspera on the femur. It is a flexor of the hip joint, and an adductor and a weak medial rotator of the thigh. The adductor brevis originates on the inferior ramus of the pubis below the gracilis and stretches obliquely below the pectineus down to the upper third of the linea aspera. Except for being an adductor, it is a lateral rotator and weak flexor of the hip joint. The adductor longus has its origin at superior ramus of the pubis and inserts medially on the middle third of the linea aspera. Primarily an adductor, it is also responsible for some flexion. The adductor magnus has its origin just behind the longus and lies deep to it. Its wide belly divides into two parts: One is inserted into the linea aspera and the tendon of the other reaches down to adductor tubercle on the medial side of the femur's distal end where it forms an intermuscular septum that separates the flexors from the extensors. Magnus is a powerful adductor, especially active when crossing legs. Its superior part is a lateral rotator but the inferior part acts as a medial rotator on the flexed leg when rotated outward and also extends the hip joint. The adductor minimus is an incompletely separated subdivision of the adductor magnus. Its origin forms an anterior part of the magnus and distally it is inserted on the linea aspera above the magnus. It acts to adduct and lateral rotate the femur.|$|E
5000|$|Beneath the fascia lata, at {{the lower}} border of the {{adductor}} longus, it joins to form a plexiform net-work (subsartorial plexus) with branches of the saphenous and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gluteal gait is an {{abnormal}} gait caused by neurological problems. If the superior gluteal <b>nerve</b> or <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves</b> are injured, {{they fail to}} control the gluteus minimus and medius muscles properly, thus producing an inability to tilt the pelvis upward while swinging the leg forward to walk. To compensate for this loss, the leg swings out laterally so that the foot can move forward, producing a shuffling or waddling gait.|$|R
25|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus {{is composed of}} nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves.</b> Since the plexus is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or mepivacaine mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|R
50|$|The {{anterior}} {{branch of}} the <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve</b> is a {{branch of the}} <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve</b> found in the pelvis and leg.|$|E
50|$|The lumbar plexus {{is formed}} from the {{anterior}} rami of nerves L1 to L4 and some fibers from T12. With only five roots and two divisions, {{it is less}} complex than the brachial plexus and {{gives rise to a}} number of nerves including the femoral nerve and accessory <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve.</b> The pectineus muscle is considered a composite muscle as the innervation is by the femoral nerve (L2 and L3) and occasionally (20% of the population) a branch of the <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve</b> called the accessory <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve.</b> When it is present, the accessory <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve</b> innervates a portion of the pectineus muscle, entering the muscle on its dorsomedial aspect. The greater nerve to the muscle is the femoral nerve. Unlike the obturator accessory nerve, the femoral nerve is always present and provides the sole innervation for the pectineus muscle in over 90% of cases. The muscle is also innervated by the accessory <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve</b> in the 8.7% of cases in which the nerve occurs.|$|E
50|$|As part of {{the medial}} {{compartment}} of the thigh, the adductor longus is innervated by the anterior division (sometimes the posterior division) of the <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve.</b> The <b>obturator</b> <b>nerve</b> exits via the anterior rami of the spinal cord from L2, L3, and L4.|$|E
40|$|Cement {{extrusion}} {{into the}} pelvis with subsequent palsy of the <b>obturator</b> and femoral <b>nerves</b> {{is a rare}} entity after hip replacement surgery. Cemented fixation of the acetabular cup has been considered as a safe and reliable standard procedure with very good long term results. We present a case of fifty year old female patient after hip arthroplasty procedure which suffered an <b>obturator</b> and femoral <b>nerve</b> palsy caused by extrusion of bone cement into the pelvis. Postoperative X-rays and CT-scan of the pelvis demonstrated a huge mass consisted of bone cement in close proximity of femoral and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves.</b> The surgery charts reported shallow and weak bony substance in postero-superior aspect of the acetabulum. This weak bony acetabular substance may have caused extrusion of bone cement during press-fitting of the polyethylene cup into the acetabulum, and the following damage of the both nerves produced by polymerization of bone cement. The bone cement fragment has been surgically removed 3 weeks after arthroplasty. The female patient underwent intensive postoperative physical therapy and electro stimulation which resulted in full recovery of the patient to daily routine and almost normal electromyography results...|$|R

Often, surgery {{is not an option}} for patients with multiple comorbidities, and conventional drugs either have many side effects or are ineffective. Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) is a new method in the treatment of pain. We attempt to compare the efficacy of PRF relative to conservative management for chronic hip pain. Patients and methods: Between August 2011 and July 2013, 29 patients with chronic hip pain were divided into two groups (PRF and conservative treatment) according to consent or refusal to undergo PRF procedure. Fifteen patients received PRF of the articular branches of the femoral and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves,</b> and 14 patients received conservative treatment. Visual analog scale (VAS), Oxford hip scores (OHS), and pain medications were used for outcome measurement before treatment and at 1  week, 4  weeks, and 12  weeks after treatment. Results: At 1  week, 4  weeks, and 12  weeks after treatment initiation, improvements in VAS were significantly greater with PRF. Improvements in OHS were significantly greater in the PRF group at 1  week, 4  weeks, and 12  weeks. Patients in the PRF group also used less pain medications. Eight subjects in the conservative treatment group switched to the PRF group after 12  weeks, and six of them had > 50 % improvement. Conclusion: When compared with conservative treatment, PRF of the articular branches of the femoral and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves</b> offers greater pain relief for chronic hip pain and can augment physical functioning.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{incidence}} and patterns of referred pain in patients with hip disease, as well as the nerve distribution in the hip and knee joints of 2 cadavers. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 113 patients with hip joint disease were included in the investigation. The incidence of regional pain and referred pain patterns were evaluated before and after arthroplasty. Two cadavers were macroscopically observed to verify the nerve innervation of the hip and knee joints. [Results] Anterior knee pain was observed preoperatively in 13. 3 % (in resting) and 33. 6 % (in motion) of the patients, which was comparable with the incidence of greater trochanter pain. In addition, the preoperative incidence rates of knee pain in resting and motion markedly decreased postoperatively. Of note is the remarkable incidence of pain radiating to the ventral lower limb. An anteromedial innervation was determined in the cadavers by the articular branches of the <b>obturator</b> and femoral <b>nerve,</b> which supply small branches to the knee joints. [Conclusion] Our results suggest that the distribution of the incidence of pain among the patients with hip disease is diverse owing to the sensory distribution of the femoral and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves...</b>|$|R

40|$|Lesions of lumbar plexus are {{uncommon}} {{and descriptions}} of surgical access are derived from vertebral spine approaches. METHOD: The extraperitoneal anterolateral approach to the lumbar plexus was performed in six adult fresh cadavers. The difficulties on dissection were related. RESULTS: An exposure of all distal elements of lumbar plexus was possible, but a cranial extension of the incision was needed to reach the iliohypogastric nerve in all cases. Ligation of vessels derived from common iliac artery was necessary for genitofemoral and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves</b> exposure in two cases. The most proximal part of the lumbar roots could be identified only after dissection and clipping of most lumbar vessels. CONCLUSION: The extraperitoneal anterolateral approach allows appropriate exposure of terminal nerves of lumbar plexus laterallly to psoas major muscle.

40|$|The {{biomechanics}} of trans-femoral amputations has {{not been}} previously described. Little {{attention has been paid}} to the importance of adductor magnus in holding the femur in its normal anatomical axis. Loss of function of adductor magnus leads to abduction of the residual femur, in a trans-femoral amputation. A cadaver study of the adductor group of thigh muscles has been done and the biomechanical importance of these muscles is documented. The moment arms of the three adductor muscles have been determined, based on muscle attachments and muscle size, relative to each other. Adductor magnus has a major mechanical advantage in holding the thigh in its normal anatomical position. Loss of the distal third of its attachment results in a 70 % loss of the effective moment arm of the muscle, which contributes to the abducted femur in standard trans-femoral amputations. A muscle preserving trans-femoral amputation, which keeps adductor magnus intact, prevents abduction of the residual femur and may allow for easier walking with a prosthesis. The conflicting reports about adductor magnus activity during the gait cycle can be explained by this muscle's dual innervation by the sciatic and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves</b> and its dual function as a hip adductor and extensor...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. During periacetabular {{osteotomy}} (PAO), the sciatic, femoral, and <b>obturator</b> <b>nerves</b> are at risk. Most frequently nerve lesions can {{be attributed}} to a mechanical cause; however, {{in the absence of a}} clear mechanical cause surgeons are faced with a diagnostic problem and in many cases no diagnosis will be established. We report a case of inflammatory neuropathy of the lumbosacral plexus following a PAO. Case Presentation. A 31 -year-old female developed weakness of ankle and knee flexion and extension 6 months after a PAO. Electrophysiological studies revealed damage to the obturator, femoral, and sciatic nerve consistent with an inflammatory lumbosacral plexopathy. MRI of the lumbosacral plexus was normal. The patient was treated with multimodal pain therapy and prolonged physiotherapy; nevertheless, symptoms worsened over time. At 2 -year follow-up, there were no signs of recovery. Discussion. Inflammatory neuropathy of the lumbosacral plexus is a potential cause of pain and weakness after ipsilateral orthopaedic procedures. It should be distinguished from more frequently encountered mechanical causes of postsurgical neuropathy based on clinical suspicion, electrophysiological studies, MRI, and nerve biopsy. It is important that the orthopaedic community is aware of this complication since there is some evidence that early recognition and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy can lead to improved clinical outcome...|$|R

Sixty patients underwent PCB (0. 4 mL/kg levobupivacaine 0. 5 %) and subsequent spinal anesthesia for primary joint arthroplasty (hip or knee) in a prospective, double-blind study. Patients were randomly allocated to undergo PCB by using the Capdevila (group C; n = 30) or a modified Winnie (group W; n = 30) approach.
