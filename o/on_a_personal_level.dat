5|$|The album {{features}} a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked {{a radical departure from}} much of his previous work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{serving with}} the Grand Fleet, Battleship Division Nine {{was forced to}} adapt quickly to {{unfamiliar}} British methods and standards. New signals and maneuvers were adopted relatively smoothly, while more stringent gunnery standards proved more difficult to achieve. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> relations between American and British officers and men were notably cordial.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> Grace {{was still}} {{unqualified}} {{as a doctor}} and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study a backlog of medical theory. He did not qualify as a doctor {{until the end of}} the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E
5|$|The novel deals <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level</b> {{with the}} change in Bond from a {{depressed}} man in mourning, to a man of action bent on revenge, to an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman. Through the mouths of his characters, Fleming also examines the decline of post-World WarII British power and influence, notably {{in relation to the}} United States. The book was popular with the public, with pre-orders in the UK totalling 62,000; critics were more muted in their reactions, generally delivering mixed reviews of the novel.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Canada, Peart was recruited to play drums for a St. Catharines band known as Hush, who {{played on the}} South Ontario bar circuit. Soon after, a mutual acquaintance convinced Peart to audition for the Toronto-based band Rush, which needed a replacement for its original drummer John Rutsey. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson oversaw the audition. His future bandmates describe his arrival that day as somewhat humorous, as he arrived in shorts, driving a battered old Ford Pinto with his drums stored in trashcans. Peart felt the entire audition was a complete disaster. While Lee and Peart hit it off <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level</b> (both sharing similar tastes in books and music), Lifeson had a less favourable impression of Peart. After some discussion, Lee and Lifeson accepted Peart's maniacal British style of drumming, reminiscent of The Who's Keith Moon.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis quit smoking in the 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal {{cigarettes}} and tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but switched to herbal because he was afraid of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> Davis drives a Tesla powered by hydroelectricity.|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} FDR another five years, {{with the help}} of the League of Women Voters to replace Stevens. Making the {{argument}} that Stevens was appointed by the Conference of the Pan-American States and not as a U.S. delegate, FDR agreed to give permanent status to the CIM, if each state was allowed to appoint their own delegates. Securing approval, he then immediately replaced Stevens with Mary Nelson Winslow. Stevens did not go quietly and the clash continued throughout 1939 with Eleanor Roosevelt backing Winslow and suffragists backing Stevens. Eleanor's objection to Stevens was multi-faced, in that she did not think that the Equal Rights Amendment would protect women and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> she believed Stevens behaved in an unladylike manner.|$|E
5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an {{enormous}} impact on PedroII: <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E

50|$|In {{the novel}} The Dragon Can't Dance, author Earl Lovelace expresses several reoccurring themes that {{illustrate}} fundamental psychological losses, which {{the characters are}} trying to rediscover and re-establish <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal,</b> and community <b>level.</b> Aldrick and his compadres are striving to find meaning and locate connectedness in something other than their involvement in the Carnival experience that occurs annually in their city of Port of Spain. In spite of their efforts, their multi-generational lack of roots and culture prevent them from developing productive attachments. This undermines their sense of identity <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> and societal <b>level.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1982, Shero {{failed in}} an attempt to become the Detroit Red Wings head coach. A year later he was {{diagnosed}} with stomach cancer. He underwent surgery but remained healthy enough to start his new position as color analyst for the New Jersey Devils radio broadcasts. In 1987 Shero decided he wanted to experience coaching in Europe and spent one season coaching Tilburg Trappers in the Netherlands. With his health declining Shero returned to the Flyers' organization as a special assistant in 1989. The reunion was to help him with his medical costs, but it was also something that was very important to Shero <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> as it was a return to the organization he had the most success with. On March 22, 1990, Shero was elected into the Flyers' Hall of Fame. Eight months later on November 24, Shero died at Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. He was 65.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{wait for}} {{replacement}} equipment, Barnette purchased {{the press of}} a newly arrived editor, William Fentress Thompson, who had intended to set up his own newspaper. As part of the purchasing deal in August 1906, Thompson was allowed to publish an evening paper—the Tanana Daily Miner—while the Fairbanks Daily News {{was published in the}} morning. The deal lasted only through September, as Thompson and Barnette conflicted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level.</b> The Tanana Miner was reduced to a weekly newspaper, then Thompson was deposed as editor of the Fairbanks News in June 1907 and took the Tanana Miner to the settlement of Chena, outside Fairbanks. Barnette, meanwhile, became embroiled in a series of legal troubles. He faced opposition from the owner of the Fairbanks Times, A.L. Anderson, who had fought Barnette about several gold claims near Fairbanks and purchased the Times to compete against Barnette.|$|E
5|$|Robert Dudley was {{a pioneer}} of new industries; {{interested}} in many things from tapestries to mining, he was engaged in the first joint stock companies in English history. The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment among the poor. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> he gave to poor people, petitioners, and prisons on a daily basis. Due to his interests in trade and exploration, {{as well as his}} debts, his contacts with the London city fathers were intense. He was an enthusiastic investor in the Muscovy Company and the Merchant Adventurers. English relations with Morocco were also handled by Leicester. This he did in the manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making). He took much interest in the careers of John Hawkins and Francis Drake from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of Martin Frobisher's 1576 search for the Northwest Passage. Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the Galleon Leicester, which he employed in a luckless expedition under Edward Fenton, but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of Dom António, the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.|$|E

25|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> more <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> he {{was said}} to {{have been one of the}} meanest players of his time; hated by {{opposition}} players and even by some of his teammates.

25|$|Overall, income after {{retirement}} {{can come}} from state pensions, occupational pensions, private savings and investments (private pension funds, owned housing), donations (e.g., by children), and social benefits. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> {{the rising cost of}} living during retirement is a serious concern to many older adults.

25|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>level,</b> {{there are}} {{internal}} conflicts involving religious beliefs, upbringing, and internalized homophobia {{in addition to}} feelings of fear and isolation.

25|$|In June 1929, the Copiaus {{formed a}} new troupe, La Compagnie des Quinze, led by Michel Saint-Denis.
