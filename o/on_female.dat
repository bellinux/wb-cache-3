5|$|Thoughts on the {{education}} of daughters: with reflections <b>on</b> <b>female</b> conduct, in the more important duties of life is the first published work of the British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft. Published in 1787 by her friend Joseph Johnson, Thoughts is a conduct book that offers advice <b>on</b> <b>female</b> education to the emerging British middle class. Although dominated by considerations of morality and etiquette, the text also contains basic child-rearing instructions, {{such as how to}} care for an infant.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{phenomenon}} of male pregnancy, the ¢sh family Syngnathidae (seahorses and pipe¢shes) has historically been considered an archetypal example of a group in which sexual selection should act more strongly <b>on</b> <b>females</b> than <b>on</b> males. However, more recent work has called into question the idea that all species with male pregnancy are sex-role reversed {{with respect to the}} intensity of sexual selection. Furthermore, no studies have formally quanti¢ed the opportunity for sexual selection in any natural breeding assemblage of pipe¢shes or seahorses in order to demonstrate conclusively that sexual selection acts most strongly <b>on</b> <b>females.</b> Here, we use a DNA-based study of parentage in the Gulf pipe¢sh Syngnathus scovelli in order to show that sexual selection indeed acts more strongly <b>on</b> <b>females</b> than <b>on</b> males in this species. Moreover, the Gulf pipe¢sh exhibits classical polyandry with the greatest asymmetry in reproductive roles (as quanti¢ed by variances in mating success) between males and females yet documented in any system. Thus, the intensity of sexual selection <b>on</b> <b>females</b> in pipe¢sh rivals that of any other taxon yet studied...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the most}} social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which {{typically}} form colonies based <b>on</b> <b>female</b> kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The {{black-tailed prairie dog}} forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists of an adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders.|$|E
5|$|In India, a 14th-century Indian text {{mentioning}} {{a lesbian}} couple {{who had a}} child {{as a result of}} their lovemaking is an exception to the general silence about female homosexuality. This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing <b>on</b> <b>female</b> homosexuality are frequently suppressed.|$|E

5|$|A week later, {{plans for}} an as yet unnamed second {{documentary}} about compulsive male masturbators were announced, to be produced by the independent company Spun Gold. The film was to be an hour long and focus on men trying to cut down excessive masturbatory habits of up to twenty times a day, using methods developed in the United States. In September 2006, the final film in the series was announced. Entitled Masturbation For Girls, it was also to be produced by Spun Gold, and focus <b>on</b> <b>female</b> masturbation. It was to feature the sex educationalist Dr Betty Dodson, although the format had yet not been finalised.

5|$|The Pacific Rim {{award was}} {{introduced}} in 1995, the year after two Australian swimmers—Kieren Perkins and Samantha Riley—became the first two Pacific Rim swimmers to be named as World Swimmer of the Year. It has subsequently been dominated by Australian swimmers, who have won 24 of the 32 awards given. Ian Thorpe won six awards (five consecutively) and Susie O'Neill has won four (three consecutively). Australia’s success has been built <b>on</b> <b>female</b> butterfliers (O’Neill and Petria Thomas), female breaststrokers (Riley and Leisel Jones), and male freestylers (Thorpe, Grant Hackett and Michael Klim). The men's awards have been dominated by Asian swimmers since 2006. Kosuke Kitajima (Japan) was the first non-Australian swimmer to win the award more than once (in 2003, 2007, 2008, and 2010). He was followed by Sun Yang of China who won three awards (in 2011, 2012, and 2013).|$|E

40|$|Anomalies of the {{skeleton}} {{provide information on}} living conditions, cultural structure and health problems in ancient societies. Squatting facet {{is a kind of}} anomaly that forms on the surfaces where the tibia and talus articulate is the squatting facet states the daily activities and living style of the society. The aim {{of this study is to}} learn the daily activities of the medieval societies in the Van region through studying of squatting facets. In this study, adult skeletons from Dilkaya and Van Kalesi-Eski Van Şehri societies dating to the Medieval Age were investigated (65 tibia and 82 tali from Dilkaya, 61 tibia and 52 tali from Van Kalesi-Eski Van Şehri). The lateral squatting facet had high ratios in both societies. The tibia lateral squatting facet found <b>on</b> <b>females</b> and males of Dilkaya was 97. 2 % and 96. 9 %, respectively, and <b>on</b> <b>females</b> and males of Van kalesi Eski Van Şehri was 87. 5 % and 89. 2 %, respectively. The talus lateral squatting facet found <b>on</b> <b>females</b> and males of Dilkaya was 72. 1 % and 51. 3 %, respectively, and <b>on</b> <b>females</b> and males of Van kalesi Eski Van Şehri was 91. 2 % and 83. 7 %, respectively. The results provide an opportunity to study the relationship between past and modern population, and also describe the daily activity of life and cultural structure...|$|R

5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects <b>on</b> <b>female</b> employment.|$|E
5|$|James VI's {{visit to}} Denmark in 1589, where witch-hunts were already common, may have {{encouraged}} {{an interest in}} the study of witchcraft, and he came to see the storms he encountered on his voyage as the result of magic. After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act and the first known to successfully involve the diabolic pact. Several people, most notably Agnes Sampson and the schoolmaster John Fian, were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches. He subsequently believed that a nobleman, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. Inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 he wrote the Daemonologie, a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth, which contains probably the most famous literary depiction of Scottish witches. James imported continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear <b>on</b> <b>female</b> communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil. However, after the publication of Daemonologie his views became more sceptical, and in the same year he revoked the standing commissions on witchcraft, limiting prosecutions by the central courts.|$|E
