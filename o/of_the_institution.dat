5|$|Fowler {{was born}} in Wadsley, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to land {{surveyor}} John Fowler and his wife Elizabeth (née Swann). He was educated privately at Whitley Hall near Ecclesfield. He trained under John Towlerton Leather, engineer of the Sheffield waterworks, and with Leather's uncle, George Leather, on the Aire and Calder Navigation and on railway surveys. From 1837 he worked for John Urpeth Rastrick on railway projects including the London and Brighton Railway and the unbuilt West Cumberland and Furness Railway. He then worked again for George Leather as resident engineer on the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway and was appointed engineer to the railway {{when it opened in}} 1841. Fowler initially established a practice as a consulting engineer in the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire area, but, a heavy workload led him to move to London in 1844. He became a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Institution</b> of Mechanical Engineers in 1847, the year the Institution was founded, and a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Institution</b> of Civil Engineers in 1849. On 2 July 1850 he married Elizabeth Broadbent (died 19 November 1901), daughter of J. Boadbent of Manchester. The couple had four sons.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hinde opposed slavery. Although their parents owned slaves, {{he and his}} {{siblings}} repudiated slavery on religious grounds.

In the Great Awakening, Methodists were prominent among those who opposed slavery, although they also converted slaves and welcomed them into congregations. In Kentucky Hinde joined other Methodist ministers in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
