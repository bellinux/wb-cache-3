Harrison won victories in the Indiana Territory and in Ohio and recaptured Detroit, before invading Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). Harrison's army defeated the British on October 5, 1813, at the Battle of the Thames, in which Tecumseh was killed.

5|$|In March 1877, Linderman {{authorized}} the melting of 12,359 twenty-cent pieces at Carson City. This included {{almost the entire}} mintage from 1876 (about 10,000) and created one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>American</b> numismatic rarities, the 1876-CC twenty-cent piece. Fewer than two dozen are known; one sold at auction for $564,000 in 2013, making it the record-holder for the denomination. In her 2003 article, numismatist Michele Orzano suggests that the few survivors were souvenirs obtained by visitors to the mint.|$|E
5|$|Little {{can be said}} of the {{evolutionary}} history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} felids {{are known}} from the Oligocene of Europe, such as Proailurus, and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the Miocene genus Pseudaelurus. The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats {{was similar to that}} of the modern clouded leopards (Neofelis). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high bite force. As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey. In derived smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from fossils, the lineages of Homotherium and Smilodon are estimated to have diverged about 18 Ma ago. The earliest species of Smilodon is S.gracilis, which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years ago (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of Megantereon, from which it probably evolved. Megantereon itself had entered North America from Eurasia during the Pliocene, along with Homotherium. S.gracilis reached the northern regions of South America in the Early Pleistocene as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Interchange. The younger Smilodon species are probably derived from S.gracilis. S.fatalis existed 1.6 million–10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and replaced S.gracilis in North America. S.populator existed 1 million–10,000 years ago (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America.|$|E

25|$|The sloths {{from the}} Late Pliocene Ware Formation are {{represented}} by 12 specimens that belong to 5 taxa from the 4 families of ground sloths. Their body sizes span over two orders of magnitude, and they most likely featured various feeding strategies, documenting a highly diverse assemblage of sloths from the Neotropics. Although geographically close to the Isthmus of Panama, and temporally preceding the first phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Biotic Interchange by only 200,000 to 400,000 years, the sloths for which unambiguous affinities were recovered are not {{closely related to the}} early immigrants found in North America before the first main pulse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Biotic interchange. The registered giant capybara Hydrochoeropsis wayuu is the northernmost South American Pliocene hydrochoerine record and the nearest to the Panamanian bridge. The presence of this hydrochoerine, together with the fluvio-deltaic environment of the Ware Formation, suggests that during the Late Pliocene, the environment that dominated the Guajira Peninsula was more humid and with permanent water bodies, in contrast with its modern desert habitats.|$|E

25|$|The direct {{ancestor}} of all modern camels, Procamelus, {{existed in the}} upper Miocene and lower Pliocene. Around 3–5 million years ago, the North American Camelidae spread to South America as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Interchange via the newly formed Isthmus of Panama, where they gave rise to guanacos and related animals, and to Asia via the Bering land bridge. Surprising finds of fossil Paracamelus on Ellesmere Island beginning in 2006 in the high Canadian Arctic indicate the dromedary is descended from a larger, boreal browser whose hump may have evolved as an adaptation in a cold climate. This creature is estimated to have stood around nine feet tall.|$|E
25|$|The camelid lineage {{has a good}} fossil record. Camel-like {{animals have}} been traced from the {{thoroughly}} differentiated, modern species back through early Miocene forms. Their characteristics became more general, and they lost those that distinguished them as camelids; hence, they were classified as ancestral artiodactyls. No fossils of these earlier forms {{have been found in}} the Old World, indicating that North America was the original home of camelids, and that Old World camels crossed over via the Bering Land Bridge. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama three million years ago allowed camelids to spread to South America as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Interchange, where they evolved further. Meanwhile, North American camelids died {{out at the end of}} the Pleistocene.|$|E

25|$|Until about 10,000 years ago, ground sloths such as Megatherium {{lived in}} South America {{as well as}} in much of North America; they colonized the latter as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Interchange. Along with many other animals, however, they {{disappeared}} shortly after the appearance of humans on both continents. Large amounts of evidence suggest human hunting contributed to the extinction of the American megafauna, like that of North Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Madagascar. Simultaneous climate change that came {{with the end of the}} last ice age may have also played a role in some cases. However, the survival of Megalocnus on the Antilles until about 5000 years ago (after these islands were finally settled by humans), long after other ground sloths died out on the mainland, points toward human activities as the cause of extinction.|$|E
25|$|The first tapirids, such as Heptodon, {{appeared}} in the early Eocene of North America. They appeared very similar to modern forms, but were about half the size, and lacked the proboscis. The first true tapirs {{appeared in}} the Oligocene. By the Miocene, such genera as Miotapirus were almost indistinguishable from the extant species. Asian and American tapirs were believed to have diverged around 20 to 30 million years ago; tapirs later migrated from North America to South America around 3 million years ago, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Interchange. For much of their history, tapirs were spread across the Northern Hemisphere, where they became extinct as recently as 10,000 years ago. T. merriami, T. veroensis, T. copei, and T. californicus became extinct during the Pleistocene in North America. The giant tapir Megatapirus survived until about 4,000 years ago in China.|$|E
25|$|According {{to these}} results, {{it appears the}} genus Equus evolved from a Dinohippus-like {{ancestor}} ~4–7 mya. It rapidly spread into the Old World and there diversified into the various species of asses and zebras. A North American lineage of the subgenus E. (Equus) evolved into the New World stilt-legged horse (NWSLH). Subsequently, populations of this species entered South America as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>American</b> Interchange shortly after {{the formation of the}} Isthmus of Panama, and evolved into the form currently referred to as Hippidion ~2.5 million years ago. Hippidion is thus only distantly related to the morphologically similar Pliohippus, which presumably became extinct during the Miocene. Both the NWSLH and Hippidium show adaptations to dry, barren ground, whereas the shortened legs of Hippidion may have been a response to sloped terrain. In contrast, the geographic origin of the closely related modern E. ferus is not resolved. However, genetic results on extant and fossil material of Pleistocene age indicate two clades, potentially subspecies, one of which had a holarctic distribution spanning from Europe through Asia and across North America and would become the founding stock of the modern domesticated horse. The other population appears to have been restricted to North America. However, one or more North American populations of E. ferus entered South America ~1.0–1.5 million years ago, leading to the forms currently known as E. (Amerhippus), which represent an extinct geographic variant or race of E. ferus.|$|E
