5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>that</b> the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than {{would have been the}} case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>that</b> the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|The State of California charged Alvarado and {{his friend}} with first-degree murder and {{attempted}} robbery. Alvarado attempted to suppress his statements given during the Comstock interview <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>that</b> he was not read his Miranda rights. The trial court denied the motion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>that</b> Alvarado was not in police custody {{at the time he}} gave his statement. Alvarado was subsequently convicted, primarily based on statements Alvarado made during his police interrogation. Alvarado's conviction was reduced by the trial judge to second-degree murder for his comparatively minor role in the offense. The California Courts of Appeal affirmed the conviction and agreed that Alvarado was not in custody. The Supreme Court of California declined discretionary review.|$|E
