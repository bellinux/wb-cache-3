His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he {{had fallen out of}} favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E

At {{the other end of}} the slide (the angle, in trig, terms), a block on a pin fixed to the frame defined the vertex between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side.|$|E

25|$|This {{match was}} eerily {{similar to the}} one two days earlier – except that Jason Gillespie {{actually}} got rewards with the ball, and the batsman to play himself into form was Adam Gilchrist – however, both England and Australia picked batsmen as their supersubs, just like on 10 July.

25|$|Durham Dynamos {{contrived}} to {{lose this}} one, having first had Leicestershire Foxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> after limiting them {{to a total of}} 150 for 9. Economical bowling from Dale Benkenstein, who took two for 17, made that possible, but he was later to be the main culprit as Charl Willoughby and Jeremy Snape took wickets and refused to give him runs. He eventually finished on 18 from 17 balls, making the task of Gareth Breese and Gordon Muchall impossible - and Durham finished an agonising three runs short.|$|E

25|$|In {{the clash}} of the two top teams of Division Two of the Championship, Durham came the closest to losing a game {{so far in the}} season – though they threw it away themselves. With England {{requiring}} Steve Harmison to be rested, the team at last looked beatable, though they had Yorkshire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> at 124 for 7 and 179 for 9. However, Richard Dawson and Deon Kruis let loose for Yorkshire, scoring 75 for the last wicket in a late blitz to guide Yorkshire to a total of 254.|$|E
25|$|Graeme Welch and Andre Botha tugged Derbyshire Phantoms back {{to victory}} from 119 for 5 chasing 220 to win, as the pair shared an unbeaten 102-run {{partnership}} at Scarborough after Deon Kruis and Richard Dawson had taken out early wickets. It was Yorkshire Phoenix who batted first, Michael Lumb top-scoring with 69 while Australian Jon Moss dug out four for 28 in his nine overs. Yorkshire finished with 219 for 8, but their bowlers replied well to have Derbyshire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> when Travis Friend was run out {{to leave them}} on 85 for 4. Fifties from Welch and Botha turned the match around, however, and Derbyshire won by five wickets.|$|E
25|$|That wasn't {{nearly as}} embarrassing, however, as Sri Lanka's top order collapse. Marvan Atapattu, Sanath Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardene – all {{experienced}} Test batsmen – rolled over to Daren Powell and Jermaine Lawson, as Sri Lanka {{first went to}} 7 for 2 and then 47 for 4. Thilan Samaraweera and Tillakaratne Dilshan staged a small recovery, with 11 and 32 respectively, but when Lawson and Omari Banks got the pair of them out, things were promising for West Indies, with Sri Lanka <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> at 93 for 6. With Gayan Wijekoon playing an obviously premeditated slash to a ball from Tino Best, which went to the hands of Sylvester Joseph, West Indies were hopeful of getting a first innings lead of 100-odd.|$|E

500|$|Coke was {{transferred}} from the Common Pleas, where he was succeeded by Hobart, to the Court of King's Bench on 25 October 1613, {{on the advice of}} Bacon, presumably because Bacon and the King felt that if he was moved from a court dedicated to protecting the rights of the people to one dedicated to the rights of the King, [...] "his capacity for harm would be diminished". From Bacon's point of view, the King's Bench was a far more precarious position for someone loyal to the common law rather than the monarch. Coke's first case of note there was Peacham's Case, in which he dictated that the writing of a sermon by Thomas Peacham which advocated the death of the king – a sermon which was never preached or published – could not constitute treason. The King was unwilling to accept this decision and instead had him tried by Coke's opponents on the bench, who [...] "not surprisingly" [...] found him guilty. Refusing to admit his guilt, Peacham was tortured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> but [...] "before torture, between torture and after torture; nothing could be drawn from him".|$|E

2500|$|Hellinck's motets have {{attracted}} scholarly attention {{in modern times}} because of their possible relation to the writings of Savonarola. Hellinck spent time in Ferrara, {{the birthplace of the}} reformer, in the Este court where Savonarola was still highly regarded, and where criticism of the papal establishment was possible, at least in guarded ways. While in prison, after being tortured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> and within several days of his execution, Savonarola wrote two impassioned meditations on the psalms, Infelix ego and Tristitia obsedit me (on psalm 50 and 30, respectively); these texts became favorites of composers for motets during the 16th century, especially in regions distant from Rome or actively involved in the Reformation. However, prior to these texts actually being used in compositions verbatim, composers alluded to them in hidden ways: [...] such is the case in Hellinck's motets based on psalms 30 and 50, as it was in Josquin's own famous setting of the Miserere.|$|E
