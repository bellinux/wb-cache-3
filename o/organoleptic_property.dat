In this study, blueberries were produced into purees comparing two homogenization methods and fur- ther heated following different thermal treatments. All the supernatants of the homogenates were mon- itored for pH. Then, the hydroalcoholic extracts of the same samples were characterized by CIELAB and HPLC-DAD analyses. These analytical techniques provide complementary information on fruit pigments content as a whole and on quali-quantitative profile of the single bioactive colorants.

40|$|Astringency is an <b>organoleptic</b> <b>property</b> {{resulting}} {{mostly from}} the interaction of salivary proteins with dietary polyphenols. It is of great importance to consumers but being typically measured by sensorial panels it turns out subjective and expensive. The main goal of the present work {{is to develop a}} sensory system to estimate astringency relying on protein/polyphenol interactions. For this purpose, a model protein was immobilized on a sensory gold surface and its subsequent interaction with polyphenols was measured by Surface Plasma Resonance (SPR). α-amylase and pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) were selected as model protein and polyphenol, respectively. To ensure specific binding between these, various surface chemistries were tested. Carboxylic terminated thiol decreased the binding ability of PGG and allowed covalent attachment of α-amylase to the surface. The pH 5 was the optimal condition for α-amylase immobilization on the surface.

For patient acceptability and compliance, bitter taste drugs are masked by adding several flavoring agents. Thus, taste assessment is one important quality control parameter for evaluating taste-masked formulations. The primary method for the taste measurement of drug substances and formulations is by human panelists.

40|$|Background: We {{previously}} reported that two-phase partition chromatography between ginseng water extract and soybean oil efficiently eliminated pesticide residues. However, an undesirable odor and an unpalatable taste unique to soybean oil were two major disadvantages of the method. This study {{was carried out}} to find an alternative vegetable oil that is cost effective, labor effective, and efficient without leaving an undesirable taste and smell. Methods: We employed six vegetable oils that were available at a grocery store. A 1 -mL sample of the corresponding oil containing a total of 32 pesticides, representing four categories, was mixed with 10 % aqueous ginseng extract (20  mL) and equivalent vegetable oil (7  mL) in Falcon tubes. The final concentration of the pesticides in the mixture (28  mL) was adjusted to approximately 2  ppm. In addition, pesticides for spiking were clustered depending on the analytical equipment (GC/HPLC), detection mode (electron capture detector/nitrogen–phosphorus detector), or retention time used. Samples were harvested and subjected to quantitative analysis of the pesticides. Results: Soybean oil demonstrated the highest efficiency in partitioning pesticide residues in the ginseng extract to the oil phase. However, canola oil gave the best result in an organoleptic test {{due to the lack}} of undesirable odor and unpalatable taste. Furthermore, the qualitative and quantitative changes of ginsenosides evaluated by TLC and HPLC, respectively, revealed no notable change before or after canola oil treatment.

This marketing strategy allows producers to sell dried insects at high prices {{but without a}} sustainable establishment on the market. For a better position on the marketplace, several studies suggest integrating insects in an invisible way in ready-to-eat preparations. This talk present our past studies on the subject and a new one, using entomophagy perception questionnaires and hedonic scales, that compared the sensory-liking of dried mealworms and homemade pasta enriched with 10 % of mealworms. Unsurprisingly, 90 % of the participants preferred mealworms pasta. Nevertheless, {{it has been shown}} that women who have already eaten insects gave higher ratings to the two preparations’ taste while men responded similarly regardless their previous experience. It was also found a correlation between the overall liking evaluation, closely related to the odor evaluation, and the respondents’ personality. Effectively, people whom self-characterized them as suspicious gave low ratings to the two preparations; curious, adventurous and down-to-earth people intermediately rated preparations while ambitious people highly rated them. This study confirms the possible insect integration by proposing powdered insects in ready-to-eat preparations. A particular attention to products’ odor must be done, as suspicious people seem to rely on this <b>organoleptic</b> <b>property</b> to assess their global evaluation of insects’ products. Finally, women taste evaluation strengthened the idea that women are more neophobic than men as only women with previous experiences with insects gave high ratings to the preparations. As key contributors in food shopping decisions, women could be targeted by specific insect tasting sessions correlated with healthy or sustainable arguments to support entomophagy.

Raw cocoa beans sourced from Ivory Coast are not known for their fine aroma quality. In the global framework of raw cocoa quality improvement, this study dealt with the determination and control of the conditions of the aroma compound formation and aimed to determine the potential contribution of yeast associated with the fermentation to the formation of sensory profiling for cocoa beans. Using the method of SPME–GC–MS, the potential for flavor contribution of some predominant yeasts isolated from cocoa fermentation assays performed around Abidjan and then grown on Sabouraud-chloramphenicol medium was determined. Also, the flavor precursor compounds of final corresponding raw cocoa bean samples prepared according to specific post-harvest processing were analyzed. A total of around ten species of yeast involved in cocoa fermentation but among them, six strains were namely identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida tropicalis, Pichia kudriavzevii, Pichia galeiforms, Galactomyces geotrichum and Wickerhamomyces anomalus. These identified yeasts produced a total of 33 aroma compounds grouped into four families such as esters, alcohols, acids and others. Among all yeasts involved in fermentation performed in Abidjan, P. kudriavzevii, S. cerevisiae, G. geotrichum and W. anomalus could be considered as the most important contributors to the formation of cocoa specific aroma compounds. These cocoa aroma producing capacities of yeast isolates could be used to improve the sensory profiling raw cocoa beans or other fermented food stuffs. Furthermore some specific yeast isolates could be used as biological markers to predict the determining of chocolate sensorial characteristics and to indicate the geographical origin or processing story of cocoa bean batches.

This study was aimed at improving the knowledge on the early life history of this species, paying a {{special attention to the}} digestive apparatus and sense organs ontogenesis in order to optimize larval feeding in rearing conditions. Fertilized eggs of bluefin tuna (BFT) were obtained from spawning induction of broodstock in net cages at the Mare Nostro hatchery, near the coast of Vibo Marina (Vv) (South Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). These fertilized eggs were secondly sent to two commercial hatcheries, the Panittica Pugliese (Torre Canne di Fasano (Br), Italy) and the Civita Ittica S. r. l. (Civitavecchia, Italy). As many as 131 reared and wild BFT were used for studying ontogenetic development and 2 wild adult tunas for describing the adult morphology of all the organs involved in feeding behaviour. Observations were carried out by mean of conventional histological and SEM procedures. The atlas of morphological features of the entire digestive apparatus (taste buds included) of wild adult tuna is the first original result. Secondarily, the study on ontogenetic pattern of alimentary tract and of outer and inner sense organs evidenced that i) BFT early stages at the same length (SL) or age show different ontogenic stages; ii) the differentiation of all organs involved in feeding is achieved very early, inner taste buds included, that is before the notochord flexion. Further, postlarvae showed inner taste buds in all the anterior digestive tract (buccal rim, oro-pharyngeal cavity and anterior oesophagous), conversely to adult (only in pharynx), thus bestowing to the early stages a higher responsiveness than adults to the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>property</b> of food items...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the efficacy of plant essential oils (EOs) for control of the natural spoilage microflora on ready-to-eat (RTE) lettuce and carrots whilst also considering their impact on organoleptic properties. Initial decontamination effects achieved using EOs were comparable to that observed with chlorine and solution containing oregano recorded a significantly lower initial TVC level than the water treatment on carrots (p < 0. 05). No {{significant differences were found between}} the EO treatments and chlorine considering gas composition, color, texture and water activity of samples. The sensory panel found EO treatments acceptable for carrots throughout storage, while lettuce washed with the EO solutions were rejected for overall appreciation by Day 7. Correlating microbial and sensory changes with volatile emissions identified 12 volatile quality markers. Oregano might be a suitable decontamination alternative to chlorine for RTE carrots, while the identification of volatile quality markers is a useful complement to sensory and microbiological assessments in the monitoring of <b>organoleptic</b> <b>property</b> changes and shelf-life of fresh vegetables. Industrial relevance There is industrial demand for natural alternatives to chlorine, which is commonly used for decontamination of fresh produce but which has limitations with respect to antimicrobial efficacy and possible formation of carcinogenic compounds in water. Plant essential oils have proven antimicrobial and other bioactive properties, however their usefulness in foods can be mitigated by their high sensory impact. This study examined the application of EOs for fresh produce decontamination addressing control of spoilage microflora and improving shelf-life characteristics whilst also considering the impact on organoleptic properties. The effectiveness of oregano as a decontamination treatment was comparable with that of chlorine. Carrot discs treated with the EO regimes were acceptable in terms of sensory quality and appreciation, therefore oregano could offer a natural alternative for the washing and preservation of fresh produce.

40|$|Astringency is an <b>organoleptic</b> <b>property</b> of {{beverages}} {{and food}} products resulting {{mainly from the}} interaction of salivary proteins with dietary polyphenols. It is of great importance to consumers, but the only effective way of measuring it involves trained sensorial panellists, providing subjective and expensive responses. Concurrent chemical evaluations try to screen food astringency, by means of polyphenol and protein precipitation procedures, but these are far from the real human astringency sensation where not all polyphenol–protein interactions lead to the occurrence of precipitate. Here, a novel chemical approach that tries to mimic protein–polyphenol interactions in the mouth is presented to evaluate astringency. A protein, acting as a salivary protein, {{is attached to a}} solid support to which the polyphenol binds (just as happens when drinking wine), with subsequent colour alteration that is fully independent from the occurrence of precipitate. Employing this simple concept, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was selected as the model salivary protein and used to cover the surface of silica beads. Tannic Acid (TA), employed as the model polyphenol, was allowed to interact with the BSA on the silica support and its adsorption to the protein was detected by reaction with Fe(III) and subsequent colour development. Quantitative data of TA in the samples were extracted by colorimetric or reflectance studies over the solid materials. The analysis was done by taking a regular picture with a digital camera, opening the image file in common software and extracting the colour coordinates from HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and RGB (Red, Green, Blue) colour model systems; linear ranges were observed from 10. 6 to 106. 0 μmol L− 1. The latter was based on the Kubelka–Munk response, showing a linear gain with concentrations from 0. 3 to 10. 5 μmol L− 1. In either of these two approaches, semi-quantitative estimation of TA was enabled by direct eye comparison. The correlation between the levels of adsorbed TA and the astringency of beverages was tested by using the assay to check the astringency of wines and comparing these to the response of sensorial panellists. Results of the two methods correlated well. The proposed sensor has significant potential as a robust tool for the quantitative/semi-quantitative evaluation of astringency in wine...|$|E
