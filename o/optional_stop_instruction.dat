40|$|Recently, <b>optional</b> <b>stopping</b> {{has been}} a subject of debate in the Bayesian {{psychology}} community. Rouder (2014) argues that <b>optional</b> <b>stopping</b> is no problem for Bayesians, and even recommends the use of <b>optional</b> <b>stopping</b> in practice, as do Wagenmakers et al. (2012). This article addresses the question whether <b>optional</b> <b>stopping</b> is problematic for Bayesian methods, and specifies under which circumstances and in which sense it is and is not. By slightly varying and extending Rouder's (2014) experiment, we illustrate that, {{as soon as the}} parameters of interest are equipped with default or pragmatic priors - which means, in most practical applications of Bayes Factor hypothesis testing - resilience to <b>optional</b> <b>stopping</b> can break down. We distinguish between four types of default priors, each having their own specific issues with <b>optional</b> <b>stopping,</b> ranging from no-problem-at-all (Type 0 priors) to quite severe (Type II and III priors). Comment: This version is a significant rewrite of the earlier version. The contingency table example has moved to the appendix, and other examples are added in the main text. We distinguish between three types of problems with <b>optional</b> <b>stopping,</b> {{depending on the type of}} prior that is used. We clarify how (priors on) nuisance parameters and data-dependent priors influence <b>optional</b> <b>stopping.</b> arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1402. 6118 by other authors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractKella and Whitt (J. Appl.
