40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} models most commonly applied {{to estimate the}} value of intellectual property and <b>other</b> forms of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> It highlights the key {{strengths and weaknesses of}} these models. One of the apparent weaknesses of the most commonly used valuation models is the failure to incorporate legal rights into their calculations. Creation, maintenance, and enforcement of legal rights of ownership and control for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> form a critical component of the total economic value of those assets. The failure to account for the value of those rights undermines the accuracy and the utility of the overall asset valuation process. This paper advocates a concerted effort by professionals involved in intellectual property law and <b>intangible</b> <b>asset</b> development and management to integrate more effectively the legal aspects of <b>intangible</b> <b>asset</b> creation, protection, and transfer into asset valuation models. Absent such integration, all <b>intangible</b> <b>asset</b> valuation models will continue to be incomplete.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{managers}} have placed increasing {{emphasis on the}} creation of tangible measures of intangible organizational properties. Many major corporations now include measures for intellectual capital, knowledge capital, reputational capital, and <b>other</b> such <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> on their financial ledgers. Counter to the rubric that "If it doesn't get measured, it doesn't get done", we argue that some intangibles are truly intangible, and attempts to force fit such measures on them creates undue organizational stress and harms the underlying asset. Instead, managers may better foster the growth of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> by placing less emphasis on outcome measurement and more emphasis on the process. Using New York University's Office of Community Service as a case study, we illustrate how a Zen approach can augment tangible measures to create a truly "balanced" organizational strategy. American firms have widely adopted the strict measurement practices of Japanese firms, but have largely not adopted the Eastern practice of Zen. A Zen approach fosters trust and provides flexibility that allows organizations to better achieve success in the long run...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} investment in research and innovation on Australian market sector productivity.

40|$|The recent {{movement}} in standards setting toward fair-value-based accounting beyond financial {{assets and liabilities}} calls for more empirical evidence on fair-value measurement, especially that of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> This article studies the initial valuation of goodwill and identifiable <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> after acquisitions. We find that the allocation of purchase price to goodwill and identifiable <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> {{is related to the}} economic determinants of the valuation. However, it is also significantly affected by managerial incentives arising from the differential treatments of goodwill and identifiable <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142. The same managerial discretions are not exhibited in the purchase price allocation prior to SFAS 142, when goodwill and <b>other</b> <b>intangibles</b> are both amortized. These findings suggest that unverifiable fair value measures are associated with the underlying economics but also deviate from the true values in the presence of management reporting incentives. Further analysis suggests that external appraisers constrain managerial discretion in <b>intangible</b> <b>asset</b> valuation to an extent but do not completely eliminate it.

The UK Investment in <b>Intangible</b> <b>Assets</b> Survey (IIA Survey) was launched in 2009 and explores the level of spending and life lengths of private sector investments in <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> The survey was discontinued following the 2010 survey. The survey is distinctive from <b>other</b> surveys measuring <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> such as the UK Innovation Survey (UK Data Archive SN 6699), in terms of three main features. First, the survey covers expenditure on {{a wider range of}} intangibles, including training, software, branding, design and business process. Second, the survey asks firms about both purchased and in-house expenditure. Third, in order to estimate depreciation rates, the survey also asks about the length of time firms expect to benefit from spending on intangibles. Firms with ten or more employees across the production and service sectors were drawn from the Inter-Departmental Business Register. The sample frame is broadly consistent with that of the UK Innovation Survey, but the sample size is considerably smaller. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. The third edition (May 2016) includes enhanced data files and documentation for 2009 and 2010. Main Topics : The survey set out to measure two main areas. First, the business' investment in the following six categories of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> split to reflect purchased and in-house investments: training software research and development design reputation and branding business process improvement The second area of the survey was to determine the lifetime benefit of each of the above categories of <b>intangible</b> <b>asset...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of fair value {{measurement}} by 228 listed companies in the UK and Australia {{around the time of}} adoption of IFRS from 1 January 2005. We test whether within and between country comparability in policy choices (as measured by T indices) has changed in relation to (a) mandatory and (b) optional use of fair value measurement. Mandatory requirements related to financial instruments (IAS 39) and share-based payments (IFRS 2) have increased comparability, with a weaker effect for biological assets (IAS 41). In relation to the optional use of fair value, comparability increased in relation to property (IAS 16) because some companies discontinued fair value measurement. Under IAS 39, the fair value option for other financial assets and other financial liabilities decreased comparability. Options to use fair value in <b>other</b> areas (<b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> plant and equipment and investment properties) are not generally taken up, either for on-going measurement or on IFRS adoption (under the 'deemed cost' option). The results suggest a conservative approach and/or lack of incentives to use fair value measurement for most companies.

40|$|While {{insights}} from business relationship literature indicate that relationships with {{suppliers and customers}} are key value drivers in many companies, there is little insight as to how their value is reflected in firms’ financial statements. Relationships can only be recognized as <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> when they are acquired, which is usually done through a business combination. To provide {{a better understanding of}} business relationships and how they are accounted for, we investigate possible determinants that could affect the probability of relationships being recognized in business combinations. Through logistic regression, we examine a sample of 516 business combinations by publicly traded American companies during the period 2001 - 2011. We find that the probability of allocation to these relationships is higher when the target firm operates in a high-tech industry, and that its pre-acquisition profit margin has a positive impact on the probability. Additionally, it is found that the likelihood of allocation to business relationships is greater after the implementation of a revised version of SFAS 141, and when the acquirer and target firm operates in different industries. We further find an interchange between allocation to supplier and customer relationships, and allocation to <b>other</b> identifiable <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> However, no indication is found that the post, through its interchange with goodwill is associated with accounting for certain incentives. The findings are of relevance to both relationship literature, financial accounting literature and standard setters as they are some of the first quantitative evidence of when customer and supplier relationships are recognized in business combinations.
