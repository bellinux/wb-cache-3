Streep's performance drew critical acclaim and earned her many award nominations, including her record-setting 14th Oscar bid, {{as well as}} the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.

5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{the revolt}} used pseudonyms, {{particularly}} in the letters sent {{around the country to}} encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|Knox was {{survived by}} his five {{children}} and his second wife. Nathaniel and Eleazar, his two sons by his first wife, attended St John's College, Cambridge. Nathaniel became a Fellow of St John's but died early in 1580. Eleazar was ordained into the Church of England and served in the parish of Clacton Magna. He also died young, and {{was buried in the}} chapel of St John's College in 1591. Knox's second wife, Margaret Stewart, got remarried to Andrew Ker, one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the murder of David Rizzio. Knox's three daughters also married: Martha to Alexander Fairlie; Margaret to Zachary Pont, son of Robert Pont and brother of Timothy Pont; and Elizabeth to John Welsh, a minister of the Kirk.|$|E

40|$|Radicalism and {{terrorism}} are often {{connected to a}} misconception of religion’s teachings. It emerges since one {{or a group of}} persons learn a religion’s teachings from wrong sources. In other words, they gain information form wrong persons or wrong literatures. Most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involve</b> <b>in</b> striking terror are youngsters for that education is then considered as one of solutions to prevent radicalism {{and terrorism}}. Thus this article proposes an alternative to avoid youngsters from the misconception of religion’s teachings by providing and selecting themes of teaching material that inform about truthful religion’s view on radicalism and terrorism...|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the rebels}} had urban backgrounds, and the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants. In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the urban poor, attempting to gain {{at the expense of}} the local elites. In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled. Other urban rebels were part of the elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds. In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.|$|E
5|$|The Ghadar Memorial Hall in San Francisco honours {{members of}} the party who were hanged {{following}} the Lahore conspiracy trial, and the Ghadar Party Memorial Hall in Jalandhar, Punjab commemorates the Ghadarites {{who were involved in}} the conspiracy.

The Ayurvedic Medicine College in Ludhiana is also named in his honour. The Indian government has produced stamps honouring several <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the conspiracy, including Har Dayal, Bhai Paramanand, and Rash Behari Bose. Several other revolutionaries are also honoured through India and the Indian American population.|$|E
5|$|The {{clock and}} {{carillon}} (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and carillon after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} the men {{galvanized}} the missionary effort in the United States, sparking an outpouring of funding for evangelization efforts around the world. Their work is still frequently remembered in evangelical publications, and in 2006 {{was the subject of}} the film production End of the Spear. Several years after the death of the men, the widow of Jim Elliot, Elisabeth, and the sister of Nate Saint, Rachel, returned to Ecuador as missionaries with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International) to live among the Huaorani. This eventually led to the conversion of many, including some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the killing. While largely eliminating tribal violence, their efforts exposed the tribe to increased influence from the outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} received significant {{media coverage}} in Norway, and Verdens Gang and Dagbladet devoted multiple cover stories to investigating the controversy. The media faced criticism for its extensive coverage of Ballo's death. Norway parliament member Inga Marte Thorkildsen commented {{that she thought}} indications were that Scientology {{had a role in}} Ballo's suicide. Psychologist Rudy Myrvang told Aftenposten that the Scientology personality test was designed to break down an individual; he characterized the test as a form of recruitment tool for the organization. Scientology critic Andreas Heldal-Lund stated parents <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> Scientology contacted him with similar concerns. The Norwegian Psychological Association warned individuals against taking such types of personality tests.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the revolt of 1381 were not represented in Parliament and {{were excluded from}} its decision-making. In a few cases the rebels were led or joined by relatively prosperous members of the gentry, such as Sir Roger Bacon in Norfolk. Some of them later {{claimed to have been}} forced to join the revolt by the rebels. Clergy also formed part of the revolt; as well as the more prominent leaders, such as John Ball or John Wrawe, nearly 20 are mentioned in the records of the revolt in the south-east. Some were pursuing local grievances, some were disadvantaged and suffering relative poverty, and others appear to have been motivated by strong radical beliefs.|$|E

5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the 1979–81 dig, {{archaeologist}} Steve Sherlock, {{decided to}} return to the site after aerial photographs revealed the presence of a rectangular Iron Age enclosure {{in the vicinity of the}} Bronze Age monuments. Initial excavations were carried out during ten days in September 2004. It was thought initially that the site was purely Iron Age or perhaps Romano-British. A more in-depth excavation was carried out in July 2005 after a geophysical survey revealed the existence of a large roundhouse, dating from the Iron Age, in the centre of the enclosure. The work revealed three roundhouses, several Iron Age ditches and a series of pits that were evidently graves. The latter came as a complete surprise and were found to date from the Anglo-Saxon period. Various artefacts dating to between 650 and 700AD were excavated but no bones were recovered, as the acidic soil had destroyed any organic material long ago. Thirty graves were found during the initial excavation.|$|E
5|$|In late March 2012, a US {{military}} official {{stated that the}} United States would have to use routes through the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) for supplies to Afghanistan if Pakistan refused to reopen its supply lines. However, he conceded the expensiveness of these routes and noted that negotiations with Pakistan regarding the possibility of opening of the supply routes were ongoing. After reviewing United States-Pakistan relations and outlining what was needed to repair bilateral relations, the Pakistani parliament turned the decision of reopening the NATO supply lines over to the government in April 2012. Due to an upcoming general election in Pakistan, with widespread anti-American sentiments in the country, the Pakistani government was reluctant to reopen the lines, and postponed its decision until the United States responded positively to Pakistani demands outlined in the parliamentary recommendations, such as a US apology for the November 2011 incident, the bringing <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the strike to justice, and a stop to US drone airstrikes. Talks between Pakistan and the United States failed in April 2012 after Pakistan could not get an unconditional apology from the United States for the November 2011 incident. The White House refused to apologise after Taliban attacks in Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan on 15 April 2012, which according to US military and intelligence officials came from the Haqqani network, an Afghan group working from a base in North Waziristan along the Afghanistan border in Pakistan's tribal belt. Pakistani officials said they cannot open the NATO supply routes in Afghanistan without a US apology.|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} the {{objective}} to design strategies that might improve the reading comprehension for children from seventh year of basic {{education of the}} "Unidad Educativa Experimental La Llama del Valle", located in Sangolquí Parish, Quito city.
