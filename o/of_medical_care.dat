5|$|Medical centers, dispensaries and {{hospitals}} are {{found throughout the}} island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access to medical care remains {{beyond the reach of}} many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers. In addition to the high expense <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000people and a total of 3,150doctors, 5,661nurses, 385community health workers, 175pharmacists and 57dentists for a population of 22million. 14.6percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30percent originated with international donors and other private sources. The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.|$|E

There is clear indication that China is moving towards a ‘prepaid’ system {{closely related to the}} HMO of the west. Decentralization <b>of</b> the <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> system administration has paved the way for a diversity of local experiments with different ways of reform, but the main direction is towards a integration <b>of</b> decisions over <b>medical</b> services and the insurance function. It is argued that reforms in this direction, while retaining a degree of socialization, will improve the efficiency and equity aspects <b>of</b> the Chinese <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> system...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine socio-demographic, lifestyle and health determinants of use <b>of</b> preventive <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> in Malaysia. Based on a cross-sectional survey conducted in Penang (Malaysia), logit models were used to analyse the likelihood <b>of</b> using preventive <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> Findings indicate age, ethnicity, marital status, history of serious family illnesses, education, income and self-rated health can affect the likelihood <b>of</b> using preventive <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> In particular, young individuals, ethnic Malays, the unmarried, individuals without history of serious family illnesses, the less educated, low income earners and individuals with self-rated fair/excellent health are unlikely to use preventive <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> Based on these findings, several population-based health policies targeted at increasing the use <b>of</b> preventive <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> are propose...|$|R
5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E
5|$|While the Progress Party {{dropped out}} of {{parliament}} altogether in 1977, it returned in the following 1981 parliamentary election with four representatives. In this election, the political right in general had a great upturn, which garnered the Progress Party increased support. The ideology of the party was sharpened in the 1980s, and the party officially declared {{that it was a}} libertarian party at its national convention in Sandefjord in 1983. Until then, the party had not had a clearly defined ideology. In the campaign for the 1985 parliamentary election the party attacked many aspects of the Norwegian welfare state, and campaigned for privatization <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care,</b> education and government-owned enterprises, as well as steep cuts in income tax. In the election, the party lost two of its four members of parliament, but was left with some power as they became the kingmaker. In May 1986, the party used this position to effectively throw the governing Conservative-led government after it had proposed to increase gas taxes. A minority Labour government was established as a result.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{mainstream}} medical ethics is biased by the assumption of a framework in which individuals are not free to contract with one another to provide whatever medical treatment is demanded, subject to the ability to pay.
