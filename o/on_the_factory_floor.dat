5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in Corning, New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of Corning Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a glassblower and sculptor in glass. In the latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing view at the time that glassblowing could only be done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor,</b> separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor</b> to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E

25|$|Frederick Winslow Taylor (March 20, 1856 – March 21, 1915) was an American {{mechanical}} engineer {{who sought to}} improve industrial efficiency. He {{was one of the}} first management consultants. Taylor was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and his ideas, broadly conceived, were highly influential in the Progressive Era (1890s-1920s). Taylor summed up his efficiency techniques in his 1911 book The Principles of Scientific Management, which in 2001 Fellows of the Academy of Management voted the most influential management book of the twentieth century. His pioneering work in applying engineering principles to the work done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor</b> was instrumental in the creation and development of the branch of engineering that is now known as industrial engineering. Taylor made his name in, and was most proud of his work in, scientific management; however, he made his fortune patenting steel-process improvements. Taylor was also an athlete who competed nationally in tennis and golf.|$|E
50|$|In September 1920, Mullard {{established}} the Mullard Radio Valve Company. The company moved to Hammersmith in 1921, {{followed by a}} move to Balham in 1923. Mullard ended up owning 6 factories. He said that all his money came from royalties from valves and other patents. In 1925, Mullard sold half the shares in the Mullard company to Philips, with {{the remainder of the}} company being acquired by Philips in 1927. Mullard remained as managing director of the Mullard company until his resignation in 1930.During the General Strike, workers in his Lancashire factory either walked or rode to work. None struck. Mullard was noted for spending a great deal of his working time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floors,</b> garnering information from his workers about improving methods of production. If workers were not performing well, they would receive two weeks holiday pay, and be expected to perform upon return. More senior management were give four weeks leave of absence.|$|R

2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor.</b> We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E

40|$|How would {{multinational}} apparel {{companies and}} retailers {{react to a}} requirement to disclose the identity and address of <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> in their global supply chain? Could disclosure regulation of this sort cause management changes {{that could lead to}} improved labor practices in those factories? Disclosure regulation is a common tool in the arsenal of so-called 2 ̆ 2 decentered 2 ̆ 2 regulatory strategies, which emphasize ways that law can be used to guide and influence the private development of behavioral norms that are consistent with the state 2 ̆ 7 s policy objectives. The author traces <b>the</b> history of <b>factory</b> disclosure, and theorizes that mandatory factory list disclosure introduces into the management system a new 2 ̆ 2 risk vims 2 ̆ 2 that companies will seek to manage through systems changes that can ultimately lead to improvements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floors.</b> To explore this theory, the author conducted extensive interviews with senior executives of Nike, Inc. and Levi-Strauss, two companies that recently released their global factory lists 2 ̆ 2 voluntarily 2 ̆ 2. The research indicates that these companies prepared extensively for the moment of disclosure by significantly improving and investing in their global labor practices monitoring and inspection systems. Neither company identified any negative business effects from <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> disclosure, but both emphasized that the disclosure had facilitated greater collaboration within the industry emphasizing shared strategies to improve supply chain labor practices. These outcomes are potentially useful in the straggle to improve labor practices. Therefore, <b>the</b> author proposes <b>factory</b> list disclosure regulation as an attainable and relatively subtle use of law that might nevertheless contribute in meaningful ways to the challenge of improving working conditions around the world...|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, after {{a lengthy}} strike, a long-running {{financial}} struggle, high legal expenses, {{and a lack of}} business interest among some of the Steinway family members, the firm was sold to CBS. At that time CBS owned many enterprises in the entertainment industry, including electric guitar and amplifier maker Fender, drum maker Rogers, electro-mechanical piano maker Rhodes, and the baseball team New York Yankees. CBS had plans to form a musical conglomerate that made and sold music in all forms and through all outlets, including records, radio, television, and musical instruments. This new conglomerate was evidently not as successful as CBS had expected, and Steinway was sold in 1985, along with classical and church organ maker Rodgers and flute and piccolo maker Gemeinhardt, to a group of Boston-area investors. In order to acquire Steinway, the investors founded the musical conglomerate Steinway Musical Properties. In 1995, Steinway Musical Properties merged with the Selmer Company to form the musical conglomerate Steinway Musical Instruments, which was named Company of the Year in 1996 by The Music Trades: [...] "As the industry's most recognized trademark Steinway & Sons is synonymous with piano quality worldwide ... Steinway's success has been hard-won <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floors</b> in Long Island City and Hamburg, Germany, and on retail showrooms around the world." [...] The award was given in recognition of Steinway's [...] "overall performance, quality, value-added products, a well-executed promotional program and disciplined distribution which generated the most impressive results in the entire music industry." [...] Steinway Musical Instruments acquired the flute manufacturer Emerson in 1997, the piano keyboard maker Kluge in 1998, and the Steinway Hall in Manhattan, New York City, in 1999. The conglomerate made more acquisitions in the following years. From 1996 to 2013, Steinway Musical Instruments was traded at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the abbreviation LVB, for Ludwig van Beethoven.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} current CSR {{activity}} on social responsibility <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floors</b> of suppliers {{for example in}} the developing countries seems to be marginal. The clothing and textile business is uniquely suited to addressing third-world issues because of its increasing reliance of outsourcing or purchasing. For companies, managing supplier relationships {{on a global scale}} presents particular challenges. A rich literature on CSR offers very limited practical guidance to corporate leaders, and is often very unclear. Objectives: This study examined what clothing and textile retail companies operating in a fast-paced fashion business aim to attain with integrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) in their global supply chain management. The main objectives of the study were to define the factors that have an influence on successful supply chain management that takes sustainability into account, and to understand CSR as a part of corporate strategy. To get a practical point of view, the other objectives of this study were to define some challenges clothing and textile retail companies face in managing global supply chains as well as define some CSR tools/ways of action for sustainable purchasing. Methodology: The empirical research was carried out based on a single-case study approach. The source of information was interviews. The interviews were conducted as personal in-depth interviews with selected respondents of the case company. The data used in this study were primary data and qualitative in nature. Findings: It was noted {{that there are so many}} factors that have an influence on successful supply chain management that it was impossible to list them all and that these factors are company-specific and also industry-specific. However, some broad guidelines were defined. The study summarized some factors that clothing and textile retail companies aim to attain when integrating corporate social responsibility in their global supply chain management. Also several challenges the companies face related to socially responsible purchasing were summarized and some common CSR tools/ways of action for sustainable purchasing were identified and discussed...|$|R

Elisabeth had maintained an ambiguous relationship with the porcelain entrepreneur Edward Eichler, who was also involved in the running of <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> from 1856 onwards. Some important events during this phase included: the new Saxon rhomb trademark was introduced; three large new furnaces for annealing and glost were built: and a new steam engine was purchased to operate <b>the</b> mill <b>on</b> <b>the</b> large <b>factory</b> <b>floor.</b> Other innovations and measures to modernise took place during this period, which was characterized by an ever-increasing degree of mechanisation of operations. An important element was the establishment of a railway line between Blankenhain and Weimar in 1887; this provided a major advantage for <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> which by that time had already been producing mainly large quantities of porcelain goods. So in 1879 with transport costing less and production numbers steadily increasing, sons Max and Karl Fasolt took over the running of the company.|$|R
