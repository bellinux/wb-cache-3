5|$|While Ferdinand {{kept the}} French occupied, Prussia {{had to contend}} with Sweden, Russia, and Austria, all of which wanted to carve <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> Prussia for themselves. Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was {{increasingly}} concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder river in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf, on 25 August 1758 a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army, but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had resulted in a draw. None of Prussia's enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia's heartland. The Austrian Feldmarshalleutnant Leopold Josef Graf Daun could have ended the war in October at Hochkirch, but he failed to follow up on his victory with a determined pursuit of Frederick's retreating army. This allowed Frederick time to recruit a new army over the winter.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the album's release, {{mainstream}} hip hop was dominated by West Coast hip hop. Enter the Wu-Tang (along with the critically acclaimed Illmatic and the commercial success of Ready to Die) was able to shift the emphasis away from the melodious, synthesizer-driven G-funk and restore interest into the East Coast hip hop scene. According to one columnist, [...] "When Enter the Wu-Tang: The 36 Chambers first graced the pages of rap lore in 1993, Dr. Dre's funk-filled, West Coast gangster rap dominated the business. Though this initial dominance was difficult to overcome, Wu-Tang still managed to carve <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> rap history." ...|$|E

She {{inspects}} his wound again and finds a lump moving along the man's spine; digging into the open wound, she pulls <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> a large worm.

2500|$|Once the tedding {{process had}} finished, the hay {{was made into}} a ruck. In Boho, {{depending}} on the moisture of the ground, it was traditional to place some branches on the ground or [...] old hay to stop the bottom of the new ruck getting wet. The ruck was constructed by two or three people pitching up hay to a person on top of the ruck (sometimes a child) who tramped the hay down so that it was compact. When the ruck was high enough, usually the height of the person pitching the hay plus the length of their pitchfork, somebody would pull out the bottom circumference of the ruck and pitch that hay up on top as well. Two hay ropes made with a twister were usually thrown {{over the top of the}} ruck at right angles to each other and secured by pulling <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> hay at the bottom of the ruck and making another short attachment, so that the ropes and the bottom of the ruck could be connected. After this was done, the ruck would be [...] "dressed" [...] by raking down the outside so that water would run off the top during the rain. The surrounding ground was raked for hay, which was transferred over to the next ruck.|$|E
