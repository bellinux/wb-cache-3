5|$|Gleason's theorem {{implies the}} nonexistence of {{certain types of}} hidden {{variable}} theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John von Neumann. Von Neumann had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made an assumption that quantum systems obeyed a form of additivity <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> for noncommuting operators that might not hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem {{could be used to}} remove this extra assumption from von Neumann's argument.|$|E
5|$|After Cristiano Ronaldo's {{transfer}} to Real Madrid in the 2009 close season, the weight <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> was on Nani {{to step up}} from bit part player and replace his compatriot. Nani's first contribution to United's new season was opening the scoring in the tenth minute of the 2009 FA Community Shield, but United eventually lost the match on penalties after a 2–2 draw. Nani suffered a dislocated shoulder during the match, which was originally expected {{to keep him out}} of the start of the season. He recovered in time to play 17 minutes for Portugal against Liechtenstein on 12 August, however, and started the match against Birmingham City on 16 August. Although he provided the assist for Wayne Rooney's winning goal in the 34th minute, Nani was replaced by Ryan Giggs at half-time. On 22 August, Nani scored his first league goal of the 2009–10 season, a free-kick against Wigan Athletic in a 0–5 away win.|$|E
5|$|Finale in {{moderate}} or fast tempo, and in sonata or rondo-sonata form. The {{themes of}} the finales are characterized by long passages of melody accompanied by relentless flowing rhythms. The exposition has no repeat written in. The development section is more ordinary in style {{than that of the}} first movement, with frequent modulations, sequences, and fragmentation of the exposition's first theme (or the main theme of the rondo). The recapitulation closely resembles the exposition, with the minimal harmonic changes needed to end the section in the tonic: the first theme returns in a shortened version; the second theme returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The coda is based on the exposition's first theme. It is composed of two parts, the first quiet and attenuated, creating a sense <b>of</b> <b>expectation,</b> the second animated, dissipating the final tension in decisive, agitated motion and ending with fortissimo tonic chords and octaves.|$|E

5|$|Now {{known as}} Takanohana, {{he was also}} the {{youngest}} ever to be promoted to ōzeki at 20years 5months. With the foreign born Akebono as sumo's only yokozuna, there was a great weight <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> on Takanohana to make the next step up. However, his lack of consistency, and Akebono's dominance, delayed his promotion to yokozuna. He won his third championship in May 1993, but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July, and even produced a make-koshi or losing score of 7–8 in November. In 1994, a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems, Takanohana won the January and May tournaments, but was then outshone by Musashimaru, who won in July with a perfect 15–0 record. After taking the September 1994 championship, Takanohana now had six top division titles, but none had been won consecutively. No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo's highest rank. The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament, but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority, the first time this had happened in twenty five years. They insisted that two consecutive championships were required, having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion. In November 1994, Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments, with his second consecutive unbeaten 15–0 score, and his promotion was confirmed. He had been at the ōzeki rank for 11 tournaments, or nearly two years. However, at 22years and 3months, he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{consumer}} expectations {{is a key}} {{to deliver}} superior services.

40|$|A {{violation}} <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> {{produces a}} prediction error, a learning signal by which organisms update current understanding and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>expectations.</b> The primary neural locus implicated in violations <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> is the ventral striatum (VS), which undergoes significant development during adolescence, a period marked by sensitivity and responsivity to social feedback and reward. The VS demonstrates increased activation for reward and reward prediction errors {{in this age}} group compared to other age groups. Importantly, the VS is also recruited when adolescents take risks and are in the presence of their peers. While a few studies have examined social violations <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> in adults, to our knowledge, none have examined social violations <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> in adolescents. The goal of this dissertation was to implement novel, ecologically valid designs to determine whether neural responses to realistic social feedback from a friend was associated with a common risky behavior, substance use, in adolescents. We found that adolescents recruited the VS for positive social violations <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> compared to negative violations <b>of</b> <b>expectations,</b> and were happiest when their social expectations were met (compared to positive or negative violations). We found that adolescents who recruited the VS more for violations <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> reported greater substance use, while adolescents who recruited the VS less for violations <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> reported lesser substance use, increased susceptibility to peer influence, and were more susceptible to peer influence in an experimental manipulation. Taken together, this body of work suggests adolescents who are more attuned to social cues from peers (and are likely to modify their behaviors in response) require smaller expectancy violations to experience reward; while those who engage in increased social risk taking require greater expectancy violations by comparison to experience reward. Implications of this work are discussed with regard to determining which adolescents are most likely to take greater social (substance use) risks, based on their VS response to social violations <b>of</b> <b>expectations...</b>|$|R

It was unearthed in January 1934 after years <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> {{as to whether}} Dura would reveal traces of the Roman Mithras cult. The earliest archaeological traces found within the temple are from between AD 168 and 171, which coincides {{with the arrival of}} Lucius Verus and his troops. At this stage it was still a room in a private home. It was extended and renovated between 209 and 211, and most of the frescoes are from this period. The tabula ansata of 210 offers salutation to Septimus Severus, Caracalla and Geta. The construction was managed by a centurio principe praepositus of the legio IIII Scythicae et XVI Flaviae firmae (CIMRM 53), and it seems that construction was done by imperial troops. The mithraeum was enlarged again in 240, but in 256—with war with Sassanians looming—the sanctuary was filled in and became part of the strengthened fortifications. Following excavations, the temple was transported in pieces to New Haven, Connecticut, where it was rebuilt (and is now on display) at the Yale University Art Gallery.|$|E

500|$|By the 1950s Hordern {{had come}} to the notice of many {{influential}} directors. In his autobiography, the actor recognised the decade as being an important era of his career.

The writer T. C. Worsley was impressed by Hordern's performance and wrote: [...] "Perhaps an actor with star quality might have imposed on us more successfully than Mr Michael Hordern, and won our sympathy for Ivanov by his own personality. But such a performance would have raised the level <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> all round. As it is, Mr Hordern is rich in intelligence, sensitivity and grasp, and with very few exceptions, the company give his impressive playing the right kind of support." [...] The title character in Macbeth, directed by Alec Clunes, was Hordern's next engagement. Critics wrote of their dislike of Clunes's version, but the theatre reviewer Audrey Williamson singled out Hordern's performance as being [...] "deeply moving".|$|E
