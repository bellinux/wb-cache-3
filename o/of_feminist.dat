5|$|Feminist {{activists have}} {{established}} a range <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> businesses, including women's bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants.

5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E

5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> psychologists on the discipline.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theology}} {{is a movement}} that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> theology include increasing {{the role of women}} among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views of}} {{pornography}} range from condemnation of pornography {{as a form}} of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> expression. Feminists' views on prostitution vary, but many of these perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of prostitution and sex work.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{feminism}} {{is a movement}} that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> movements throughout their history.|$|E
5|$|Opinions on the sex {{industry}} are diverse. Feminists critical of the {{sex industry}} generally {{see it as the}} exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of {{the sex industry}} argue that it can be a medium <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality.|$|E

5|$|Supported by {{formation}} of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) in 1972, gender-based critiques of traditional economics appeared in the 1970s and 80s. The subsequent emergence of Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) and the 1992 founding of the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) along with its journal Feminist Economics in 1994 encouraged the rapid growth <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> economics.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of the {{clitoris}} was alluded to by Masters and Johnson in 1966, but in such a muddled fashion that the significance of their description became obscured; in 1981, the Federation <b>of</b> <b>Feminist</b> Women's Health Clinics (FFWHC) continued this process with anatomically precise illustrations identifying 18 structures of the clitoris. Despite the FFWHC's illustrations, Josephine Lowndes Sevely, in 1987, described the vagina as more of the counterpart of the penis.|$|E

50|$|Cyberfeminism {{is used to}} {{describe}} the philosophies <b>of</b> a contemporary <b>feminist</b> community whose interests are cyberspace, the Internet and technology.

5|$|An early {{version of}} the modern {{self-help}} book, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was {{an explosion in the}} number of conduct books published {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published Thoughts. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> literary criticism in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is a branch <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> theology {{which seeks to}} interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

5|$|Female {{friendship}}s {{are central}} to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, {{but it is the}} friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman {{is one of the first}} moments in the history <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{movements}} have campaigned {{and continue to}} campaign for women's rights, {{including the right to}} vote, to hold public office, to work, to earn fair wages or equal pay, to own property, to receive education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage, and to have maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to promote bodily autonomy and integrity, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> movements.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much <b>of</b> <b>feminist</b> theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E

40|$|This article takes a {{critical}} look at the research methodologies regarding gender-based violence and HIV and AIDS in South Africa {{over the last two}} decades. Gender has become the operative term in these research projects {{and there has been a}} conflation or collapse of gender with the feminist perspectives analysis. The immediate question is whether the studies on gender and masculinities have de-politiced feminist research and methodologies or whether it has enhanced the work <b>of</b> <b>feminists.</b> This is undoubtedly a loaded argument that has been on the minds <b>of</b> <b>feminists</b> and those who claim to support feminist theory and praxis...|$|R
