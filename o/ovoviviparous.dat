5|$|Aquarists {{commonly}} {{refer to}} <b>ovoviviparous</b> and viviparous fish as livebearers.|$|E
5|$|In <b>ovoviviparous</b> {{fish the}} eggs develop inside the mother's body after {{internal}} fertilization but receive {{little or no}} nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the yolk. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of <b>ovoviviparous</b> fish include guppies, angel sharks, and coelacanths.|$|E
5|$|Among {{many other}} things, he gave {{accurate}} {{descriptions of the}} four-chambered stomachs of ruminants, and of the <b>ovoviviparous</b> embryological development of the dogfish. His accounts of about 35 animals are sufficiently detailed to convince biologists that he dissected those species, indeed vivisecting some; he mentions the internal anatomy of roughly 110 animals in total.|$|E
5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the mackerel sharks. They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and <b>ovoviviparous</b> reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|E
5|$|The female usually {{attaches}} the egg {{case to a}} substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective crevice, or {{carries it}} about until just before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are <b>ovoviviparous,</b> keeping the eggs inside their body, with or without an egg case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, is fully viviparous.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are <b>ovoviviparous.</b> The eggs of <b>ovoviviparous</b> animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E
5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is <b>ovoviviparous,</b> with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E
5|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} basal fish with {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set {{on the underside of the}} head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are <b>ovoviviparous</b> and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted eagle}} ray (Aetobatus narinari) is a {{cartilaginous}} fish of the eagle ray family, Myliobatidae. As traditionally recognized, it is found globally in tropical regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Recent authorities have restricted it to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with other populations recognized as the ocellated eagle ray (A. ocellatus) and Pacific white-{{spotted eagle ray}} (A. laticeps). Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen alone, but occasionally swim in groups. They are <b>ovoviviparous,</b> the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} <b>ovoviviparous,</b> with females {{giving birth to}} one to 16 live young and {{possibly}} as many as 20. However, litters of six to eight are the most common. Neonates are 22–35cm in length (excluding runts), with the largest being A. p. conanti and A. p. leucostoma the smallest. If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available, growth is rapid and females may reproduce at {{less than three years}} of age and a total length of as little as 60cm. The young are born in August or September, while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year, at least in certain parts of its range.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be <b>ovoviviparous.</b> In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the great white shark's mating habits. It is {{possible}} that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating. Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are <b>ovoviviparous,</b> which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer. The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez, as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have caught them and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches.|$|E
5|$|Young velvet bellies feed {{mainly on}} krill and small bony fish, {{transitioning}} to squid and shrimp {{as they grow}} larger. There is evidence that individuals also move into deeper water as they age. This species exhibits a number of adaptations to living in the deep sea, such as specialized T-cells and liver proteins {{for dealing with the}} higher concentrations of heavy metals found there. Velvet bellies often carry a heavy parasite load. It is <b>ovoviviparous,</b> giving birth to litters of six to 20 young every two to three years. This species has virtually no commercial value, but large numbers are caught as bycatch in deepwater commercial fisheries. Although it has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the heavy fishing pressure throughout its range and its slow reproductive rate are raising conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae are aquatic, {{with six}} pairs of {{tracheal}} gills {{on the underside}} of the abdomen. The eggs are laid above water on emergent twigs or vegetation or on the water surface although females of some species enter water to choose sites. Although most species lay eggs, a few in the genus Triplectides are <b>ovoviviparous.</b> Some species lay eggs on land and although most are associated with freshwater, a few like Symphitoneuria are found in coastal saline water. Philanisus plebeius females lay their eggs into the coelomic cavity of intertidal starfish. The larvae are long and roughly cylindrical, very similar to those of lepidoptera but lacking prolegs. In case-bearing species, the heads are heavily sclerotinised while the abdomen is soft; the antennae are short and the mouthparts adapted for biting. Each of the usually ten abdominal segments bears a pair of legs with a single tarsal joint. In case-bearing species, the first segment bears three papillae, one above and two at the sides, which anchor the larva centrally in the tube. The posterior segment bears a pair of hooks for grappling. There are five to seven larval instars, followed by an aquatic pupa which has functional mandibles (to cut through the case), gills, and swimming legs.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of {{amphibians}} {{are typically}} laid {{in water and}} hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) {{and some of the}} African live-bearing toads (Nectophrynoides spp.) are viviparous. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are <b>ovoviviparous.</b> The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species. The toad genus Nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} neotype, other fossils are known of Scelidosaurus. In 1888 Lydekker catalogued {{a large number}} of single bones, largely limb elements, and osteoderms, that had been {{acquired}} by the BMNH from the Norris collection. Owen in 1861 described a second, partial, skeleton of a juvenile animal, that later was added to the collection of Elizabeth Philpot and today is registered in the Lyme Regis Museum as specimen LYMPH 1997.37.4-10. As it was relatively large, Owen speculated, in the context of its presumed marine lifestyle, that Scelidosaurus might have been <b>ovoviviparous.</b> The short prepubis in this specimen convinced scientists that this process did not represent the main pubic body as some had thought, who had been unable to believe that the thin, backward-pointing, pubis with the Ornithischia was homologous to the forward-pointing much larger pubic bone in most reptilian groups. In more recent times, new discoveries have been made at Charmouth, not through commercial quarrying but by the efforts of amateur palaeontologists. In 1968 a second partial juvenile skeleton was described, specimen BMNH R6704, that had already been reported in 1959. Found by geologist James Frederick Jackson (1894-1966) of Charmouth, it is from a slightly younger layer, the Stonebarrow Marl Member dating to the early Pliensbachian, about 190 million years old. In 1985 Simon Barnsley, David Costain and Peter Langham excavated a partial skeleton including a very complete skull and skin impressions, which was sold to the Bristol Museum where it is registered as specimen BRSMG CE12785. Specimen CAMSMX.39256 is part of the collection of the Sedgwick Museum at Cambridge. Several specimens remain undescribed because they are in private collections. These include a two metres (7ft) long skeleton found by David Sole in 2000, perhaps the most complete non-avian dinosaur exemplar ever discovered in the British Isles. All elements of the skeleton are now known. The finds by Sole differ from the neotype in details of the armour and might represent a separate taxon or reflect sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|Reproduction is <b>ovoviviparous,</b> {{meaning that}} the young sharks develop in eggs that remain within the mother's body until they hatch.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle gave {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants, and of the <b>ovoviviparous</b> embryological development of the hound shark Mustelus mustelus.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{many other}} snakes, vipers often appear rather sluggish. Most are <b>ovoviviparous,</b> giving birth to live young, but a few lay eggs.|$|E
25|$|However, {{some fish}} {{do not fit}} these categories. The livebearing largespring gambusia (Gambusia geiseri) {{was thought to be}} <b>ovoviviparous</b> until it was shown in 2001 that the embryos {{received}} nutrients from the mother.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids usually lay yolky eggs, which hatch into immatures that {{resemble}} adults. Scorpions, however, are either <b>ovoviviparous</b> or viviparous, depending on species, and bear live young. In most arachnids only the females provide parental care, with harvestmen {{being one of}} the few exceptions.|$|E
25|$|This genus is <b>ovoviviparous,</b> {{giving birth}} to live young. The basic {{lifecycle}} of many Nearctic species {{has been known for}} quite some time. Females at an age of 26 months undergo vitellogenesis as they enter their third hibernation, mate the following spring, and give birth later in September or October.|$|E
25|$|Mating is {{followed}} by a gestation period that lasts about six to seven months. The species is <b>ovoviviparous,</b> with females giving birth to live young. Litters usually consists of 20 to 40 offspring, although as many as 100 may be produced. After giving birth, females may lose up to half their weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of E. carinatus in India is <b>ovoviviparous.</b> In northern India, mating {{takes place in}} the winter with live young being born from April through August. Occasionally, births have also been recorded in other months. A litter usually consists of 3 to 15 young that are 115–152mm in length. Mallow et al. (2003) mention a maximum litter size of 23.|$|E
25|$|Eggs may be embryonated or unembryonated when {{passed by}} the female, meaning their fertilized eggs may not yet be developed. A few species {{are known to be}} <b>ovoviviparous.</b> The eggs are {{protected}} by an outer shell, secreted by the uterus. In free-living roundworms, the eggs hatch into larvae, which appear essentially identical to the adults, except for an underdeveloped reproductive system; in parasitic roundworms, the life cycle is often much more complicated.|$|E
25|$|Anecdotal {{reports and}} {{observations}} {{suggest that in}} KwaZulu-Natal the indigenous thiarid Melanoides tuberculata is becoming less common and pressure from the spread of Tarebia granifera, particularly at high densities, is a possible explanation. Like Tarebia granifera, Melanoides tuberculata is parthenogenetic and <b>ovoviviparous,</b> grows to a similar size, are similar in size at first birth and juvenile output. Data from several habitats where the species occur sympatrically show however that in all such situations Tarebia granifera becomes numerically dominant.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of species are ovoviviparous: the medium-sized eggs, encased {{only by a}} double membrane, remain in the uterus. The embryos do not receive food directly from the mother, but are supplied instead by the moderate quantity of yolk contained in the eggs—they are therefore described as lecithotrophic. The young emerge from the eggs {{only a short time}} before birth. This probably represents the velvet worm's original mode of reproduction, i.e., both oviparous and viviparous species developed from <b>ovoviviparous</b> species.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} snake are <b>ovoviviparous</b> and retain the eggs within their bodies {{until they are}} almost ready to hatch. Recently, it has been {{confirmed}} that several species of snake are fully viviparous, such as the boa constrictor and green anaconda, nourishing their young through a placenta {{as well as a}} yolk sac, which is highly unusual among reptiles, or anything else outside of requiem sharks or placental mammals. Retention of eggs and live birth are most often associated with colder environments.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Belgian {{ichthyologist}} Max Poll {{published a}} report on sharks and chimaeras captured during a 194849 Belgian oceanographic expedition off western Africa, including several seemingly <b>ovoviviparous</b> blackmouth catsharks (G. melastomus). As the blackmouth catshark {{is known to be}} oviparous, Poll's account alerted French zoologist Jean Cadenat to the presence of a distinct catshark species in the region. After examining more specimens from Senegal, Cadenat described the new species in a 1959 issue of the scientific journal Bulletin de l'Institut Francais d'Afrique Noire (Sér A) Sciences Naturelles, naming it in Poll's honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} African {{frilled shark}} (Chlamydoselachus africana) is {{a species of}} shark in the family Chlamydoselachidae, described in 2009. It {{is found in the}} deep waters off southern Angola to southern Namibia. This species is difficult to distinguish from the better-known frilled shark (C. anguineus), but is smaller at maturity and differs in several proportional measurements including head length and mouth width. It seems to be a specialized predator of smaller sharks, using its flexible jaws and numerous needle-like, recurved teeth to capture and swallow them whole. Reproduction is presumably <b>ovoviviparous,</b> as with the other member of its family.|$|E
25|$|It is {{dioecious}} (it has {{two distinct}} sexes), iteroparous (reproducing {{more than once}} in a lifetime) and <b>ovoviviparous,</b> laying eggs singly in albumen-filled capsules. Females generally brood eggs for 9–10 months. Fecundity is generally between 4 and 81 young per female, but on average is closer to 11 young/female. Females can brood more than one batch of young at a time, and the number of young in one brood is positively related {{to the size of the}} female. Reproductive females are usually larger than 16mm. Female banded mystery snails live 28 – 48 and males live 18 – 36 months.|$|E
25|$|Tarebia granifera is both {{parthenogenetic}} and <b>ovoviviparous,</b> although {{males have}} been reported. These are characteristics which are undoubtedly key to its success as an invader. For example no males {{have been found}} amongst hundreds dissected from KwaZulu-Natal, {{it is probable that}} a few are present. Males were found in most (6/7) populations examined in Puerto Rico but were generally uncommon at up to 22.7% of the population (mean 4.6%). Live sperm were present in the testes of these males but the genitalia were apparently non-functional. R. Tucker Abbott (1952) failed to find sperm in the gonads of male Tarebia granifera from Florida. Most Tarebia granifera are therefore clones of the female parent.|$|E
25|$|S. haemorrhoidalis {{is hardly}} ever used in {{forensic}} investigations, {{due to its}} global distribution {{and the fact that}} little is known about them. Usually, other more researched flies and beetles, if present on the body, take precedence. The fly has a pupation time ranging from 93 hours to 153 hours. Development from larvae to adult can range from 252 to 802 hours. Knowing the pupation and life cycle times of S. haemorrhoidalis and taking into consideration that this species is <b>ovoviviparous</b> allows investigators to calculate how long the fly has been on the corpse. If time of colonization of the corpse by maggots is known, it can help determine the PMI, or post-mortem interval.|$|E
25|$|Female queen snakes will {{be fully}} sexually mature at three years of age, males at two years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring and autumn months. If mating was in the autumn, the female can delay giving birth till spring, storing the energy she will need through the months that she will be in a period of brumation. This snake is <b>ovoviviparous,</b> the female giving birth to live young after {{carrying}} the eggs within her body. This differs from oviparous and viviparous snakes. Litter size can vary from 5 to 20, and the time for an individual birth is from 1.5 to 2.5 minutes. Time between individual births is 4 minutes to 1 hour, with the average time being 11 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of species in the class Arachnida, which are oviparous, scorpions seem to be universally <b>ovoviviparous.</b> The young are born one by one after hatching and expelling the embryonic membrane, if any, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one moult. Before the first moult, scorplings cannot survive naturally without the mother, since they depend on her for protection and to regulate their moisture levels. Especially in species that display more advanced sociability (e.g. Pandinus spp.), the young/mother association can continue {{for an extended period}} of time. The size of the litter depends on the species and environmental factors, and can range from two to over a hundred scorplings. The average litter however, consists of around 8 scorplings.|$|E
25|$|All {{members of}} the family Sarcophagidae are larviparous or <b>ovoviviparous.</b> Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) gives live birth to larvae with the female {{retaining}} the egg case in her abdomen. Flesh flies are strongly attracted to carrion or dry flesh. The female has a strong desire to lay larvae on the flesh and have even been noted to larviposit on the sleeve of a garment that has been previously soiled with blood. Oldroyd states that the larvae of Sarcophaga spp are voracious and will take anything of animal origin be it alive or dead. A larva is forced out of the larvipositor usually head first and soon disappears into the food material. Once larvae are deposited as 1st stage instars, rapid development follows with 3rd instars usually being achieved by three to four days. Larviposition to adulthood generally takes around two weeks.|$|E
