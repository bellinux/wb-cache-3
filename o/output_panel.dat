Generally speaking, a bank’s cost efficiency would be improved if the bank mergers happened between banks with different culture backgrounds. On the other hand, if the mergers happened between homogeneous banks, there would be little financial innovation and the cost efficiency would be unsubstantially improved. Another finding is that small banks have superior performance than larger banks in Taiwan. Also, efficiency would seem to dictate against merger mania. Copyright Springer 2005...|$|E

40|$|A {{sustainable}} energy supply {{is required in}} Malaysia to meet the increasing electricity demand with rapid growing in population and economy. Photovoltaic solar panel is most suitable alternative way to generate electricity in Malaysia where most of its location receives large number of solar radiation throughout the year. However, fixed solar panel is more preferred than tracking panel because it is cost effective. In present work, the power output and efficiency of single-axis tracking solar panel is compared with fixed solar panel by experimentally in East Coast Malaysia. A single-axis tracking panel produces higher power <b>output</b> than fixed <b>panel</b> up to 28 W. During this time, the average efficiency of tracking panel was about 66. 70 % and fixed panel was 39. 96 %. Hence, the percentage increment on average power <b>output</b> using tracking <b>panel</b> reached up to 66. 92 % compare to fixed panel during this period. The tracking panel module efficiency was higher than fixed panel {{for the same period}} and can reach up to 28. 9 % at 6. 00 p. m. In conclusion, single-axis tracking panel is more efficient than fixed panel in premeridian and postmeridian. Thus, it produces higher power <b>output</b> than fixed <b>panel</b> which means it utilize the most of available solar radiation effectively and this will reduce payback period of the initial investment cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of solar irradiance {{with a high}} ramp-rate, caused by cloud passing, can create fluctuation in the PV output. In a weak distribution grid with a high PV penetration, this can create significant voltage fluctuations. Energy storage devices are used to smooth out the fluctuation using traditional moving average control. However, moving average does not control the ramp-rate directly; rather the ramp-rate depends on previous values of PV output. This paper proposes a strategy where the ramp-rate of PV <b>panel</b> <b>output</b> is used to control the PV inverter ramp-rate to a desired level by deploying energy storage (which can be available for other purposes, such as storing surplus power, countering voltage rise, etc.). During the ramping event, the desired ramp-rate is governed by controlling the energy storage based on an inverse relationship with the PV <b>panel</b> <b>output</b> ramp-rate to improve the fluctuation mitigation performance. In contrast to the moving average method, the proposed strategy is {{able to control the}} desired ramp-rate independent of the past history of the PV <b>panel</b> <b>output.</b> A dynamic model of the PV-storage integrated system is developed to verify the proposed strategy in the presence of physical device time lags.
