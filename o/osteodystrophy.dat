5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary <b>osteodystrophy.</b> Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E

40|$|We {{realized}} {{an exhaustive}} {{review of literature}} concerning traumatic and micro-traumatic lesions of the ankle and foot in sporting children. These pathologies are on the increase due to considering the development of sports activities. They are often considered as benign whereas they require an adequate diagnosis followed by adequate treatment. We thus described the 4 groups of pathologies of the ankle and foot in sporting children: <b>osteodystrophies</b> (disease of Sever, Köhler-Mouchet, Renander, Freiberg, Panner and Iselin), talar diseases (osteochondritis dissecans and osteochondral fractures), sprained ankles (benign, medium and serious) and supernumerary ossifications.

40|$|X-ray {{images of}} the teeth and jaws are {{required}} {{for a variety of}} diagnostic purposes to supplement a clinical examination, and are invaluable for providing pictorial information about the structures that cannot be examined with direct vision. They can be acquired using traditional film systems which produce analogue images, or using a variety of alternative image receptors which result in a digital image. Irrespective of the method of image acquisition they are utilised by the dental surgeon in order to benefit their patients’ management. Numerous disease processes can affect the teeth and jaws, in addition to a range of developmental abnormalities. These can be classified according to a radiological sieve, which also includes artefactual and iatrogenic features. The key components of the classification are: developmental, inflammatory, traumatic, cystic, neoplastic, <b>osteodystrophies</b> and systemic disorders. This paper will utilise examples of radiographic images of patients to illustrate components of this classification which are unique to the teeth and jaws...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess whether}} {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH) has {{any effect on}} bone aluminium (A 1) accumulation, we evaluated the relationship between bone quantitative histomorphometry and bone A 1 content in 25 dialysis patients with clinical features of secondary hyperparathyroidism. By means of bone biopsy, patients were classified as showing predominant hyperparathyroidism in 17 cases and mixed lesions in 8. The A 1 burden was low, judging from the dialysate A 1 and the oral A 1 assumption. Bone A 1 content and serum A 1 levels were higher than normal in both groups, particularly so in the patients with predominant hyperparathyroidism. Significant positive correlations were found between bone indexes of hyperparathyroidism and bone A 1 content. Moreover, bone and serum A 1 concentrations were directly related. Aluminium staining appeared faintly positive only in a minority of bone samples, and was mainly localized at the neutral bone surfaces. We conclude that in dialysis <b>osteodystrophies</b> with features of secondary hyperparathyroidism and in a clinical setting characterized by low-grade A 1 burden, PTH may favour A 1 accumulation into the bone...|$|R
25|$|Hypertrophic <b>osteodystrophy</b> is a bone {{disease in}} rapidly growing large breed dogs. Signs include {{swelling}} of the metaphysis (the part of the bone adjacent to the joint), pain, depression, loss of appetite, and fever. The disease is usually bilateral in the limb bones.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic diseases, such as renal <b>osteodystrophy,</b> produce widening, while {{ochronosis}} {{results in}} calcific deposits in the symphysis. Inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, result in bony fusion of the symphysis. Osteitis pubis, {{the most common}} inflammatory disease in this area, is treated with anti-inflammatory medication and rest. Degenerative joint disease of the symphysis, which can cause groin pain, results from instability or from abnormal pelvic mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{radiography}} is useful, both {{by itself}} and {{in conjunction with}} CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass; pre-osteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or for follow-up examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renal <b>osteodystrophy.</b> However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires {{a substantial amount of}} bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.|$|E
40|$|Nutritional {{assessment}} of American Negro (Black) individuals of largely-African ancestry {{is complicated by}} differences that transcend socioeconomic status (SES). These include smaller size at birth but greater size from 2 to 14 years, advanced skeletal development ("bone age"), advanced dental development, a larger skeletal mass and bone "density" and a lesser rate of adult bone loss in the Black female from age 40 on as shown {{in a variety of}} bone-losing situtations, including renal <b>osteodystrophies.</b> Thus, appropriate dimensional and radiographic and radiogrammetric measures must be employed. Differences in hemoglobin concentration approximating 1. 0 g/ 100 ml and in hematocrit levels also indicate the need for population-specific standards, otherwise gross errors will be made in calculating the per cent "deficient" and "low". Since self-assignments to racial categories are commonly used, the problem of racial identification is minimal. Failure to employ appropriate standards will result in underestimating the dimensional, radiographic and radiogrammetric effects of undernutrition in Blacks after the 2 nd year, underestimating adult bone loss to a large degree, but overestimating the severity of hematologic responses from the 1 st year through the 9 th decade...|$|R
40|$|Osteochondritis dissecans {{is a very}} {{uncommon}} {{phenomenon in}} osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). A 14 -year-old boy, affected by OI and followed in our Center for Congenital <b>Osteodystrophies,</b> had a knee trauma and MRI indicated a hollowed area of 2. 5 × 1. 5 [*]cm in the lateral femoral condyle, which was classified as grade III. The patient underwent surgery, performed as a one-step surgical treatment: the osteochondral fragment was removed, curettage of lesion's bottom was performed, and a biphasic scaffold was used to fill the defect, implanted with a press-fit technique. MRI at 12 and 24 months after surgery showed scaffold integration. At the final follow-up, the patient did not feel any pain or articular limitations. It is difficult to provide a guideline on osteochondritis dissecans in patients affected by OI {{because of the lack}} of literature reports on this rare disorder in a rare disease. According to our experience, in these patients, osteosynthesis of the bone fragment and the use of autograft are not recommended because of the patient's bone weakness and osteoporosis. Moreover, compared with two-step surgery, one-step surgery is preferred to reduce the risk related to anesthesia, often observed to be higher in these patients...|$|R

One study analyzed the nutritional content of three homemade diets (BARF, Ultimate and Volhard) and two commercial raw food diets (Steve's Real Food and Sojourner Farms) and compared it to the AAFCO standards, showing nutritional imbalances in the homemade diets. Three of the diets had abnormal calcium-to-phosphorus ratios {{which can lead to}} hyperparathyroidism and fibrous <b>osteodystrophy</b> in puppies.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{progressive}} loss in kidney function {{over a period}} of months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are not specific, and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite. Often, chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a bloodline relative with CKD. This disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as cardiovascular disease, anemia, pericarditis or renal <b>osteodystrophy</b> (the latter included in the novel term CKD-MBD). CKD is a long-term form of kidney disease; thus, it is differentiated from acute kidney disease (acute kidney injury) in that the reduction in kidney function must be present for over 3 months. CKD is an internationally recognized public health problem affecting 5–10% of the world population.|$|E
500|$|OFC is {{a common}} {{presentation}} of renal <b>osteodystrophy,</b> which is a term {{used to refer to}} the skeletal complications of [...] end stage renal disease (ESRD). OFC occurs in approximately 50% of patients with ESRD. [...] ESRD occurs when the kidneys fail to produce calcitriol, a form of Vitamin D, which assists in the absorption of calcium into the bones. When calcitriol levels decrease, parathyroid hormone levels increase, halting the storage of calcium, and instead triggering its removal from the bones. The concept of renal <b>osteodystrophy</b> is currently included into the broader term chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).|$|E
500|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica ( [...] ), is a {{skeletal}} disorder {{resulting in}} a loss of bone mass, a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue (peritrabecular fibrosis), and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known as osteitis fibrosa, osteodystrophia fibrosa, and von Recklinghausen's disease of bone (not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease, neurofibromatosis type I), is caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus of parathyroid hormone from over-active parathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal <b>osteodystrophy.</b> Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.|$|E

2500|$|Hypocalcemia, due to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 {{deficiency}} (caused by {{stimulation of}} FGF-23 and reduction of renal mass), {{and resistance to}} the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone. Osteocytes {{are responsible for the}} increased production of FGF-23, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3). Later, this progresses to secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal <b>osteodystrophy,</b> and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function. An extreme consequence is the occurrence of the rare condition named calciphylaxis.|$|E
2500|$|Nephrology (from Greek nephros [...] "kidney", {{combined}} with the suffix -logy, [...] "the study of") is a specialty of medicine and pediatrics that concerns itself with the kidneys: the study of normal kidney function and kidney problems, the preservation of kidney health, and the treatment of kidney problems, from diet and medication to [...] renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation). Systemic conditions that affect the kidneys (such as diabetes and autoimmune disease) and systemic problems that occur {{as a result of}} kidney problems (such as renal <b>osteodystrophy</b> and hypertension) are also studied in nephrology.
