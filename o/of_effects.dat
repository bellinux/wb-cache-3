In fact, tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties, especially from flooding and landslides.|$|E

Since Max Payne, the polygon count (the number of polygons rendered per frame) has been increased, which smooths out the edges of character models. In addition, characters have a much greater range of expressions. Previously, Max had only one expression available; in Max Payne 2, he often smirks and moves his eyebrows to react to different scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity. Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing many different types <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E

Guardian souls provide continuous effects, including transforming into mythical creatures and summoning familiars. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Enchant souls are continuously active so long as they are equipped, and provide increases in statistics or other innate abilities—such as the ability to walk on water. Ability souls give the player innate abilities, which are often required to traverse certain areas of the castle. Because the souls are automatically activated and stay active unless the player specifically disables them, they do not consume magic points.|$|E
