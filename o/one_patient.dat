5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with <b>one</b> <b>patient</b> suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume {{necessary for a}} patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The gene TGFBR2 {{has been}} implicated in several {{connective}} tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A study of patients with SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of Marfan syndrome {{has been found in}} 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 has been documented in these CSF-leak patients, but only <b>one</b> <b>patient</b> demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome.|$|E

25|$|In 2002 a small {{outbreak}} of systemic E. dermatitidis infection occurred in North Carolina hospitals, involving five women who received steroid injections for pain management. In one of women the infection wasn't evident until 152 days after injection of the contaminated solution. Isolates from these patients were {{found by the}} FDA to be susceptible to all of voriconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B. In <b>one</b> <b>patient</b> the infection caused sacroiliitis, while the remaining four developed meningitis. Meningitis eventually caused death in <b>one</b> <b>patient,</b> while voriconazole was successful in treating infection in the four other patients. The outbreak was traced back to a single compounding pharmacy, which was found by the FDA to have inadequately controlled for sterility of its products.|$|E

25|$|The North Wales Hospital, Denbigh: Leucotomy was {{introduced}} in 1942.

25|$|Equipment {{failure is}} one {{possible}} type of accident.

Thirty <b>one</b> <b>patients</b> (34 %) had anti E. h. antibody titres of > 1 : 80. Among them eight patients (9 %) had acute infection.

40|$|The {{need for}} early {{ambulation}} for caring of the neonate by mothers makes postoperative pain management after cesarean delivery unique. Favorable {{results have been}} observed with buprenorphine, clonidine and bupivacaine as epidural analgesics. This prospective, randomised triple blind control study was carried out among 112 lower segment caesarean segment (LSCS) patients, divided into three groups, to assess the analgesic efficacy and side effects of epidural analgesia, with an intermittent top up of (i) bupivacaine (0. 125 %) and buprenorphine (0. 075 mg) (ii) bupivacaine (0. 125 %) and clonidine (37. 5 microgram) and (iii) bupivacaine (0. 125 %) alone, in LSCS cases. The demographic characteristics (age, weight and height) {{of the three groups}} were comparable and the differences were not statistically significant. The mean duration of the analgesia was significantly longer in the group <b>one</b> <b>patients</b> receiving buprenorphine plus bupivacaine (690 ± 35 minutes) and it was lowest in group three patients receiving bupivacaine (170 ± 31 minutes) alone. The mean highest pain score (VAS scale) was significantly lower (3. 4 ± 0. 6) in group <b>one</b> <b>patients</b> and it was highest in group three (6. 7 ± 0. 8) patients. Requirement of continuation of epidural analgesia after 15 hours of operation and requirement of diclonfenac injections as well as incidence of itching and pruritus was significantly lower in group <b>one</b> <b>patients.</b> Incidence of nausea and vomiting was the lowest in group <b>one</b> <b>patients.</b> Incidence of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension were nil in all three group of patients. Epidural buprenorphine combined with bupivacaine produced significantly longer duration and better quality of analgesia than bupivacaine combined with clonidine or bupivacaine alone, and it was safe in LSCS patients, for post-operative analgesia...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} erythema nodosum (EN) and sex, age, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytosis (BAL-I), interstitial granulomas and radiological stage in patients presenting with pulmonary sarcoidosis in Ireland. Sixty-nine patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis between 2003 and 2006 were studied. Forty <b>one</b> <b>patients</b> (59 %) were male. Sixteen patients (23 %) presented with EN. Forty <b>one</b> <b>patients</b> of 65 (63 %) had transbronchial biopsies demonstrating non-caseating granulomas. Patients with sarcoidosis presenting with EN {{were more likely to}} be female (p= 0. 042), younger (p= 0. 012) and have earlier stage pulmonary disease (p= 0. 02). There were no correlations between serum ACE, interstitial granulomas and disease stage. BAL-I did however predict increasing disease radiological stage (p= 0. 042). In this study, <b>one</b> quarter of <b>patients</b> with sarcoidosis presented with EN among their presenting features.

25|$|Atypical Timothy {{syndrome}} {{has largely}} the same symptoms as the classical form.

Patients with atypical Timothy syndrome also have more facial deformities, including protruding foreheads and tongues. Finally, <b>one</b> <b>patient</b> with atypical Timothy syndrome had a body development discrepancy wherein her upper body was normally developed (that of a 6-year-old) while her lower half resembled a 2- or 3-year-old.|$|E
