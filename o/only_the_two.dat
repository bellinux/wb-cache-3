5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|On the {{accession}} of George I in 1714, {{the theatre}} was renamed the King's Theatre and remained so named during {{a succession of}} male monarchs who occupied the throne. At this time <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> patent theatres were permitted to perform serious drama in London, and lacking letters patent, the theatre remained associated with opera. In 1762, Johann Christian Bach travelled to London to premiere three operas at the theatre, including Orione on 19 February 1763. This established his reputation in England, and he became music master to Queen Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|The December 1970 OAG shows 86 weekday arrivals (77 jet) on 13 {{fixed-wing}} airlines from 31 airports, but the August 1974 shows 14 arrivals (all jet) on four airlines, and in 1976–79 Midway had <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> {{or three}} Delta DC-9s from St Louis. Midway Airlines arrived on October 31, 1979 with DC-9 nonstops to Kansas City, Detroit and Cleveland Lakefront; they expanded greatly in the 1980s. Their September 1989 timetable shows 117 weekday departures to 29 cities, plus 108 departures on their commuter affiliates to 22 more cities. Midway quit flying in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro {{were both}} dissolved, in 1991 and 2006 respectively. Serbia and Montenegro {{in the attempt}} to mask as Yugoslavia, participated in the 1992 Contest under its name but {{representing}} the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which consisted of <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> republics. Both Montenegro and Serbia have competed as separate countries since 2007.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War II on December 7, 1941, the Federal {{government}} {{set up the}} War Shipping Administration {{to manage}} the vitally important maritime shipping and Naval support needs of the U.S. and its Allies, including the power to expropriate civilian-owned boats. On April 1, 1942, the government acquired the Old Bay Line's State of Virginia and State of Maryland. On July 13, the President Warfield and Yorktown were also taken over. Thus, by mid-1942, four of the Old Bay Line's six ships had become government property, leaving the company <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> oldest and smallest ships in its fleet {{for the duration of}} the war, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the ship arrived in Leningrad, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> forward gun turrets had been {{installed}} and the bridge superstructure was incomplete. The only secondary guns installed were the 3.7cm anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet Navy renamed the ship Petropavlovsk on 25 September 1940, and designated the construction effort to complete the ship Projekt 83. The vessel's design {{provided the basis for}} a planned heavy cruiser, designated Projekt 82, although this ship was canceled before work began. Training for the Soviet crew of the ship proved to be contentious; the Soviets wanted their personnel trained in Germany, while the Germans preferred sending instructors to the Soviet Union. Language barriers and inexperience with international training missions also hampered the training effort.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{were dry}} for {{qualifying}} on Saturday afternoon. Qualifying {{consisted of three}} parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. <b>Only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Mercedes drivers were capable of proceeding into the second part of qualifying (Q2) without having to use the faster, soft tyres. Nico Rosberg was fastest, ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton. As Carlos Sainz was unable to compete following his crash in practice, only four running drivers were eliminated. Those were both Marussia drivers, the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson and Fernando Alonso for McLaren.|$|E
5|$|Construction of an {{extension}} to Route 115 (Santa Clara Street, now SR 130) at 30th Street in San Jose began in 1939, and {{was completed by}} late 1940. As with the portion between Fourth and 13th Streets, it was not marked as a numbered route. The state legislature authorized {{an extension}} beyond San Jose back to El Camino Real near Ford Road in 1947, which was already under construction, and was completed that year. This was the first segment built with interchanges, and included a median barrier. Despite this, most crossings were at-grade; <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> ends at Route 115 (Santa Clara Street) and regular US 101 included bridges, the former a diamond interchange and the latter a simple split with additional access to Ford Road. It also crossed over Coyote Road, though with no access, {{just south of the}} Coyote Creek bridge. The original 1947 bridge over Coyote Road remains, though widened in 1990, {{and is one of the}} oldest road-road grade separations on the present freeway.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> values in the pixelated image, a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E
5|$|Located on an embankment, {{the station}} has four tracks with <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> outer ones in revenue service. The two center express tracks have been {{disconnected}} from the line and have permanently been removed from service. North of this station, {{a portion of the}} southbound express track connects with the southbound local track at its north end, and ends at a bumper block at its southern end. This section of track can be used for revenue service or work train layups, but this use has been made completely redundant because of the nearby Pitkin Yard serving as the primary layup yard instead.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia, the KJRM comprised 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries, effectively divided into ships capable of offensive and defensive tasks, and ships intended for peacetime training, logistics and minelaying tasks. The former category included Dubrovnik, the three Beograd-class destroyers (although Ljubljana was in dry dock being repaired), the four submarines, eight Orjen-class MTBs and two Uskok-class MTBs. Of the submarines, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> French-built ones were considered fully combat-ready. The latter category consisted of Dalmacija, six Galeb-class minelayers, six 250t-class torpedo boats, five Malinska-class minelayers, and the training and auxiliary ships Jadran, Zmaj, Hvar and Sitnica. The Maritime Air Force consisted of 150 seaplanes, of which 120 were combat-capable, the remainder being training aircraft. The combat aircraft were mainly Do 22s, Do Js and Do D types. Although torpedo-capable aircraft were in service, no air-launched torpedoes were available.|$|E

5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> largest regular moons {{have been}} imaged with a {{resolution}} sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200km in diameter, is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either: it resembles an irregular polyhedron, with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250km in diameter. At about 400km in diameter, it {{is larger than}} the Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus. The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Protandry is when an {{individual}} starts out male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as protogyny, the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male is removed {{the largest and most}} dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she is removed, the next ranking female takes her place. In the species Anthias squamipinnis, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are removed from a group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.|$|E
5|$|Sacred zebu {{were kept}} in a sunken cattle pen (fahimasina) {{to the west of}} the kianja {{courtyard}} before sacrifice at royal events such as circumcisions and the fandroana festival. <b>Only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> most highly prized types of zebu were kept here: black zebu with white markings on the forehead, called volavita, and entirely reddish-brown zebu, called malaza. In this way, the cattle were made to walk from the west toward the east (the direction of the ancestors and sanctity) before being slaughtered. Another large pen for sacrificial zebu was located to the northeast of this courtyard before being filled in by the French Colonial Authority in the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Small Heath {{went through}} the League season without drawing a match. They scored 103 goals, {{at a rate of}} 3.6goals per game, and became the first team to exceed 100 goals in a Football League season (Sunderland scored exactly 100 the {{previous}} season). If test match goals are counted, all five first-choice forwards reached double figures for the second consecutive season. The leading scorer was Frank Mobley with 24 League goals, a total which also made him the top scorer in the Second Division, closely followed by Fred Wheldon with 22. Ted Devey, Tommy Hands, Billy Ollis and Wheldon were ever-present in the League, all but Devey for the second season running, and Caesar Jenkyns missed <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> games for which he was suspended.|$|E
5|$|The {{third part}} of {{qualifying}} determined pole position and <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Mercedes drivers set two timed laps. After he clocked in behind both Ferrari drivers {{in his first}} run, Rosberg improved to second place on his second time out, {{but was unable to}} challenge teammate Hamilton, who took the fiftieth pole position of his career. Every other driver was limited to only one timed lap and in the end, the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen locked out the second row on the grid ahead of Max Verstappen and Felipe Massa. Sainz and Ricciardo rounded up the top eight on the grid. Therefore, Q3 saw little running with the final positions determined very early on and drivers exiting their cars five minutes before the end of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of the church there are the {{remnants}} of a stone preaching cross. The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's. <b>Only</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> circular steps into which the original structure was set remain; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the gnomon was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a small garden of remembrance. The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other flowering bulbs in early springtime.|$|E
