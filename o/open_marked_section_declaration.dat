40|$|The use {{of trade}} marks in keyword {{advertising}} {{has been one}} of the ‘hottest’ issues in intellectual property law for several years. This entirely new way of using trade marks as a targeting tool has provoked a discussion concerning the core concepts of trade mark law. This chapter discusses the issues of ‘trade <b>mark</b> use’ (<b>section</b> 5), the likelihood of confusion test (section 6), the protected functions of a trade <b>mark</b> (<b>section</b> 7), the protection of reputable <b>marks</b> (<b>section</b> 8), and the limitations to trade <b>mark</b> rights (<b>section</b> 9) in the context of keyword advertising. First, this paper will illuminate the functioning of keyword advertising and the various interests at stake (section 2). Thereafter, the structure of Art 5 TMD, as well as the underlying rationales and policy concerns of trade mark law will be addressed (sections 3 and 4). In addition to trade mark law, unfair competition law issues will briefly be pointed out (section 10). Furthermore, a number of national court decisions applying the guidance provided by the ECJ will be analyzed (section 11). The chapter concludes by arguing an approach towards the use of trade marks in keyword advertising which takes into account the freedoms of information and competition and which focuses on the prevention of consumer confusion (section 12) ...|$|R

5000|$|Like its predecessors, Gears of War 3 is a third-person shooter that {{emphasizes}} the use of cover and squad tactics {{in order to survive}} combat situations. The player's character can carry four weapons: one pistol, one set of grenades, and two primary weapons. Firearms can be swapped with other weapons dropped by fallen foes or at stockpiles throughout the game, along with ammunition. When the player reloads a weapons ammunition, they have an opportunity for an [...] "active reload", shown by a small cursor moving over a line with a <b>marked</b> <b>section</b> on the player's heads-up display (HUD). If the player hits a control button when the cursor is in the <b>marked</b> <b>section,</b> they will reload faster with the resulting reload being slightly more powerful than normal bullets, causing more damage to opponents. If they press the button outside this section, this temporarily jams the weapon, leaving the player vulnerable and taking longer to reload. Alternatively, the player can opt to not try for the active reload, reloading the weapon at normal speed, but with no added damage.|$|R
