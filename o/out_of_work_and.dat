25|$|By 1930, 30% of {{the labour}} force was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> one {{fifth of the}} {{population}} became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell, as did prices.

25|$|In the United States, {{the rate}} of unionization for these workers is about 36 percent, {{much higher than the}} average for all occupations.

25|$|The Liberal Party {{lost the}} 1930 {{election}} to the Conservative Party, led by R.B. Bennett. Bennett, a successful western businessman, campaigned on high tariffs and large-scale spending. Make-work programs were begun, and welfare and other assistance programs became vastly larger. This led to a large federal deficit, however. Bennett became wary of the budget shortfalls by 1932, and cut back severely on federal spending. This only deepened the depression as government employees were put <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> public works projects were cancelled.|$|E

In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> employment prospects for Harlemites stayed bad for decades. Employment among black New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, including domestic service and some types of manual labor, were taken over by other ethnic groups. Major industries left New York City altogether, especially after 1950. Several riots happened in this period, including in 1935 and 1943.|$|E

Worst hit were areas dependent on primary industries such as farming, mining and logging, as prices fell and there were few alternative jobs. Most families had moderate losses and little hardship, though they too became pessimistic and their debts became heavier as prices fell. Some families saw {{most or all of}} their assets disappear, and suffered severely.|$|E
25|$|As the antisemitic {{policies}} of the Third Reich took effect, Jewish musicians were forced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> began to leave Germany. The Nazis were aware that Furtwängler was opposed to the policies and might also decide to go abroad, so the Berlin Philharmonic, which employed many Jews, was exempted from the policies. In 1933, when Bruno Walter was dismissed from his position as principal conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the Nazis asked Furtwängler to replace him for an international tour. Their goal was to show {{to the world that}} Germany did not need Jewish musicians. Furtwängler refused, and it was Richard Strauss who replaced Walter.|$|E

25|$|The late 1970s and the 1980s again saw {{a period}} of {{economic}} hardship hit the city as several major employers closed or restructured. The Eatons catalogue division closed in 1976 and CN closed its locomotive shops facility in 1988, throwing thousands <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> forcing the federal and provincial governments to step in with economic restructuring packages to diversify the Moncton economy. CFB Moncton was also closed at about this time due to defence cutbacks resulting {{from the end of}} the Cold War. Moncton became so despondent during the late 1980s (prior to economic restructuring having a positive impact) that the city's promotional slogan would become the rather lackluster Moncton - We're OK.|$|E
500|$|Critic Robert B. Stepto {{states that}} the poem [...] "One More Round" [...] is heavily {{influenced}} by the work and protest songs of the past.

Stepto is impressed with Angelou's {{creation of a new}} art form <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> protest forms, but does not feel that she develops it enough. He places Angelou's work in the tradition of other Black poets, and compares the poems in And Still I Rise to the works of Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Sterling Brown. Stepto also praises Angelou for borrowing [...] "various folk rhythms and forms and thereby buttresses her poems by evoking aspects of a culture's written and unwritten heritage". Despite Angelou's strong criticism of racism, she also asserted in all her writings what Hagen calls a recurring theme, that [...] "we are more alike than unalike".|$|E

500|$|Bence's {{career began}} to decline around 1986, and she stopped {{receiving}} work proposals.

The play, by Colin Higgins was presented at the Blanca Podestá Theater on Corrientes Avenue, with Bence playing the character of Harold's mother. The play received good reviews, but failed to attract an audience, and ended in February 1988. Bence spent almost two years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> in 1989 traveled to Cuba to attend the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema, where she met Fidel Castro at a reception.

500|$|Radcliffe became {{well known}} for its paper industry; its mills {{included}} the East Lancashire Paper Mill and Radcliffe Paper Mill. The former was founded by the Seddon family on 29 March 1860, {{along the banks of}} the Irwell. Its construction provided much-needed employment: in the 1860s living standards within the town were poor, and local mills often operated on [...] "short time". A reduction in the demand for coal had placed many colliers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> the Lancashire Cotton Famine was starving Lancashire of raw materials, especially cotton. Soup kitchens were opened by local benefactors, and many local residents were on poor relief. The mill began producing low grade paper and newsprint, moving on to other products including high quality printing and writing papers. Radcliffe Paper Mill was formed during the First World War, when it took over from a paper mill and a pipe plant. It originally produced paper suitable for roofing felt, to cater for a national shortage. After World War II the mill employed over 600people and produced 70,000tons of paper annually. British Plaster Board Industries (BPB) took over the company in 1961.|$|E
500|$|From the beginning, Smith {{considered}} the role ideal for Wendy Richard, {{with whom she}} had worked on the 1960s BBC soap, The Newcomers; [...] Holland and Smith decided to approach her about the role, even though their casting policy was not to use [...] "stars"—Richard was already well known in the UK for playing glamorous roles, such as Shirley Brahms in the successful sitcom Are You Being Served? At their first meeting, Tony Holland informed Richard that they were planning a programme that would not [...] "duck social issues but would be a hard-hitting drama including teenage pregnancy, drugs, racial conflict, prostitution, rape, mental illness, homosexuality, alcoholism, and muggings among its subjects." [...] In order to carry such controversial storylines, Richard was told that [...] "powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened" [...] had been invented, and two families, the Fowlers and the Beales, were to form the core of the soap's narrative. In her autobiography, Richard states, [...] "If I accepted, my character was to be Pauline Fowler. A middle-aged mother of two teenagers, with a late baby on the way, Pauline worked part-time at the launderette, voted Labour and supported Arsenal. She was married to Arthur, who was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> was really a bit of a failure, not much good at anything in life."
