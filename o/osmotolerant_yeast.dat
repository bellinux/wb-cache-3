In this study, we have characterized the functional role of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in mediating the osmotic stress response, among others, in T. delbrueckii. We show that the T. delbrueckii Hog 1 p homologue TdHog 1 p is phosphorylated after cell transfer to NaCl- or sorbitol-containing medium. However, TdHog 1 p plays a minor role in tolerance to conditions of moderate osmotic stress, a trait related mainly with the osmotic balance. In consonance with this, the absence of TdHog 1 p produced only a weak defect in the timing of the osmostress-induced glycerol and GPD 1 mRNA overaccumulation. Tdhog 1 Δ mutants also failed to display aberrant morphology changes in response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, our data indicate that the T. delbrueckii HOG pathway has evolved to respond to specific environmental conditions and to play a pivotal role in the stress cross-protection mechanism...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} the {{dissolved}} oxygen on glycerol and ethanol productions by an <b>osmotolerant</b> <b>yeast</b> Hansenula anomala was examined during growth in media at low water activity resulting from the addition of 2 M NaCl in the culture medium. High stirring rate, high culture medium aeration, as well as high mass transfer surface inhibited both glycerol and ethanol biosynthesis. In absence of oxygen, yeast used acetaldehyde as a hydrogen acceptor, leading to the stimulation of ethanol biosynthesis and accounting for the low biomass and glycerol production; the experimental ratio ethanol on glycerol produced was 5. 1 when the available oxygen was lowered (low stirring rate, 500 rpm) and increased to 10. 2 in absence of aeration. Extracellular glycerol production was therefore optimal for a moderate stirring (1000 rpm) and aeration (1. 4 vvm) rates. These optimal conditions resulted in an experimental ratio ethanol on glycerol produced of 4. 1, namely close to the theoretical value of 4, illustrating the osmodependent channelling of carbon towards polyols productio...|$|E

In the present study, the effect of different growth substrates, trace elements, nitrogen concentration and initial pH on growth and formation of ethanol and arabitol were examined. Optimum conditions for maximizing the product yields were established: glucose as carbon source, an initial pH of 6.0, 6 g/L of ammonium sulphate and addition of micronutrients. Under these best suited conditions, a concentration of 11 g/L of arabitol and 19 g/L of ethanol was obtained in shake flask fermentations. The fermentation was scaled up to 2.5 L bioreactor {{and the influence of}} aeration, agitation and initial substrate concentration was also determined. Under optimal conditions (150 g/L glucose, 400 rpm and 0.5 vvm) ethanol concentration reached 52 g/L, which corresponds to a yield of 0.34 g/g and volumetric productivity of 0.28 g/L/h, whereas arabitol production reached a maximum of 14 g/L with a yield and volumetric productivity of 0.1 g/g and 0.07 g/L/h respectively.|$|E

Intracellular concentration of K+ in yeasts is usually between 200 mM and 300 mM, while the external K+ concentration is ranging from molar to micromolar. To adapt to environments with low K+ content, yeast cells employ various K+ high-affinity uptake systems, e. g.

Addition of osmolyte such as NaCl into culture medium can increase the production of glycerol from glucose, but osmolytes may burden the glycerol separation. A coencapsulation method was suggested to create local extracellular hyperosmotic stress for glycerol accumulation. Firstly, the influence of osmotic stress induced by the addition of PEG 4000 on growth and metabolism of free cell was studied in detail. Glycerol accumulation could be improved by employing PEG 4000 as osmoregulator. Secondly, cells and PEG 4000 were coentrapped in NaCS/PDMDAAC capsules to create local hyperosmotic stress. The effects of local hyperosmotic microenvironment on the cell growth and metabolism were studied. The coentrapment method increased the glycerol concentration by 25 %, and the glycerol concentration attained 50 [*]gL− 1 with productivity of 18. 8 [*]gL− 1 Day− 1 in shake flask.

40|$|Microbial {{production}} of glycerol {{has been known}} for 150 years, and glycerol was produced commercially during World War I. Glycerol production by microbial synthesis subsequently declined since it was unable to compete with chemical synthesis from petrochemical feedstocks due to the low glycerol yields and the difficulty with extraction and purification of glycerol from broth. As the cost of propylene has increased and its availability has decreased especially in developing countries and as glycerol has become an attractive feedstock for {{production of}} various chemicals, glycerol production by fermentation has become more attractive as an alternative route. Substantial overproduction of glycerol by yeast from monosaccharides can be obtained by: (1) forming a complex between acetaldehyde and bisulfite ions thereby retarding ethanol production and restoring the redox balance through glycerol synthesis; (2) growing yeast cultures at pH values near 7 or above; or (3) using osmotolerant yeasts.

The role of this putative membrane channel protein in polyol accumulation and release during osmoregulation was investigated. The Z. rouxii FPS 1 (ZrFPS 1) complemented the S. cerevisiae fps 1 Δ growth defect and glycerol release upon hypo-osmotic shock. Deletion of ZrFPS 1 did not affect growth on glycerol as sole carbon source, suggesting that other transport proteins {{are involved in the}} uptake of glycerol. However, mutants lacking ZrFPS 1 exhibited a significant decrease in glycerol and D-arabitol efflux and poor growth during hypo-osmotic conditions, suggesting that ZrFPS 1 might be involved in D-arabitol transport in addition to glycerol.

40|$|Polyploidization is an {{important}} process {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotic genomes, but ensuing molecular mechanisms remain to be clarified. Autopolyploidization or whole-genome duplication events frequently are resolved in resulting lineages by the loss of single genes from most duplicated pairs, causing transient gene dosage imbalance and accelerating speciation through meiotic infertility. Allopolyploidization or formation of interspecies hybrids raises the problem of genetic incompatibility (Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller effect) and may be resolved by the accumulation of mutational changes in resulting lineages. In this article, we show that an <b>osmotolerant</b> <b>yeast</b> species, Pichia sorbitophila, recently isolated in a concentrated sorbitol solution in industry, illustrates this last situation. Its genome is a mosaic of homologous and homeologous chromosomes, or parts thereof, that corresponds to a recently formed hybrid in the process of evolution. The respective parental contributions to this genome were characterized using existing variations in GC content. The genomic changes that occurred during the short period since hybrid formation were identified (e. g., loss of heterozygosity, unilateral loss of rDNA, reciprocal exchange) and distinguished from those undergone by the two parental genomes after separation from their common ancestor (i. e., NUMT (NUclear sequences of MiTochondrial origin) insertions, gene acquisitions, gene location movements, reciprocal translocation). We found that the physiological characteristics of this new yeast species are determined by specific but unequal contributions of its two parents, one of which could be identified as very closely related to an extant Pichia farinosa strain...|$|E
40|$|The {{members of}} group III hybrid {{histidine}} kinases (HHK) are ubiquitous in fungi. Group III HHK have been implicated {{to function as}} osmosensors in the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway that is essential for fungal survival under high osmolarity stress. Recent literature suggests that group III HHK are also involved in conidia formation, virulence in several filamentous fungi, and are an excellent molecular target for antifungal agents. Thus, group III HHK constitute a very important group of sensor kinases. Structurally, group III HHK are distinct from Sln 1 p, the osmosensing HHK that regulates the HOG pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Group III HHK lack any transmembrane domain and typically contain HAMP domain repeats at the N terminus. Until now, {{it is not clear}} how group III HHK function as an osmosensor to regulate the HOG pathway. To investigate this, we undertook molecular characterization of DhNIK 1, an ortholog from <b>osmotolerant</b> <b>yeast</b> Debaryomyces hansenii. We show here that DhNIK 1 could complement sln 1 mutation in S. cerevisiae thereby confirming its role as a bona fide osmosensor. We further investigated the role of HAMP domains by deleting them systematically. Our results clearly indicate that the HAMP 4 domain is crucial for osmosensing by DhNik 1 p. Most importantly, we also show that the alternative interaction among the HAMP domains regulates the activity of DhNik 1 p like an “on-off switch” and thus provides, for the first time, an insight into the molecular mechanism of osmosensing by this group of HHKs...|$|E

The requirement for 2. 0 M KCl compares with that for S. bisporus var. mellis (another osmotolerant species) and contrasts with the 0. 3 to 0. 8 M KCl concentrations used in the preparation of most yeast protoplasts. Short digestions (60 min or less) produced mostly spheroplasts; longer incubations (90 min or more) yielded mostly protoplasts as judged by electron micrographs. These protoplasts could be transferred to 1. 0 M KCl or 2. 0 M sorbitol without lysing, but lysis was pronounced in 0. 5 M KCl or 1. 0 M mannitol and complete in 0. 02 M KCl. Protoplasts were separated from isolated cell wall remnants and debris by centrifugation on a linear gradient of Ficoll 400 (35 to 17. 5 %, wt/vol) containing 2. 0 M KCl. Both crude and fractionated protoplast preparations contained vesicles which were identified with the periplasmic bodies of whole cells. Some of the periplasmic bodies were connected to protoplasts by fine pedicels; others appeared free. Independent degeneracy of periplasmic bodies was occasionally observed. β-Fructofuranosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) activity is cryptic (physically) in cells of S. rouxii in contrast to the expressed enzyme (periplasmic space) of other Saccharomyces species.

In experiments aimed at investigating the physiological {{function of the}} DHA pathway in Z. rouxii, a typical <b>osmotolerant</b> <b>yeast,</b> we cloned and characterized a DAK gene encoding dihydroxyacetone kinase from Z. rouxii NRRL 2547. Sequence analysis revealed a 1761 bp open reading frame, encoding a peptide composed of 587 deduced amino acids with the predicted molecular weight of 61 664 Da. As the amino acid sequence was most closely homologous (68 % identity) to the S. cerevisiae Dak 1 p, we named the gene and protein ZrDAK 1 and ZrDak 1 p, respectively. A putative ATP binding site was also found but no consensus element associated with osmoregulation {{was found in the}} upstream region of the ZrDAK 1 gene. The ZrDAK 1 gene complemented a S. cerevisiae W 303 - 1 A dak 1 Δdak 2 Δ strain by improving the growth of the mutant on 50 mmol/l dihydroxyacetone and by increasing the tolerance to dihydroxyacetone in a medium containing 5 % sodium chloride, suggesting that it is a functional homologue of the S. cerevisiae DAK 1.

Test yeast were separately grown to early stationary phase in YPD broth containing increasing concentrations of glucose (1 – 50 % w/v) and were flashed with ≤ 40 pulses of broad-spectrum light at lamp discharge energy settings of 3. 2, 7. 2 and 12. 8 J (equivalent to UV doses of 0. 53, 1. 09 and 3. 36 μJ cm− 2, respectively) and their inactivation measured. Findings showed that prior growth in high-sugar conditions (≥ 30 % glucose w/v) enhanced {{the sensitivity of}} all nine representative strains of Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Z. rouxii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast to PUV irradiation. Significant differences in inactivation amongst different yeast types also occurred depending on amount of UV dose applied, where the order of increasing sensitivity of osmotically stressed yeast to PUV irradiation was shown to be Z. rouxii, Z. bailii and >S. cerevisiae. For example, a 1. 2 -log order difference in CFU mL− 1 reduction occurred between Z. bailii 11 486 and S. cerevisiae 834 when grown in 50 % w/v sugar samples and treated with the uppermost test UV dosage of 3. 36 μJ cm− 2, where these two yeast strains were reduced by 3. 8 and 5. 0 log orders, respectively, after this PUV treatment regime compared to untreated controls.

40|$|Osmotolerance is an {{essential}} trait of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for several industrial applications, such as high-sugar dough fermentation, high-gravity brewing or wine making and also during high-gravity industrial bioethanol production in which typically high concentrations of sugars are used. Commercial application of very high-gravity (VHG) fermentation technology for bioethanol production has immense potential to increase final ethanol titer, and reduce the energy consumption for distillation {{and the amount of}} distillage residue. However, implementation of this technology requires a robust yeast strain that can efficiently ferment under high-gravity conditions. This work tried to help remediating this industrial bottleneck by exploring three different avenues. First, the natural biodiversity of Saccharomyces species has been extensively explored to identify one or more osmotolerant strains that have potential as a starter culture in bioethanol fermentation. This allowed the identification of several interesting yeast strains that performed well in fermentation experiments mimicking industrial bioethanol production. Moreover, several isolates were identified that were extremely tolerant to specific stressors and are good candidates for inverse metabolic engineering or further strain improvement through genetic engineering, experimental evolution, or breeding. In the second approach, the S. cerevisiae strain that showed most efficient very high-gravity fermentation performance (X 6003) was subjected to polygenic analysis to identify the causative genetic elements responsible for its superior osmotolerance. For this purpose, pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis, a powerful technology for efficient polygenic analysis, was employed. In this method, a haploid segregant (X 6003 - 4 D) of the <b>osmotolerant</b> <b>yeast</b> strain with the most superior trait-of-interest has been crossed with a haploid segregant (ER- 42 A) from an unrelated industrial strain (Ethanol Red) with a comparatively inferior phenotype. Subsequently, the resulting diploid hybrid strain X 6003 - 4 D/ER- 42 A has been sporulated and 32 segregants with the superior phenotype have been selected to construct the superior pool. 32 segregants were also randomly selected regardless of their phenotype to construct the unselected pool. Pooled genomic DNA extraction was performed for both pools separately and submitted to whole-genome sequence analysis. A total of ten quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified with this approach, all of which had a statistically significant linkage. Dissection of QTL 2, QTL 3 and QTL 7 revealed three causative genes, namely RBK 1, GPD 1 and DUS 3. Further analysis is required to identify the remainder of the causative alleles in the other QTLs. This work demonstrated the high genetic complexity of osmotolerance. Moreover, it confirmed the potential of polygenic analysis by pooled-segregant whole-genome sequencing to identify causative gene(s) with a subtle influence on the phenotype. Finally, in the third approach, the huge, yet barely exploited resource of non-conventional yeast biodiversity was explored to identify potential stress-tolerant alternatives for S. cerevisiae. This work resulted in the identification of several promising candidates that may replace or complement S. cerevisiae in second generation bioethanol fermentation, including Pichia kudriavzevii. Moreover, this work yielded a multipurpose database, providing novel insight in the properties of non-conventional yeasts and a resource for future studies to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the extreme phenotypes of some of these yeasts. Altogether, the study supplemented our existing knowledge on the phenotypic diversity within different yeast species and within different strains of the same yeast species. It also gave us a better knowledge of the tolerance limits of different yeast species and strains for traits relevant to bioethanol production. Finally, the polygenic analysis by pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis expanded our current knowledge on S. cerevisiaegenetic elements that contribute to superior fermentation performance under VHG conditions. nrpages: 212 status: publishe...|$|E
