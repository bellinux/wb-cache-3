5|$|An adult {{dragonfly}} {{has three}} distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen {{as in all}} insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It {{is dominated by the}} two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The facets facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just <b>one</b> <b>size.</b> These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet {{at the top of the}} head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.|$|E

25|$|The 74% packing {{efficiency}} is the maximum density possible in unit cells constructed of spheres of only <b>one</b> <b>size.</b> Most crystalline forms of metallic elements are hcp, fcc, or bcc (body-centered cubic).

25|$|Many {{problems}} in the chemical and physical sciences {{can be related to}} packing problems where more than <b>one</b> <b>size</b> of sphere is available. Here there is a choice between separating the spheres into regions of close-packed equal spheres, or combining the multiple sizes of spheres into a compound or interstitial packing. When many sizes of spheres (or a distribution) are available, the problem quickly becomes intractable, but some studies of binary hard spheres (two sizes) are available.|$|E

25|$|Bennett {{published}} {{a study of}} sexual dimorphism in Pteranodon using 400 specimens. He found there to be two size based morphs, a larger form with a larger crest and narrow pelvis and a small form with a small crest and wide pelvis. He concluded that the larger form was male and the smaller form was female. He found that female Pteranodon outnumbered male Pteranodon by 2:1. Bennett argued that since large crests were only associated with <b>one</b> <b>size</b> morph, that it functioned purely as display. He also hypothesized that Pteranodon sternbergi was the direct ancestor of Pteranodon longiceps.|$|E
25|$|Some slave {{devices are}} {{designed}} to ignore any SPI communications in which the number of clock pulses is greater than specified. Others do not care, ignoring extra inputs and continuing to shift the same output bit. It is common for different devices to use SPI communications with different lengths, as, for example, when SPI is used to access the scan chain of a digital IC by issuing a command word of <b>one</b> <b>size</b> (perhaps 32 bits) and then getting a response of a different size (perhaps 153 bits, one for each pin in that scan chain).|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} metal type faces, the metal type of Akzidenz-Grotesk shows {{variation}} between sizes, with adaptation of letter-spacing and proportions to different sizes. In addition, there is variation between weights: Karl Gerstner notes that even comparing <b>one</b> <b>size</b> (20pt), the medium and bold weights have different x-height, cap height and descender length {{to the light}} and regular weights. This is common with nineteenth-century sans-serifs, which were often not designed as {{with the intention of}} forming an extended family that would match together. The differences in proportions between different sizes and weights of Akzidenz-Grotesk has led to a range of contemporary adaptations, reviving or modifying different aspects of the original design.|$|E
25|$|The Joroleman mailbox was {{originally}} approved for manufacture in <b>one</b> <b>size,</b> the No. 1, which could accommodate letter mail, periodicals, newspapers, catalogs, and small parcels. After July 1, 1916, the Joroleman mailbox {{would be the}} only design approved by the Post Office for new curbside mailbox installations. In July 1929, the Post Office approved specifications for a larger Joroleman mailbox known as the No. 2. The No. 2 mailbox, soon followed by the still-larger No. 3, could accept larger parcels and packages sent via Parcel Post; these large boxes proved particularly popular with rural mail recipients, who could order manufactured goods by mail for delivery to the farm or ranch.|$|E
25|$|Only <b>one</b> <b>size</b> of {{particle}} is considered in this equation. However, river beds are often formed by {{a mixture of}} sediment of various sizes. In case of partial motion where {{only a part of}} the sediment mixture moves, the river bed becomes enriched in large gravel as the smaller sediments are washed away. The smaller sediments present under this layer of large gravel have a lower possibility of movement and total sediment transport decreases. This is called armouring effect. Other forms of armouring of sediment or decreasing rates of sediment erosion can be caused by carpets of microbial mats, under conditions of high organic loading.|$|E

25|$|A {{natural number}} (which, in this context, {{includes}} the number 0) {{can be used}} for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence. When restricted to finite sets these two concepts coincide, {{there is only one way}} to put a finite set into a linear sequence, up to isomorphism. When dealing with infinite sets one has to distinguish between the notion of size, which leads to cardinal numbers, and the notion of position, which is generalized by the ordinal numbers described here. This is because while any set has only <b>one</b> <b>size</b> (its cardinality), there are many nonisomorphic well-orderings of any infinite set, as explained below.|$|E
25|$|Though it did {{represent}} {{a complex and}} gradual change in the shopping and self-presentation habits of both men and women, the idea of metrosexuality was often distilled in the media down to a few men and a short checklist of vanities, like skin care products, scented candles and costly, colorful dress shirts and pricey designer jeans. It was this image of the metrosexual—that of a straight young man who got pedicures and facials, practiced aromatherapy and spent freely on clothes—that contributed to a backlash against the term from men who merely wanted to feel free to take more care with their appearance than had been the norm in the 1990s, when companies abandoned dress codes, Dockers khakis became a popular brand, and XL, or extra-large, became the <b>one</b> <b>size</b> that fit all.|$|E
25|$|The player {{controls}} the smallest doll, Charlie Blackmore, who {{is attempting to}} reunite his family that is being forced to work for an evil industrialist named The Baron. Charlie is able to jump inside dolls that are <b>one</b> <b>size</b> larger than he and control them, {{as long as the}} larger doll is facing away from him. If the player already controls a stack of dolls, that stack can jump into a one-size-larger doll as well. The player can also unstack the dolls at any time in order to enter dolls smaller than his current stack. Certain unique dolls, outside of Charlie, have their own special abilities—such as the ability to unlock doors, float to higher locations, or lure other dolls around, which can be used by the outermost doll. Thus, the player must stack and unstack the set of dolls possessed by Charlie to solve puzzles throughout the game. Later puzzles may require the use of multiple dolls to combine their skills.|$|E

25|$|Machine-knitted jumpers {{tend to use}} finer wool, cotton, or {{synthetic}} yarn and have less complex patterns, {{since many of the}} traditional stitches cannot be reproduced this way. They are generally flatter, lighter and less substantial, without the pronounced texture of a hand knitted or hand loomed jumper. Machine knitted jumpers will loosen with wear, and so it is advisable to buy <b>one</b> <b>size</b> smaller than the size of the sweater usually worn. They are the least expensive option. Hand-looming allows more complicated stitches to be used, will have fewer stitches to the inch and be thicker. The best quality hand-loomed jumpers are almost indistinguishable from hand knit. Hand-knit jumpers tend to be more tightly knit, to have more complex stitch patterns and to be longer-lasting and they attract a significant price premium. By holding them up to light, the difference between the machine knit and hand knit is evident.|$|E
500|$|Despite their superficially similar appearance, {{there were}} many {{differences}} between the Scharnhorst class and the final incarnation of the Dutch design.
