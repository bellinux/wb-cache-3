5|$|At {{the first}} of these appearances, on October 28, 1893, Tchaikovsky {{conducted}} the premiere of his Sixth Symphony, along with his First Piano Concerto with Adele aus der Ohe as soloist. Tchaikovsky did not live to conduct the other three concerts, as he died on November 6, 1893. Rimsky-Korsakov stood in for him at the second of these events, an all-Tchaikovsky concert in memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer,</b> on December 12, 1893. The program included the Fourth Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, Marche Slave and some solo piano works played by Felix Blumenfeld.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1978, Messiaen retired from {{teaching}} at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> in conversation with Claude Samuel.|$|E
5|$|Jane Marian Joseph (31 May 1894– 9 March 1929) was an English composer, {{arranger}} {{and music}} teacher. She was a pupil and later associate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> Gustav Holst, and was closely concerned in the {{organisation and management}} of various of the music festivals which Holst sponsored. Many of her works were composed for performance at these festivals and similar occasions. Her early death, which prevented the full realisation of her talents, was considered by her contemporaries as a considerable loss to English music.|$|E

50|$|Beethoven {{first met}} him in the 1790s, {{probably}} in <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer's</b> patron Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky.

5|$|Throughout {{his early}} career, {{although}} determined {{to become a}} musician, Beer {{found it difficult to}} decide between playing and composition. Certainly other professionals in the decade 1810–1820, including Moscheles, considered him amongst the greatest virtuosi of his period. He wrote during this period numerous piano pieces, including a concerto and set of variations for piano and orchestra, but these have been lost. To this period also belongs a Clarinet Quintet written for the virtuoso Heinrich Baermann (1784–1847) who remained a close friend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Already {{a friend}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> Aaron Copland, Britten {{encountered}} his latest works Billy the Kid and An Outdoor Overture, {{both of which}} influenced his own music. In 1940 Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, {{the first of many}} song cycles for Pears. Britten's orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto and Sinfonia da Requiem. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, Paul Bunyan, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden. While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese gamelan music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording. This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career.|$|E

5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> by Rose Garrard {{is at the top of}} Church Street in Malvern, {{overlooking}} the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to remove his image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be legal tender on 30 June 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Tchaikovsky {{began to}} shed his unsociability and restlessness. That March, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which {{included}} a title of hereditary nobility and a personal audience with the Tsar. This {{was seen as a}} seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovsky's social standing and might have been cemented in the composer's mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite No. 3 at its January 1885 premiere in Saint Petersburg. In 1885, Alexander III requested a new production of Eugene Onegin at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. By having the opera staged there and not at the Mariinsky Theatre, he served notice that Tchaikovsky's music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art. In addition, thanks to Ivan Vsevolozhsky, Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer,</b> Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3,000 rubles from the Tsar. This made him the premier court composer, in practice if not in actual title.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Sargent {{recorded}} Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, {{one of his}} specialities, {{which was}} reissued on CD in 1990 and again in 2004. Sargent recorded Walton's Façade Suites in 1961. With the LSO, Sargent recorded Walton's Orb and Sceptre March. He also made a stereo recording of Walton's First Symphony in the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composer,</b> but Walton privately preferred André Previn's recording, issued in January 1967, the same month as Sargent's. Of Vaughan Williams's shorter pieces, Sargent recorded, with the BBC in 1960, the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (which he also recorded with the Philharmonia), and with the LSO, Serenade to Music (1957; choral version) and Toward the Unknown Region. He also recorded Vaughan Williams's overture The Wasps with the LSO.|$|E
