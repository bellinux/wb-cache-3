5|$|Shortly {{before the}} earthquake, the News-Miner placed {{an order for}} a modern <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> press. To house the new press, which could not fit in the Lathrop Building, Snedden ordered the {{construction}} of a new printing facility and office—named the Aurora Building—north of the Chena River. The Alaska Railroad sold Snedden the land for the building, which was built at a cost of $1 million in 1965. Snedden ordered the foundation for the new building to be raised 22 inches above the 100-year flood line. This fact saved the News-Miner two years later, when a massive flood swept through Fairbanks. The water was three inches deep throughout the paper's offices and even deeper in the press and boiler rooms, which were slightly below that raised level. The flood halted production for a time, and the Anchorage Times reciprocated the post-earthquake favor by publishing the News-Miner's masthead on its editions and posting occasional stories from Fairbanks until electrical power was restored to the town.|$|E
25|$|<b>Offset</b> <b>printing</b> is a {{commonly}} used printing technique where the inked image {{is transferred from}} a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. Ira Washington Rubel invented the first <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> press in 1903.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the improved removal of impurities (coating, ink/toner) from <b>offset</b> <b>prints</b> produced by digital printing of two-side coated paper. The substrates were printed by conventional and digital offset processes. Based on image analysis results it was established that deinking flotation is an inefficient method for ink particle removal from digital <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> paper, {{but it is}} efficient for ink removal from conventional <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> paper. On the other hand, pre-treatment with hydrogen peroxide solution gives better results for ink particle removal from digital <b>offset</b> <b>prints</b> than from conventional <b>offset</b> <b>prints.</b> Optimal parameters for hydrogen peroxide pre-treatment for both <b>offset</b> <b>prints</b> were chosen based on unprinted substrate mass loss results in the preliminary investigation. These results showed that hydrogen peroxide pre-treatment is more successful at removal of impurities in comparison with flotation deinking without pre-treatment...|$|R

25|$|By the 1900s {{printing}} plants often incorporated electrotyping and stereotyping departments, and electrotyping and stereotyping {{had become}} trades with associated apprenticeships. In the United Kingdom, the National Society of Electrotypers and Stereotypers (NSES) formed in 1893, {{and continued to}} 1967 when it amalgamated with the National Graphic Association. In the US and Canada, the International Stereotypers and Electrotypers Union (ISEU) was formed in 1902; previously, electrotypers had belonged to the International Typographer's Union (ITU). In 1925 there were 6800 members, and in 1955 10,500. In 1973 the ISEU was absorbed into the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union. In 1978, an Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that 2000 electrotypers and stereotypers were employed in the US. However, job prospects were reported as poor. <b>Offset</b> <b>printing</b> has supplanted letterpress printing in most printing plants; the last letterpress facility for a newspaper was installed in the 1980s. For <b>offset</b> <b>printing,</b> the printing plates are typically prepared by coating them with light-sensitive materials, and creating {{the image on the}} plate by direct optical exposure (the photo-offset process); stereotyping and electrotyping are not used.|$|E

Due to the poor printing technology (<b>offset</b> <b>printing)</b> counterfeits appeared in a short time. The situation was so serious that the banknotes soon had to be replaced with a new series. As a consequence, these belong to the most valued collector rarities among Hungarian banknotes.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate passing through presses for lithographic printing, intaglio printing, numbering printing, and varnish printing. The inks are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The opacifier layers enable the inks of the offset and intaglio printing {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the polymer substrate. <b>Offset</b> <b>printing</b> deposits a 1.5µm layer, intaglio about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|E
25|$|Three {{denominations}} of 1, 2 and 3-cents {{were printed}} by the <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> process. There {{are two types}} of the 1-cent denomination, five different types of the 2-cent variety, and two types of the 3-cent variety. These types possess differences in the lines on the toga rope in Washington's profile and usually require the aid of magnification to positively identify their different characteristics. Stamps produced by the offset process were issued with a perforation gauge of 11 with the one exception of the 1919 1-cent issue with gauge 12½. The first Washington-Franklin stamp printed by the offset process was a 3-cent Washington-head, issued on March 22, 1918. The 1-cent green followed and was issued on December 24, 1918. The five types of the 2-cent denomination were issued sometime later on March 15, 1920. Beginning in 1919 an imperforate variety (no perforations between stamps) was also issued. All three denominations were printed and possess the same variations in type that are found on the perforated issues, as the imperforate issues were produced from the same plates. There were no Franklin-heads printed with the <b>Offset</b> <b>printing</b> press.|$|E

25|$|Fiborgtangen {{had about}} 700 {{employees}} during the 1980s. From 1984 {{and the following}} years {{there was an increase}} in newsprint demand. Customers demanded better quality paper, particularly aimed at more advanced <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> and color printing. To remain competitive Norske Skog needed both to improve quality and cut production costs. This was achieved through the rationalization program NT90, which ran from 1986 through 1991. Total costs reached NOK2 billion. A quarter of this was financed through issuing new shares.|$|E
25|$|UV {{sources for}} UV curing {{applications}} include UV lamps, UV LEDs, and Excimer flash lamps. Fast {{processes such as}} flexo or <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> require high-intensity light focused via reflectors onto a moving substrate and medium so high-pressure Hg (mercury) or Fe (iron, doped)-based bulbs are used, energized with electric arcs or microwaves.

25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{transformation}} to more automated processes. The accounting systems {{were transferred to}} computers in 1970, followed by the paper machines in 1972 and 1973. These systems automatically measured the water content of the pulp at various stages and then adjusted the input factors as needed. PM1 was renovated and upgraded in a two-month period in 1975. This followed the standardization of newsprint to 48.8g/m2 as well as optimized the paper for <b>offset</b> <b>printing.</b> This and other refinements allowed {{the speed of the}} paper machine to increase to 900 meters per minute, up from 430 at start-up.|$|E
25|$|A {{printing}} press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring an image. The systems involved were first assembled in Germany by the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century. Printing methods based on Gutenberg's {{printing press}} spread rapidly throughout first Europe {{and then the}} rest of the world, replacing most block printing and making it the sole progenitor of modern movable type printing. As a method of creating reproductions for mass consumption, The printing press has been superseded by the advent of <b>offset</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{this image}} were {{transferred}} directly to paper, {{it would create}} a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber blanket, which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or offset to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as offset lithography or <b>offset</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{performance}} of a moisture sensor operating at 200 GHz for remote measurement of water content in paper. The system aims at industrial processes such as <b>offset</b> <b>print</b> and paper production. The moisture content in the paper is derived through an accurate measurement {{of the loss of}} a signal transmitted through the paper. The system is designed to achieve high accuracy in the measurement of the loss presented by the paper, not affected by 1 /f or drift noise. The sensor is capable of resolving 0. 005 dB loss achieving a moisture resolution of 0. 1 % for moisture content higher than 15 %. The resolution can be improved if necessary in exchange for longer measurement times. The sensor is tested in <b>offset</b> <b>print</b> and paper production processes and measured values are compared to laboratory measured samples of the paper...|$|R
