5|$|In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> distractions, {{during the}} summer of 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, {{completing}} the Adagio and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat, which persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 40°C (104°F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, including the world premiere of Busoni's Berceuse élégiaque. This was Mahler's last concert. After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, a disease to which sufferers from defective heart valves were particularly prone, and for which the survival rate in pre-antibiotic days was almost zero. Mahler did not give up hope; he talked of resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest when one of Alma's compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS Amerika bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 May he was taken by train to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where he died on 18 May.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{labeling}} the emotions (i.e., putting them into words) may lessen the intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> experience. Studies {{have shown the}} process of affective labeling leads to decreases in brain regions such as the amygdala and increases in activation of the prefrontal cortex, possibly indicating beneficial emotion regulation.|$|E
25|$|The Emotional Competency Inventory (ECI), {{which was}} created in 1999, and the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI), a newer edition of the ECI was {{developed}} in 2007.

25|$|Easterbrook's (1959) cue {{utilization}} theory {{predicted that}} {{high levels of}} arousal will lead to attention narrowing, defined as {{a decrease in the}} range of cues from the stimulus and its environment to which the organism is sensitive. According to this hypothesis, attention will be focused primarily on the arousing details (cues) of the stimulus, so that information central to the source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> arousal will be encoded while peripheral details will not.|$|E
25|$|Arthur P. Shimamura, a {{psychologist}} at the University of California, Berkeley, has speculated that Muybridge suffered substantial injuries to the orbitofrontal cortex that probably also extended into the anterior temporal lobes, which may have led to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional,</b> eccentric behavior reported by friends in later years, as well as freeing his creativity from conventional social inhibitions. Today, there still is little effective treatment for this kind of injury.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{some other}} patients, the {{character}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> display can be incongruent with, and even contradictory to, the emotional valence of the provoking stimulus or may be incited by a stimulus with no clear valence. For example, a patient may laugh in response to sad news or cry in response to stimuli with no emotional undertone, or, once provoked, the episodes may switch from laughing to crying or vice versa.|$|E

25|$|Writer Lawrence Miles {{has stated}} that he {{believes}} the Eighth Doctor has sex with I. M. Foreman between the events of his novels Interference – Book One and Interference – Book Two.

25|$|Though Star Sapphires do {{not have}} a {{weakness}} to other Corps (they are immune to the energy stealing properties of an Orange Power Ring), they are more susceptible to being controlled by their own power.

Unlike the Star Sapphire gem, which could force itself on a user, violet power rings must be accepted by the wearer.|$|E

25|$|The western Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic {{depictions of}} {{physical}} and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as Blake's portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or David's propagandistic paintings. This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of Goethe. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as academic art, Symbolism, impressionism and fauvism among others.|$|E
25|$|Manning and Pertwee {{enjoyed a}} close working relationship; Manning felt this {{added to the}} success of the {{partnership}} between Jo and the Third Doctor. Though her character was criticised for not being a progressive interpretation of a woman, Manning felt both that feminism was not a contemporary concern and Jo had her virtues aside from her intelligence, such as her loyalty. The character's exit is generally considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> high points of Doctor Whos 1963–89 run; Russell T Davies felt pressure to remain true to this exit when re-introducing the character in 2010.|$|E

Schizophrenic patients usually have difficulty processing prosody. These patients also show a remarkable increase in lateralization towards the right hemisphere of both emotionally and non-emotional prosody rich speech. Also, a decrease in right-handedness led {{to an increase in}} the right hemisphere lateralization. This right hemisphere lateralization extends beyond prosody to many of aspects of language and speech processing in schizophrenic patients.|$|E

25|$|Hiroki {{returned}} to his theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> and sexual lives of young adults in modern urban Japan in his June 1996 film Midori about a high-school girl pretending to be ill {{in order to see}} her boyfriend. His 2000 work Tokyo Trash Baby is an understated look at a lonely woman who goes through the garbage of the neighbor she is obsessed with looking for mementos. His other film in 2000 had a very different theme; the erotic comic drama I Am an S Writer, with a screenplay by Hiroki's former pink film colleague Hitoshi Ishikawa, is based on a possibly partly autobiographical novel by celebrated S writer Oniroku Dan.|$|E

She left two years later for Chiang Mai University in Thailand, where she taught English. The three years she spent in Chiang Mai had a deep impact on her. Together with her students and colleagues, Ho spent several periods {{living and working in}} nearby villages, as part of the ongoing student movement to alleviate rural poverty. While the student leaders were preoccupied with organizing the peasants into a political group in their search for democracy, Ho became more aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> world of the women and children there.|$|E
25|$|Oroonoko is {{the first}} English novel to show Africans in a {{sympathetic}} manner. At the same time, this novel {{is as much about}} the nature of kingship as it is about the nature of race. Oroonoko is a prince, and he is of noble lineage whether of African or European descent, and the novel's regicide is devastating to the colony. The theatrical nature of the plot follows from Behn's previous experience as a dramatist. The language she uses in Oroonoko is far more straightforward than in her other novels, and she dispenses with a great deal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> content of her earlier works. Further, the novel is unusual in Behn's fictions by having a very clear love story without complications of gender roles.|$|E

Contemporary psychologists use the Yale model’s psychological approach and Aristotle’s philosophical approach to examine components of persuasion.|$|R
