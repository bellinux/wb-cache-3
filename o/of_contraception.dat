40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} {{determinants}} <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> non-use {{among women in}} unplanned and ambivalent pregnancies. Method Cross-sectional study with a probabilistic sample of 366 pregnant women from 12 primary health care units {{in the city of}} S&# 227;o Paulo, Brazil. A multinomial logistic regression was performed, comparing three groups: women who used emergency contraception to prevent ongoing pregnancies (reference); women who made no use <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception,</b> but used other contraceptive methods; and women who made no use of any contraceptive methods at all. Results Cohabitation with a partner was the common determinant <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> non-use. No pregnancy risk awareness, ambivalent pregnancies and no previous use <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> also contributed to emergency contraception non-use. Conclusion Apart from what is pointed out in the literature, knowledge <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> and the fertile period were not associated to its use...|$|R

Materials and methods: This is a cross-sectional study using a semi-structured ­self-administered questionnaire to assess the knowledge and practice <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception</b> among female undergraduates in the University of Ibadan and The Polytechnic, Ibadan. A total of 1, 200 undergraduate students were interviewed, and data obtained were analyzed with SPSS Version 18. 0. Results: The {{mean age of the}} respondents was 22. 57 ± 3. 43  years. Among the respondents, 900 (84. 6 %) were unmarried, 871 (77. 9 %) have been sexually exposed, 793 (70. 9 %) had heard <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception,</b> and 659 (58. 9 %) had knowledge <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception.</b> Majority (66. 8 %) of the participants used effective <b>contraception,</b> <b>of</b> whom 423 (56. 3 %) used condom, while others used other short- or long-term reversible contraception. More than two-thirds (79. 2 %) of the sexually exposed respondents were aware <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception,</b> but only 465 (41. 6 %) had practiced it. The main sources of information about dual contraception were from friends and radio (45. 3 % and 36. 1 %, respectively). Those who had multiple sexual partners and early coitarche were more likely to use dual contraception (P< 0. 05). History of previous sexually transmitted infection (odds ratio = 3. 06, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 03 – 4. 62) and unwanted pregnancy (odds ratio = 3. 53, 95 % CI = 2. 62 – 4. 74) were strongly associated with the use <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception.</b> Conclusion: Uptake <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception</b> among the students was low. Efforts need to be concentrated on determining and addressing the challenges that are responsible for the lower uptake <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception</b> among female undergraduates who are at higher risk of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Promotion of consistent use <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception</b> is pertinent in maximizing the benefits <b>of</b> dual <b>contraception</b> in our environment.

5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method <b>of</b> <b>contraception,</b> they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To assess {{awareness}} <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> {{and related}} factors in women living at {{rural and urban}} residences of Trabzon city center. METHODS: Its a cross-sectional study and {{the data was collected}} via face to face technique with the participation of women who were selected by simple random sampling method. Total of 420 women between ages of 20 - 44 participated to the questionnairre based study. Chi-square test and logistic regression test were performed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The 36. 9 % of participants stated that they heard <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> where 63. 1 % did not. Of the women, 96. 0 % didnt report any use <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> and 2. 6, 1. 0 and 0. 4 % reported ever usage <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> as once, twice, three and more, respectively. Living in rural residence, having education level of primary school and under, early age of marriage, increased age were determined as independent factors for emergency contraception unawareness in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Being aware <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> and its usage were low in our study. As emergency contraception {{is considered to be a}} second chance method, indications <b>of</b> emergency <b>contraception</b> should firstly be known by health professionals and correct informations should be transferred to public.

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to fertilize an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods <b>of</b> <b>contraception,</b> including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing contraception {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use <b>of</b> <b>contraception.</b> By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families. The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.|$|E

5|$|Several methods <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> {{involve the}} cervix. Cervical {{diaphragms}} are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth control}} {{movement}} received an unexpected boost during World War I, {{as a result}} of a crisis the U.S. military experienced when many of its soldiers were diagnosed with syphilis or gonorrhea. The military undertook an extensive education campaign, focusing on abstinence, but also offering some contraceptive guidance.Tone, pp. 91–115 contains a history <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> in the U.S. military in World War I. Navy secretary Josephus Daniels led the efforts to enforce abstinence. The military, under pressure from purity advocates, did not distribute condoms, or even endorse their use, making the U.S. the only military force in World War I that did not supply condoms to its troops. When U.S. soldiers were in Europe, they found rubber condoms readily available, and when they returned to America, they continued to use condoms as their preferred method of birth control.|$|E

5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> nonadherence.|$|E
