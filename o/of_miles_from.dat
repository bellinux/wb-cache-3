5|$|Dolarhyde, Ella, {{and other}} townsfolk form a posse to track an injured alien that {{escaped from the}} downed ship. Meanwhile, Jake travels to an {{abandoned}} cabin and, in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins up with the posse. During the evening, the group comes upon a capsized paddle wheel steamboat that the aliens apparently dumped hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> any rivers capable of holding it. They camp in it, and during the night the alien they were tracking kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{geography}} – {{the only place}} in hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid-19th century was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.|$|E
5|$|Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. The vocalizations of {{blue and}} fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept {{infrasonic}} pulses from 16 to 40hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20hertz and 20kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184–186decibels relative to 1micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> their source.|$|E

5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} 150years, other expeditions, explorers, and {{scientists}} would piece together what happened next. Franklin's men wintered in 1845–46 on Beechey Island, where three crew members died and were buried. Terror and Erebus became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again. According to a note dated 25 April 1848, and {{left on the}} island by Fitzjames and Crozier, Franklin had died on 11 June 1847; the crew had wintered on King William Island in 1846–47 and 1847–48, and the remaining crew had planned to begin walking on 26 April 1848 toward the Back River on the Canadian mainland. Nine officers and fifteen men had already died; the rest would die along the way, most {{on the island and}} another 30 or 40 on the northern coast of the mainland, hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the nearest outpost of Western civilization.|$|E
5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so {{could not have known}} about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E

25|$|In medieval China, one of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} naturalists was Shen Kuo (1031–1095), a polymath personality who dabbled in many fields of study in his age. In terms of geology, Shen Kuo is {{one of the}} first naturalists to have formulated a theory of geomorphology. This was based on his observations of sedimentary uplift, soil erosion, deposition of silt, and marine fossils found in the Taihang Mountains, located hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the Pacific Ocean. He also formulated a theory of gradual climate change, after his observation of ancient petrified bamboos found in a preserved state underground near Yanzhou (modern Yan'an), in the dry northern climate of Shaanxi province. He formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.|$|E

25|$|Geology existed as a {{cloud of}} isolated, {{disconnected}} ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science. Theophrastus' work on rocks, Peri lithōn, remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath Shen Kua (1031–1095) first formulated hypotheses for the process of land formation. Based on his observation of fossils in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the ocean, he deduced that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.|$|E
25|$|Meredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, India on 30 June 1928.

It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking {{in a sense of}} humor and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have {{played a central role in}} introducing Meher Baba to the western world.|$|E

25|$|Some modern scholars, such as Fielding H. Garrison, are of {{the opinion}} that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the {{earliest}} Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{tendency}} to travel very long distances at sea, individual saltwater crocodiles {{have been known}} to appear occasionally in areas far away from their general range. Vagrant individuals have historically been reported on New Caledonia, Fiji, and in Asian waters possibly swam with Kuroshio Current, reaching such as at Iwo Jima, Hachijō-jima, Amami Ōshima, Iriomote-jima (residences by several individuals along Urauchi River from Bakumatsu to Meiji until being hunted by locals were suggested), pelagic waters off Shima, Mie, Miura Peninsula, and even in the relatively frigid Sea of Japan (thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> their native territory.) In late 2008-early 2009, a handful of wild saltwater crocodiles were verified to be living within the river systems of Fraser Island, hundreds of kilometres from, and in much cooler water than, their normal Queensland range. These crocodiles did indeed migrate south to the island from northern Queensland during the warmer wet season and presumably returned to the north upon the seasonal temperature drop. Despite the surprise and shock within the Fraser Island public, this is apparently not new behaviour, and in the distant past, wild crocodiles had been reported appearing occasionally as far south as Brisbane during the warmer wet season.|$|E
25|$|The {{nearby town}} of Coulson {{appeared}} a far more likely site. Coulson was a rough and tumble town where arguments were often followed by gunplay. Liver-Eating Johnston was a lawman in Coulson. Perhaps the most famous person {{to be buried in}} Coulsons Boothill cemetery is Muggins Taylor, the scout who carried the news of Custer's Last Stand to the world. Most buried here were said to have died with their boots on. The town of Coulson had been situated on the Yellowstone River, which made it ideal for the commerce that steamboats brought up the river. However, when the Montana & Minnesota Land Company oversaw the development of potential railroad land, they ignored Coulson, and platted the new town of Billings just a couple of miles to the Northwest. Coulson quickly faded away; most of her residents were absorbed into Billings. Yet for a short time the two towns co-existed: a trolley even ran between the two. But ultimately there was no future for Coulson as Billings grew. Though it stood {{on the banks of the}} Yellowstone River only a couple <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the heart of present-day Downtown Billings, the city of Billings never built on the land where Coulson once stood. Today Coulson Park sits along the banks of the Yellowstone where the valley's first town once stood.|$|E
