At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> days. During social grooming (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using a scent gland on the throat, and grooming sessions can last several minutes. While feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over non-resident males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta).|$|E

25|$|Chek Lap Kok Airport was {{designed}} as a replacement for the former Hong Kong International Airport (commonly known as Kai Tak Airport) built in 1925. Located in the densely built-up Kowloon City District with a single runway extending into Kowloon Bay, Kai Tak had only limited room for expansion to cope with steadily increasing air traffic. By the 1990s, Kai Tak had become one of the world's busiest airports – it far exceeded its annual passenger and cargo design capacities, and <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> flights experienced delays, largely due to lack of space for aircraft, gates, and a second runway. In addition, noise mitigation measures restricted nighttime flights, as severe noise pollution (exceeding 105dB(A) in Kowloon City) adversely affected an estimated total of at least 340,000 people.|$|E
500|$|Another {{cardioid}} subwoofer array pattern {{can be used}} horizontally, {{one which}} takes few channels of processing and no change in required physical space. This method is often called [...] "cardioid subwoofer array" [...] or [...] "CSA" [...] even though the pattern of all directional subwoofer methods is cardioid. The CSA method reverses the enclosure orientation and inverts the polarity of <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> subwoofers {{across the front of}} the stage, and delays those enclosures for maximum cancellation of the target frequency on stage. Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically, by reversing the wiring polarity, or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward. This method reduces forward output relative to a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of subwoofers, but can solve problems of unwanted low frequency energy coming into microphones on stage. Compared to the end-fire array, this method has less on-axis energy but more even pattern control throughout the audience, and more predictable cancellation rearward. The effect spans a range of slightly more than one octave.|$|E

2500|$|Because cowboys ranked low in {{the social}} {{structure}} of the period, there are no firm figures on the actual proportion of various races. One writer states that cowboys were [...] "...of two classes—those recruited from Texas and other States on the eastern slope; and Mexicans, from the south-western region..." [...] Census records suggest that about 15% of all cowboys were of African-American ancestry—ranging from about 25% on the trail drives out of Texas, to very few in the northwest. Similarly, cowboys of Mexican descent also averaged about 15% of the total, but were more common in Texas and the southwest. Other estimates suggest that in the late 19th century, <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> cowboys was a Mexican vaquero, and 20% may have been African-American.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to lacking financial resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training {{that are necessary}} to find gainful employment, and also may have several children to support.

2500|$|However, when {{recurring}} fractions {{do occur}} in duodecimal notation, {{they are less}} likely to have a very short period than in decimal notation, because 12 (twelve) is between two prime numbers, 11 (eleven) and 13 (thirteen), whereas ten is adjacent to the composite number 9. Nonetheless, having a shorter or longer period doesn't help the main inconvenience that one does not get a finite representation for such fractions in the given base (so rounding, which introduces inexactitude, is necessary to handle them in calculations), and overall one is more likely to have to deal with infinite recurring digits when fractions are expressed in decimal than in duodecimal, because <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> consecutive numbers contains the prime factor 3 in its factorization, whereas only one out of every five contains the prime factor 5.

[...] During the Polish October of 1956, a political amnesty freed 35,000 former AK soldiers from prisons. Nevertheless, some partisans remained in service, unwilling or simply unable to rejoin the civilian community. The cursed soldier Stanisław Marchewka [...] "Ryba" [...] ("The Fish") was killed in 1957, and the last AK partisan, Józef Franczak [...] "Lalek" [...] ("Doller"), was killed in 1963 — almost two decades after the Second World War ended. Four years later, long after the abolition of Stalinist terror, the last member of the elite British-trained Cichociemny ("The Silent and Hidden") intelligence and support group, Adam Boryczka was finally released from prison (1967).
