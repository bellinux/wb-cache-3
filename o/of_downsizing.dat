5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War, the Army began {{a process}} <b>of</b> <b>downsizing</b> its forces. The Army {{reactivated}} the 29th Infantry Division and began reorganizing its forces and further consolidating them. As a result, the Army decided to downsize the 26th Infantry Division into a brigade, and put it under the command of the 29th Infantry Division. On 1 September 1993, the division was inactivated, and the 26th Infantry Brigade designated in its place, based in Springfield. The 3rd and 43rd brigades, 26th Infantry Division were inactivated, and the 86th Infantry Brigade was put under the command of the 42nd Infantry Division. On 1 October 1995, the division was formally designated the 26th Brigade, 29th Infantry Division. In 2004, the 26th Brigade transitioned into the 26th (Yankee) Infantry Brigade Combat Team.|$|E
5|$|Many workers {{seen in the}} {{background}} of the first season are developed into secondary characters, and romantic relationships begin to develop between some of the characters. Michael spends the night with his boss Jan, {{in the wake of the}} latter's divorce, but does not sleep with her. Dwight and Angela become romantically involved, but keep the relationship a secret from everyone else. Kelly develops a crush on Ryan, and they start dating. When Roy sets a date for his wedding to Pam, Jim grows depressed and considers transferring to the Stamford, Connecticut branch, but tells Pam in the season finale that he loves her, even though Pam still insists she will marry Roy. The two kiss, but Jim transfers to the Stamford branch soon after. The general threat <b>of</b> <b>downsizing</b> continues throughout the season as well.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} thought that {{survivors}} <b>of</b> a <b>downsized</b> organization should {{be thankful for}} remaining in their jobs, {{and that they should}} respond positively by helping the organization to achieve its goals. However, these individuals often have the intention of leaving the organization. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the factors that influence the turnover intention <b>of</b> survivors <b>of</b> <b>downsized</b> organizations. We hypothesized that survivors were more likely to think about leaving their organization when they perceived insecurity in their jobs and considered the downsizing decision taken by top management as a "shock. " We tested this hypothesis on 187 surviving employees <b>of</b> <b>downsized</b> organizations in Malaysia. The important findings of this study are that the survivors' turnover intention is significantly related to shock, job insecurity, and organizational level. Hence, organization leaders need to plan carefully before implementing their organization's downsizing, as shocks do influence survivors' turnover intention...|$|R

She believed that the EPA was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective.

She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries {{they were supposed to be}} regulating.

40|$|Relative to the United States, most European {{countries}} have {{high rates of}} unemployment {{and low levels of}} productivity in manufacturing. To relate these issues, we develop a leader-follower model with endogenous growth and dual labour markets, stressing the role of high-tech and high-wage sectors in trade between countries. The model shows a negative relation between unemployment and growth. The steady state relative productivity level and the corresponding rates of unemployment depend on the relative level of fixed costs in the high-tech sectors <b>of</b> both countries. <b>Downsizing</b> <b>of</b> firms in the leader country raises the worldwide rate <b>of</b> unemployment, whereas <b>downsizing</b> <b>of</b> firms in the follower country enlarges the productivity trap. ...|$|R
