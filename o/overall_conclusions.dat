The National Post used the subheading [...] "IPCC report skeptics seize on lull in global warming". Even Nature headlined their news report [...] "IPCC: Despite hiatus, climate change here to stay", though it said that [...] "the 'hiatus' since the record hot year of 1998 — probably due to increased heat uptake by the oceans — is no sign that global warming has stopped, as some would like to hope", and quoted climatologist Thomas Stocker saying that [...] "Comparing short-term observations with long-term model projections is inappropriate", and adding [...] "We {{know that there is a}} lot of natural fluctuation in the climate system. A 15-year hiatus is not so unusual even though the jury is out as to what exactly may have caused the pause." [...] He said that claims dismissing climate models would only be justified if [...] "temperature were to remain constant for the next 20 years", and Brian Hoskins said other factors showed climate change.|$|E

50|$|Keen's {{full-range}} {{critique of}} neoclassical economics {{is contained in}} his book Debunking Economics. Keen presents {{a wide variety of}} critiques on neoclassical economic theory, and argues that they show neoclassical assumptions are fundamentally flawed. Keen claims that several neoclassical assumptions are empirically unsupported (that is, they are unsupported by observable and repeatable phenomena) nor are they desirable for society at large (that is, they do not necessarily produce either efficiency or equity for the majority). He argues that economists' <b>overall</b> <b>conclusions</b> are very sensitive to small changes in these assumptions.|$|E

Their <b>overall</b> <b>conclusions</b> were that a global peak was imminent (if not already occurring), more wars would be fought to control access to oil resources, and economies most dependent on oil (or relying on trade with oil-dependent nations) would suffer dire consequences rivaling the Great Depression, without the benefit of cheap oil to enable a recovery.|$|E

During the conference the findings and recommendations {{of a study}} recently undertaken by ECAS and the Law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer on the legal basis of the refused ECIs were presented and discussed. The <b>overall</b> <b>conclusions</b> of the Study are that the legal admissibility requirements are applied in a too narrow fashion by the Commission, {{that the decision to}} refuse registration has been arbitrary and that the reasons given for a rejection have been incomplete.|$|E
5000|$|Dynamed - Is a {{clinical}} reference tool created by physicians for physicians {{and other health}} care professionals for use at the point-of-care. With clinically-organized summaries for more than 3,200 topics, DynaMed provides the latest content and resources for answering most clinical questions during practice. Updated daily, DynaMed editors monitor the content of over 500 medical journals on a daily basis. Each article is evaluated for clinical relevance and scientific validity. The new evidence is then integrated with existing content, and <b>overall</b> <b>conclusions</b> are changed as appropriate, representing a synthesis of the best available evidence. Through this process of Systematic Literature Surveillance, the best available evidence determines the content of DynaMed.|$|E
