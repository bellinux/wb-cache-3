25|$|Mechanical fiber splices are {{designed}} to be quicker and easier to install, but there is still the need for stripping, careful cleaning and precision cleaving. The fiber ends are aligned and held together by a precision-made sleeve, often using a clear index-matching gel that enhances the transmission of light across the joint. Such joints typically have higher <b>optical</b> <b>loss</b> and are less robust than fusion splices, especially if the gel is used. All splicing techniques involve installing an enclosure that protects the splice.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes <b>optical</b> <b>loss.</b> A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E

This way, the costsof the solar cells can be reduced by lowering the material consumption and decreasingthe physical constraints on the material quality. In this work, plasmonic light trappingwith Ag back contacts in thin-film silicon solar cells is studied. Solar cell prototypeswith plasmonic back contacts are presented along with optical simulations of thesedevices and general design considerations of plasmonic back contacts. Based on three-dimensional electromagnetic simulations, the conceptual design ofplasmonic nanostructures on Ag back contacts in thin-film silicon solar cells is studiedin this work. Optimizations of the nanostructures regarding their ability to scatterincident light at low <b>optical</b> <b>losses</b> into large angles in the silicon absorber layers ofthe thin-film silicon solar cells are presented.
