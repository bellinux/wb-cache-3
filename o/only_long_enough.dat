In Omaha, Nebraska, the King was {{the guest of honor}} at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of the attendees were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed exhaustion from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels joined the group at Ogden, Utah.|$|E

Departing 30 August the ship headed for California. Due to a case of suspected appendicitis the ship diverted to San Diego which was reached on 14 September where the patient, cadet James J. Sylvester, was put ashore but did not survive an operation. On 17 September the Pathfinder arrived at San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|William Blake {{was born}} on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street (now Broadwick St.) in Soho, London. He was the third of seven children, two of whom died in infancy. Blake's father, James, was a hosier. He {{attended}} school <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to learn reading and writing, leaving {{at the age of}} ten, and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Blake (née Wright). Even though the Blakes were English Dissenters, William was baptised on 11 December at St James's Church, Piccadilly, London. The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake, and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life.|$|E

A satisfactory knowledge of the iEneid of Virgil was necessary for receiving a Latin diploma. The annual number of graduates never exceeded seven, as it was arduous. The majority remained <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to be thoroughly drilled in the various branches of a common school education. Music was one of the special features of the school, but all students were made aware that the highest achievement of a female student was not a musical triumph or a marvel of embroidery.|$|E

25|$|Both {{the plethora}} of parties and the {{defection}} to the majority party were typical of Somali parliamentary elections. To register for elective office, a candidate merely needed either the support of 500 voters or the sponsorship of his clan, expressed through a vote of its traditional assembly. After registering, the office seeker then attempted to become the official candidate of a political party. Failing this, he would remain on the ballot as an individual contestant. Voting was by party list, which could make a candidate a one-person party. (This practice explained not only the proliferation of small parties but also the transient nature of party support.) Many candidates affiliated with a major party <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to use its symbol in the election campaign and, if elected, abandoned it for the winning side {{as soon as the}} National Assembly met. Thus, by the end of May 1969 the SYL parliamentary cohort had swelled from 73 to 109.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as a Rifle Platoon Commander of Company H, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 27 October 1952. With his platoon subjected to an intense mortar and artillery bombardment while preparing to assault a vitally important hill position on the main line of resistance which had been overrun by a numerically superior enemy force on the preceding night, Second Lieutenant O'Brien leaped from his trench when the attack signal was given and, shouting for his men to follow raced across an exposed saddle and up the enemy-held hill through a virtual hail of deadly small-arms, artillery and weapon fire. Although shot through the arm and thrown to the ground by hostile automatic-weapons fire as he neared the well-entrenched enemy position, he bravely regained his feet, waved his men onward and continued to spearhead the assault, pausing <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to go to the aid of a wounded Marine. Encountering the enemy at close range, he proceeded to hurl hand grenades into the bunkers and, utilizing his carbine to best advantage in savage hand-to-hand combat, succeeded in killing at least three of the enemy. Struck down by the concussion of grenades on three occasions during the subsequent action, he steadfastly refused to be evacuated for medical treatment and continued to lead his platoon in the assault for a period of nearly four hours, repeatedly encouraging his men and maintaining superb direction of the unit. With the attack halted, he set up a defense with his remaining forces to prepare for a counterattack, personally checking each position, attending to the wounded and expediting their evacuation. When a relief of the position was effected by another unit, he remained to cover the withdrawal and to assure that no wounded were left behind. By his exceptionally daring and forceful leadership in the face of overwhelming odds, Second Lieutenant O'Brien served as a constant source of inspiration to all who observed him and was greatly instrumental in the recapture of a strategic position on the main line of resistance. His indomitable determination and valiant fighting spirit reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

In the case where a claim was abandoned or not worked upon, other miners would [...] "claim-jump" [...] the land. [...] "Claim-jumping" [...] meant that a miner began work on a previously claimed site. Disputes were often handled personally and violently, and were sometimes addressed by groups of prospectors acting as arbitrators. This often led to heightened ethnic tensions.

500|$|The Sognsvann Line was {{upgraded}} to metro standard and reopened on 3 April 1993. The Røa Line was closed on 5 February 1995 to be {{upgraded to}} metro standard. The upgrades meant that all platforms {{needed to be}} extended to [...] to allow six-car metro trains. The only exception was Østerås, that was made <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for five cars, although this could easily be extended later. The upgrade involved a complete renovation of the tracks, with the old ones being replaced with new, and increasing the weight to 49kilograms per meter (33lb/ft). The overhead wire was replaced with a third rail; this required all four level crossings, at Makrellbekken, Hovseter, Eiksmarka and Ekraveien, to be replaced. In the former three, the track was sunk under {{the level of the}} road, requiring several hundred meters of the line to be rebuilt. Pedestrian underpasses were built at Ekreveien, Borgen, Holmen, Huseby skole and Lijordet.|$|E

500|$|After {{their first}} trip to the Himalaya and {{subsequent}} labor problems, the Workmans hired Matthias Zurbriggen, the best and most experienced mountain climbing guide of the time. Thus, in 1899, with 50 local porters and Zurbriggen, the Workmans began to explore the Biafo Glacier in the Karakoram, but dangerous crevasses and poor weather forced them instead to shift to the Skoro La Glacier and the unclimbed peaks around it. They reached Siegfriedhorn, an 18,600-foot (5,700 m) summit that she named after her son, giving Fanny an altitude record for women at the time. They next camped at [...] and climbed a higher peak of , naming it Mount Bullock Workman. Admiring the view of a far-off mountain, they commented on the grand view: they were looking at K2, the second-highest mountain in the world.

It was very challenging: they had to hire new porters, establish a new base camp, and remain overnight at around [...] In the morning, they climbed a wall that measured , and were buffeted by winds. During the summit push, Fanny's fingers were so numb that she could no longer hold her ice ax and one of the porters abandoned them. Pauly writes, [...] "propelled to the summit by adrenalin and desperation, the foursome lingered <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for their instruments to assess that the temperature was ten degrees Fahrenheit [...] and their elevation was 21,000 feet." [...] Fanny was a [...] "slow, relentless, and intrepid" [...] climber; [...] "bearlike, she solidly planted one foot and then groped for another secure grip with the other". Climbing {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, she did not have specialized equipment like pitons or carabiners. She was able to climb to such heights, Pauly argues, because of [...] "her dauntless persistence and her immunity to altitude sickness".|$|E
