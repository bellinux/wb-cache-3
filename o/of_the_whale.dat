5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can {{become the focus of}} public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples from each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> populations {{concluded}} {{the northern and}} southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale. The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E

5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long {{distances}} underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale,</b> watching is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones {{to listen to the}} clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale,</b> because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E

2500|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> {{has been}} killed, {{a crew member}} called the [...] "diver" [...] jumps {{into the water and}} cuts a hole through the bottom and top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale's</b> jaw, to which a tow line and float are attached.

5|$|Captive whales have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech.

25|$|Marine life {{is known}} {{to exist in the}} estuary, with seals, crabs, and some whales reported. On March 29, 1647, a white whale swam up the river to the Rensselaerswyck (near Albany).

25|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the pelagic whaling fleet after 1835 into the range of the North Pacific right whale, the whale's {{population}} size, at least {{in the eastern part of}} its range, was probably at its original population size—in the range of 20,000–30,000 whales. The part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> population in the west around Japan may have been reduced from its original size as a result of the historic net whaling.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>whale</b> songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one {{purpose is to}} attract females. However, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|R
40|$|A diffuse {{aggregation}} of dwarf minke <b>whales</b> {{occurs in}} <b>the</b> northern Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) during the austral winter months. <b>The</b> <b>whales</b> voluntarily approach dive tourism vessels and their passengers and maintain contact for prolonged periods (mean[*]±[*]SE[*]=[*] 3. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 57  h). We report on 521 industry-wide dwarf minke whale encounters (2006 – 2007) and provide detailed analyses of 20 encounters in 2006 and 18 in 2007 from the vessel Undersea Explorer. <b>The</b> <b>whales</b> surfaced significantly more often within a 60  m radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel than expected, and aggregated especially around swimmers. <b>The</b> inquisitiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> creates several management issues including compliance difficulties for non-swim-with <b>whales</b> endorsed operations. <b>The</b> whales' close and prolonged association with vessels and swimmers indicates a strong attraction {{of these animals}} to the stimulus and raises concerns about <b>the</b> wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> and <b>the</b> swimming participants. Preventing these encounters would be difficult without banning dive tourism in the GBRWHA for several months. Several management strategies are highlighted and broader education is recommended to reduce <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> adverse impacts on <b>the</b> <b>whales...</b>|$|R

25|$|During the Second World War Japan's whaling was {{significantly}} limited to more familiar hunting grounds, {{such as the}} Bonin Islands, to provide meat and oil for domestic and military use. Whaling there was halted in March, 1945 when the islands were taken by US forces. By November 1945 the whaling stations received permission to reopen; however, most whaling ships had been commandeered by the Japanese navy, {{and by the end}} of the war the factory ships and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> catchers had been sunk.|$|E

25|$|After the {{moratorium}} came into force in 1986, the Scientific Committee was commissioned {{to review the}} status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> stocks and develop a calculation method for setting safe catch limits.

With such populations, it was submitted, 2000 minke whales could be harvested annually without endangering the population. Despite this, the IWC Plenary Committee voted to maintain the blanket moratorium on whaling, arguing that formulas for determining allowable catches {{had not yet been}} adequately evaluated.|$|E
