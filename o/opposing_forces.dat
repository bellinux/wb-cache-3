5|$|After 5:00 pm, Custer's {{division}} (including Capehart's brigade) remounted, {{and attacked}} a Confederate battery. The battery {{was unable to}} shoot low enough to hit the charging cavalry, and was soon captured. The rebels responded with a Rebel yell, and soon the <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> were fighting in close combat using sabers. Because of their position on the field, most of the Union casualties in this encounter belonged to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry—but {{a large portion of}} the loss was from wounds that were not lethal.|$|E
5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry attacked from the south and west. Capehart's brigade attacked from the southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E
5|$|After a few skirmishes, the <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> met {{in earnest}} at Edgehill, on 23 October 1642. Charles's nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine {{disagreed}} with the battle strategy of the royalist commander Lord Lindsey, and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by Lord Forth. Rupert's cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, but instead of swiftly returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and bled to death without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.|$|E

50|$|Armoured Infantry (A.I) battalions shared similar traits as {{compared}} towards their regular Infantry counterparts (roles such as Advancing towards an <b>opposing</b> <b>force,</b> Assaulting an <b>opposing</b> <b>force</b> dug in positions and Delaying an <b>opposing</b> <b>force</b> advancement) but {{the differences are}} each section in an A.I of an A.I platoon have their own individual armoured tracked platform, A.I platoon carry more firepower on a dismounted role {{as compared}} to regular infantry and A.I platoons specialise conducting water bodies crossing with their armoured platforms through flotation devices.|$|R
5|$|Before every battle, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice of using 'Political Tactics,' such as {{increasing}} or decreasing time limit of battles or preventing enemy reinforcements from arriving during battles. The player can also secure alliances with other forces; these alliances can change how the game progresses, such as requesting reinforcements from the allied forces against <b>opposing</b> <b>forces.</b> However, these alliances only last for a set time decided by the tactic used. There's also an 'Archives Mode' that shows the motions and voices of the officers. A gallery of character artworks and game movies is also presented within the Archives Mode.|$|E
5|$|In early 1863, Major General James Longstreet {{was given}} {{command of the}} Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His {{objectives}} were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied {{a position on the}} right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the Nansemond River. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.|$|E
5|$|Post independence, the British honours {{and awards}} system informally came to an end. But then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru decided to give gallantry awards for the ongoing {{conflict}} in Jammu and Kashmir. Though Indian and Pakistan still had the option to award the British honours, the leaders felt {{that it would be}} witless to give the same honour for personnel from <b>opposing</b> <b>forces.</b> So it was decided to institute new awards. In June 1948, the new awards, known as Param Vir Chakra(PVC), Maha Vir Chakra(MVC), and Vir Chakra(VrC) were finalized.|$|E

5|$|Reports of {{this first}} contact between <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated, with many local reports {{claiming}} it {{as some kind of}} victory. The Quebec Gazette, for example, reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1,500 Americans, killing 30 and wounding 40. Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten percent of their militia. Officers of the militia reported to Montreal, but many militia men stayed home. By September 7, a troop of about 120 men was raised, which was sent to Fort St. Jean.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 22 August 1795 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of four British Royal Navy frigates and two frigates and a cutter from the Navy of the Batavian Republic. The engagement was fought off the Norwegian coastal island of Eigerøya, then in Danish Norway, the <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> engaged in protecting their respective countries' trade routes to the Baltic Sea. War between Britain and the Batavian Republic began, undeclared, {{in the spring of}} 1795 after the Admiralty ordered British warships to intercept Batavian shipping following the conquest of the Dutch Republic by the French Republic in January 1795.|$|E

Even though the special police units which captured the Plitvice Lakes area did pull out on 2 April, a newly established Croatian police station, staffed by 90 officers, remained in place. The police station was blockaded by the JNA three months later, and captured in late August 1991.|$|E

5|$|As the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army made {{preparations}} for its war against Vietnam, state-controlled media in Vietnam sent congratulatory {{messages to the}} Government of the Democratic Kampuchea on {{the second anniversary of}} its establishment, on 17 April 1977. On 30 April 1977, the second anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the Kampuchean reply {{came in the form of}} a military attack against the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang and Châu Đốc, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians. The Vietnam People's Army responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and, on 7 June 1977, Vietnam proposed high-level talks to discuss outstanding issues. On 18 June 1977, the Kampuchean Government replied by demanding that Vietnam remove all of its military units from the disputed areas, and create a demilitarised zone between the <b>opposing</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves {{in the center of}} a huge administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming <b>opposing</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|E

5|$|Descent: FreeSpace – The Great War, {{also known}} as Conflict: FreeSpace – The Great War in Europe, is a 1998 space combat {{simulation}} IBM PC compatible computer game developed by Volition, when it was split off from Parallax Software, and published by Interplay Productions. In 2001, it was ported to the Amiga platform as FreeSpace: The Great War by Hyperion Entertainment. The game places players {{in the role of}} a human pilot, who operates in several classes of starfighter and combats against <b>opposing</b> <b>forces,</b> either human or alien, in various space-faring environments, such as in orbit above a planet or within an asteroid belt. The story of the game's single player campaign focuses on a war in the 24th century between two factions, one human and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of an enigmatic and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} {{with an emphasis}} on stealth action and the use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate <b>opposing</b> <b>forces.</b> The game world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused areas designed for multiple avenues of exploration in terms of in-game movement and powers. Between missions, the player is taken to a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character Corvo can meet with his allies, receive mission briefings and alternate objectives, and convert recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades. In-game areas include loading docks, royal estates, poverty-stricken streets, and a bathhouse. The player can save their progress anywhere, and the game includes a checkpoint save system. Saving is disabled during combat. The game has four difficulty levels which modify the effectiveness of health and mana (magic) potions, and enemies' awareness, damage delivered, and responsiveness. In the easy setting, health regeneration is possible.|$|E
5|$|Further tragedy soon {{followed}} when Victoria's son, George, died of bone cancer the following year. Her granddaughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, remembered her grandmother's tears. In World War II Victoria was bombed out of Kensington Palace, and {{spent some time}} at Windsor Castle with King George VI. Her surviving son, Louis, and two of her grandsons served in the Royal Navy, while her German relations fought with the <b>opposing</b> <b>forces.</b> She {{spent most of her}} time reading and worrying about her children; her daughter, Alice, remained in occupied Greece and was unable to communicate with her mother for four years {{at the height of the}} war. After the Allied victory, her son, Louis, was offered the post of Viceroy of India, but she was deeply opposed to his accepting, knowing that the position would be dangerous and difficult. He accepted anyway.|$|E
50|$|In {{military}} tactics, a flanking maneuver, or flanking manoeuvre (also {{called a}} flank attack), {{is an attack}} on the sides of an <b>opposing</b> <b>force.</b> If a flanking maneuver succeeds, the <b>opposing</b> <b>force</b> would be surrounded from two or more directions, which significantly reduces the maneuverability of the outflanked force and its ability to defend itself.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the best-known}} {{examples}} of specialist operations is the United States OPFOR. During the Cold War, <b>opposing</b> <b>force</b> units employed Soviet military doctrine and simulated Soviet equipment; {{since the fall of}} the USSR, US <b>opposing</b> <b>force</b> units have become more flexible to represent a wider range of opponents. More recently training has focused on Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|R
5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts and advisers were operating. Largely because of his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently <b>opposing</b> <b>forces</b> of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Michael of Epirus, however, marshalled his forces, and was {{reinforced}} with {{men from the}} Principality of Achaea and the Latin states of southern Greece under Prince William II of Villehardouin himself, {{as well as a}} Sicilian contingent. Further forces were provided by Michael II's bastard son, John Doukas, ruler of Thessaly. The allied force was clearly superior in numbers to the Nicaean army, and John Palaiologos avoided direct confrontation, instead using his mobile Turkish and Cuman horse archers to wear down the <b>opposing</b> <b>forces.</b> In addition, the allied army was divided by conflicting aims and the hatred between the Epirote Greeks and the Latins. A quarrel with William II led to the withdrawal of the Epirote army and the temporary defection of John Doukas to the Nicaean camp. The next day, the Nicaean forces attacked the Latins and secured a crushing victory; William II himself and many other barons were taken prisoner, while most of the Latin soldiery was killed or captured.|$|E
