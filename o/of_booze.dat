25|$|The Purple Gang was reputedly {{suspected}} of {{taking part in}} the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. On February 13, 1929, Abe Bernstein had reputedly called Bugs Moran and told him that a hijacked load <b>of</b> <b>booze</b> {{was on its way to}} Chicago. Moran, who was in the middle of a turf war with Capone, had only recently begun to trust Bernstein, who had previously been Capone's chief supplier of Canadian liquor. The next day, instead of delivering a load of liquor, five men dressed as policemen went to S.M.C. Cartage on North Clark Street (Moran's North Side hangout) and opened fire with machine guns, killing seven men in what has become known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.|$|E
25|$|Although Angie {{tries to}} stop drinking, her {{attempts}} always fail dismally {{and by the}} end of the year she is arrested for drink-driving when she crashes Den's car on the way home from a darts match. In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail <b>of</b> <b>booze</b> and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as he has more pressing things on his mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E
500|$|When we {{were doing}} the oyster bar, we wanted a turn-of-the-20th-century, early-1900s styleâ€”what you would find in Slidell, a po' boy shop with good gumbo and jambalaya, a little rowdy, where people {{consumed}} a lot <b>of</b> <b>booze.</b> The idea behind The Parish is to take it uptown, to the 1920s ... and (New Orleans') Garden District.|$|E

The film displayed Hazelwood's portrait prominently aboard their flagship, also called Exxon Valdez.

This is yet another reference to accusations that Hazelwood was intoxicated {{at the time of the}} spill.|$|E
500|$|Prohibition {{became the}} major {{issue of the}} campaign. Though both Stanley and Beckham were known to drink liquor, Beckham campaigned on a pro-temperance platform. Stanley, an {{opponent}} of prohibition, criticized Beckham's position as hypocritical, saying of pro-temperance politicians in general and Beckham in particular [...] "They keep full <b>of</b> <b>booze</b> and introduce bills to punish the man who sells it to them." [...] " [...] would sell out the world {{to go to the}} Senate," [...] he added. [...] The support of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson and Representative Ben Johnson were not enough to carry Stanley to victory. Beckham secured the Democratic nomination by almost 7,000 votes and {{went on to win the}} seat in the general election.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta {{thought of}} the idea of Barney sobering up early in the series. He wrote a script {{together}} with his wife Deb Lacusta. They offered their script to showrunner Al Jean. Jean liked the story, but felt that it was too similar to a script the writers were already working on, [...] "Duffless", so he turned it down. Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes. Their script became the eleventh season episode [...] "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses", which first aired April 9, 2000. The episode was directed by Neil Affleck, who said that he had [...] "a vested interest in getting Barney sober." [...] However, some of the writing staff was opposed to the episode as they felt Barney sober would not be funny. Castellaneta commented, [...] "He's still a goofy man-child...he's still got 15 years <b>of</b> <b>booze</b> left in his veins." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pete Townshend, who {{performed}} with The Who {{later in the}} same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said the following in his 2012 memoir: [...] "She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount <b>of</b> <b>booze</b> and heroin she'd consumed while she waited.

2500|$|The {{rare and}} wonderfully warm {{observations}} Berry made of working people {{are perhaps the}} most enduring: [...] "old women, who sat night after night, squat as frogs, drinking, watching, eating and taking all in", [...] "and the publican had got a clean collar and tie on, and all the world was ship-shape--this was happiness." [...] "I once saw a pot-woman dance an impromptu fertility dance...the woman sitting with him had knees the size of hams, and drank a case of bottled beer as she sat there." [...] And [...] "then there are the princes of drink, men high in the hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>booze,</b> popes of the tap-room...they manage to live and live with style; to smoke and drink and back horses without ever seeming to concern themselves about money...savour the full richness of the working class who can live without work...I have known such men rear big families on the dole, and strut up the street with a rose in their buttonhole." [...] Then there are the [...] "ordinary men who cannot make ends meet and are under the rule of women...lesser men, who are pestered by women and children, whooping cough and rashes of one sort or another...troubles that reduce an honest man to a worrying machine...all the bellyaching and mither and half-pint scrimping that bogs most men down...the poverty, and the poverty of just being able to make ends meet... bosses and women and children [...] pull men down from their dignity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among critics, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times, {{gave the}} film two {{stars in a}} mostly {{negative}} review, saying the film lacked a science fiction theme and was more akin to a police murder revenge flick, musing [...] "they've just taken the standard cop-buddy-drug lord routine and changed some of the makeup. The Newcomers have no surprises." [...] Regarding the fictional alien culture, he expressed disappointment saying [...] "a feeble attempt is made to invest the Newcomers with interest, by having them get drunk on sour milk instead <b>of</b> <b>booze,</b> and depriving them of any sense of humor." [...] However, on a slightly complimentary note, Ebert mentioned [...] "the makeup took trouble, the photography looks good, the cast and technical credits are top-drawer." [...] But overall, he summed it up by declaring [...] "Alien Nation feels like a movie made {{by people who have}} seen a lot of movies, but don't think the audience has." [...] In agreement with Ebert over the originality of the buddy cop genre with the aliens inserted in as just a new rendition, Rita Kempley of The Washington Post said, [...] "Alien Nation wants to be [...] "In the Heat of the Night" [...] as science fiction, but it's neither morally instructive nor prophetic. It proves a lumbering marriage of action and sci-fi that alienates both audiences. It's too dull for one and too dumb for the other." [...] Kempley did find the first half hour to be suspenseful, though: [...] "... well paced, brawny and intense, looks like it was made by another director. But the rest is the cinematic equivalent of overcooked asparagus." [...] However, the more enthusiastic staff of Variety found originality in the extraterrestrialâ€“injected plot saying, [...] "Solid performances by leads James Caan and his humanoid buddy-cop partner Mandy Patinkin move this production beyond special effects, clever alien makeup and car chases." [...] while also adding the film was a [...] "compelling human-humanoid drama." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Berry's {{autobiography}} A Three and Sevenpence Halfpenny Man {{he wrote}} {{of his childhood}} and of his daily life at Burslem School of Art.

It's amazing the quantity <b>of</b> <b>booze</b> thirty plunks will buy, and it is equally amazing the quantity <b>of</b> <b>booze</b> outside of which twenty stiffs will get. Beer and cheap wine made up the card, with alcohol thrown in for the blowd-in-the-glass stiffs. It was great--an orgy under the sky, a contest of beaker-men, a study in primitive beastliness. To me there is something fascinating in a drunken man, and were I a college president I should institute P.G. psychology courses in practical drunkenness.
