25|$|Wine tasting (often, in wine circles, simply tasting) is {{the sensory}} {{examination}} {{and evaluation of}} wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers <b>or</b> <b>buyers</b> for retailers) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology {{which is used to}} describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers <b>or</b> <b>buyers</b> use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E

25|$|These {{services}} {{facilitate the}} transaction and redistribution of unwanted, yet perfectly usable, {{materials and equipment}} from one entity to another. The entities that benefit from either side of this service (as donors, sellers, recipients, <b>or</b> <b>buyers)</b> can be businesses, nonprofits, schools, community groups, and individuals. Some maintain a physical space (a reuse center), and others act as a matching service (a virtual exchange). Reuse centers generally maintain both warehouses and trucks. They take possession of the donated materials and make them available for redistribution or sale. Virtual exchanges do not have physical space or trucks, but instead allow users to post listings of materials available and wanted (for free or at low cost) on an online materials exchange website. Staff will help facilitate the exchange of these materials without ever taking possession of the materials.|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, in {{reference}} to Hannah Montana, commented, [...] "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." [...] Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was {{unable or unwilling to}} [...] "give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means. For all its eye-popping detail, the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show <b>or</b> <b>buyers</b> of her records don't already know about her." [...] Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated, [...] "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides a moment for her to catch her breath, and she's still able to deliver." [...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take a backseat to the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change. It's a tacky moment and doesn't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range. Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show, stating that it was [...] "a pure visual spectacle", but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus' personality.|$|E
2500|$|By {{confining}} {{themselves to}} limiting {{cases in which}} sellers <b>or</b> <b>buyers</b> are both [...] "price takers"nbsp&– so that demand functions ignore supply functions or vice versanbsp&– Marshallian marginalists and neoclassical economists produced tractable models of [...] "pure" [...] or [...] "perfect" [...] competition and of various forms of [...] "imperfect" [...] competition, which models are usually captured by relatively simple graphs. [...] Other marginalists have sought to present {{what they thought of}} as more realistic explanations, but this work has been relatively uninfluential on the mainstream of economic thought.|$|E

60|$|At {{one time}} there seemed a {{probability}} of the {{enlargement of the}} author's gains by subscription publication, and one very well-known American author prospered fabulously in that way. The percentage offered by the subscription houses was only about {{half as much as}} that paid by the trade, but the sales were so much greater that the author could very well afford to take it. Where the book-dealer sold ten, the book-agent sold a hundred; or at least he did so in the case of Mark Twain's books; and we all thought it reasonable he could do so with ours. Such of us as made experiment of him, however, found the facts illogical. No book of literary quality was made to go by subscription except Mr. Clemens's books, and I think these went because the subscription public never knew what good literature they were. This sort of readers, <b>or</b> <b>buyers,</b> were so used to getting something worthless for their money that they would not spend it for artistic fiction, or, indeed, for any fiction at all except Mr. Clemens's, which they probably supposed bad. Some good books of travel had a measurable success through the book-agents, but not at all the success that had been hoped for; and I believe now the subscription trade again publishes only compilations, or such works as owe more to the skill of the editor than the art of the writer. Mr. Clemens himself no longer offers his books to the public in that way.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether transactions where the <b>buyer</b> (<b>or</b> seller) always moves {{first and the}} seller (<b>or</b> <b>buyer)</b> always moves second in the exchange give higher payoffs than transactions {{in which it is}} randomly determined who moves first. We examine the effect of two treatment variables: partners versus strangers, and fixed versus changing positions. We find that both with fixed and with changing positions, second movers take advantage of their position by exploiting the first mover. But with fixed positions, exploitation occurs significantly less, while reciprocal exchanges happen more often. However, fixed positions result in very unevenly distributed payoffs. ...|$|R
