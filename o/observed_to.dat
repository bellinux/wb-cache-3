5|$|A few non-essential {{heavy metals}} have been <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> have {{biological}} effects. Gallium, germanium (a metalloid), indium, and most lanthanides can stimulate metabolism, and titanium promotes growth in plants (though {{it is not}} always considered a heavy metal).|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{additional}} alkali and alkaline neptunium oxide compounds such as Cs4Np5O17 and Cs2Np3O10 have been characterized with various production methods. Neptunium has also been <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> form ternary oxides with many additional elements in groups 3 through 7, although these compounds are much less well studied.|$|E
5|$|Although nearby GRBs hitting Earth with a {{destructive}} shower of gamma rays are only hypothetical events, high energy processes across the galaxy have been <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> affect the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{seasonal}} changes, the cloud bands {{in the southern}} hemisphere of Neptune have been <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980 {{and is expected to}} last until about 2020. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.|$|E
5|$|Changes in Earth's {{magnetic}} field on a time scale {{of a year}} or more are referred to as secular variation. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> vary over tens of degrees. A movie on the right shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b has an orbital {{inclination}} of 86.7º {{as seen from}} Earth. The planet is, thus, almost edge-on when seen from Earth. The planet has been <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> transit its host star.|$|E

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} tungsten {{consists of}} five isotopes whose half-lives are {{so long that}} they can be considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year. The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> decay, constraining their half-lives to be at least 4×1021 years.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{its native}} range, F.rubiginosa has naturalised {{to some degree}} in urban Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia, as well as New Zealand, Hawaii and California, and Mediterranean Europe. F. rubiginosa has been planted widely in Malta since the early 1990s but has not been <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> fruit.|$|E

5|$|Red pandas are {{excellent}} climbers, and forage largely in trees. They eat mostly bamboo, and may eat small mammals, birds, eggs, flowers, and berries.

5|$|Some of Catawissa Creek's tributaries {{are known}} to contain trout, but the creek itself does not contain any fish due to {{pollution}} from acidic mine drainage. In 1966, some woodcocks were <b>observed</b> <b>to</b> live along Catawissa Creek.|$|E
