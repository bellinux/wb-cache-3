5|$|Critical {{infrastructure}} and infrastructure services {{are vital to}} the functionality of modern society, to provide: medical care, policing, emergency services, and lifelines such as water, wastewater, and power and transportation links. Often critical facilities themselves are dependent on such lifelines for <b>operability,</b> which makes them vulnerable to both direct impacts from a hazard event and indirect effects from lifeline disruption.|$|E
5|$|Developed in the 2000s at an {{investment}} of US$2 million after IDF commitments for 1,200 units, some AIL jobs {{were believed to be}} in jeopardy following a mid-2005 announcement that the IDF would purchase 100 US sold Land Rover Defender-based MDT David. The announcement provoked threats of protests from AIL's management and labourers, who had recently faced the blow of local Humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations. The MDT David was chosen over the armoured version of the Storm because the heavy Storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems, safety hazards and limited mission <b>operability.</b> However the IDF said that the purchase of the David was to fill a temporary gap in production until the Storm II's testing was completed, and has since begun filling its commitment.|$|E
5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and <b>operability.</b> As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the T class (EMD G8) diesel electric locomotive from 1955 onwards on VR's branchline network spelled {{the beginning of the}} end for the K class, with Ks gradually being retired as successive orders of Ts were delivered throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Even so, their reliable and low-cost <b>operability</b> ensured they remained in service around various yards and depots as shunters and workshop pilots until the Y class (EMD G6B) locomotive eventually superseded them in this role.|$|E
25|$|The Beretta 92's open slide design ensures smooth {{feeding and}} {{ejection}} of ammunition and allows easy clearing of obstructions. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy and <b>operability</b> with suppressors {{due to the}} in-line travel of the barrel. This {{is in contrast to}} the complex travel of Browning designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much easier.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} prior to the sinking, the Coast Guard had had to assist Aquilo on three {{different}} occasions, specifically on August 25, 1966, when the vessel was taking on water while in drydock in Seattle on Lake Union, on September 4, 1966, when the vessel reported itself to be disabled at sea 10 {{miles west of the}} mouth of the Rogue River at Gold Beach, Oregon, and, on the same day, the Aquilo having been restored to <b>operability,</b> when the Coast Guard was asked to escort the Aquilo into the Northern California port of Crescent City, because the crew did not have sufficient knowledge of the waters of that area.|$|E
500|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal disease unless all the tumors can be fully resected (cut out surgically). Since the <b>operability</b> of the tumor can only be assessed during surgery in most cases, a majority of patients undergo exploratory surgery unless there is already a clear indication that the tumor is inoperable.

However, {{in an interview with}} Famitsu, the game's producer Masachika Kawata revealed the reason for the drastic change in gameplay: according to him, [...] "Wii users like easiness" [...] and that a Resident Evil 4-style game is [...] "too complicated" [...] for Wii users to enjoy. Masachika Kawata then elaborated that [...] "complex <b>operability</b> can be an obstacle for Wii users", and that he purposefully had to [...] "compromise to a lower difficulty level" [...] and [...] "reduce enthusiast-only elements".|$|E
2500|$|The Harrier II's cockpit has day {{and night}} <b>operability</b> and is {{equipped}} with head-up display (HUD), two head-down displays known as multi-purpose colour displays (MPCD), a digital moving map, an inertial navigation system (INS), and a hands-on-throttle-and-stick system (HOTAS). Like the British Aerospace Sea Harrier, the Harrier II used an elevated bubble canopy to provide a significantly improved all-round view. A combination of the new design of the control system and the greater [...] stability of the aircraft made the Harrier II fundamentally easier to fly than the first generation Harrier GR1/GR3 models.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Dr. Edgar Hardin {{became the}} University Interim President. Chuck Julian, as President of the MSU Railroad Club, {{went to his}} {{reception}} and made an appointment to see him.

2500|$|Kulluk {{originally}} had no propulsion {{and had to}} be towed to location. In 2006, Shell contracted Aker Arctic to evaluate the feasibility of adding a thruster-aided propulsion to the drilling barge. In 2007, Kulluk was fitted with two 62-tonne, [...] ThrustMaster hydraulic overboard azimuth thrusters, the largest ever supplied by the company, to provide the platform an ability to move between drill sites and improve her <b>operability</b> in ice. However, before the system had been installed completely, the project was already delayed and subsequently halted due to regulatory and operational changes. In 2011, it was decided to remove the thrusters while Kulluk was on the shipyard and sell them, turning Kulluk into an unpropelled drilling barge again.|$|E
2500|$|The Hornet is also {{notable for}} having been {{designed}} to reduce maintenance, {{and as a result}} has required far less downtime than its heavier counterparts, the F-14 Tomcat and the A-6 Intruder. Its mean time between failures is three times greater than any other Navy strike aircraft, and requires half the maintenance time. [...] Its General Electric F404 engines were also innovative in that they were designed with <b>operability,</b> reliability and maintainability first. The engine, while unexceptional in rated performance, demonstrates exceptional robustness under various conditions and is resistant to stall and flameout. [...] The F404 engine connects to the airframe at only 10 points and can be replaced without special equipment; a four-person team can remove the engine within 20 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, {{directed}} DOE {{to assess}} the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) evaluated the potential impacts on legacy vehicles and other engines. In a preliminary report released in October 2008, NREL described the effects of E10, E15 and E20 on tailpipe and evaporative emissions, catalyst and engine durability, vehicle driveability, engine <b>operability,</b> and vehicle and engine materials. This preliminary report found {{that none of the}} vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light; no fuel filter plugging symptoms were observed; no cold start problems were observed at [...] and [...] under laboratory conditions; and all test vehicles exhibited a loss in fuel economy proportional to ethanol's lower energy density. For example, E20 reduced average fuel economy by 7.7% when compared to gas-only (E0) test vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which {{mandates}} an increase in renewable fuels for the transport sector, the U.S. Department of Energy began assessments for the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet as a way to allow higher consumption of ethanol fuel. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted tests to evaluate the potential impacts of intermediate ethanol blends on legacy vehicles and other engines. In a preliminary report released in October 2008, the NREL presented the results of the first evaluations of the effects of E10, E15 and E20 gasoline blends on tailpipe and evaporative emissions, catalyst and engine durability, vehicle driveability, engine <b>operability,</b> and vehicle and engine materials. This preliminary report found none of the vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light as {{a result of}} the ethanol blend used; no fuel filter plugging symptoms were observed; no cold start problems were observed at [...] and [...] laboratory conditions; and as expected, computer technology available in newer model vehicles adapts to the higher octane causing lower emissions with greater horsepower and in some cases greater fuel economy.|$|E
2500|$|Survival Flight has an {{excellent}} safety record and intense maintenance program. The aero-medical aviation sector has a high accident rate per hours flown due to its requirement to operate in almost all weather conditions and due to urgent transportation needs. Survival Flight has only suffered one crew and equipment loss. On June 4, 2007, a Cessna 550 Citation II provided by Marlin Air, Inc. plunged into Lake Michigan after experiencing a [...] "trim runaway" [...] problem. In September 2008, a legal settlement was reached between University of Michigan and Marlin Air, Inc. after a lawsuit was filed because the university terminated its contract for air medical transportation services. Results of the NTSB investigation placed blame on the deficiencies and inadequate checkrides instituted by the chief pilot of Marlin Air, Inc., cited an [...] "ill-prepared pilot in the first officer's seat", and also placed blame on the FAA's inability to detect such training and operational deficiencies. In 2009, Survival Flight once again began to operate fixed-wing service in a new Cessna Citation Encore out of KPTK airport in Waterford Township, Michigan and in 2013 moved fixed-wing operations to KOZW airport in Howell, Michigan. The new Cessna Citation Encore's extended <b>operability</b> allows Survival Flight to provide aeromedical evacuation [...] "as far away as the Caribbean and Mexico".|$|E
