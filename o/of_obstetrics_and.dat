500|$|Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, {{has said}} that {{there appear to be}} many [...] "inaccuracies and contradictions" [...] in {{accounts}} of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £ as of [...] ) to White, a pioneer <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> {{one of the founders of}} the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£ as of [...] ), and that £400 (£ as of [...] ) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick's will and that he received the £400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid. Having Beswick embalmed therefore allowed him to keep the whole amount. Alternatively it has been suggested that White was considerably in debt to Beswick, a debt that would have to be repaid after the funeral, which was avoided by her embalming, but Beswick's will names Mary Graeme and Esther Robinson as her executors, not White. In 1866, more than 100years after her death, the details of Beswick's will were still being disputed.|$|E
