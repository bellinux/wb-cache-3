50|$|Approximately 39 American and 51 German {{tanks were}} destroyed, damaged or abandoned. Recovery of {{disabled}} vehicles {{was very difficult}} due to the complete lack of cover.

40|$|Abstract. Operational {{reporting}} {{differs from}} informational reporting in that its scope is on day-to-day operations and thus requires {{data on the}} detail of individual transactions. It is often not desirable to maintain data on such detailed level in the data warehouse, due to both exploding size of the warehouse and the update frequency required for <b>operational</b> <b>reports.</b> Using an ODS as the source for operational reporting exhibits a similar information latency. In this paper, we propose an OLTP database architecture that serves the conventional OLTP load out of a row-store database and serves operational reporting queries out of a column-store database which holds the subset of the data in the row store required for <b>operational</b> <b>reports.</b> The column store is updated within the transaction of the row database, hence OLTP changes are directly reflected in <b>operational</b> <b>reports.</b> We also propose the virtual cube as a method for consuming <b>operational</b> <b>reports</b> from a conventional warehousing environment.

40|$|Data {{warehouses}} {{perform better}} with Column Stores as they involve analytical applications like {{reporting from the}} information present in them. However, there are reports other than the Informational reports that business organizations need. Real-time reports, called the <b>Operational</b> <b>Reports</b> are needed. Operational reporting differs from informational reporting in that its scope is on day-to-day operations and thus requires data on the detail of individual transactions. It is often not desirable to maintain data on such detailed level in the data warehouse and the update frequency required for <b>operational</b> <b>reports.</b> Therefore, a Hybrid Row-Column database architecture is proposed. An OLTP database architecture that serves the conventional OLTP load out of a row-store database and serves operational reporting queries out of a column-store database which holds the subset of the data in the row store required for <b>operational</b> <b>reports.</b> The column-store is updated within the transaction of the row database; hence OLTP changes are directly reflected in <b>operational</b> <b>reports.</b> The project done with SAP AG have been studied {{and the results of}} are described here. The described solution for Operational Reporting was implemented in SAP Business ByDesign and SAP Business Warehouse. Row and Column stores along with their applications have been briefed. Then Operational Reporting is described as being different from Informational Reporting and the need for Operational reporting is identified. As the Hybrid Row-Column Database Architecture for Operational reporting solution was implemented in SAP Business ByDesign and SAP Business Warehouse, SAP Business ByDesign, TREX and MaxDB have been discussed briefly...|$|E
