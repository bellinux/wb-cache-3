25|$|An {{ordinary}} camera {{could be}} used to take the three pictures, by reloading it and changing filters between exposures, but pioneering color photographers usually built or bought special cameras that made the procedure less awkward and time-consuming. One of the two main types used beam splitters to produce three separate images in the camera, making all three exposures {{at the same time and}} from the same viewpoint. Although a camera of this type was ideal in theory, such cameras were optically complicated and delicate, and liable to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Some designs were also subject to optical phenomena that could cause noticeably uneven color or other defects in the results. The other, more robust type was an essentially ordinary camera with a special sliding holder for the plates and filters that allowed each in turn to be efficiently shifted into position for exposure—an operation sometimes partly or even entirely automated with a pneumatic mechanism or spring-powered motor.|$|E

As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. [...] All gears were vanadium steel running in an oil bath.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the Italian {{multicultural}} {{system in}} which religious practices are finding new channels of existence and expression the concept of public order represents the extreme limit within which the judicial system must continually and autonomously promote the carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the existing normative structure, values and constitutional principles, in order to guarantee the rights they attribute to individuals in its territory. A process of continuous, well-pondered monitoring of {{the very concept of}} public order – including the relevance that that value holds beyond the country’s national borders – permits the judicial system to place the right to religous freedom and its manifestations within their rightful context; in this logic the elements of ‘space’ and ‘time’ acquire an important role in an updated version of the right to religious freedom, i. e. individuals’ ability to worship without any reference to State-determined religious institutions, or – inversely - to freely profess their atheist convictions...|$|R

2500|$|The {{landside}} is {{the flat}} plate which presses against and transmits the lateral {{thrust of the}} plough bottom to the furrow wall. It helps to resist the side pressure exerted by the furrow slice on the mouldboard. It also helps in stabilizing the plough while it is in operations. The rear bottom end of the landslide, which rubs against the furrow sole, is known as heel [...] A heel iron is bolted {{to the end of}} the rear of the landside and helps to carry the back of the plough. The landside and share are arranged to give a ‘'lead” towards the unploughed land, thus helping to maintain the correct furrow width. The landside is usually made of solid medium carbon steel, and is very short except on the rear bottom of the plow. The heel or rear end of the rear landside may be subject to excessive wear if the rear wheel is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> therefore, a chilled iron heel piece is frequently used. This heel is inexpensive and can be easily replaced. The land side is fastened to the frog with the help of plough bolts.|$|E

60|$|Lydgate, {{relieved}} from {{anxiety about}} her, relapsed into what she inwardly called his moodiness--a name which to her covered his thoughtful preoccupation with other subjects than herself, {{as well as}} that uneasy look of the brow and distaste for all ordinary things as if they were mixed with bitter herbs, which really made a sort of weather-glass to his vexation and foreboding. These latter states of mind had one cause amongst others, which he had generously but mistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it should affect her health and spirits. Between him and her indeed there was that total missing of each other's mental track, which is too evidently possible even between persons who are continually thinking of each other. To Lydgate it seemed that he had been spending month after month in sacrificing more than half of his best intent and best power to his tenderness for Rosamond; bearing her little claims and interruptions without impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of bitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the blank unreflecting surface her mind presented to his ardor for the more impersonal ends of his profession and his scientific study, an ardor which he had fancied that the ideal wife must somehow worship as sublime, though not in the least knowing why. But his endurance was mingled with a self-discontent which, if we know how to be candid, we shall confess to make more than half our bitterness under grievances, wife or husband included. It always remains true that if we had been greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us. Lydgate was aware that his concessions to Rosamond were often little more than the lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping paralysis apt to seize an enthusiasm which is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to a constant portion of our lives. And on Lydgate's enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a simple weight of sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading care, such as casts the blight of irony over all higher effort.|$|E

There is reason for believing that throughout the animal kingdom, the union of varieties which have become widely divergent is physically injurious; while the union of slightly divergent varieties is physically beneficial. Does the like hold with the mental nature? Some facts seem to show that mixture of human races extremely unlike, produces a worthless type of mind--a mind fitted neither for the kind of life led by the higher of the two races, nor for that led by the lower--a mind <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to all conditions of life. Contrariwise, we find that peoples of the same stock, slightly differentiated by lives carried on in unlike circumstances for many generations, produce by mixture a mental type having certain superiorities. In his work on The Huguenots, Mr. Smiles points out how large a number of distinguished men among us have descended from Flemish and French refugees; and M. Alphonse de Candolle, in his Histoire des Sciences et des Savants depuis deux Siècles, shows that the descendants of French refugees in Switzerland have produced an unusually great proportion of scientific men. Though, in part, this result may be ascribed to the original natures of such refugees, who must have had that independence which is a chief factor in originality, yet it is probably in part due to mixtures of races. For thinking this, we have evidence which is not open to two interpretations. Prof. Morley draws attention to the fact that, during seven hundred years of our early history [...] "the best genius of England sprang up on the line of country in which Celts and Anglo-Saxons came together." [...] In like manner Mr. Galton, in his English Men of Science, shows that in recent days these have mostly come from an inland region, running generally from north to south, which we may reasonably presume contains more mixed blood than do the regions east and west of it. Such a result seems probable a priori. Two natures respectively adapted to slightly unlike sets of social conditions, may be expected by their union to produce a nature somewhat more plastic than either--a nature more impressible by the new circumstances of advancing social life, and therefore more likely to originate new ideas and display modified sentiments. The Comparative Psychology of Man may, then, fitly include the mental effects of mixture; and among derivative inquiries we may ask--How far the conquest of race by race has been instrumental in advancing civilization by aiding mixture, as well as in other ways.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with the existence of a dynamic arbitrage gap that evolves <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an <b>adjustment</b> process for disequilibrium prices, within a complex dynamics framework which takes into account the market microstructure and transactions costs.

This dynamic arbitrage gap depends upon a truly financial gap that accounts for unexpected events and superior information on the professional dealers´side.

In order to prevent the formation of postoperative adhesions and delay the time <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> an animal study was performed to determine the combined effect of physical barriers, Viscoat and Interceed, and a pharmacological agent, 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU).  METHODS— 38 rabbit eyes were divided into three groups. After recession of the superior rectus muscle (SRM), 5 -FU was applied beneath and over the SRM in group 5 -FU. Group I-f had Interceed and 5 -FU and group I-fv, Interceed, 5 -FU, and Viscoat. Delayed adjustment was performed once on each SRM at 1,  2, and 3  weeks postoperatively. The possible length and the necessary force to adjust {{as well as the}} degree of adhesions were recorded.  RESULTS— 5 -FU delayed the adjustment for up to 1  week after surgery in three <b>out</b> <b>of</b> four eyes. Combined use of Interceed and 5 -FU could delay the adjustment for up to 1  week after surgery in three <b>out</b> <b>of</b> five eyes.

50|$|Accuracy of {{measurement}} when using a caliper is {{highly dependent on}} the skill of the operator. Regardless of type, a caliper's jaws must be forced {{into contact with the}} part being measured. As both part and caliper are always to some extent elastic, the amount of force used affects the indication. A consistent, firm touch is correct. Too much force results in an underindication as part and tool distort; too little force gives insufficient contact and an overindication.
