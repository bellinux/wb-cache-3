50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>molasses</b> is a laser cooling {{technique}} that can cool neutral atoms to temperatures lower than a magneto-optical trap (MOT). An <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> consists of 3 pairs of counter-propagating circularly polarized laser beams intersecting {{in the region}} where the atoms are present. The main difference between <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> and a MOT {{is the absence of}} magnetic field in the former. While a typical Sodium MOT can cool atoms down to 300μK, <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> can cool the atoms down to 40μK, an order of magnitude colder.|$|E

50|$|One use for Doppler cooling is the <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> technique. This {{process itself}} forms {{a part of}} the {{magneto-optical}} trap but it can be used independently.|$|E
50|$|Counter-propagating sets {{of laser}} beams {{in all three}} Cartesian {{dimensions}} {{may be used to}} cool the three motional degrees of freedom of the atom.Common laser-cooling configurations include <b>optical</b> <b>molasses,</b> the magneto-optical trap, and the Zeeman slower.|$|E
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} an <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> made of counter-propagating lasers which cool and trap a gas of cesium atoms. Once trapped, the atoms are propelled upward by two vertical lasers inside a microwave chamber. Depending on the exact frequency of the microwaves, the cesium atoms will reach an excited state. Upon passing through a laser beam, the atoms will fluoresce (emit photons). The microwave frequency which produces maximum fluorescence is used to define the second.|$|E
5000|$|In atomic physics, Raman cooling is a sub-recoil cooling {{technique}} {{that allows the}} cooling of atoms using optical methods below the limitations of Doppler cooling, limited by the recoil energy of a photon given to an atom. This scheme can be performed in simple <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> or in molasses where an optical lattice has been superimposed, which are called respectively free space Raman cooling [...] and Raman side-band cooling. Both techniques make use of Raman scattering of laser light by the atoms.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of the laser spurred the development of additional techniques to manipulate atoms with light. Using laser light to cool atoms was first proposed in 1975 {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler effect to make the radiation force on an atom dependent on its velocity, a technique known as Doppler cooling. Similar ideas were also proposed to cool samples of trapped ions. Applying Doppler cooling in three dimensions will slow atoms to velocities that are typically a few cm/s and produce what is known as an <b>optical</b> <b>molasses.</b>|$|E
50|$|The best {{explanation}} of the phenomenon of <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> {{is based on the}} principle of polarization gradient cooling. Counterpropagating beams of circularly polarized light cause a standing wave, where the light polarization is linear but the direction rotates along the direction of the beams at a very fast rate. Atoms moving in the spatially varying linear polarisation have a higher probability density of being in a state that is more susceptible to absorption of light from the beam coming head-on, rather than the beam from behind. This results in a velocity dependent damping force that is able to reduce the velocity of a cloud of atoms to near the recoil limit.|$|E
5000|$|Doppler cooling was {{simultaneously}} {{proposed by}} two groups in 1975, the first being David J. Wineland and Hans Georg Dehmelt {{and the second}} being Theodor W. Hänsch and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. [...] It was first demonstrated by Wineland, Drullinger, and Walls in 1978 and shortly afterwards by Neuhauser, Hohenstatt, Toschek and Dehmelt. One conceptually simple form of Doppler cooling {{is referred to as}} <b>optical</b> <b>molasses,</b> since the dissipative optical force resembles the viscous drag on a body moving through molasses. Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William D. Phillips were awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in laser cooling and atom trapping.|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} loading of 85 Rb atoms into a shallow Far-Off-Resonance Trap (FORT) from an <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> and {{compared it to}} loading from a Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT). We found that substantially more atoms could be loaded into the FORT via an <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> as compared to loading from the MOT alone. To determine why this was the case, we measured the rate of atoms loaded into the FORT and the losses from the FORT during the loading process. For both MOT and molasses loading, we examined atom load rate and losses over a range of detunings as well as hyperfine pump powers. We found that the losses induced during MOT loading were {{essentially the same as}} the losses induced during molasses loading at the same MOT/molasses detuning. In contrast, load rate of the molasses was higher than that of a MOT at a given detuning. This caused the <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> to be able to load more atoms than the MOT. Optimization of FORT loading form an <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> improved the number of atoms we could trap by a factor of two over that of optimal loading from a MOT.

40|$|We {{present a}} summary of the results of a simple {{two-level}} theory of Doppler cooling in <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> and contrast it with the recent theories of multilevel, polarization-gradient cooling. The effects of single-photon recoil and of trapping in microscopic optical potential wells are also considered. Experiments are described in which the temperature of sodium atoms released from <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> is measured and found to be well below the Doppler-cooling limit. Measurements of the temperature dependence on many experimental parameters are found to be in good qualitative agreement with the new theories of polarization-gradient cooling...|$|E
40|$|We report laser cooling of fermionic K- 40 atoms, with {{temperatures}} down to (15 +/- 5) microK, for an enriched sample {{trapped in a}} MOT and additionaly cooled in <b>optical</b> <b>molasses.</b> This temperature is a factor of 10 below the Doppler-cooling limit and corresponds to an rms velocity within a factor {{of two of the}} lowest realizable rms velocity (~ 3. 5 v rec) in 3 D <b>optical</b> <b>molasses.</b> Realization of such low atom temperatures, up to now only accessible with evaporative cooling techniques, is an important precursor to producing a degenerate Fermi gas of K- 40 atoms...|$|E
40|$|Many {{predictions}} of Doppler cooling theory of two-level atoms {{have never been}} verified in a three-dimensional geometry, including the celebrated minimum achievable temperature ħΓ/ 2 k_B, where Γ is the transition linewidth. Here, we show that, despite their degenerate level structure, we can use Helium- 4 atoms to achieve {{a situation in which}} these predictions can be verified. We make measurements of atomic temperatures, magneto-optical trap sizes, and the sensitivity of <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> to a power imbalance in the laser beams, finding excellent agreement with the Doppler theory. We show that the special properties of Helium, particularly its small mass and narrow transition linewidth, prevent effective sub-Doppler cooling with red-detuned <b>optical</b> <b>molasses.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{experimentally}} and theoretically investigate laser cooling of Strontium 88 atoms in one dimensional <b>optical</b> <b>molasses.</b> In our case, since the optical cooling dipole transition involves a $J_g= 0 $ groundstate, no Sisyphus-type mechanisms can occur. We are thus able to test quantitatively {{the predictions of}} the Doppler-cooling theory. We have found, in agreement with other similar experiments, that the measured temperatures are systematically larger than the theoretical predictions. We quantitatively interpret this discrepancy by taking into consideration the extra-heating mechanism induced by transverse spatial intensity fluctuations of the <b>optical</b> <b>molasses.</b> Experimental data are in good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations of our theoretical model. We thus confirm the important role played by intensity fluctuations in the dynamics of cooling and for the steady-state regime...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the spatial diffusion of atoms in a three-dimensional sigma(+) -sigma(-) <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> over twenty milliseconds timescale, {{starting from the}} initial interaction of the atoms with the molasses. We find that the diffusion constants agree well with a linear model for these short time scales and also compare favourably to other studies of diffusion made over longer time scales. These measurements enable us to quantify the detection method known as freezing molasses. We discuss this method, for detecting and measuring the momentum distribution of cold atoms, which relies on the slow diffusion of atoms in <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> to produce a freeze-frame of the spatial distribution of the atoms. This method enables a longer interrogation interval, providing a greatly increased signal-to-noise ratio. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|Laser cooling to sub-Doppler {{temperatures}} by <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> {{is thought}} to be inhibited in atoms with unresolved, near-degenerate hyperfine structure in the excited state. We demonstrate that such cooling is possible in one to three dimensions, not only near the standard D 2 line for laser cooling, but over a range extending to the D 1 line. Via a combination of Sisyphus cooling followed by adiabatic expansion, we reach temperatures as low as 40 μ K, which corresponds to atomic velocities a factor of 2. 6 above the limit imposed by a single photon recoil. Our method requires modest laser power at a frequency within reach of standard frequency locking methods. It is largely insensitive to laser power, polarization and detuning, magnetic fields, and initial hyperfine populations. Our results suggest that <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> should be possible with all alkali species. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|Established optical cooling methods, {{employed}} in such traps as magneto-optical traps and <b>optical</b> <b>molasses,</b> work {{by means of}} a closed optical transition involving the absorption and spontaneous emission of large numbers of photons by each atom. This technique, therefore, cannot be extended to species-such as molecules-which, in general, do not have closed optical transitions. Finally, the lack of any requirement for having a closed optical transition implies that this method for cooling atoms may also be applicable to cooling molecules...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme for a viable and highly {{flexible}} all-optical atomic cooling and trapping using twisted light. In particular, we explain how one-dimensional twisted <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> {{should lead to}} a microscale atomic ring or a picoampere ionic current.

These isotopes range in abundance from 96. 9 % (Ca- 40) to 0. 004 % (Ca- 46).

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the use of a}} moving or "Doppler" mirror to probe laser cooled atoms. The device uses the Doppler shift induced on reflection at a moving surface to modulate the frequency of a probing laser beam, with a modulation bandwidth and frequency resolution sufficient for the narrow spectral features typically encountered. We anticipate that the device could be a simple and cost-effective alternative to acousto-optic modulators for cold atom spectroscopy, and demonstrate its usefulness by performing stimulated optical Compton scattering on an <b>optical</b> <b>molasses.</b> [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} method for loading cold atoms into an optical trap with high initial {{phase-space}} density (PSD). By simply overlapping the trap beam with atoms in <b>optical</b> <b>molasses,</b> 4 × 10 ^ 6 rubidium atoms with an initial temperature less than 10 μK are loaded into a single beam trap. The estimated initial PSD exceeds 0. 01, which is several orders greater than that achieved with the conventional loading method.

40|$|We {{investigate}} sub-Doppler laser cooling of bosonic potassium isotopes, whose small hyperfine splitting {{has so far}} prevented cooling {{below the}} Doppler temperature. We find instead {{that the combination of}} a dark <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> scheme that naturally arises in this kind of systems and an adiabatic ramping of the laser parameters allows to reach sub-Doppler temperatures for small laser detunings. We demonstrate temperatures as low as 25 (3) microK and 47 (5) microK in high-density samples of the two isotopes 39 K and 41 K, respectively. Our findings will find application to other atomic systems. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a technique for producing a cold pulsed beam of atoms by transferring {{a cloud of}} atoms trapped in a three dimensional magneto-optic trap (MOT). The MOT is loaded by heating a getter source of Rb atoms. We show that it is advantageous to transfer with two beams (with a small angle between them) compared to a single beam, because the atoms stop interacting with the beams in the two-beam technique, which results in a Gaussian velocity distribution. The atoms are further cooled in <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> by turning off the MOT magnetic field before the transfer beams are turned on. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the diffusion of}} particles in an attractive one-dimensional potential that grows logarithmically for large $|x|$ using the Fokker-Planck equation. An eigenfunction expansion shows that the Boltzmann equilibrium density does not fully describe the long time limit of this problem. Instead this limit is characterized by an infinite covariant density. This non-normalizable density yields the mean square displacement of the particles, which for a certain range of parameters exhibits anomalous diffusion. In a symmetric potential with an asymmetric initial condition, the average position decays anomalously slowly. This problem also has applications outside the thermal context, as in the diffusion of the momenta of atoms in <b>optical</b> <b>molasses...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} {{collective}} atomic recoil lasing (CARL) model including {{the effects of}} friction and diffusion forces acting on the atoms due {{to the presence of}} <b>optical</b> <b>molasses</b> fields. The results from this model are consistent with those from a recent experiment by Kruse et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 183601 (2003) ]. In particular, we obtain a threshold condition above which collective backscattering occurs. Using a nonlinear analysis we show that the backscattered field and the bunching evolve to a steady state, in contrast to the nonstationary behavior of the standard CARL model. For a proper choice of the parameters, this steady state can be superfluorescent...|$|E
