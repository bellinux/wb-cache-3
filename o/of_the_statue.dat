Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350million in donations. The Statue of Liberty {{was one of the}} earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card, the company would contribute one cent to the renovation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue.</b> The campaign generated contributions of $1.7million to the restoration project.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{period the}} Serapeum in Alexandria was also {{said to have}} {{contained}} a solar alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, a shaft of light would pass across the lips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> of Serapis thus symbolising the Sun saluting the god.|$|E

25|$|The rockery was {{designed}} and the whole complex installed by <b>the</b> British company <b>of</b> J Cheal & Sons who had {{to make their own}} interpretation as to <b>the</b> intended layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statues.</b> Though they were able to incorporate all <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> into one tableaux, their interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sculptor's intended design has led to comments about <b>the</b> unusual poses <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statues,</b> especially when viewed from the side.|$|R

The French government authorized a lottery; among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a terracotta model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue.</b> By the end of 1879, about 250,000francs had been raised.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Salamis is {{proposed}} by modern scholars {{as one of}} three possible naval battles—along with the Battle of Amorgos (322 BC) and the Battle of Cos (261/255 BC)—that provided the occasion for the erection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> of the Nike of Samothrace.|$|E
5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which would either be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> {{were said to be}} similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
50|$|AT&T {{commissioned}} Evelyn Beatrice Longman {{to create}} a bronze sculpture that she called Genius of Telegraphy, {{that was to be}} placed atop a pyramidal structure on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fulton Street wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> that she created depicted a 24 ft winged male figure in gilded bronze on top of a globe, with the figure having cables around its torso and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue's</b> arms holding bolts <b>of</b> electricity. <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was cast in bronze and covered with over 40,000 pieces of gold leaf. After a court-ordered divestiture <b>of</b> Western Union, <b>the</b> <b>statue's</b> official title was changed to Genius <b>of</b> Electricity. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> was renamed Spirit <b>of</b> Communication in <b>the</b> 1930s, but has been better known by its nickname, Golden Boy.|$|R

Five statues depict European officers who aided the American cause, and <b>the</b> one <b>of</b> Edmund Burke, a British politician who spoke out for the American cause.

5|$|The statue has {{required}} repair work {{on several occasions}} to fix damage and defects. Only {{a few months after}} it was installed, it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind. Marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary. During the winter of 1908–09, frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue.</b> It was found that between 60–80 leaks were letting water into the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> and causing further damage when it froze. It was also discovered that the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under its own weight on the two ends of its base. Repair work took place to remedy these problems.|$|E

5|$|After the United States entered World War I in 1917, images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> {{were heavily}} {{used in both}} {{recruitment}} posters and the Liberty Bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially.
