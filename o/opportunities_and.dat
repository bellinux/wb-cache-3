5|$|Lemurs {{have drawn}} much {{attention}} to Madagascar and its endangered species. In this capacity, they act as flagship species, the most notable {{of which is the}} ring-tailed lemur, which is considered an icon of the country. The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive ecotourism, which especially helps local communities living {{in the vicinity of the}} national parks, since it offers employment <b>opportunities</b> <b>and</b> the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of Ranomafana National Park, job <b>opportunities</b> <b>and</b> other revenue from long-term research can rival that of ecotourism.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on case study {{research}} of employment downsizing and the implications for equal <b>opportunity</b> <b>and</b> diversity management conducted in the UK airline industry during 2002 / 2003. Design/methodology/approach – Review of literature on downsizing <b>and</b> equal <b>opportunity</b> <b>and</b> diversity management followed by identification of a number of research questions which are answered with reference to secondary analysis of labour market data and interviews with key informants from senior management and line management. Findings – A planned approach to downsizing had been adopted that was strongly influenced by the human resources function in terms of equal <b>opportunity</b> <b>and</b> diversity management. An adverse impact on different employee groups had been avoided in order to sustain the diversity of the workforce. Research limitations/implications – The research focuses on the management of downsizing <b>and</b> equal <b>opportunity</b> <b>and</b> diversity management. It addresses the perceptions of managers involved in developing and implementing policy, but does not examine the perceptions of other employees. Practical implications – There are some reflections on ways in which equal <b>opportunity</b> <b>and</b> diversity management policy might adapt to organisational change and downsizing. Originality/value – This paper brings together two scholarly debates on downsizing <b>and</b> equal <b>opportunity</b> <b>and</b> diversity management, and provides case study evidence of how an equal <b>opportunity</b> <b>and</b> diversity management agenda is implemented during organisational restructuring and downsizing...|$|R

5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations.

Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{argued for}} girls and boys to have equal {{recreational}} and educational <b>opportunities</b> <b>and</b> for women to have fair wages. Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting.

She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican Republic, legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of <b>opportunities</b> <b>and</b> they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the Dominican Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the Dominican Republic are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|In May 1997, {{two groups}} of six female sailors were posted to Collins and Farncomb to test the {{feasibility}} of mixed-sex submarine companies. Following the trial's success, eleven female sailors and one female officer commenced submarine training in 1998. Officers and senior enlisted submariners slept in mixed accommodation, but junior enlisted submariners could only be deployed in groups of six: one of the enlisted cabins was set aside, and all six bunks in the cabin had to be filled. Mixed accommodation for all female submariners was approved in June 2011, {{in order to increase}} posting <b>opportunities</b> <b>and</b> help make up shortfalls in submarine complements.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Lawton {{underwent}} tremendous growth {{during the late}} 1940s and 1950s, leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka.

Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s. It offered additional water resources, but also recreational <b>opportunities</b> <b>and</b> flood control along Cache Creek.|$|E
