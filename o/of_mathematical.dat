This research is a class action research consist of two cycles. The subject of this research were the students of class VII 4 SMP Negeri 3 Tambang that consist of 19 boys and 11 girls. The instruments of data collection in this research were observation sheet, students <b>mathematical</b> understanding <b>of</b> first ability tests and students <b>mathematical</b> understanding <b>of</b> ability tests. The results of this research showed the activity of teacher and students performing well according to plan. Most students look to actively participate in the learning process. Based on data analysis ability <b>of</b> understanding <b>mathematical</b> students in classical class VII 4 SMP Negeri 3 Tambang, obtained an average value ability <b>of</b> understanding <b>mathematical</b> students in the classical style on the first cycle is higher than the average value on first tests ability <b>of</b> understanding <b>mathematical</b> students and the average value ability <b>of</b> understanding <b>mathematical</b> students classically on the second cycle is higher than the average value in first cycle. Average value ability <b>of</b> understanding <b>mathematical</b> students classical students has increased from the first tests to the first cycle of 13. 89.

5|$|Their {{answer was}} {{surprising}} in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, {{limits to what}} mathematical logic could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form <b>of</b> <b>mathematical</b> reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process <b>of</b> <b>mathematical</b> deduction.
