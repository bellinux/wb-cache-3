Main problem at distant sight is, that the oneself have to check every one server separately. This performs central server provided by web server with the support language PHP and database MySQL. Central server creates interface between user and servers. All application is built on PHP, MySQL and SOAP messages. Server, which is monitored, is equipped web server and application for automatic execute process. All application is then built on exchange SOAP messages, which contain monitoring information. These data are preserved in database and further used for various statistics and graphs. By the help of web interface on central server can be information suitable displayed. This interface {{makes it possible to}} do action above single processes. Restarted or stopping process is at distant management used frequently. Naturally is respect emphasis on safeness. Optimal place for placement these application is <b>operator</b> <b>centre</b> or administrator's computer. Demand user has then displayed all monitored servers on monitor.

50|$|In {{virtual call}} centre model, the call <b>centre</b> <b>operator</b> pays a monthly or annual fee to a vendor that hosts the call centre {{telephony}} equipment {{in their own}} data centre. In this model, the operator does not own, operate or host the equipment that the call centre runs on. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional PSTN telephone lines, or over voice over IP. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor's data centre, {{rather than at the}} call <b>centre</b> <b>operator's</b> premises.

40|$|AbstractWe studied visual evoked {{potentials}} (VEPs) elicited by second-order contrast modulations of binary dynamic {{noise and}} first-order luminance modulations. Using a 3 -point Laplacian <b>operator</b> <b>centred</b> on Oz, {{we found that}} contrast modulations of both low and higher spatial frequencies elicited a negative component whose latency was about 200 ms. The latency of this component was significantly longer {{than that of the}} early Laplacian components to first-order luminance modulations. These findings could be due to slower first-stage linear filters and additional processing stages of the second-order pathway. The topographical analysis of scalp recorded VEPs to central and half-field stimulation has suggested that the responses to second-order patterns are likely to be generated by neuronal structures within the primary visual cortex which may have inputs from extrastriate neurons via feedback connections...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{practice}} briefing paper is to provide an exploratory review of the sustainability agendas being addressed and publicly reported by the UK's leading data <b>centre</b> <b>operators.</b> Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a short discussion {{of the characteristics of}} sustainability and an outline of the origins and development of data centres within the UK. The paper draws its empirical material from the most recent information on sustainability posted on the UK's leading data centre operators' corporate web sites. Findings - The findings reveal that all the UK's leading data <b>centre</b> <b>operators</b> provide only limited information on their commitment to sustainability with the dominant focus being on its environmental dimension and with little attention being paid to social and economic issues. More critically the authors argue that these commitments are driven more by the search for efficiency gains, that they are couched within existing business models centred on continuing growth and that as such the UK's leading data <b>centre</b> <b>operators</b> are pursuing a "weak" rather than a "strong" model of sustainability. Practical implications - The paper suggests that leading data centre operating companies may need to extend their sustainability reporting and to introduce external assurance procedures. Originality/value - The paper provides an accessible review of the sustainability agendas being pursued by the UK's leading data <b>centre</b> <b>operators</b> and as such it will interest academics, students and practitioners interested in both sustainability and data centre operations and developments...|$|R
