5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> and rarely defecate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999–2000 season, on February 15, 2000, Brodeur was {{credited}} with his second career goal, as Brodeur was the last Devils player <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> to touch the puck before Daymond Langkow of the Flyers accidentally put the puck into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils. Brodeur had previously stopped an attempted Flyers shot.|$|E

5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> {{the team}} reached the 2010 playoffs as the eighth seed {{for the second}} year in a row, yet upset the top-seeded Washington Capitals and the then-defending Stanley Cup {{champion}} Pittsburgh Penguins in the first two rounds. The Habs lost the Eastern Conference finals to the Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|E

5|$|Returning for a {{third season}} with Hamilton in 1962–63, Henderson led the Ontario Hockey Association in scoring with 49 goals in 48 games. He added 27 assists to finish the season with 76 points. A bout of strep throat {{resulted}} in his missing Hamilton's playoff games, but he was called up to the Detroit Red Wings late in their season when they were short of players. Henderson played his first two NHL games against the Toronto Maple Leafs, with only one shift in each game. In his first game, Henderson elbowed Dick Duff in the head, sparking a fight. He {{spent the rest of}} the game on the bench after several Toronto players threatened retaliation against him. In his second, he incurred a slashing penalty during his only time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> Henderson estimated that he was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> for only 20 seconds over the two games, but drew nine penalties in minutes.|$|E
5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> {{and when he saw}} the misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised. Parise nearly swung his stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted {{in the rest of the}} game being refereed capably.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E

5|$|According to many observers, {{including}} Ray Ferraro {{and teammates}} Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev {{was perhaps the}} best defenceman in the tournament {{in terms of his}} defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, were not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> for a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals against in 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|After lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> for {{approximately}} 10 minutes, Moore {{was removed from}} the playing surface on a stretcher. He was treated for three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a grade three concussion, vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves, and facial lacerations. He was also suffering from amnesia. Bertuzzi apologized to Moore and his family, as well as to Burke, Canucks owner John McCaw, Jr., the Canucks organization, his teammates, and the fans in a press conference two days later.|$|E

But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E

5|$|At {{the first}} tournament in 1920, {{there were many}} {{differences}} from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed, the rink (which had been intended to be used only for figure skating) was 56m×18m (165ft×58.5ft) and two 20-minute periods were played. Each team had seven players <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> the extra position being the rover. Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules—six men per side and three periods of play.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight and felt the League did little {{to protect him from}} players wanting {{to make a name for}} themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while he was lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E

Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions.
