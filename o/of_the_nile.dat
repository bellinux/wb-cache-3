50|$|Aside from {{a source}} of {{internal}} conflict within nations, water has caused external tension between sovereign states.

5|$|Due to {{the civil}} war, Mongalla had {{suffered}} considerable physical neglect and damage, and population loss. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> ports {{to be the first}} to be rehabilitated.

5|$|In his 1992 {{review of}} Naguib Mahfouz's The Search (1964), the Ethiopian scholar Mulugeta Gudeta {{observed}} that Ethiopian and Egyptian societies bore striking historical resemblances. According to Haggai Erlich, these parallels {{culminated in the}} establishment of the Egyptian abun ecclesiastical office, which exemplified Ethiopia's traditional connection to Egypt and the Middle East. In the earlier part of the 20th century, Egyptian nationalists also propounded the idea of forming a Unity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> Valley, a territorial union that would include Ethiopia. This objective gradually ebbed due to political tension over control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> waters. Consequently, after the 1950s, Egyptian scholars adopted a more distant if not apathetic approach to Ethiopian affairs and academic studies. For instance, the Fifth Nile 2002 Conference held in Addis Ababa in 1997 was attended by hundreds of scholars and officials, among whom were 163 Ethiopians and 16 Egyptians. By contrast, there were no Egyptian attendees at the Fourteenth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies later held in Addis Ababa in 2000, similar to all previous ICES conferences since the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Most {{settlements}} in ancient Egypt were {{situated on the}} alluvium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> floodplain.

5|$|Osiris's {{death is}} {{followed}} either by an interregnum or by {{a period in}} which Set assumes the kingship. Meanwhile, Isis searches for her husband's body with the aid of Nephthys. When searching for or mourning Osiris, the two goddesses are often likened to falcons or kites, possibly because kites travel far in search of carrion, because the Egyptians associated their plaintive calls with cries of grief, or because of the goddesses' connection with Horus, who is often represented as a falcon. In the New Kingdom, when Osiris's death and renewal came {{to be associated with the}} annual flooding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> that fertilized Egypt, the waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> were equated with Isis's tears of mourning, or with Osiris's bodily fluids. Osiris thus represented the life-giving divine power that was present in the river's water and in the plants that grew after the flood.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} shift was a religious one: Thebes effectively became the religious {{as well as the}} political center of the country, its local god Amun credited with inspiring Ahmose in his victories over the Hyksos.

5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s.

Water {{samples were collected}} from <b>the</b> River <b>Nile</b> at Shambat bridge, <b>the</b> White <b>Nile</b> at Fetaehab bridge and <b>the</b> Blue <b>Nile</b> at Mak-Nimir bridge. They were obtained at <b>the</b> same day <b>of</b> each month for one year from March – 2008 to February – 2009. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study was <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water quality indices for <b>the</b> three <b>Niles</b> and appraisal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River <b>Nile</b> and its two main tributaries for irrigation use. <b>The</b> measurements <b>of</b> water quality parameters (pH, ECW, Na+, K+, Ca+ 2, Mg+ 2, Cl-, CO 3 - 2, HCO 3 -, SO 4 - 2) were carried out. The USSL (1954) classification system revealed that <b>the</b> three <b>Niles</b> water salinity, as represented by ECW and SAR ranged from C 1 – S 1 (low salinity – low sodicity) class to C 2 – S 1 (medium salinity – low sodicity) class. Eight percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blue <b>Nile</b> water samples belonged to the C 1 – S 1 class and 92 % belonged to C 2 – S 1 class. Sixty seven percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White <b>Nile</b> water samples belonged to the C 1 – S 1 class and 33 % belonged to C 2 – S 1 class. Fifty eight percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River <b>Nile</b> water samples belonged to C 1 – S 1 class and 42 % belonged to C 2 – S 1 class. Ca-Mg was the dominant cation class and Cl=CO 3 was the dominant anion class. All water samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River <b>Nile</b> and its two tributaries gave low sodium hazard for the twelve months. The RSC values for all water samples, in all months, were negative indicating absence <b>of</b> carbonate hazard. <b>The</b> Langelier saturation index values for 83 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River <b>Nile</b> and its two tributaries were negative indicating dissolution of carbonate from water.
