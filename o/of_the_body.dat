5|$|The mouth opens into a {{flattened}} pharynx. This {{consists of an}} in-folding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> wall, and is therefore lined by the animal's epidermis. The pharynx typically runs for about one third the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that occupies the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most of the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> system {{consists}} <b>of</b> {{two primary}} <b>bodies</b> with <b>the</b> same mass , which move in circular or elliptical Kepler orbits around their center <b>of</b> mass. <b>The</b> third <b>body,</b> which is substantially smaller than <b>the</b> primary <b>bodies</b> and whose mass {{can be set}} to zero , moves under <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>bodies</b> in a plane that is perpendicular to <b>the</b> orbital plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>bodies</b> (see Figure 1). <b>The</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system is at <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>bodies.</b> <b>The</b> combined mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>bodies</b> , <b>the</b> orbital period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> , and <b>the</b> radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> [...] are used for this system. In addition, the gravitational constant is 1. In such a system that <b>the</b> third <b>body</b> only moves in one dimension - it moves only along the z-axis.|$|R
30|$|We use Algorithm 2 to {{calculate}} <b>the</b> joint angles <b>of</b> both legs. We control <b>the</b> CoM <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>body,</b> <b>the</b> torso’s orientation, and <b>the</b> poses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs. <b>The</b> CoM <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>body</b> is calculated by assuming <b>the</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>body</b> (e.g., <b>the</b> configuration {{in the previous}} time step). We use the numerical IK to solve <b>the</b> joint angles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>body.</b> Since <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> DoF <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>body</b> is a subset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DoF <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>body,</b> this calculation is faster than <b>the</b> IK <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>body.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend {{to the front and}} back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> two identical solid axisymmetric bodies (of diameter d and thickness h) freely {{falling in}} a fluid at rest. We determine <b>the</b> domains <b>of</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different interaction behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>bodies</b> (i. e. attraction, repulsion and indifference) {{as a function}} of their initial relative position. We then investigate in detail <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> falling in tandem, for both rectilinear and periodic paths, and the associated attraction behaviour. For all the Reynolds numbers and aspect ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> (χ=d/h) investigated, <b>the</b> trailing <b>body</b> catches up with <b>the</b> leading <b>body.</b> We provide a quantitative description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinematics leading to <b>the</b> regrouping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> and analyse its relationship with <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading <b>body.</b> In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> rectilinear paths, a dynamical model that takes into account <b>the</b> axial evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading <b>body</b> is proposed to reproduce the acceleration observed for <b>the</b> trailing <b>body</b> until a vertical separation distance between <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5 diameters. In parallel, direct numerical simulations (DNS) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow about two fixed bodies in tandem in an oncoming flow are carried out, providing a good estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> for separation distances larger than 5 diameters. For periodic paths, the kinematics leading to <b>the</b> regrouping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> is slower than for rectilinear paths. However, in this case, the interaction also leads to significant changes in <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oscillatory motion and is strongly dependent on <b>the</b> aspect ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies.</b> To explain <b>the</b> observed differences, we consider <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transverse inhomogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading <b>body</b> on <b>the</b> oscillatory motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trailing disk...|$|R

5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body)</b> is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body)</b> is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide {{and is more}} ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> The other shields on the lower side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E
