25|$|Cardiometabolic risk among {{children}} and adolescents is fueled by the rising prevalence of obesity in this age group. From 1980 to 2008, rates of obesity have increased from 5% to 10% among preschool children aged 2–5. During the same time period, obesity increased from 6.5% to nearly 20% among 6-11year-olds and from 5% to 18% among adolescents aged 12–19. Hypertension {{among children}} and adolescents has increased by 1% since 1999 and is estimated to affect 3.6% of those aged 3–18. This increase is attributed to the rising number <b>of</b> <b>overweight</b> and obese children. The prevalence of lipid abnormalities among {{children and adolescents}} is also tied to obesity and overweight. Approximately 14% of normal-weight youths aged 12–19 have lipid abnormalities. That figure rises to 22% <b>of</b> <b>overweight</b> youths and nearly 43% of obese youths.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{increasing}} prevalence <b>of</b> childhood <b>overweight</b> is {{an important}} health issue. There {{is a need for}} longitudinal research among children in order to identify risk factors for childhood <b>overweight.</b> The objective <b>of</b> the present research was to identify potential sociodemographic and behavioural risk factors for development <b>of</b> childhood <b>overweight</b> among 3 - to 6 -year-old children. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Sixteen pre-primary and primary schools. SUBJECTS: BMI Z-scores at baseline and two follow-up measurements were calculated for 568 children. Sociodemographic, parental adiposity, familial composition, child's diet, physical activity and sedentary behavioural data were collected through questionnaires. RESULTS: Several risk factors for the development <b>of</b> childhood <b>overweight</b> were found. Being an only child, lower maternal educational level, maternal and paternal overweight, more than 1 h screen time on weekdays and high soft drinks consumption were shown to be positively associated with the development <b>of</b> childhood <b>overweight.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Although behavioural factors are important, our findings support the thesis that interventions on the prevention <b>of</b> childhood <b>overweight</b> should focus on high-risk groups, i. e. children from low socio-economic background or with high parental BMI. Interventions should address the whole family and take into account their lifestyle and structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{association}} of socio-demographic and built environment characteristics on the odds <b>of</b> being <b>overweight</b> and obese {{using data from the}} Atlanta SMARTRAQ travel survey. A new methodological framework based on a multinomial logit (MNL) model and an enhanced odds ratio plot is presented. The use of an MNL model overcomes limitations of many prior studies that employ a sequence of binary logit models to examine multiple weight categories. The use of an enhanced odds ratio plot provides important information into the relative importance of socio-demographic and built environment characteristics. Several new findings for the Atlanta area result from this study. Socio-demographic variables, including age and educational attainment, exhibit a non-linear relationship with the odds <b>of</b> being <b>overweight</b> or obese. Gender, age, ethnicity, and educational attainment are strongly associated with the odds <b>of</b> being <b>overweight</b> or obese, while income and number of students between 5 and 16 years old in the household have smaller effects. Built environment characteristics such as increased net residential densities and enhanced street connectivity are associated with reductions in the odds <b>of</b> being <b>overweight</b> and/or obese. Relative to socio-demographic variables, however, such built environment characteristics have a much smaller impact on describing the odds <b>of</b> being <b>overweight</b> or obese.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three parts of empirical analyses investigating temporal patterns and consequences <b>of</b> (childhood) <b>overweight</b> and obesity, mainly in the United States and the People's Republic of China. Based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey, the first part conducts hierarchical age-period-cohort analyses <b>of</b> childhood <b>overweight</b> in China and finds a strong cohort effect driving the overweight epidemic. Results from the growth-curve models show that childhood overweight and underweight are related such that certain socio-economic groups with higher levels <b>of</b> childhood <b>overweight</b> also exhibit lower levels of childhood underweight. The second part situates the discussion on childhood obesity in a broader context. It compares temporal patterns <b>of</b> childhood <b>overweight</b> in China with these <b>of</b> adulthood <b>overweight</b> and finds that the salient cohort component is absent in rising adulthood overweight, which is dominated by strong period effects. A positive association between human development index and overweight/obesity prevalence across countries is also documented. Using multiple waves of survey data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the third part analyzes the (latent) trajectory of childhood overweight/obesity in the United States. It finds that individuals with obesity growth trajectories {{are less likely to}} avoid mental depression, tend to have higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness/conscientiousness, and show less delinquent behaviors.

In that vein, social psychology proposed that {{the mental health of}} the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific therapy and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance. That effective phenomenon was indicated in {{the results of the study}} Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment <b>of</b> <b>Overweight</b> Children (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.|$|E
25|$|A joint interim {{statement}} of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity published a guideline to harmonize {{the definition of the}} metabolic syndrome. This definition recognizes that the risk associated with a particular waist measurement will differ in different populations. Whether it is better at this time to set the level at which risk starts to increase or at which there is already substantially increased risk will be up to local decision-making groups. However, for international comparisons and to facilitate the etiology, it is critical that a commonly agreed-upon set of criteria be used worldwide, with agreed-upon cut points for different ethnic groups and sexes. There are many people in the world of mixed ethnicity, and in those cases, pragmatic decisions will have to be made. Therefore, an international criterion <b>of</b> <b>overweight</b> (BMI≥25) may be more appropriate than ethnic specific criteria of abdominal obesity for an anthropometric component of this syndrome which results from an excess lipid storage in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver.|$|E
25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} even in {{the first}} few months of mother–child relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with obesity. A study using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother–child interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and body mass index was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>overweight</b> or obese grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and by grade six, 34.34% of the children were classified as overweight or obese. More interesting is the difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive mothers had an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype <b>of</b> <b>overweight</b> women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Rising rates <b>of</b> {{obesity and}} <b>overweight</b> is an {{increasing}} public health problem all over the world. Recent research has shown the importance of early life factors in the development <b>of</b> child <b>overweight.</b> However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge there are no studies investigating the potential synergistic effect of early life factors and presence <b>of</b> parental <b>overweight</b> on the development <b>of</b> child <b>overweight.</b> Methods The study was population-based and cross-sectional. The study population consisted of children who visited the Child Health Care (CHC) centers in Malmö for their 4 -year health check during 2003 - 2008 and whose parents answered a self-administered questionnaire (n = 9009 children). Results The results showed that having overweight/obese parents was strongly associated with the child being overweight or obese. Furthermore, there was an association between unfavorable early life factors (i. e., mother smoking during pregnancy, presence of secondhand tobacco smoke early in life, high birth weight) and the development of child overweight/obesity at four years of age, while breastfeeding seemed to have a protective role. For example, maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1. 47 (95 % CI: 1. 22, 1. 76) for overweight and 2. 31 (95 % CI: 1. 68, 3. 17) for obesity. The results further showed synergistic effects between parental overweight and exposure to unfavourable early life factors in the development <b>of</b> child <b>overweight.</b> Conclusions The present study shows the importance of early life factors in the development <b>of</b> child <b>overweight</b> and obesity, and thus puts focus on the importance of early targeted interventions. </p...|$|R
