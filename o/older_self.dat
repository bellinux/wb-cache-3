50|$|In {{the salient}} self's view the {{observer}} has the opposite pattern: {{if an individual}} perceives continuity with the <b>self</b> (<b>old</b> <b>self</b> matches new self), they would approach this with an observer perspective, contrasted to having discontinuity or incongruence (<b>old</b> <b>self</b> does not match new self) that would be approached with the field perspective.|$|R

His thoughts are soon cut short as Degra arrives for their rendezvous.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} punctuated by fantasy {{sequences}} {{in which his}} character performed his thoughts as a stand-up routine in a small club. In the commentary and the interview on the DVD, Bathurst says that {{he was told that}} they would be re-shot after filming everything else, an idea abandoned because of the expense. He has an idea of re-filming the sequences 'now', as his <b>older</b> <b>self,</b> to give them a more retrospective feeling. He has also said that he believes Mark was too [...] "designery" [...] and wishes that he had [...] "roughened him up a bit". The role is his favourite of his whole career; he has described it as [...] "the most enjoyable job I will ever do" [...] and considers several episodes of the series to be [...] "timeless, beautifully constructed farces which will endure". Bathurst is often recognised for his appearance in this series, mentioning that [...] "Drunks stop me on public transport and tell me details of the plot of their favourite episode". As punishment for arriving late for the series one press launch at the Caf√© Royal in Regent Street, London, writer Steven Moffat pledged to write an episode in which Mark is naked throughout. To a large extent, this vow is realised in the second series.|$|E
