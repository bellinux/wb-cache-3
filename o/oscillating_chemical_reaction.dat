In 1958 B. P. Belousov in the Soviet Union discovered the Belousov - Zhabotinsky reaction (BZ reaction), which is suitable as a demonstration, but it too met with skepticism (largely because such oscillatory behaviour was unheard {{of up to}} that time) until A. M. Zhabotinsky, also in the USSR, learned of it and in 1964 published his research. In May 1972 a pair of articles in the Journal of Chemical Education {{brought it to the}} attention of two science instructors at Galileo High School in San Francisco. They discovered the Briggs - Rauscher oscillating reaction by replacing bromate (BrO3&minus;) in the BZ reaction with iodate and adding hydrogen peroxide. They produced the striking visual demonstration by adding starch indicator. Since then, many other investigators have added to the knowledge and uses of this very unusual reaction.|$|E

Here it is shown that cellu-lar automata models of BZ spirals can be created by using a very simple set of equations based on a three substrate model with close connection to reaction-diffusion models, more closely re-sembling the actual BZ reaction.

The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is a non-linear partial differential equation frequently encountered in the study of continuous media.

We explicitly derive the equations of motion for scroll wave filaments in reaction-diffusion systems with isotropic diffusion up to third order in the filament's twist and curvature. The net drift components define at every instance of time a virtual filament which lies close to the instantaneous filament. Importantly, virtual filaments obey simpler, time-independent laws of motion which we analytically derive here and illustrate with numerical examples. Stability analysis of scroll waves is performed using virtual filaments, showing that filament curvature and twist add as quadratic terms to the nominal filament tension.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{spatially}} periodic forcing on an <b>oscillating</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> as described by the Lengyel-Epstein model are investigated. We find a surprising competition between two oscillating patterns, where one is harmonic and the other subharmonic {{with respect to the}} spatially periodic forcing. The occurrence of a subharmonic pattern is remarkable as well as its preference up to rather large values of the modulation amplitude. For small modulation amplitudes we derive from the model system a generic equation for the envelope of the oscillating reaction that includes an additional forcing contribution, compared to the amplitude equations known from previous studies in other systems. The analysis of this amplitude equation allows the derivation of analytical expressions even for the forcing corrections to the threshold and to the oscillation frequency, which are {{in a wide range of}} parameters in good agreement with the numerical analysis of the complete reaction equations.

The synthesis and characterization of "grafted from brushes and triblock copolymers is reported. The responsive nature of polyelectrolyte brushes, grown by surface initiated atomic transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), has been characterized by scanning force microscopy, neutron reflectometry, and single molecule force measurements. The molecular response is measured directly for the brushes in terms of both the brush height and composition and the force generated by a single molecule. Triblock copolymers, based on hydrophobic end blocks and polyacid midblock, have been used to produce polymer gels where the deformation of the molecules can be followed directly by small angle Xray scattering (SAXS), and a correlation between molecular shape change and macroscopic deformation has been established. A Landolt pHoscillator, based on bromate/sulfite/ferrocyanide, with a room temperature period of 20 min and a range of 3. 1 <pH < 7. 0, was used to drive periodic oscillations in volume in this pH responsive hydrogel.

40|$|Oscillating {{reactions}} {{are one of}} the most interesting topics in chemistry and analytical chemistry. Fluctuations in concentrations of one the reacting species (usually a reaction intermediate) create an <b>oscillating</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> In oscillating systems, the reaction is far from thermodynamic equilibrium. In these systems, at least one autocatalytic step is required. Developing an instinctive feeling for how oscillating reactions work will be invaluable to future generations of chemists. Some software programs have been released for simulating oscillating systems; however, the algorithm details of such software are not transparent to chemists. In contrast, function of spreadsheet tools, like Microsoft Excel, is well understood, and the software is nearly universally available. In this work, the simulation and visualization of different oscillating systems are performed using Microsoft excel. The simple repetitive solving of the ordinary differential equation of an autocatalytic reaction (a spreadsheet row) followed by time, easily automated by a subroutine (a “Macro” in Excel), readily simulates an oscillating reaction. This permits the simulation of some oscillating systems such asBelousov-Zhabotinsky.
