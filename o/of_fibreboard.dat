50|$|The wood is soft, white {{when first}} cut, turning to pale red; the knots are attractively mottled. The timber {{is not used}} where {{strength}} is required in the construction industry, but is used for paper-making, the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>fibreboard</b> {{and the production of}} energy. Under water the wood is very durable and is used for deep foundations of buildings. The piles beneath the Rialto in Venice, and the foundations of several medieval cathedrals are made of alder. The Roman architect Vitruvius mentioned that the timber was used {{in the construction of the}} causeways across the Ravenna marshes. The wood is used in joinery, both as solid timber and as veneer, where its grain and colour are appreciated, and it takes dye well. As the wood is soft, flexible and somewhat light, it can be easily worked as well as split. It is valued in turnery and carving, in making furniture, window frames, clogs, toys, blocks, pencils and bowls.|$|E
50|$|Next, a dam {{was built}} on the Salmon Falls River that was 160 ft long from {{abutment}} to abutment. The dam created Spaulding Pond on the river, which extends north for a mile into Milton. The factory building constructed for the mill measured 52 by 200 ft and was four stories high (see postcard photo). Mammoth timbers were used in finishing this solidly constructed mill. When the North Rochester mill started up it, like Milton, would have a Leatherboard capacity of about 7 tons a day.In 1900, before the North Rochester leatherboard mill was completed, Jonas Spaulding died. Leon C. Spaulding became President of J. Spaulding & Sons Company. With the completion of the mill in North Rochester the Spaulding brothers acquired and started several auxiliary businesses to use and convert the company's leatherboard. In 1900 after the startup of the North Rochester mill, the brothers added to the plant special machinery that was designed to produce shoe counters. In 1898 Spaulding Brothers Company had been assigned US Patent 606,375 for Counter-Cutting Machine from Daniel L. Chandler of Ayer, Massachusetts. In 1902 the brothers acquired Kennebunk Manufacturing Co in Kennebunk, Maine, which company had been making fiberboard lunch boxes since 1898. Later Kennebunk would manufacture violin cases and radio speaker horns. Also in 1902 the Spaulding brothers started a subsidiary, Spaulding Perkins, which manufactured fiberboard receptacles. Spaulding Perkins was the nucleus of Spaulding's material handling division which survives today as Bayhead Products Company. Also in 1902 Leon, Huntley, and Rolland Spaulding (Jonas' sons) brought the Spaulding Brothers (Jonas & Waldo) operations in Townsend Harbor, Massachusetts, under the banner of J. Spaulding & Sons Company. In 1906 the brothers purchased a cutdown machine {{that could be used to}} produce products made of multiple plies <b>of</b> <b>fibreboard.</b> It was installed in the North Rochester plant.

40|$|The New Zealand kiwifruit {{and apple}} {{industries}} export {{the two largest}} horticultural crops by value and tonnage on long sea routes to distant markets. The long storage and shipping times, low temperature (~ 0 °C) and high humidity (> 70 %RH) conditions require boxes manufactured from high performance corrugated fibreboard. As the corrugated fibreboard boxes are a significant expense, improvements to reduce the weight and therefore the cost <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>fibreboard,</b> while maintaining their vertical compression strength, would increase the apple and kiwifruit industries profitability Through analysis of the literature it was established that the greatest contributor to box compression strength was the corrugated fibreboard edgewise compression strength, which is significantly affected by moisture. The strength <b>of</b> corrugated <b>fibreboard</b> decreases with increasing moisture content, which tends to be high in low-temperature high-humidity cool-stores. The literature also indicated that temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium could be optimised to reduce the damage caused during the fluting process. The objectives of this study included improving box compression strength predictions by measuring the effect of moisture and temperature on the strength <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>fibreboard</b> and measuring the relationship between temperature, humidity and corrugated fibreboard moisture content. The objectives also included developing a mathematical model to optimise the operations preceding the fluting process by predicting the fluting medium moisture content and temperature {{just prior to the}} fluting process. The measurements <b>of</b> corrugated <b>fibreboard</b> properties enabled the widely known McKee’s equation to be modified to enable the prediction of box compression strength over a range of moisture contents (7 to 30 %db), the valves of which could be estimated using the moisture sorption isotherms developed in this study over the temperature and relative humidity range of 0 to 20 °C and 40 to 90 %RH. A mathematical model was developed to predict how the operation of the corrugator would affect the temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium just prior to the fluting process. The model was tested by running the corrugator at normal and extreme settings based on the model’s predictions, and measuring the strength properties <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>fibreboard</b> produced. The measured strength properties indicated that the machine speed and steam shower could have an effect but the too were inconsistent to established firm conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Although wind, hydro {{and solar}} {{are the most}} {{discussed}} sources of renewable energy, countries will need to rely much more on biomass {{if they are to}} meet renewable energy targets. In this study, a global forest trade model is used to examine the global effects of expanded demand for wood pellets fired with coal in power plants. Positive mathematical programming is used to calibrate the model to 2011 bilateral trade flows. To assess the impact of increased demand for wood pellets on global forest products, we consider a scenario where demand for wood pellets doubles. Findings indicate that production of lumber and plywood is likely to increase in most of the 20 model regions, but outputs <b>of</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> particleboard and pulp will decline as these products must compete with wood pellets for residual fibre. Ultimately, policies promoting aggressive renewable energy targets cause wood pellet prices to more than double in our scenarios, which could increase the cost of generating electricity to such an extent that, in some regions, electricity producers will continue to use fossil fuels as their primary fuel, while some others might find it worthwhile to rely more on nuclear energy for base load power...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work was to study the {{possibilities}} of radical formation in wood fiber surfaces to enable direct fiber-to-fiber adhesion by radical-based reactions in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> particularly medium-density fiberboard (MDF). The fibers were produced by defibration at high temperatures. Radical formation was achieved by treatment with laccase, treatment with Fenton's reagent, or gamma-irradiation. High-temperature defibration was found to cause cleavage of interunit beta-aryl ether linkages of lignin, resulting in formation of mechanoradicals and phenolic hydroxyl groups. The proportion of water-extractable low-molecular weight lignin and hemicelluloses present in the fibers increased {{with an increase in}} defibration temperature. In the laccase treatment of fibers in water suspension, much more radicals were formed in hardwood than in softwood fibers for fibers produced at equal temperature. Radical formation increased with increasing defibration temperature. The treatment of fibers with Fenton's reagent in water suspension resulted in the formation of similar numbers of radicals in hardwood and softwood fibers. Radical formation increased with increasing defibration temperature but not so drastically as with laccase treatments. Also the gamma-irradiated fibers contained large numbers of radicals. Their content increased as a function of increasing defibration temperature and was higher for hardwood than for softwood fibers. The internal bond strength (IB) of fiberboards made from fibers treated with laccase or Fenton's reagent in the defibrator blowline improved with increasing defibration temperature. The IB of boards made from laccase-treated fibers correlated with the number of radicals formed in the fibers on laccase treatment in water suspension, indicating that adhesion in the boards was largely due to reactions of radicals on the fiber surfaces. The IB of boards made from fibers treated with Fenton's reagent also correlated with the radical content of the fibers, but this relationship was not as strong as with the laccase treatments. This suggests that bonding mechanisms other than radical coupling may have contributed significantly to adhesion. Gamma-irradiation of fibers before their fabrication into boards resulted in a marked increase in board IB, indicating that radicals {{play a significant role in}} the adhesion of boards made from gamma-irradiated fibers. reviewe...|$|E

50|$|Fibre {{modification}} {{with chemicals}} or enzymes had been investigated {{in the production}} <b>of</b> <b>fibreboards.</b> Fibre modification applying steam (steam-exploded wood) has been proved an efficient pre-treatment method in producing thermoplastic composites.Current theories for interfibre bonding during papermaking process are based on general recognition of the hydrogen bonding model. Consequently, all effort for boosting fibre strength is connected to mechanical beating of fibres in order to generate more flexible and fragmented fibres for increased bonding areas. As a consequence, significant drawbacks are obtained in terms of water retention ratio resulting in poor dewatering behaviour and high energy consumption. New mechanisms for interpretation and control of interfibre bonding are still upcoming. One way to overcome these drawbacks could be the molecular coating of cellulose fibres using polymers targeted on entropy controlled mixing of polymers and cellulose gel resulting in higher bonding forces. Theoretical results as well as experimental data on how application of polymeric layers (e.g. carboxymethyl cellulose) and enzymes on cellulose fibres can lead to sheets of high bonding strength without any mechanical beating have been already presented. However, these attempts were still far from any industrial implementation and their application would have been costly and would {{not solve the problem}} of raw material availability.|$|R
