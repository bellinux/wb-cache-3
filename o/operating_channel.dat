50|$|Throughout {{construction}} of the new maximized transmitting facilities at the Willis Tower, WLS operated both channels 7 and 44 from its auxiliary facilities at the John Hancock Center under an STA. WLS operated channel 7 as a fill-in translator with a power of 7 kW, and operating their full power operations on channel 44 with a power of 1 MW. Through the use of PSIP technology, both operating frequencies were re-mapped and displayed as virtual channel 7, which would cause some digital tuners to have two versions of virtual channels 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, while tuning sequentially. In October 2012, WLS-TV completed construction from the Willis Tower and its <b>operating</b> <b>channel</b> 44 at the 1 million watt power level. The station continued its dual-frequency operations until 12:03 p.m. on March 18, 2013 when WLS-TV formally ceased operations on VHF channel 7, leaving UHF channel 44 as its permanent allotment. Since WLS-TV officially moved its full-power operations to channel 44, {{it is the only}} ABC-owned station to vacate its former analog allotment for its digital operations and the second ABC O&O to operate its full-power operations on the UHF band, after Fresno sister station KFSN-TV.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{radio control}} systems have {{traditionally}} used crystals {{to set the}} <b>operating</b> <b>channel</b> in the receiver and transmitter. It is important that each aircraft uses a different channel, otherwise interference could result. For example, {{if a person is}} flying an aircraft on channel 35 (used for 72.490 MHz in North America), and someone else turns their radio on the same channel, the aircraft's control will be compromised and the result is almost always a crash. Since multiple RC frequency use began in the RC hobbies in the mid-20th century, so-called [...] "frequency pins" [...] have been used to ensure that only one modeler was using a particular frequency at any one time, for [...] "traditional" [...] style, crystal-controlled RC system use [...] The common, spring-loaded two-piece wood clothespin - marked in some manner with text and/or color-coding for the designated frequency it references, usually with an added piece of thin plywood or plastic on the clothespin to place the text or color-code upon for greater visibility - is the usual basis for these. Usually, the model club itself will possess some sort of [...] "transmitter impound" [...] facility at their modeling site for secure storage of the modelers' transmitters when not in active use while visiting the facility, and usually provides some sort of fixed [...] "frequency control board" [...] nearby to the impound area. The [...] "frequency control board" [...] at a modeling club's facility is used in one of two ways: either the club provides sets of frequency pins itself, already clipped onto the control board for the modeler to take the appropriate pin for their modeling activity (clipped onto their transmitter's antenna, in a so-called [...] "subtractive" [...] method) while their transmitter is in use away from the impound area, or with the modeler required to provide them for their own transmitter(s), and places them on a club facility's existing frequency board (the [...] "additive" [...] method) whenever they are using their RC transmitter.|$|E

30|$|The {{authors in}} [22] {{proposed}} a channel allocation scheme for the IEEE 802.22 system which improves {{the performance of}} the probability of forced termination rates (FTR). This article focuses on the medium access control (MAC) layer that allows the coexistence between SUs and PUs and includes the following two elements: the spectrum label and the low on-demand frame contention (ODFC). The channel allocation scheme is developed based on the classification of operation, backup, and candidate channels. The parameters considered for the selection of the channels in this classification scheme are the interference and the arrival probability of PUs. The proposed scheme works as follows: if a PU arrives at the <b>operating</b> <b>channel</b> of the SU, the SU moves to the BKC and the candidate channel is used as the new BKC; if two PUs arrive, one at the <b>operating</b> <b>channel</b> and the other at the BKC, the candidate channel is immediately selected as the <b>operating</b> <b>channel</b> of the SU. The results show that FTR improves based on the interference measurements.|$|E
