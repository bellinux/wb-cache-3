5|$|Nedim Gürsel {{wrote his}} 2001 novel Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul about a minor passage in Candide during which its protagonist meets Ahmed III, the deposed Turkish sultan. This chance meeting {{on a ship}} from Venice to Istanbul is the setting of Gürsel's book. Terry Southern, in writing his popular novel Candy with Mason Hoffenberg adapted Candide for a modern {{audience}} and changed the protagonist from male to female. Candy deals with the rejection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of optimism which the author sees in women's magazines of the modern era; Candy also parodies pornography and popular psychology. This adaptation of Candide was itself adapted for the cinema by director Christian Marquand in 1968.|$|E
5|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of the battalion serving in Singapore as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve, 1973 finally saw all units of the regiment stationed in Australia for the first time. Thus began a period of peace-time soldiering <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> not before seen in the regiment. The end of National Service significantly diminished the strength of the Army, and at this time the government directed that the number of battalions in the regiment be reduced to six, which was achieved by linking 2 and 4 RAR, 5 and 7 RAR, and 8 and 9 RAR. The strength of units and resources were also reduced, with a shift in strategic and tactical concepts from forward defence to defence of continental Australia. Regardless, from September 1973 the battalions of the regiment provided a company on three monthly rotations to Rifle Company Butterworth in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements. Meanwhile, the 10th Independent Rifle Company, Royal Australian Regiment (10 IRC) was raised on 23 May 1974 to provide an opposing force for units training at the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra.|$|E

25|$|While the United States {{with its}} soil {{untouched}} by the war was enjoying prosperity and living standards <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> never seen before in history, life in postwar Britain was comparatively grim.

25|$|The exact events {{surrounding}} Isin's disintegration as a kingdom are mostly unknown, but some evidence can be pieced together. Documents indicate {{that access to}} water sources presented a huge problem for Isin. Isin also endured an internal coup <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> when Gungunum the royally appointed governor of Larsa and Lagash province, seized the city of Ur. Ur had been the main center of the Gulf trade; thus this move economically crippled Isin. Additionally, Gungunum's two successors Abisare and Sumuel (c. 1905BC and 1894BC) both sought to cut Isin off from its canals by rerouting them into Larsa. At some point, Nippur was also lost. Isin would never recover. Around 1860BC, an outsider named Enlil-bani seized the throne of Isin, ending the hereditary dynasty established by Ishbi-Erra over 150years earlier.|$|E

The sons who were certainly found in the Catalogue are Cretheus, Athamas, Sisyphus, Salmoneus, Deion (or Deioneus) and Perieres. A seventh son's name is obscured in lacuna: he has been identified tentatively as Minyas, Locrus or a second Magnes, not the eponym of the Magnetes, but the father of Dictys and Polydectes of the Danaë-Perseus myth. No similar doubt attends the identities of Aeolus' daughters: they were Peisidice, Alcyone, Calyce, Canace and Perimede. The families of the daughters were treated first, and much of the middle of book 1—over 400 lines—was devoted to recounting their descendents. Aeolus' extended family, via both sons and daughters, is notable for a concentration of fantastical narratives and folk elements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> largely absent from the Homeric poems, beginning with the doomed, hubristic love of Ceyx and Alcyone, who called one another [...] "Zeus" [...] and [...] "Hera" [...] and were turned into the kingfisher and halcyon as punishment (frr. 10a.83–98, 10d OCT, 15).|$|E
