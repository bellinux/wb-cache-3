In 2004, 55% of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41% said it should be decreased.

2500|$|A New York Times {{poll found}} that 33% <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>think</b> that Muslim Americans were more [...] "sympathetic to terrorists than other Citizens" [...] Rik Coolsaet {{analysed}} this as indicating {{a high level of}} distrust directed at the American Muslim community. The Times did this survey during the Park51 Ground Zero Mosque incident. [...] The Times called the findings [...] "appalling" [...] and also analysed the data as showing a very high level of distrust of Muslim Americans and robust disapproval of the Park51 Mosque proposal. The New Republic stated that it does not trust the poll carried out by the New York Times and that the figures would be higher than 33%. They further claimed that New York residents are tolerant and if the figures were 33% in New York then [...] "non-New Yorker fellow citizens are far more deeply biased and warped than the Gotham locals".|$|E

Unity08 is attempting to leverage online technology, such as secure voting, to allow American voters to determine the most crucial issues facing the country, discuss them with potential nominees, and participate in an online convention to nominate a bipartisan presidential ticket. [...] In an interview that aired on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer in May 2006, Unity08's founders said that the group was formed {{in response to the}} polarization between the Republican and Democratic political parties. The group also cited a poll it commissioned from Princeton Survey Research and claimed that 82 percent <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>think</b> that the two major political parties are unable to address the country's problems and that 73 percent of Americans are in favor of alternatives to the two parties.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} current {{situation}} in the USA that revolves around the legalization of marijuana from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>think</b> tanks also known as policy institutes. The aim was to compare approaches of these institutions which differ {{from each other in}} their ideological background as well as in their proposed solution. It was necessary for a complex analysis to cast light on the institution of think tanks, their history and influence on lawmaking. Four different groups of think tanks were chosen - libertarian, conservative, centrist and liberal/progressive. It was found out that their impact is hard to measure but they certainly do have some impact. Individual think tanks propose different drug policies from legalization to decriminalization to preservation of current situation and not even two think tanks in the same ideological group share the same opinion...|$|R

Drawing on archival records, interviews, and {{an original}} database {{of the educational}} and career backgrounds of policy experts, this paper examines the growing sphere <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>think</b> tanks. I develop a relational conception of think tanks as structurally hybrid offspring of the more established institutions of academics, politics, business, and journalism – the “parental ” ties being at once material and symbolic: material because these anchoring institutions provide support, patronage, and personnel to think tanks, symbolic because the figures of the policy aide, the academic scholar, the entrepreneur, and the journalist supply the imaginary models from which policy experts fashion their mixed self-understandings. The relational mode of analysis moves the study of think tanks beyond the essentializing question of whether policy experts are at bottom “bona fide intellectuals ” or mere “lobbyists in disguise. ” Key words: think tanks • intellectuals • knowledge production • American politics • relational analysis Word count: 9, 135 (text only) 13, 298 (including footnotes and references...|$|R
