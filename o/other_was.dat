5|$|Easy is {{the most}} recent major {{hurricane}} to strike the Homosassa, Florida, area.

5|$|Heinrich Hertz (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena by building two resonant circuits, {{one of which}} was driven by a generator and the <b>other</b> <b>was</b> tunable and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical resonant response.|$|E
5000|$|Two homeomorphic spaces {{share the}} same topological properties.

Note however that this does not extend to properties defined via a metric; there are metric spaces that are homeomorphic even though one of them is complete and the <b>other</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|R
