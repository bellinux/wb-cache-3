Beyoncé could immediately connect to the topic as she had also experienced the same things in the record industry when people advised her about {{the sound of her}} music. For the music of [...] "Ghost", Boots created a beat from [...] a [...] "dreamlike, hypnotic place" [...] working with guitars and building layers inspired by the work of musician Aphex Twin. Boots said, [...] " [...] works like that are more floaty, more without than within, but I made mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't get out of that feeling." [...] He also elaborated about its concept, [...] "It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going. You're scared and you're not sure what to expect from it, but as the album unfolds, we take the blindfold <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> realize it's a surprise party for you." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1957, Monk {{began to}} perform at the venue for six months with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time Monk's {{employment}} there ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left {{in pursuit of a}} solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group. After returning to New York City's club scene with a new quartet, Monk received an eight-week offer from Joe and Iggy Termini to play the Five Spot Café beginning on June 12, 1958. He played most nights during the weekend to capacity crowds with Abdul-Malik, drummer Roy Haynes, and tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, who had performed with Monk before. Griffin was unfamiliar with all of his repertoire and, like Coltrane, found it difficult to solo over Monk's comping during their first few weeks: [...] "Any deviation, one note <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> sound like you're playing another tune, and you're not paying attention to what's going on. And it's so evident ... there's no space." [...] During their performances, Monk often left the stage for a drink at the bar or danced around, which gave Griffin an opportunity to play with more space. However, the quartet eventually developed a sufficient rapport and grasp of the set list.|$|E

Every so often it broke <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> saw Lucy in the sky with {{diamonds}} all over the sky. This Lucy was God, the Big Figure, the White Rabbit." [...] He later recalled helping Lennon finish the song at Lennon's Kenwood home, specifically claiming he contributed the [...] "newspaper taxis" [...] and [...] "cellophane flowers" [...] lyrics; Lennon's 1968 interview with Rolling Stone magazine confirmed McCartney's contribution.|$|E
