5|$|The {{second issue}} of the comic Homeworlds was {{revealed}} to focus around Tali's past.

Originally intending to take the quarian ship Honorata to the planet Illium, along with Keenah'Breizh, in search of valuable items, they discover geth activity on an unidentified ice planet.

5|$|Within a week <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of construction, however, severe {{deficiencies}} {{were beginning}} to be revealed in the fort's location. Due to its site close to the Long Bridge, Runyon was overlooked by the ridge of the Arlington Heights, and an enemy force could shield itself with the heights and sneak up on the fort unopposed. To prevent this from happening, Barnard was forced to issue orders calling {{for the construction of}} a fort called Fort Albany atop the ridge. Nevertheless, work on Fort Runyon continued despite its less-than-optimal location.|$|E
5|$|After the hot start, a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February occurred {{during which the}} Senators won only seven of 21 games, and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27, 2008, taking over the coaching duties himself. After the coaching switch, team performance improved but did not match the performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the season. A playoff spot was in doubt until the Senators' last game of the season, a loss to Boston, but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing. After all other games were played, the team ended up as the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round, {{a repeat of the}} 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators lost the series four games to none, the third time they were swept in a first-round series. The result, after going to the Finals the previous season, led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season, including the buy-out of Ray Emery and the Senators not re-signing their free agents.|$|E

5|$|As ununennium is {{the lightest}} undiscovered element, {{it has been}} the target of {{synthesis}} experiments by both German and Russian teams in recent years. The Russian experiments were conducted in 2011, and no results were released, strongly implying that no ununennium atoms were identified. From April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295Uue and 296Uue was made by bombarding a target of berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany.

5|$|Marquis {{wished to}} be sent to France, but was {{required}} first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a convalescent hospital. Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia, an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the 1918 flu pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the flu epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task of determining the capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to the attending surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself came down with flu but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. During the long wait for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.|$|E
5|$|The {{culmination}} of a three-month siege by the British, the battle lasted about an hour. British troops commanded by General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadien militia under General Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm, employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle; Wolfe received three gunshot wounds that ended his life within minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the engagement and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a musket ball wound just below his ribs. In {{the wake of the}} battle, the French evacuated the city; their remaining military force in Canada and the rest of North America came under increasing pressure from British forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{ritual is}} {{the central part of}} the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes after the service, and is done by a priest or by a {{respected}} parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, holy water may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of basil into a bowl with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.|$|E

The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder pintles and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.|$|E
5|$|Poti is {{the crucial}} port of Georgia on the Black Sea {{and serves as}} an {{essential}} entry point for Transcaucasia and the landlocked nations of Central Asia. Russian aircraft attacked the town of Poti on 8 August, causing a two-day shutdown of the port. Russia positioned ships {{in the vicinity of}} Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August 2008. The next day, Georgian and Russian representatives said that Russian troops were in Poti, although Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area. On 13 August, six Georgian naval vessels were sunk by Russian troops in Poti. Russian deputy chief of the General staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, denied the Russian presence in Poti the following day. One day after Russia's declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the withdrawal from Georgia, 70 Russian soldiers moved into the port on the morning of 19 August. Russian forces took twenty-one Georgian soldiers prisoner and grabbed five US Humvees in Poti, taking them to a military base occupied by Russian troops in Senaki. The Wall Street Journal said that Russian actions in Poti constituted an additional attack on Georgian economy. Russian military was looting and damaging properties during their presence in Poti, even ransacking toilets.|$|E
