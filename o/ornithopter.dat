25|$|In 1896 Whitehead {{was hired}} as a {{mechanic}} for the Boston Aeronautical Society. He and mechanic Albert B. C. Horn built a Lilienthal-type glider and an <b>ornithopter.</b> Whitehead made a few short and low flights in the glider, but did not succeed in flying the <b>ornithopter.</b> Also in 1896, founding Society member Samuel Cabot employed Whitehead and carpenter James Crowell to build a Lilienthal glider. Cabot reported to the Society that tests with this glider were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|In {{flexible}} wings, much {{or all of}} a {{wing surface}} can change shape in flight to deflect air flow much like an <b>ornithopter.</b> Adaptive compliant wings are a military and commercial effort. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing was a US Air Force, NASA, and Boeing effort.|$|E
50|$|Manned <b>ornithopters</b> {{fall into}} two general categories: Those powered by the muscular effort of the pilot (human-powered <b>ornithopters),</b> and those powered by an engine.|$|R
50|$|NUAA {{unmanned}} <b>ornithopters</b> are Chinese UAVs {{developed by}} Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), {{and all of}} them are experimental aircraft intended to explore technologies of <b>ornithopters.</b> As of 2014 a total of three have been publicized.|$|R
50|$|Similarly to {{propeller}} vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion. Sailboats and sailplanes are {{propelled by}} the forward component of lift generated by their sails/wings. <b>Ornithopters</b> also produce thrust aerodynamically. <b>Ornithopters</b> with large rounded leading edges produce lift by leading-edge suction forces.|$|R
25|$|Boulton also {{attempted}} {{to build an}} <b>ornithopter,</b> an aircraft which would create lift by the movement of its articulating wings. Manned ornithopters were later successful created in 2006 when teams at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) achieved working designs for them with large flapping wing areas.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo {{was fascinated}} by the {{phenomenon}} of flight for much of his life, producing many studies, including Codex on the Flight of Birds (...) , as well as plans for several flying machines such as a flapping <b>ornithopter</b> and a machine with a helical rotor. The British television station Channel Four commissioned a 2003 documentary, Leonardo's Dream Machines, in which various designs by Leonardo, such as a parachute and a giant crossbow, were interpreted, constructed and tested. Some of those designs proved successful, whilst others fared less well when practically tested.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} next filmed Birdy's flight on an <b>ornithopter</b> at the Newby Island landfill in Santa Clara County. The {{filming of}} the scene {{was considered to be}} a health concern among the cast and crew, due to the exposed garbage and smell of methane gas. The filmmakers originally planned to shoot Birdy landing in a reservoir thirty feet away from the landfill, but a test of the water had shown it to be hazardous. Parker said, [...] "We experimented with a 100-foot wire hanging from a helicopter to allow us to 'fly' Birdy into a pond we'd constructed {{at the bottom of a}} hill of garbage." [...] The hospital scenes were filmed at the Agnews Developmental Center, a psychiatric and medical care facility located in Santa Clara. A corner of the hospital was used to film scenes set in Birdy's bedroom.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>ornithopters</b> do not {{necessarily}} act like birds or bats in flight. Typically birds and bats have thin and cambered wings to produce lift and thrust. <b>Ornithopters</b> with thinner wings have a limited angle of attack but provide optimum minimum-drag performance for a single lift coefficient.|$|R
50|$|From {{the last}} years of the 15th century on he wrote about and sketched many designs for flying {{machines}} and mechanisms, including <b>ornithopters,</b> fixed-wing gliders, rotorcraft and parachutes. His early designs were man-powered types including <b>ornithopters</b> and rotorcraft, however he came to realise the impracticality of this and later turned to controlled gliding flight, also sketching some designs powered by a spring.|$|R
50|$|Support {{for a large}} {{variety of}} VTOL architectures: Quadplanes, Tilt wings, tilt rotors, tail sitters, <b>ornithopters.</b>|$|R
500|$|While Joe {{engages the}} robots with his {{modified}} Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins {{photographs from the}} street {{with little regard for}} her personal safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and [...] reluctantly convinces Joe to let her in on the investigation. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf's plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of <b>ornithopter</b> drones. Dex tacks the origin of the signal on a part of a map before his capture.|$|E
500|$|The first album, <b>Ornithopter,</b> came bundled {{with the}} {{original}} release of Air in September 2000. The next album was released in August 2001 as a maxi single titled [...] "Natsukage / Nostalgia" [...] containing a vocal version of [...] "Natsukage", and a B-side track; both songs were sung by Lia {{and the rest of}} the single was produced by Jun Maeda. The game's original soundtrack was released in September 2002 containing two discs with 31 different tracks along with remix and instrumental versions of the opening and ending themes. A piano arrange album was released in December 2003 called Re-feel which contained five tracks from Air and five from Kanon. An EP containing original versions of the three theme songs and remixed versions of the opening and ending themes was released in May 2006 called [...] Each of the albums released for the visual novel version were released on Key's record label Key Sounds Label. The film's original soundtrack was released in March 2005 by Frontier Works. A bonus symphony CD titled Shinwa e no Izanai was released with the special edition Air film DVD on August 5, 2005. Overall, Air music has been well received, and the original soundtrack for the visual novel has met with high sales. The opening theme was involved in copyright infringement in 2005.|$|E

50|$|He {{initially}} {{attempted to}} achieve manned flight with <b>ornithopters.</b> In 1883, he built and experimented {{with a series}} of three <b>ornithopters</b> but found that human strength was insufficient to generate the necessary lift. He abandoned flapping-wing flight, preferring instead to emulate soaring birds with fixed-wing craft. He reasoned that {{it would be possible to}} solve the physics of gliding and soaring flight and then add a motor.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the flying aircraft, several unsuccessful aircraft of the period were represented by non-flying replicasincluding contraptions such as an <b>ornithopter</b> (the Passat <b>Ornithopter)</b> flown by the Italian contender, the Walton Edwards Rhomboidal, Picaut Dubrieul, Philips Multiplane and the Little Fiddler (a canard, or tail-first design). Several of the [...] "non-flying" [...] types flew {{with the help of}} [...] "movie magic".

5000|$|If future manned {{motorized}} <b>ornithopters</b> {{cease to}} be [...] "exotic", imaginary, unreal aircraft and start to serve humans as junior members of the aircraft family, designers and engineers will need to solve not only wing design problems but many other problems involved in making them safe and reliable aircraft. Some of these problems, such as stability, controllability, and durability, are inherent to all aircraft. Other problems specific to <b>ornithopters,</b> will appear; optimizing flapping-wing design {{is only one of}} them.|$|R
50|$|Hobbyists {{can build}} and fly their own <b>ornithopters.</b> These range from {{light-weight}} models powered by rubber bands, to larger models with radio control.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1939, DC's {{success with}} the seminal superhero Superman in Action Comics {{prompted}} editors to scramble for more such heroes. In response, Bob Kane conceived [...] "the Bat-Man." [...] Kane said his influences for the character included actor Douglas Fairbanks' movie portrayal of the swashbuckler Zorro, Leonardo da Vinci's diagram of the <b>ornithopter,</b> a flying machine with huge bat-like wings; and the 1930 film The Bat Whispers, based on Mary Rinehart's mystery novel The Circular Staircase.|$|E

The work takes place after the fall of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the ascension of Paul Atreides to the throne in the original novel Dune. The short story [...] discusses the major sites in the capital city, Arrakeen, including the Grand Palace and Temple of Alia. It also features images (with descriptions) of some of the devices and characters seen in the novels, including Paul's personal <b>ornithopter,</b> an Ixian glowglobe, Princess Irulan, Duncan Idaho and Reverend Mother Mohiam.|$|E
2500|$|Louis BlÃ©riot was an {{engineer}} who had developed the first practical headlamp for cars and {{had established a}} successful business marketing them. [...] In 1901 he had built a small unmanned <b>ornithopter,</b> but his serious involvement with aviation began in April 1905 when he witnessed Gabriel Voisin's first experiments with a floatplane glider towed behind a motorboat on the river Seine. [...] A brief partnership with Voisin followed, but after {{the failure of the}} BlÃ©riot III and its modified version, the BlÃ©riot IV, the partnership was dissolved and BlÃ©riot set up his own company, [...] "Recherches AÃ©ronautique Louis BlÃ©riot" [...] (Louis BlÃ©riot Aeronautical Research).|$|E

2500|$|Like many early {{aircraft}} companies, Voisin {{were prepared}} to build machines to the designs of customers, this work supporting their own design experiments. The company's first customers were a M. Florencie, who commissioned them to build an <b>ornithopter</b> he had designed, and Henri Kapferer, for whom they built a pusher configuration biplane of their own design. [...] The latter was underpowered, having a Buchet engine of only , and it failed to fly. [...] However, Kapferer introduced them to Leon Delagrange, for whom they built a similar machine, powered by a [...] Antoinette engine. [...] This was first successfully flown by Charles Voisin on 30 March 1907, achieving a straight-line flight of [...] In turn Delagrange introduced them to Henri Farman, who ordered an identical aircraft. [...] These two aircraft are often referred to by their owners' names as the Voisin-Delagrange No.1 and the Voisin-Farman No.1, and were {{the foundation of the}} company's success. [...] On 13 January 1908 Farman used his aircraft to win the [...] "Grand Prix de l'aviation" [...] offered by Ernest Archdeacon and Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first closed-circuit flight of over a kilometre. Since the achievements of the Wright Brothers were widely disbelieved at the time, this was seen as a major breakthrough in the conquest of the air, and brought Voisin FrÃ¨res many orders for similar aircraft; around sixty were built.|$|E
5000|$|The Snowbird is a human-powered <b>ornithopter</b> {{that was}} built as a project of the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS). Snowbird was the first human-powered <b>ornithopter</b> to fly {{straight}} and level.|$|E
