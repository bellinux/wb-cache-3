The station's construction was expedited in order to both connect with and compete with the Bergen Street and Smith Street streetcar lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT).

Ion Storm closed its Dallas offices <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> game's release. In 2002, Anachronox cinematic director Jake Hughes spliced together gameplay footage and cutscenes to create a feature-length, award-winning machinima film.|$|E

5|$|Hives further {{recommended}} that a factory be built near Glasgow {{to take advantage}} of the abundant local work force and the supply of steel and forgings from Scottish manufacturers. In September 1939, the Air Ministry allocated ₤4,500,000 for a new Shadow factory. This government-funded and -operated factory was built at Hillington starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October, <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of war. The factory was fully occupied by September 1940. A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in.|$|E

5|$|Multiplayer {{comes in}} two forms in Empire: Total War.

The full campaign multiplayer mode was unveiled <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> initial release, because the technology to create a multiplayer campaign game was not available in previous Total War games, and the time allowed The Creative Assembly to implement this for Empire: Total War. The campaign multiplayer mode was first tested in a two-player beta build which was released on 7 December 2009.|$|E

5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of people attempted to flee Afghanistan following the attacks, fearing a response by the United States. Pakistan, already home to many Afghan refugees from previous conflicts, closed its border with Afghanistan on September 17, 2001. Approximately <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> attacks, the United States led a broad coalition of international forces to overthrow the Taliban regime from Afghanistan for their harboring of al-Qaeda.

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and {{the high level of}} illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E

5|$|By {{four days}} after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 meals to {{displaced}} families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 pounds of ice {{in the first few}} days, and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and 180,000liters of water for the following week for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By about <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)).

5|$|When Rovio {{began writing}} new {{versions}} of the game for other devices, new issues came to light. As the team began working on a version for Android systems, they observed {{the large number of}} configurations of device types and {{versions of the}} Android software. The number of combinations of software version, processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version. Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. <b>One</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.|$|E
5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E
