40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} (RE- 239) is to analyze {{the way in which}} the Bank has been supporting sector reform policies in various countries in recent years. It is based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>based</b> on the principal evaluation results from 14 sector loans that were approved between 1990 and 1995, in eight member countries of the Bank. Drawing on elements both of theory and of empirical evidence, the document establishes a set of features that are necessary for achieving sustained growth of the kind that will contribute to reducing poverty. The sector operation evaluations analyzed here focus on the impact of sector lending in supporting policies and institutions in those areas where major efforts are being made to consolidate stabilization and improve growth prospects, and thereby to reduce poverty...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we present some {{parameters}} {{that are being}} studied to perform a purely morphological analysis of reconstructed images of extended objects, particularly galaxies, {{in the context of}} the ESA-Gaia mission. Those parameters, known as Concentration, Asymmetry, Clumpiness, Gini's coefficient and the Momentum of the brightest 20 % of the galaxy, form a set that is becoming commonly used when a limited number of pixels is available to analyse, such as will be the case for Gaia reconstructed images. We comment about small modifications on those parameters that are planned to be performed. We also report tests with a preliminar version of the code that is being written to analyse Gaia images <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>based</b> on the Frei catalog of galaxies. Finally, we comment on the possibility of using Support Vector Machines to perform the morphological classification based on those measured parameters, and conclude that a very good level of segregation can be obtained for a two-class discrimination...|$|E

40|$|This book {{presents}} {{the details of}} the BONUS algorithm and its real world applications in areas like sensor placement in large scale drinking water networks, sensor placement in advanced power systems, water management in power systems, and capacity expansion of energy systems. A generalized method for stochastic nonlinear programming <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>based</b> approach for uncertainty analysis and statistical reweighting to obtain probability information is demonstrated in this book. Stochastic optimization problems are difficult to solve since they involve dealing with optimization and uncertainty loops. There are two fundamental approaches used to solve such problems. The first being the decomposition techniques and the second method identifies problem specific structures and transforms the problem into a deterministic nonlinear programming problem. These techniques have significant limitations on either the objective function type or the underlying distributions for the uncertain variables. Moreover, these methods assume that there are a small number of scenarios to be evaluated for calculation of the probabilistic objective function and constraints. This book begins to tackle these issues by describing a generalized method for stochastic nonlinear programming problems. This title is best suited for practitioners, researchers and students in engineering, operations research, and management science who desire a complete understanding of the BONUS algorithm and its applications to the real world...|$|R

Three research areas, human aspects of software engineering, requirements engineering, and information systems, study these topics from various perspectives. We {{think it is important to}} analyze user {{participation and}} involvement in software engineering comprehensively to encourage further research in this area. We investigate the evidence on effects of user participation and involvement on system success and we explore which methods are available in literature. A systematic mapping study was conducted. The systematic search yielded 3, 698 hits, from which we identified 289 unique papers. These papers were reviewed by the first author based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The second author validated the selection of papers by reviewing the reasons for exclusion and inclusion and the corresponding papers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>base.</b> 58 of the 289 papers were selected (22 statistical survey and meta-study papers and 36 methods papers). Based on the empirical evidence of the surveys and meta-studies, we developed a meta-analysis of structural equation models.

The analysis of the proposed solutions from the method papers revealed a wide variety of user participation and involvement practices for most activities within software development...|$|R

We present <b>a</b> novel experience <b>based</b> <b>sampling</b> technique which {{has the ability to}} focus on the analysis’s task by making use of the contextual information and past experiences. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> this, <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>based</b> dynamic attention model is built by sensing the experiential environment. Sensor samples are used to gather information about the current environment and attention samples are used to represent the current state of attention.

The multimedia analysis task can then focus on the attention samples only. Moreover, past experiences and the current environment can be used to adaptively correct and tune the attention.

40|$|Ensuring {{conformance}} {{as well as}} establishing quality, {{software testing}} {{is an integral part}} of software engineering lifecycle. However, due to resource and time-to-market constraints, testing all exhaustive possibilities is impossible in nearly all practical testing problems. Considering the aforementioned constraints, much research is now focusing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> technique <b>based</b> <b>on</b> interaction testing (termed t-way strategy). Although helpful, most existing t-way strategies (e. g. AETG, IPOG and GTWay) assume that all parameters have uniform interaction. However, in reality, the interaction between parameters is rarely uniform. Some parameters may not even interact rendering wasted testing efforts. As a result, a number of newly developed t-way strategies that considers variable strength interaction based on input-output relationships have been developed in the literature e. g. Union, ParaOrder and Density. Although useful, these strategies often lack in optimality i. e. in term of the generated test size. Furthermore, no single strategy appears to be dominant as the optimal generation of t-way interaction test suite is considered NP hard problem. Motivated by the abovementioned challenges, this paper proposes and implements a new strategy, called General Variable Strength (GVS). It is demonstrated that GVS, in some cases, produces better results than other competing strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} hedge fund activism and target firm performance, executive compensation, and executive wealth. It introduces a theoretical framework that describes the activism process as a sequence of discrete decisions. The methodology uses regression analysis <b>on</b> <b>a</b> matched <b>sample</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> firm size, industry, and market-to-book ratio. All regressions control for industry and year fixed effects. Schedule 13 D Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings are the source for the statistical sample of hedge fund target firms. I supplement that data with target firm financial, operating, and share price information from the CRSP-COMPUSTAT merged database. Activist hedge funds target undervalued or underperforming firms with high profitability and cash flows. They do not avoid firms with powerful CEOs. Leverage, executive compensation, pay for performance and CEO turnover increase at target firms after {{the arrival of the}} activist hedge fund. Target firm executives’ wealth is more sensitive to changes in share price after hedge fund activism events suggesting that the executive team experiences changes to their compensation structure that provides incentive to take action to improve returns to shareholders.

The use of the subspace identification based ANC methods enables non-iterative derivation and updating of MIMO compact state space models for the controller. The robustness property of subspace identification methods forms {{the basis of an}} accurate model updating mechanism, using small size data batches. The design of a feedforward controller via the proposed approach is illustrated for an acoustic duct benchmark problem, supplied by TNO Institute of Applied Physics (TNO-TPD), the Netherlands.

40|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} structural econometric models (nonlinear rational expectations, option pricing, auction models, [...] .) characterize observable variables as highly nonlinear transforma- tions of some latent variables. These transformations are one-to-one, but {{they depend on}} the unknown distribution of the latent variables through the equilibrium of the game and/or the learning process. Therefore numerical complexity of the equilibrium definition generates sub- stantial obstacles for the direct implementation of maximum likelihood inference. This is a particular case of argmax estimators <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> untractable <b>sample</b> <b>based</b> criterion Q[exp. T][thêta,lambda(thêta) ] contaminated by the occurences of [thêta] in a ‘nuisance function’ [lambda(thêta) ] to which corresponds a simple criterion Q[exp. T][thêta,lambda(thêta. exp 0) ] with [thêta. exp. 0] the true, unknown value of the parameter. The natural idea is to replace the unknown value [lambda(thêta. exp 0) ] by some ’good proxy’, say [lambda(thêta. exp 1) ], to maximize Q[exp. T][thêta,lambda(thêta. exp 1) ] with respect to [thêta] {{and to get a}} new, updated estimate which, in turn, can be used for approxi- mating [lambda(thêta. exp 0) ], [...] .

This radio galaxy was discovered in the Elais-N 2 field and has a spectral index of alpha = 0. 75, i. e. not ultra-steep spectrum. It also has a luminosity consistent with being drawn from the break of the radio luminosity function and can therefore be considered as a typical radio galaxy. Using the Spitzer-SWIRE data over this field we find that the host galaxy is consistent with being similarly massive to the lower redshift powerful radio galaxies (~ 1 - 3 L*). We note however, that at z= 4. 88 the H-alpha line is redshifted into the IRAC 3. 6 micron filter and some of the flux in this band may be due to this rather than stellar continuum emission. The discovery of such a distant radio source from our initial spectroscopic observations demonstrate the promise of our survey for finding the most distant radio sources.

METHODS: Individual data of participation and aggregate socioeconomic data, from respectively the structure responsible for organising screening and the French census, were analysed simultaneously by a multilevel model. RESULTS: Uptake was significantly higher in women than in men; odds ratio (OR= 1. 33; 95 %CI: 1. 21 - 1. 45); and significantly lower in the youngest (50 - 59 years) and in the oldest (70 - 74 years) persons, compared with intermediate ages 60 - 69 years with respectively OR= 0. 70 (95 %CI: 0. 63 - 0. 77) and OR= 0. 82 (95 %CI: 0. 72 - 0. 93).

For many spatial algorithms, time-efficiency of quadtrees in terms of execution may be as important as their space-efficiency concerning storage conditions. Briefly, the quadtree is a class of hierarchical data structures which is based on the recursive partition of a square region into quadrants and sub-quadrants until a predefined limit. Beyond the wide applicability of quadtrees in image processing, spatial information analysis, and building digital databases (processes becoming ordinary for the astronomical community), there may be numerous further applications in astronomy. Some of these practicable applications based on quadtree representation of astronomical data are presented and suggested for further considerations. Examples are shown for use of point as well as region quadtrees. Statistics of different leaf and non-leaf nodes (homogeneous and heterogeneous sub-quadrants respectively) at different levels may provide useful information on spatial structure of astronomical data in question. By altering the principle guiding the decomposition process, different types of spatial data may be focused <b>on.</b> Finally, <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> method <b>based</b> <b>on</b> quadtree representation of an image is proposed which may prove to be efficient in the elaboration of <b>sampling</b> strategy in <b>a</b> region where observations were carried out previously either with different resolution or/and in different bands...|$|R

However, {{it has been shown}} that Pielou’s test is not appropriate for testing segregation against the RL pattern while Dixon’s tests are. In this article, we compare Pielou’s and Dixon’s NNCT-tests; introduce the one-sided versions of Pielou’s test; extend the use of NNCT-tests for testing complete spatial randomness (CSR) of points from two or more classes (which is called CSR independence, henceforth). We assess the finite sample performance of the tests by an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study and demonstrate that Dixon’s tests are also appropriate for testing CSR independence; but Pielou’s test and the corresponding one-sided versions are liberal for testing CSR independence or RL. Furthermore, we show that Pielou’s tests are only appropriate when the NNCT is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> random <b>sample</b> of (<b>base,</b> NN) pairs. We also prove the consistency of the tests under their appropriate null hypotheses. Moreover, we investigate the edge (or boundary) effects on the NNCT-tests and compare the buffer zone and toroidal edge correction methods for these tests. We illustrate the tests <b>on</b> <b>a</b> real life and an artificial data set...|$|R
40|$|Aims: We present new {{extraction}} {{and identification}} techniques for supernova (SN) spectra developed within the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) collaboration. Methods: The new spectral extraction method takes {{full advantage of}} photometric information from the Canada-France-Hawaï telescope (CFHT) discovery and reference images by tracing the exact position of the supernova and the host signals on the spectrogram. When present, the host spatial profile is measured on deep multi-band reference images and is used to model the host contribution to the full (supernova + host) signal. The supernova is modelled as a Gaussian function of width equal to the seeing. A χ 2 minimisation provides the flux of each component in each pixel of the 2 D spectrogram. For a host-supernova separation greater than ⪆ 1 pixel, the two components are recovered separately {{and we do not}} use a spectral template in contrast to more standard analyses. This new procedure permits a clean extraction of the supernova separately from the host in about 70 % of the 3 rd year ESO/VLT spectra of the SNLS. A new supernova identification method is also proposed. It uses the SALT 2 spectrophotometric template to combine the photometric and spectral data. A galaxy template is allowed for spectra for which a separate extraction of the supernova and the host was not possible. Results: These new techniques have been tested against more standard extraction and identification procedures. They permit a secure type and redshift determination in about 80 % of cases. The present paper illustrates their performances <b>on</b> <b>a</b> few <b>sample</b> spectra. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> observations obtained with FORS 1 at the Very Large Telescope on the Cerro Paranal, operated by the European Southern Observatory, Chile (ESO Large Programmes 171.

40|$|We {{motivate the}} {{importance}} of understanding the kinematics and dynamics of the Milky Way stellar halo both in unravelling the formation history and evolution of our host Galaxy and in the more general context of galaxy dynamics. We present a cleaned picture of the kinematics of the smooth component of the stellar halo: we develop a method to quantify the average distance error <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of stars <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the idea of Schoenrich et al. (2012), but adapted so that it uses velocity information only on average. We use this scheme to construct an analytic distance calibration for Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) field halo stars in Sloan colours and demonstrate that our calibration is a) more accurate than the ones available and b) unbiased w. r. t. metallicity and colour. We measure {{the rotation of the}} smooth component of the stellar halo with a tool-set of four estimators that use either only the l. o. s. velocities or the full 3 D motion. From two samples of BHB stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we favour a non-rotating single halo. We critique conflicting results in the literature <b>based</b> on similar <b>samples</b> and trace back the disagreement (either in the sign of rotation or in the morphology of the halo) to sample contaminations and/or neglect account of the halo geometry. We propose a scheme that generalizes any isotropic spherical model to a model where the potential is axisymmetric and the distribution function {{is a function of the}} three actions. The idea is to approximate the Hamiltonian as a function of the actions with a library of quadratic fits to surfaces of constant energy in action space and then make explicit the dependence of the energy on the three actions in the ergodic distribution function. The transparency of the physics implied by the model we achieve, should make it possible to combine our spheroidal models to the f(J) -models of Binney (2010) for the disks and of Pontzen & Governato (2013) for the dark-matter halo, and obtain a complete actions-defined dynamical model of the Milky Way Galaxy.

40|$|The {{influence}} of several environmental and antropic parameters were evaluated on productivity, diversity and distribution {{patterns of the}} Gasteromycetes, in Parque de Natureza de Noudar (Alentejo, Portugal). The study area is dominate by holm oak stands with and without shrubs (montado) and areas of pastures and grasses. In a minor scale, there are some cork oak stands, shrub lands and stream margins vegetation. The experimental design consisted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stratified <b>sampling</b> procedure, <b>based</b> in the total area and land use of each biotope and the maximum sampling effort. Therefore, 45 circular plots (250 m² each) were distributed randomly and proportionally among the six biotopes present in the study area. All the plots were sampled monthly, from November of 2006 to April of 2007. During this period all the carpophores were identified, collected to evaluate the species productivity (number of carpophores) and some specimens were preserved for the reference collection (Herbarium of the University of Évora - UEVH). After the environmental characterization {{of the study area}} (climate, vegetation and soil), all data was analyzed using a Principal components analysis (PCA) followed by a hierarchical grouping of "clusters", using as aggregation method the "complete linkage. " The results suggest that the presence of this heterogenic group of fungi is partly conditioned by vegetation type and management practices. On the other hand, productivity and phenology {{are more likely to be}} influenced by climatic conditions, particularly precipitation. The holm oak biotopes present the highest biodiversity of this group of fungi, whereas areas dominated by shrubs reveal the highest productivity. Within the holm oak biotopes, the montado biotope registers the highest number of Gasteromycetes trophic groups (mycorrhizal, humicolous, lignicolous and coprophilous), whereas in the pastures and grasses and in the streams biotopes no presences were registered. Ten of the total species, namely Bovista delicata, B. dermoxantha, Crucibulum laeve, Cyathus olla, C. stercoreus, Geastrum elegans, Handkea excipuliformis, Ileodictyon gracile, Lycoperdon atropurpureum and Vascellum pratense, are reported for the first time to the province of Baixo Alentejo. The species potential distribution maps may constitute a valuable tool for identifying and preserve areas of special mycological interest on the Parque de Natureza de Noudar...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the field of}} applied statistics and financial modeling by analyzing mathematical models used in retail credit underwriting processes. Specifically, it has three goals. First, the thesis aims to challenge the performance criteria used by established statistical approaches and propose focusing on predictive power instead. Secondly, it compares the analytical leverage of the established and other suggested methods according to the newly proposed criteria. Third, the thesis seeks to develop and specify a new comprehensive profitability-based underwriting model and critically reflect on its strengths and weaknesses. In the first chapter I look into the area of probability of default modeling and argue for comparing the predictive power of the models in time rather than focusing on the random testing sample only, as typically suggested in the scholarly literature. For this purpose I use the concept of survival analysis and the Cox model in particular, and apply it to a real Czech banking data sample alongside the commonly used logistic regression model to compare the results using the Gini coefficient and lift characteristics. The Cox model performs comparably on the randomly chosen validation sample and clearly outperforms the logistic regression approach in the predictive power. In the second chapter, in the area of loss given default modeling I introduce two Cox-based models, and compare their predictive power with the standard approaches using the linear and logistic regression <b>on</b> <b>a</b> real data <b>sample.</b> <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> the modified coefficient of determination, the Cox model shows better predictions. Third chapter focuses on estimating the expected profit {{as an alternative to the}} risk estimation itself and building on the probability of default and loss given default models, I construct a comprehensive profitability model for fix-term retail loans underwriting. The model also incorporates various related risk-adjusted revenues and costs, allowing more precise results. Moreover, I propose four measures of profitability, including the risk-adjusted expected internal rate of return and return on equity and simulate the impact of the model on each of the measures. Finally, I discuss some weaknesses of these approaches and solve the problem of finding default or fraud concentrations in the portfolio. For this purpose, I introduce a new statistical measure based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pre-defined expert critical default rate and compare the GUHA method with the classification tree method <b>on</b> <b>a</b> real data <b>sample.</b> While drawing on the comparison of different methods, this work {{contributes to}} the debates about survival analysis models used in financial modeling and profitability models used in credit underwriting...|$|R
