On MIT computer keyboards, the Meta key {{is used as a}} modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a Windows key. Compact keyboard layouts often use a Fn key.

40|$|In {{menu-driven}} {{computer programs}} the user is often required to select an option from among several alternatives. The most common response system for this selection is the stan-dard keyboard. Three response selection methods were evaluated: using a key-controlled cursor {{to point to}} the desired <b>option,</b> <b>keying</b> a digit to indicate the desired <b>option,</b> and <b>keying</b> a letter that served as a mnemonic device. The speed and errors of selecting options with the alternative methods were studied as a function of (1) the number of the alternative options in the array and (2) familiarity with the program and the options. Results demonstrated the superiority of the meaningful letter code, and the differential and lower effectiveness of cursor and digit as a function of level of practice and number of options. A default selection method that utilizes the practice effect is recommended...|$|R

A small set of keyboard commands (such as cut and paste, open and save) are standard across nearly all applications, and many other commands are standardized (Find, Show Fonts). If an application needs more shortcuts than can be obtained with the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet, double modifiers such as Command+Option are used.|$|R
