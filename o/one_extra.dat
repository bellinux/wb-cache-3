5|$|A set of 14 {{illustrated}} {{short stories}} which added to Clannad story were serialized between the September 2004 and October 2005 issues of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine. Titled , there were 13 regular chapters and <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> bonus chapter. The installments {{were written by}} Key's scenario staff and each story was accompanied by illustrations by Japanese artist GotoP. Two more stories were included when they were collected into a 103-page bound volume released on November 25, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who had missed the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E
5|$|In week four, the Pros {{played against}} the Cincinnati Celts. The Celts were not {{directly}} {{affiliated with the}} APFA and would not join the league until the following year. Fullback Rip King scored the first touchdown by a five-yard rush in the first quarter. Pollard also scored a touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}} en route to a 13–0 Akron victory. The Pro's kicker for that game, Charlie Copley, made <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> point and missed the other. The Pros' defense was so dominant that the Celts did not get a single first down all game long.|$|E

5|$|In week nine, the Triangles {{played against}} the Akron Pros. The Pros {{came into this}} game {{as one of the}} few teams left in the APFA who were undefeated. The game started out with three {{scoreless}} quarters until Rip King threw a 15-yard passing touchdown in the fourth quarter to Frank McCormick. Fritz Pollard, a future Hall-of-Famer, rushed for a 17-yard touchdown, and Charlie Copley made <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> point and missed another one to beat the Triangles 13–0 and give the Triangles their first loss of the season.|$|E

5|$|About 90 {{atoms of}} flerovium have been observed: 58 were {{synthesized}} directly, {{and the rest}} were made from the radioactive decay of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms {{have been shown to}} have mass numbers from 284 to 290. The most stable known flerovium isotope, flerovium-289, has a half-life of around 2.6seconds, but {{it is possible that the}} unconfirmed flerovium-290 with <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> neutron may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half-life of 19seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of any element at these farthest reaches of the periodic table. Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.|$|E
5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E

5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> train slot on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by moisture in the couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E
5|$|With {{the series}} already lost, England made four changes to their team. Dewes {{replaced}} Washbrook, who {{was suffering from}} a thumb injury, {{at the top of}} the order. Watkins replaced Cranston as the middle order batsman and bowler. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut. England played two spinners; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker, while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard. The selectors were widely condemned for their changes. Australia made three changes. Having taken only seven wickets in the first four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured Toshack was replaced by the recovered Barnes, meaning that Australia were playing with <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury.|$|E
5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens and court cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} extra stage {{system used}} on DJ Troopers for e-Amusement users is Military Splash, {{an extension of}} the VIP Room concept from Gold. The system is divided into 2 tiers, one containing 3 songs and a <b>One</b> More <b>Extra</b> Stage, and the other containing 4 plus another <b>One</b> More <b>Extra</b> Stage, aptly titled Military Splash #02. The songs contained on the first tier are Mirage Residence by Jimmy Weckl, Übertreffen by dj TAKA, TRIP MACHINE PhoeniX by DE-SIRE alternative, and the <b>One</b> More <b>Extra</b> Stage, TROOPERS by Des-TRACT. When Military Splash is unlocked, an option appears when an Extra Stage is unlocked in Standard mode, allowing access to it instead of a regular Extra Stage.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> hardpoint per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on Wednesday 23 May at Worcestershire's New Road ground in Worcester, but no play was possible due to bad weather, and so the match {{was moved to the}} following day. The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to be playing. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset, and chose to bat first. The Somerset captain himself opened the batting, alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's West Indian bowler, Vanburn Holder, bowled the first over. Holder bowled seven deliveries—six denoted a normal over, but he had to bowl <b>one</b> <b>extra</b> due to a no ball—all to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots, and declared Somerset's innings complete {{at the end of the}} over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no ball, and Worcestershire only needed to score two to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod were the batsmen. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. Keith Jennings bowled the second over, and Turner scored another single from the fourth delivery to grant Worcestershire the victory.|$|E
