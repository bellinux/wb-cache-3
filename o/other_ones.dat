5|$|The {{graphics}} and characters of each worlds {{were designed to}} resemble the artwork style of each Disney films. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the worlds are unaware of <b>other</b> <b>ones,</b> with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, {{such as the}} introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory {{can be thought of}} as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the <b>other</b> <b>ones,</b> too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.|$|E

5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that the hairs would cast shadows on <b>other</b> <b>ones.</b> Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E
5|$|In 2012, DeMarco {{went back}} to {{recording}} as a solo artist and was signed by Captured Tracks. They released his EP Rock and Roll Night Club in early 2012; it received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. His second studio album, 2, followed later the same year. 2 was met with critical acclaim and peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. It was followed by DeMarco’s third studio album, Salad Days in 2014. Salad Days was also praised by critics and peaked at number 90 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 30 on the Billboard 200. DeMarco released an EP titled Some <b>Other</b> <b>Ones</b> and the mini-LP Another One {{in the summer of}} 2015. Another One was met with positive reviews and peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, it peaked at number 25 on the Billboard 200, selling 13,000 copies in its first week. This Old Dog, DeMarco's fourth album was released in the summer of 2017 to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Other new {{features}} {{were added to}} the series, such as the monsters being animated when they attack. The Slime Arena and Best Dresser Contest were new mini-games introduced; the casinos return from previous Dragon Quest games. Like previous games, mini medals can be found hidden throughout the worlds and can be traded for items. There are bonus dungeons and a few extra characters after beating the main storyline. There is a day and night system, as in some previous installments; with certain storyline events happening at night. While the Monster Master class can catch monsters in the original Super Famicom version it is not {{a major part of the}} game. Another returning feature from the past two games is the use of the wagon, which allows characters to be swapped out for <b>other</b> <b>ones</b> on the world map.|$|E

In 2000, the <b>Other</b> <b>Ones</b> toured again, this time with Kreutzmann but without Lesh. After taking another year off, the band toured again in 2002 with Lesh. That year, the <b>Other</b> <b>Ones</b> then included all four living former Grateful Dead members {{who had been in}} the band for most or all of its history. At different times the shifting lineup of the <b>Other</b> <b>Ones</b> also included guitarists Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, and Jimmy Herring, keyboardists Bruce Hornsby, Jeff Chimenti, and Rob Barraco, saxophonist Dave Ellis, drummer John Molo, bassist Alphonso Johnson, and vocalist Susan Tedeschi.|$|E

60|$|If {{speculation}} tends thus to {{a terrific}} unity, {{in which all}} things are absorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is the course of gravitation of mind; {{the second is the}} power of nature. Nature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate all things, all thought; the one, the many. One is being; the <b>other,</b> intellect; <b>one</b> is necessity; the <b>other,</b> freedom; <b>one,</b> rest; the <b>other,</b> motion; <b>one,</b> power; the <b>other,</b> distribution; <b>one,</b> strength; the <b>other,</b> pleasure; <b>one,</b> consciousness; the <b>other,</b> definition; <b>one,</b> genius; the <b>other,</b> talent, <b>one,</b> earnestness; the <b>other,</b> knowledge; <b>one,</b> possession; the <b>other,</b> trade; <b>one,</b> caste; the <b>other,</b> culture; <b>one</b> king; the <b>other,</b> democracy; and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher, and name the last tendency of both, we might say, {{that the end of the}} one is escape from organization,--pure science; and the end of the other is the highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive deity.|$|R
