5|$|Despite high aspirations, the Metroliner cars {{proved to}} have poor reliability, {{with less than}} two-thirds of the fleet in service at many times. Four cars were {{successfully}} <b>overhauled</b> for improved operation in 1974, but the rebuilding cost more than the original purchase price of the cars. Thirty-three more cars were <b>overhauled</b> in 1979–1980. However, by this time, new AEM-7 locomotives pulling Amfleet cars could match Metroliner schedules with higher reliability. Metroliners were withdrawn from Metroliner service entirely in 1981; they served until 1988 on Keystone Service trains.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a repair shop with {{multiple}} parallel servers, which has to carry out planned <b>overhauls.</b> Each <b>overhaul</b> consists {{of a large number}} of maintenance jobs. The <b>overhaul</b> process is interrupted by randomly arriving emergency jobs. To control the delivery performance of the <b>overhauls,</b> knowledge about the <b>overhaul</b> makespan distribution should be available. Using a 2 -dimensional Markov model, we derive the first and second moment of the <b>overhaul</b> makespan analytically for the case that the repair times of all <b>overhaul</b> jobs are identically and exponentially distributed. For the case of nonidentical repair time distributions, an approximation is presented. Simulation shows that the makespan distribution fitted on these moments gives an excellent approximation...|$|R

40|$|A {{preventive}} maintenance policy with minimal repair at failure, periodic <b>overhaul</b> and replacement is considered. A model describing {{the effect of}} <b>overhaul</b> is proposed and the expected cost rate is obtained under negligible or non-negligible maintenance time. Based on this model, the optimal number of <b>overhauls</b> and optimal interval between <b>overhauls</b> for minimizing the expected cost rate over infinite time horizon are determined. Under some mild conditions, a unique optimal maintenance policy exists and a closed form expression for the optimal interval between <b>overhauls</b> is derived when the lifetime of the system follows Weibull distribution.

40|$|This article systematizes {{data on the}} {{new system}} for {{organizing}} and funding the <b>overhaul</b> of common property in an apartment building (AB), {{being one of the}} most important directions of communal services reform. The purpose of optimization of the <b>overhaul</b> system of apartment building common property is effective functioning of the AB common property <b>overhaul</b> system. The optimization shall be implemented by applying international practices, while considering the specifics of domestic procedures of apartment building <b>overhaul</b> system. A defining concept in this new <b>overhaul</b> system is the <b>overhaul</b> fund whose main source would be obligatory target payments made by owners of apartments in apartment buildings. The owners from each apartment building should select one of two possible ways to create such a fund (on a special account or on a regional operator’s account). The article deals with development of regulatory framework for <b>overhauls</b> of common property in apartment buildings, approval of the regional program, minimum rate of contribution for the <b>overhaul,</b> as well as creation and management of the regional operator’s activities. Considering a number of existing issues, this article lists basic ways how to optimize the <b>overhaul</b> system for apartment buildings. The conclusions and proposals made in this study can be used to solve practical tasks...|$|R

50|$|The TBO {{is a time}} 'recommended' by the {{manufacturer}} and, depending upon what rules the aircraft operates under, <b>overhauling</b> the engine at this time is not necessarily mandatory.

5|$|The aircraft's number 2 port engine No.5097, {{constructed}} in 1961, had run for 14,917 hours from new, {{and had been}} <b>overhauled</b> in spring 1965 because of vibration caused by metal fatigue that had led {{to the failure of}} a stage 8 high-pressure compressor blade. In 1967 the engine had been removed from service because of flame tube deterioration, and as part of the repairs, the low-pressure compressor, of which the number 5 wheel was an original component, was <b>overhauled,</b> but the wheel itself was not tested for fatigue. On 22 November 1967 the engine was bench tested and rejected because of excessive vibration of the high-pressure compressor, but was later released as serviceable following further analysis. After 1,415 hours service on another 707 and modification to the turbine seals, on 5 April 1968 No.5097 became number 2 engine of the port wing of the aircraft, scheduled to fly long-haul to Sydney, Australia, three days later.|$|E
