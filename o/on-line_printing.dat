40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} <b>on-line</b> <b>printing</b> of {{paperboard}} envelopes {{as a means}} of supporting the need to provide customized packaging. Market forces and new business models are contributing to the need for customized packaging and rapid response to orders. Large retailers are demanding unique packaging presentations and global marketing requires localized packaging for different regions of the world. A business environment ofjust-intime delivery and minimal inventory levels demand flexibility to react to unpredictable product mix and volumes. These conditions require customized packaging within short cycle times. The traditional carton printing process using offset lithography does not respond quickly enough to meet these needs. Alternate methods of applying graphics to paperboard envelopes provide the capability to respond to the need for customized packaging quickly. This study evaluates several alternative application methods to test the hypothesis that on-line graphics application can provide high quality graphic presentation for low volume, customized packages at a cost that is competitive with traditional offset carton printing...|$|E

The tool, TurboMedical, is a PDF version of our Form 8500 - 8 and even includes a dummy “FF ” (medical certificate number). Airmen are completing the form <b>on-line,</b> <b>printing</b> a copy, and asking aviation medical examiners to accept them in lieu of completing one of the AME’s forms. RESULT One of our AMEs accepted this form and successfully transmitted an examination into the Aerospace Medical Certification Subsystem, using the dummy “FF ” number. The system accepted the number, since there were no duplicates already in the database. A second AME also accepted a TurboMedical form with the same dummy “FF ” number and attempted to enter it into the AMCS, but this form was rejected by the system.

40|$|The {{utility model}} relates to an <b>on-line</b> palm <b>print</b> image {{collector}} which {{belongs to the}} technical field of on-line personal identification and Chinese medical automatic diagnosis instruments. The utility model is studied and designed for solving the problems that the collecting quality of the traditional palm image {{is concerned with the}} inking degree and the stamping force, the automatic palm print identification is very difficult, the collected image resolution is not high and the collecting is not convenient. The <b>on-line</b> palm <b>print</b> image collector of the utility model consists of a digital camera, a lamp house, a reflector, a communication interface, a computer, a collector bracket, a collector shell, a collector box and a palm box; wherein, the collector shell is fixed on the collector bracket; the digital camera, the lamp house and the reflector are arranged in the collector box; the digital camera is connected with the computer through the communication interface; the palm box is communicated with the collector box. The utility model which can obtain the palm image with higher resolution and keep the three-dimensional curved surface information of the palm, and can meet the current demands of on-line personal identification and Chinese medical automatic diagnosis has the advantages of real-time collecting, simple structure, easy assembly and convenient use and adjustment. 本实用新型涉及一种在线掌纹图像采集仪，属基于人体生物特征的在线身份识别和中医自动诊断仪器技术领域，为解决传统掌纹图像的采集质量与着墨的程度和捺印的力度有关、自动化掌纹识别难度大、采集的图像分辨率不高和采集不方便的问题而研制设计，在线掌纹图像采集仪由数码摄像头、光源、反射镜、通讯接口、计算机、仪器支架、仪器外壳、仪器箱体和手掌箱体组成；仪器外壳固定在仪器支架上形成的仪器箱体内安装数码摄像头、光源、反射镜，数码摄像头经通讯接口与计算机连接，手掌箱体与仪器箱体相通；本实用新型可获得比较高分辨率的掌纹图像，保持手掌的三维曲面信息，具有实时采集的优点，能满足当前在线身份识别和中医自动诊断的要求；具有结构简单、组装容易、使用调整方便的优点、特点。Department of ComputingInventor name used in this publication: 张大鹏Inventor name used in this publication: 王宽全Inventor name used in this publication: 卢光明Inventor name used in this publication: 邬向前Title in Traditional Chinese: 在線掌紋圖像採集儀Chin...|$|R

40|$|When {{developing}} a domain model, it seems natural {{to bring the}} traditional informal tools of inspection and verification, debuggers and automated test suites, to bear upon the problems that will inevitably arise. Debuggers that allow inspection of registers and memory and stepwise execution have been a staple of software development of all sorts from the very beginning. Automated testing has repeatedly proven its considerable worth, {{to the extent that}} an entire design philosophy (Test Driven Development) has been developed around the writing of tests. Unfortunately, while not entirely without their uses, the limitations of these tools {{and the nature of the}} complexity of models and the underlying planning systems make the diagnosis of certain classes of problems and the verification of their solutions difficult or impossible. Debuggers provide a good local view of executing code, allowing a fine-grained look at algorithms and data. This view is, however, usually only at the level of the current scope in the implementation language, and the data-inspection capabilities of most debuggers usually consist of <b>on-line</b> <b>print</b> statements. More modem graphical debuggers offer a sort of tree view of data structures, but even this is too low-level and is often inappropriate for the kinds of structures created by planning systems. For instance, god or constraint networks are at best awkward when visualized as trees. Any any non-structural link between data structures, as through a lookup table, isn't captured at all. Further, while debuggers have powerful breakpointing facilities that are suitable for finding specific algorithmic errors, they have little use in the diagnosis of modeling errors...|$|R
