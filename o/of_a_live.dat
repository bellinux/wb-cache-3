5|$|Of {{the eight}} or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others {{probably}} all became extinct {{due to a}} combination of excessive hunting and deforestation. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene parrot itself is uncertain. In 1834, the German zoologist and author Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> Mascarene parrot in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The bird must have been very old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The IUCN Red List accepts the 1834 account as the last mention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> specimen.|$|E

5|$|FreeBSD {{has several}} unique {{features}} related to storage. Soft updates can protect {{the consistency of}} the UFS filesystem (widely used on the BSDs) {{in the event of a}} system crash.

GEOM is a modular framework that provides RAID (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), full disk encryption, journaling, concatenation, caching, and access to network-backed storage. GEOM allows building of complex storage solutions combining ("chaining") these mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Maneater {{is one of}} the few {{films in}} the series to break the {{standard}} formula of Syfy natural horror films with its use of a normal, living tiger rather than a CG animal or excusing its behavior by having it be a mutant or genetically altered.

For example, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded project implanted electrodes into adult male Rhinoceros beetles, {{allowing them to}} be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held on its back.

Koprowski continued to work on the vaccine throughout the 1950s, leading to large-scale trials in the then Belgian Congo and the vaccination of seven million children in Poland against serotypes PV1 and PV3 between 1958 and 1960.|$|E

5|$|The shark tourist {{industry}} has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to £20,000. That is {{a fraction of}} the tourism value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between £50 and £150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between £9,000 and £27,000 of revenue daily.|$|E
5|$|Theaters {{projected}} silent {{films with}} a variety of musical accompaniment. Depending on the film and the venue, accompanying music might have been the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> pianist or orchestra, recorded music, or absent entirely. Some films were distributed with cue sheets indicating when music was to be played, or anthologies of specific songs to use as accompaniment. Especially between 1910 and 1912, these selections were often popular music, chosen because the song's title or lyrics related to the film in some way, in contrast to later efforts to provide music with appropriate texture. Beginning in 1910, Vitagraph provided lists of this nature for all of their films.|$|E
5|$|Three years elapsed between series VI and VII, {{partly due}} to the {{dissolving}} of the Grant and Naylor partnership, but also due to cast and crew working on other projects. When the series eventually returned, it was filmised and no longer shot in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> audience, allowing for greater use of four-walled sets, location shooting, and single-camera techniques. When the show returned for its eighth series two years later, it had dropped use of the filmising process and returned to using a live audience.|$|E

5|$|As {{the debate}} over Zeus raged, the Nike team was making rapid {{progress}} developing the actual system. Test firings of the original A models of the missile began in 1959 at White Sands Missile Range. The first attempt on 26 August 1959 was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> booster stage and dummy sustainer, but the booster broke up shortly before booster/sustainer separation. A similar test on 14 October was a success, followed by the first two-stage attempt on 16 December. The first complete test of both stages with active guidance and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 February 1960. Data collected from these tests led to changes to the design to improve speed during the ascent. The first test of the Zeus B took place in May 1961. A number of Zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of the control surfaces, and numerous changes were worked into the system to address this.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce the feel <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E
5|$|Coleman {{hired the}} Portland company Sandstrom Design {{to help with}} marketing.

Sandstrom Design produced a 56-page flyer that showed the performance schedule for the 2003–2004 season which was mailed to subscribers, potential customers, handed out at performances and placed around town. The promotional campaign stressed the unique qualities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> theater performance as entertainment over television and film.
