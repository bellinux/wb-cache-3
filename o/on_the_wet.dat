5|$|Giro {{champion}} Denis Menchov was {{the last}} man to take the course. The rain started again as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course. He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well {{out in front of}} him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|The race began {{without a}} {{formation}} lap {{and despite the}} slow speed, drivers struggled for grip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> surface. After three laps under the safety car, conditions were unchanged; drivers reported on the circuit's condition via radio and the race was suspended. Light rain prevented the resumption of the Grand Prix for over forty-five minutes until the marshals and road sweeping trucks removed some of the excess water and dirt on the track. Resin on the newly laid track surface had prevented water from soaking into the ground. The rain had eased slightly during the suspension. Teams were allowed to change the set-up of their cars, which were largely optimised for dry weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|Following the pitstops {{and safety}} car deployment, Petrov had gained sixth place while Barrichello, Alguersuari, Rosberg and Maldonado {{were in the}} {{remaining}} point scoring positions. Schumacher and Webber, who had contested second place before the safety car, resumed their fight as the race resumed on lap 61. Barrichello was passed by Rosberg and Alguersuari before Massa, {{who had been in}} eleventh place, overtook both Williams cars for ninth. Kobayashi lost fifth place to Petrov, and Maldonado retired by spinning off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> track at turn two. Webber, passing Schumacher using DRS, cut the chicane on lap 64 and ceded the position back to avoid a penalty. Button passed Webber, after he again cut the chicane, and Schumacher on the same lap, and gained second place. As Button began catching race leader Vettel, Webber overtook Schumacher for third place on lap 67. On the same lap di Resta retired because of a puncture, and Massa gained eighth position from Alguersuari. The fastest lap of the race was set by Button on lap 69, setting a time of 1:16.956 as he was closing to Vettel for the race lead.|$|E
5|$|On lap 21, Rosberg made a {{pit stop}} for the {{intermediate}} tyres, leaving only Ricciardo and Hamilton {{at the front of}} the field on the full wet tyres. Ricciardo made the switch on lap 24, but Hamilton stayed out, opting to remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> tyre until the track dried out enough to go straight to slicks. In the meantime, Verstappen had fought his way back into the top ten, after having started 21st. In the subsequent laps, Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton in the lead, edging as close as half a second by lap 28. Behind the leading pair, Rosberg was third ahead of Pérez and Vettel. The pivotal moment of the race followed on lap 31, when Hamilton changed to slick tyres. When Ricciardo followed suit a lap later, his pit crew were not ready for him and had the wrong tyres, resulting in a long stop, handing the lead to Hamilton, who stayed narrowly ahead of him. Sergio Pérez was another driver who benefited during the second round of stops, emerging in third. Rosberg was left in sixth after both Vettel and Alonso also came out ahead of him after the switch to dry tyres. On lap 34, Ricciardo made an attempt to repass Hamilton on track, but Hamilton successfully defended his position.|$|E

40|$|Controlling {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of liquid droplets on surfaces via surface energy patterning {{can be used to}} control material delivery to specified regions via selective liquid/solid wetting. While studies of the equilibrium shape of liquid droplets on heterogenous substrates exist, much less is known about <b>the</b> corresponding <b>wetting</b> kinetics. We make significant progress towards elucidating details of this topic by studying, via large-scale atomistic simulations, liquid nanodroplets spreading on chemically patterned surfaces. A model is presented for lines of polymer liquid (droplets) on substrates consisting of alternating strips of wetting (equilibrium contact angle approximately 0 degrees) and non-wetting (equilibrium contact angle approximately 90 degrees) material. Droplet spreading is compared for different wavelength of the pattern and strength of surface interaction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> strips. For small wavelength, droplets partially spread <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> and non-wetting regions of the substrate to attain a finite contact angle less than 90 degrees. In this case, the extent of spreading depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interaction strength in <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> regions. A transition is observed such that, for large wavelength, the droplet spreads only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> region of <b>the</b> substrate by pulling material from non-wetting regions. In most cases, a precursor film spreads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> portion of <b>the</b> substrate at a rate strongly dependent upon interaction strength.

In the third quarter, DeStefano hit Shemonski for a three-yard touchdown. In the final period, Davis led the Colonials on a 43-yard drive, but they were stopped on the Maryland 3-yard line. Petruzzo then stopped another G.W. drive when he intercepted a pass and returned it 44 yards. Ed Modzelewski rushed to the Colonials' three-yard line setting up a scoring run by Fullerton.

25|$|Meanwhile, in the {{dramatic}} 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix the Toyotas {{were the only}} cars to stay out on dry tyres in the torrential rainstorm in the closing stages of the race, and that had a significant factor on deciding the destiny of the world title. Trulli had qualified 2nd, but both he and Glock faded to 6th and 8th respectively at the finish, Glock relinquishing the vital fifth place to Lewis Hamilton on the final lap, which was enough for the McLaren driver to seal the world title by a point from local hero and race winner Felipe Massa. Afterwards, Glock denied conspiracy claims that he gave the place to Hamilton, citing that he was struggling for grip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> track surface {{and that there was}} absolutely nothing he could do.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, by then almost {{exclusively}} bowling spinners, Appleyard was almost unplayable <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> wickets {{early in the}} summer, but a knee injury wiped out almost all his cricket after the middle of June. He recovered his form well enough in 1956, however, to regain his Test place for the first match as Trent Bridge but did not bowl well enough to challenge Jim Laker {{for the rest of}} the summer. Then, in 1957, Appleyard declined so badly that Yorkshire often left him out of their team: he seemed unable to show his old versatility when asked to open the bowling again with Fred Trueman and was not gaining as much penetration on rain-affected surfaces. Appleyard's decline continued in 1958, and Yorkshire dropped him for good in early June, and he never did well enough for the second eleven for them to consider retaining him.|$|E
25|$|Predation by the {{non-native}} rosy glandina snail Euglandina rosea {{remains a}} serious threat to the survival of Newcomb's snail. This predatory snail, introduced into Hawai`i in 1955, has established populations throughout the main islands. The rosy glandina feeds on snails and slugs, and field studies document that it readily feeds on native snails found in Hawai`i. Furthermore, the rosy glandina snail exhibits remarkable hunting behaviors leading to capture and predation of submerged prey. Although terrestrial, the rosy glandina will fully immerse itself in water to locate and feed on aquatic molluscs such as Newcomb's snail. The rosy glandina has been observed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet,</b> algae-covered rocks of the Makaleha Stream in close proximity to individual Newcomb's snails, and is believed to prey on them. The rosy glandina snail is responsible for the extirpation of many populations and even the extinction of numerous species of native snails throughout the Pacific Islands, and represents a significant threat to the survival of Newcomb's snail.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that extreme precipitation events accounted for a disproportionate share of the nearly 2 % increase in precipitation in China over the period of 1960 - 2000. Michaels et al. challenged a similar finding in the USA, arguing that fixed-bin methods for analysing extreme events obscure underlying precipitation patterns, and proposing a method that focusses <b>on</b> trends of <b>the</b> 10 <b>wettest</b> days of <b>the</b> year. Applying this method to China, we find that trends of precipitation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 10 <b>wettest</b> days are generally proportional to changes in annual total precipitation. Regionally, a disproportionate increase is observed in southwest China. While the greatest absolute increase in precipitation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wettest</b> 10 days is seen in east China, the trend {{as a percentage of the}} annual total is not statistically significant. In the other six climate regions, the annual total rainfall is increasing at a proportionally greater rate than <b>the</b> 10 <b>wettest</b> days. Seasonally, <b>the</b> changes in precipitation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> five <b>wettest</b> days show increasing trend both nationally and for most of the climate regions. The greatest absolute increase in precipitation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wettest</b> five days is seen in east China in both summer and winter half-years. Only in southwest China during the summer half-year do we see a significant, disproportional increase in <b>the</b> precipitation falling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> five <b>wettest</b> days. Nationally, there has been an increasing trend in the frequency of precipitation exceeding the long-term mean 97. 5 th percentile and 99 th percentile values. Although the annual increasing precipitation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 10 <b>wettest</b> days corresponds with a similar increase in water vapour pressure in China nationally, regional results suggest that change in humidity is not the only factor that influences the changes in heavy precipitation.

40|$|International audienceClassical density {{functional}} theory (DFT) of inhomogeneous fluids {{is applied}} to an explicit solvent "semi-primitive" model (SPM) of ionic solutions to investigate the influence of ionic solutes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> behaviour of a solvent in contact with a neutral or charged planar substrate. The SPM {{is made up of}} 3 species of hard sphere particles with different diameters, interacting via an attractive Yukawa potential to model excluded volume and cohesion. The solvent particles are neutral, while the monovalent anions and cations are oppositely charged. The polar nature of the solvent is modeled by a continuum dielectric permittivity linked to the local solvent density. All 3 species interact with the impenetrable substrate via an attractive external potential. While excluded volume effects are accurately described by a Rosenfeld "fundamental measure" free energy functional, the short range Yukawa attraction and Coulombic interactions are treated within the mean-field approximation. The ionic solutes are found to have a significant impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> behaviour of <b>the</b> solvent, in particular <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> temperature. Strong electric fields, or long-ranged (weakly screened) Coulombic forces are shown to have the propensity to change <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> transition from second to first order. The cation-anion size asymmetry leads to charge separation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> liquid-vapour interface of the solution, which in turn can induce a drying transition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> liquid side of liquid-vapour coexistence...|$|R

(Thus, fans who had tickets for Game5 went to Game4 instead.) The Cardinals won, taking a 3–1 series lead. The Tigers took a 3–0 lead into the top of the third, after Sean Casey had two RBIs, including a home run. The other RBI came from Detroit's Iván Rodríguez, who singled in Carlos Guillén. Rodriguez, who had been hitless in the previous three games, also went 3-for-4. In the bottom of the third, the Cardinals struck back with a run-scoring double by David Eckstein, scoring Aaron Miles who had the first stolen base of the series by either team. Yadier Molina doubled in Scott Rolen in the fourth to cut the Tiger lead to 3–2. The score remained that way, until the bottom of the seventh, when Eckstein led off with a double over the head of Curtis Granderson, who had slipped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> Busch Stadium outfield. Eckstein then scored on a sacrifice bunt by So Taguchi that was thrown over the head of Plácido Polanco covering first by Fernando Rodney, and that tied the score at three.
