50|$|On July 8, 1999, WGN-TV and {{independent}} station WCIU-TV {{entered into a}} sports programming arrangement, in which the latter station would carry select Bulls and White Sox games, and {{a limited number of}} Cubs games, that are produced by and contracted to air on WGN-TV for exclusive broadcast within the Chicago market. This is due to network affiliation contracts (first enforced by The WB, and presently by The CW) that limit the number of programming preemptions on an annual basis, and broadcasting restrictions put in place by the NBA which limited the WGN national feed to air only fifteen Bulls games per season (though these national broadcasts usually varied between 10 and 20 telecasts depending on the year for the remainder of WGN America's national broadcast rights to the games). The remaining Bulls games produced by WGN-TV were split between the station's Chicago area signal and WCIU-TV. Until 2015, Blackhawks games aired on channel 9 were also exclusive to the Chicago market (in this case, this was due to the NHL's exclusive broadcast contracts, such as its deal with NBCUniversal that began in 2008). On February 19, 2015, WCIU owner Weigel Broadcasting terminated its agreement with Tribune to carry WGN-produced Cubs and White Sox telecasts, in an effort to limit scheduling conflicts with channel 26's then-recently launched early-prime time newscast (produced through a news share agreement with WLS-TV); WPWR-TV replaced WCIU as WGN's <b>overflow</b> <b>outlet</b> for these baseball games.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} pulsatile {{pulmonary}} flow after the modified Fontan procedure was examined {{in a model}} that simulated the right heart. An inlet overflow tank (preload), axial pulsatile pump, Wind-Kessel model (afterload), and an <b>outlet</b> <b>overflow</b> tank were connected in series. The standard conditions were flow 2. 00 l/min with 12 mm Hg preload pressure, 3. 0 Wood units resistance, and an <b>outlet</b> <b>overflow</b> tank pressure at 6 mm Hg. The pump rate was set at 80 beats/min. The simulated pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary flow waves produced by this model closely resembled those obtained from patients who had undergone the modified Fontan procedure. All variables except the preload were fixed and changes in pulmonary flow were examined at preload pressures of 8, 12, 15, and 17 mm Hg. As the peak pulmonary arterial pressure increased so did pulmonary flow, until it was greater than during the non-pulsatile state. Because the afterload of this model was fixed, this result suggests {{that there was a}} concomitant decrease in resistance. This model indicates that pulsatile pulmonary blood flow is likely to have a beneficial effect on the pulmonary circulation after the modified Fontan procedure...|$|R

40|$|Throughout Europe, roof {{areas are}} {{commonly}} drained using a conventional gutter and downspout system. These are usually large in volume {{and have the}} capacity to discharge rainwater at high rates of flow. There is now increased awareness of syphonic roof drainage systems. Historically, the definitive method for the design of gutters within the United Kingdom is BS 6367 : 1983 British Code of Practice for the Drainage of Roofs and Paved Areas. This publication clearly sets out the theoretical model to predict the hydraulic performance of a gutter. In 2000, this Code was superseded by BS EN 12056 - 3 which, shares a common theoretical basis and method of derivation as BS 6367 : 1983. These codes do not specifically address syphonic systems and currently there are no design criteria for such systems. Hence, there is an urgent need for {{a better understanding of the}} hydraulic performance of syphonic systems. This is particularly relevant to systems that are installed in gutters that drain large industrial and commercial buildings. The work reported in the thesis describes a series of experimental investigations that were carried out to improve knowledge and understanding of the way in which syphonic systems perform. Initially the study concentrated on the construction of a full-scale experimental system to test the hydraulic performance of syphonic system outlets located within a 600 mm wide gutter. Tests were completed with single (primary) outlets and primary outlets in combination with independent <b>overflow</b> <b>outlets</b> (secondary outlets). The outlets were positioned at a number of different locations along the length of the gutter and combinations of both primary and secondary outlets were tested. The thesis has concluded that the performance of syphonic rainwater systems is much more complex than conventional roof drainage systems. Specific findings of the study are: • The application of existing theoretical models for the design of conventional rainwater drainage systems should not be transferred to syphonic systems. An additional factor of safety is required within the existing theoretical model. - 11 - • The position of the outlet in the gutter has a significant influence on the depth profile along the gutter length. Outlets located near to the gutter end resulted in an increase in the depth profile of the outlet. • When an independent overflow system (secondary system) was used in conjunction with a number of primary outlets within a common gutter, it was found that the overflow system, dominated the flow profile within the gutter. • A method, based on dispersion of solutes, was developed to determine the actual flow rate through each outlet of a syphonic system. It was shown that the flow rate through each outlet of the system was not the same and that the water level in the gutter was redistributed along the gutter length. This implies that the negative pressure created in syphonic systems is not a limiting factor. These findings have important design implications. • A methodology to calculate the influence on water depth in any gutter and for any outlet position has been established and is recommended as a basis for the improved design of a syphonic system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of alternative overflow systems for roof structures that are drained siphonically. Many buildings that have siphonic roof drainage systems currently incorporate a separate secondary overflow system, {{which is quite}} often also siphonic. An alternative low-cost technique that is explored {{in this study is}} to connect each <b>overflow</b> <b>outlet</b> to a single, vertical downpipe. Seven different overflow configurations, each with five different downpipe lengths, are investigated in terms of maximum flowrate and corresponding water depth in the gutter. The results of this study are significant in that they do not support the common theoretical assumption that there is a limiting length of a siphonic downpipe over which pipe-full flow may occur before gravity causes the water to accelerate enough for it to no longer occupy the full cross-sectional area. Instead, this study has found that once a downpipe is flowing full, it is possible for pipe-full flow conditions to be maintained over the entire pipe length...|$|E

It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This method has been adapted from a proposal by T. C. Powers. It describes the procedure used to evaluate the resistance to deterioration of aggregates in air-entrained concrete when subjected to a specified period of soaking in water with intervening cycles of freezing and thawing. Values given for maximum size of aggregate, size of test specimen, conditioning prior to soaking, and length of soaking period are intended to be appropriate for construction in localities of severe winter exposure in California. The test conditions are subject to modification if exposure conditions at the site of the work so warrant. When tests are performed for work on a particular project, the test conditions given in this method shall be followed unless otherwise provided in the contract. B. APPARATUS 1. Apparatus specified in ASTM Designation: C 192 for making and curing concrete specimens in the laboratory. 2. One or more refrigerated baths of a size and depth required to contain the test specimens immersed in water-saturated kerosene, and having suitable controls to provide a lowering of the temperature at the rate of 2. 8 ± 0. 6 °C per hour from room temperature to- 17. 8 °C. Household type deep freezing chests with a copper liner have been found to be satisfactory. Two or more baths are desirable unless the number of specimens to be tested at one time is small. 3. One or more water baths of a size and depth required to contain the specimens immersed in water, and equipped with water supply and <b>overflow</b> <b>outlet.</b> 4.

40|$|The Rukwa rift basin is {{presently}} a closed hydrogeological depression containing a shallow lake (max 20 me deep) with its surface {{at an altitude}} around 810 m above sea level. Lacustrine terraces and paleo-shorelines are known up to 980 m above sea level, an altitude at which it reach the overflow sill towards Lake Tanganyika. Both Lakes Tanganyika and Nyasa (Malawi) are presently overflowing, but as their lake level fluctuates, they have been disconnected from their outlet in the recent past. High resolution seismic profiling in both Lakes Rukwa and Malawi has show the presence of active fault systems underneath the lake floor. Some of these fault systems appear {{to have had a}} cyclic activity, with alternating periods of high tectonic activity/sedimentation and periods of tectonic quiescence. The accommodation zone between Lake Rukwa and Nyasa is occupied by the Rungwe volcanic Province, with the Ngozi, Rungwe and Kiejo volcanoes presenting signs of recent volcanic activity. The Rungwe Province is cross-cut by several directions of faults, which clearly control the location of the volcanic vents. In our work, we reviewed the available data on recent (Late Pleistocene – Holocene) volcanic eruptions, in the Rungwe area itself, in the drill cores from the surrounding lakes and from aerial observations up to 300 km away from the Rungwe Province. We performed morphotectonic and paleoseismic investigations of the Kanda fault, a major normal fault between lakes Rukwa and Tanganyika. We investigated lacustrine deposits of the Rukwa basin corresponding to the two last cycles of high lake level. The chronological framework was established using 30 new radiocarbon dating and the most prominent volcanic tephra layers were used as a reference in the correlations. The results are still preliminary, but a good correlation already appear between climatically induced lake level change (in Lake Rukwa), seismo-tectonic activation of the regional fault network (underneath Lake Rukwa and the Kanda fault between Lakes Rukwa and Tanganyika) and the timing of the recent strong volcanic eruptions in the Rungwe Volcanic Province since the last 40. 000 years. This relation is explained taking into account that Lake Rukwa is very sensitive to climate change as it occupies a flat depression and its <b>overflow</b> <b>outlet</b> is 180 m above its present-day level. Its lake level rises rapidly when the climate becomes more humid as it was the case during the Last Glacial Maximum and during the Younger Dryas event. Increase in lake level means increasing of the load in the basin and perturbation of the ambient tectonic stresses. In most of the Rukwa rift, the tectonic stress is of extensional (normal faulting) regime, with the maximum principal stress axis (sigma 1) subvertical. In these conditions, increasing the vertical load will increase the shear stress on the existing normal faults, triggering (seismogenic) normal faulting deformation. As the architecture of the active volcanoes in the Rungwe Province is tectonically controlled, activation of the faults, together with a greater pressure of water in the tectonic discontinuities are likely to trigger large volcanic eruptions, strongly explosive...|$|E
