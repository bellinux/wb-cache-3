5|$|The Sable Island {{horses are}} a feral horse {{population}} that is entirely unmanaged: they {{are not subject to}} any kind of interference. Observational research, which is considered noninvasive to the herd, has been conducted by various entities over several decades. The population in recent years (2009 and onward) has varied between 400 and 550 animals. Due to the lack of predators, older horses often die of starvation after their teeth are worn down by a lifetime of exposure to sand and marram, a tough grass. A lack <b>of</b> <b>nutritional</b> food on the island limits the horses' size, and the offspring of those removed from the island and raised on better diets are significantly larger.|$|E

5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence <b>of</b> <b>nutritional</b> benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E

Critics of raw feeding assert that the risk <b>of</b> <b>nutritional</b> imbalance, intestinal perforations and foodborne illnesses posed by the handling and feeding of raw meat and bones outweigh any benefits. The assertion that raw feeding is inherently better because it is natural has also been criticized by proponents of commercial pet foods.|$|E
25|$|A major use of {{formic acid}} is as a {{preservative}} and antibacterial agent in livestock feed. In Europe, it is applied on silage (including fresh hay) {{to promote the}} fermentation of lactic acid and to suppress the formation of butyric acid; it also allows fermentation to occur quickly, and at a lower temperature, reducing the loss <b>of</b> <b>nutritional</b> value. Formic acid arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer, {{and so it is}} widely used to preserve winter feed for cattle. In the poultry industry, it is sometimes added to feed to kill E. coli bacteria. Use as preservative for silage and (other) animal feed constituted 30% of the global consumption in 2009.|$|E
