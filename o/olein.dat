40|$|Objectives The ex-vivo {{percutaneous}} absorption {{of the natural}} antioxidant resveratrol in liposomes and niosomes was investigated. The influence of vesicle composition on their physicochemical properties and stability was evaluated. Liposomes containing resveratrol were formulated using soy phosphatidylcholine (Phospholipon 90 G). Innovative niosomes were formulated using mono- or diglycerides: glycerol monooleate (Peceol) and polyglyceryl- 3 dioleate (Plurol OleiqueCC), respectively, two suitable skin-compatible <b>oleins</b> used in pharmaceutical formulations as penetration enhancers. Methods Small, negatively charged vesicles with a mean size of approximately 200 nm were prepared. The accelerated stability of vesicles was evaluated using Turbiscan Lab Expert, and the bilayer deformability was also assessed. Ex-vivo transdermal experiments were carried out in Franz diffusion cells, on newborn pig skin, to study {{the influence of the}} different vesicle formulations on resveratrol skin delivery. Key findings Results indicated a high cutaneous accumulation and a low transdermal delivery of resveratrol, especially when Peceol niosomes were used. Conclusions Overall, niosomes formulated with Plurol oleique or Peceol showed a better behaviour than liposomes in the cutaneous delivery of resveratrol...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel, a {{renewable}} fuel of vegetal origin, {{has been an}} object of a rapidly growing interest, in the latest years, both as a pure fuel and as blending component to reduce exhaust pollutants of traditional diesel fuel. Biodiesel is conventionally produced through a well-established technology that {{involves the use of}} alkaline catalysts and is, therefore, not compatible with the presence of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the feedstock due to the formation of soaps. Also the presence of FFA in small amounts is detrimental, because, formed soaps strongly affect the successive glycerol separation giving place to a long settling time. Normally, highly refined vegetable oils are used as raw materials for biodiesel production. A preliminary stage of acidity reduction is necessary, when the starting material is characterized by a high free acidity (higher than 0. 5 % by weight). This pre-treatment can be pursued, as example, by means of an esterification reaction of the FFAs with methanol, catalyzed by sulphonic ionic exchange resins. In the present work, a batch reactor has been used {{for the study of the}} above-mentioned reaction and different acid ionic exchange resins have been tested as heterogeneous catalysts. Two kinds of substrates have been submitted for esterification with methanol: a model mixture of soybean oil artificially acidified with oleic acid and a commercial high-acidity mixture of waste fatty acids (<b>oleins).</b> A detailed kinetic model has been developed and tested in which the following key phenomena, characterizing the system, have been introduced: (i) the physical phase equilibrium (partitioning equilibrium) of the components between the resin-absorbed phase and the external liquid phase; (ii) the ionic exchange equilibria; (iii) an Eley–Rideal surface reaction mechanism. The developed kinetic model was able to correctly interpret all the experimental data collected, both as a function of the temperature and of the catalyst concentration...|$|R
40|$|Tesis con mención internacional. Tesis {{doctoral}} por el sistema de compendio de publicacionesThe {{main objective}} of this thesis is the preparation of vesicles formed by the self-assembly of non-ionic surfactants (niosomes) of interest in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, containing trans-resveratrol (RSV), a bioactive compound with antioxidant capacity and beneficial effects for human health. First, the suitability of niosomes to encapsulate RSV was studied using Span 80 and Span 60 as surfactants, and cholesterol as membrane stabilizer. Niosomes were prepared by a two-stage technique: mechanical agitation followed by sonication. The niosomal formulations were evaluated {{in terms of their}} morphology, mean size, size distribution, stability, entrapment efficiency (EE), and in vitro RSV release. High speed mechanical agitation produced niosomes with smaller mean size, narrower size distribution, and lower EE values. Mean size, stability and EE of the niosomes were affected not only by their composition, but also by the protocol used in their preparation. Taking into consideration the importance of vesicular systems as nanocarriers in dermal and transdermal delivery, RSV was incorporated into niosomes and liposomes and its ex-vivo percutaneous absorption in newborn pig skin was investigated using Franz diffusion cells. Cholesterol was also added as membrane stabilizer. The influence of vesicle composition on its physicochemical properties and stability was evaluated. Phosphatidylcholine was used in liposomes formulation while niosomes were formulated with two suitable skin-compatible <b>oleins</b> commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations as surfactants. The results obtained in this work enabled us to confirm that niosomes are more suitable than liposomes as carriers for percutaneous absorption of RSV. Then, nanodesign of RSV entrapped niosomes for oral administration using food-grade surfactants and dodecanol as membrane stabilizer was carried out. RSV entrapped niosomes were prepared using a modified thin film hydration method, and their suitability as yoghurt additive was studied. Dodecanol was selected as a membrane stabilizer to avoid potential adverse health effects of cholesterol, as well as the rejection by the consumer of this functional food. A factorial design of experiments was carried out {{to reduce the number of}} experiments, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to optimize the key parameters involved in niosome preparation. The addition of niosomes containing RSV did not involve changes in the textural properties of regular yoghurt. Finally, a new approach to formulate RSV entrapped niosomes for topical applications was proposed, and two specific preparation methods were applied and compared: thin film hydration and sonication method (TFH-S) with minor modifications, and ethanol injection modified method (EIM). Niosomes were formulated using Gelot 64 (G 64) as surfactant and two suitable skin-compatible unsaturated fatty acids, commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations: oleic acid (OA) and linoleic acid (LA) as penetration enhancers. The EIM method allowed obtaining niosomes with smaller mean size, narrower size distribution and higher EE values than those provided by the TFH-S method...|$|R

5000|$|Recently, {{in a study}} {{funded by}} the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Sundram et al. [...] {{compared}} the effects of three types of fat: native palm <b>olein,</b> a blend with partially hydrogenated soybean oil and an interesterified mixture of oils. They concluded both the IE blend and the partially hydrogenated fat blend increased the fasting ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol, indicating an adverse effect on CVD risk. Sundram et al. also found that fasting plasma glucose levels were higher after 4 weeks on the interesterified fat than after the other diets. For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p<0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p<0.05). As was pointed out {{in a letter to}} the Editor by Destaillats et al., a major limitation of the Sundram study is that the diets differed in overall fatty acid composition. The interesterified fat had 30% more saturated and 57% less monounsaturated fatty acids than the untreated palm <b>olein.</b> The direction of the effects on blood lipids are in line with what can be predicted based on these differences in fatty acid content between the study diets (Mensink 2003).|$|E

50|$|Next, noodles can be dried {{in one of}} two ways: by frying or by hot air drying. Fried instant noodles are dried by oil frying for 1-2 {{minutes at}} a {{temperature}} of 140 - 160 C. The frying process decreases the moisture content from 30-50% to 2-5%. Common oils used for frying in North America consist of canola, cottonseed and palm oil mixtures, while only palm oil or palm <b>olein</b> are used in Asia. Air-dried noodles are dried for 30-40 minutes in hot air at a temperature of 70 - 90 C, resulting in a moisture content of 8-12%. The heat from either drying process will further add to the porous texture of the noodles by gelatinizing the starch even more. More than 80% of instant noodles are fried as it gives more evenly dried noodles than hot air drying which can cause an undesired texture in finished noodles, and also taking longer time to cook. However, with fried noodles, the oil content is about 15-20% and decreases the shelf life of the noodles due to oxidation whereas in hot air-dried noodles it has only 3% oil content maximum.|$|E
