5|$|During spring {{training}} {{in a game}} against the Boston Red Sox, Kershaw gained much attention for throwing a curveball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey but at the end looped into the strike zone and struck him <b>out</b> <b>looking.</b> Kershaw was 0–3 and had a 2.28 ERA with 47 strikeouts through 43 innings pitched in his first stint of the year with the Suns. He was then called up to the majors on May 28, 2008, but optioned back to Jacksonville on July 2.|$|E

5|$|In response, Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal for a duck in {{the first}} over, giving debutant Ajmal Shahzad his first ODI wicket from his third ball of the match. Bresnan removed the other Bangladeshi opener in the 10th over, {{the first of his}} four wickets in the match. This wicket brought {{together}} Mushfiqur Rahim and Aftab Ahmed, who both played aggressively, putting on 56 together in the next ten overs, but when Aftab Ahmed was run <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> for a non-existent run, Bangladesh started to struggle. Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan both fell after making good starts and the required run rate started to rise, making a Bangladeshi victory look improbable. Slow scoring between Naeem Islam and Mahmudullah took victory further away, and Bangladesh eventually finished 45 runs short of their target, granting England a series whitewash.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, to the south, Percy {{advanced}} with some 3,000 men. Percy advanced in two columns with his brigade of Hessians {{on the left}} and Percy himself leading the right. About 200 yards from the American lines Percy halted the advance, waiting for the feint by Stirling to take place. Facing Percy was Alexander Graydon and his company. Graydon's superior was Lambert Cadwalader, Magaw's second in command, {{who was in charge of}} holding the three defensive lines south of Fort Washington. After hearing that there was a landing on the shore in his rear, Cadwalader sent 50 men to oppose it. The 50 men ran into the feint by Col. Stirling's 42nd Foot of 700 men. Where Stirling landed happened to be the least defended area of the American defenses, and when Cadwalader heard how many men were there, he sent another 100 men to reinforce the 50 he had sent earlier. The British landing parties spread <b>out,</b> <b>looking</b> for a path through the rough terrain on the landing spot. The Americans took up a position on a hilltop and began firing at the British troops who were still crossing the river, killing or wounding 80 men. The British troops charged the American position, dispersing them.|$|E

25|$|By {{design the}} trireme {{was meant for}} day-long journeys, with no {{capacity}} to stay at sea overnight or carry the necessary provisions to sustain the men it carried. There were, however, storage facilities on board large enough to provide each crewman with the 2 gallons (7.6 L) of fresh drinking water {{he would need to}} stay hydrated each day. This meant that all those aboard were dependent upon the land and peoples of where they landed each night for supplies. Sometimes this would entail traveling up to eighty kilometres in order to procure the necessary provisions. In the Peloponnesian War, the beached Athenian fleet was caught unawares on more than one occasion, while <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> for food (Battle of Syracuse and Battle of Aegospotami). The cities, which suddenly found themselves needing to provide for all these sailors were usually agreeable and did not mind the extra business, but those in charge of the fleet and/or mission had {{to be careful not to}} completely deplete the 'host' city of resources.|$|E
25|$|By 1886, Bogan was in Wyoming {{working for}} the Vorhees Ranch, near Lusk, Wyoming. He {{is known to have}} killed three men by this time, one was the alleged murder of a dance hall {{proprietor}} who prohibited Bogan and his men from ever entering his saloon. Bogan, who have laready taken the alias of Bill Gatlin at that time, still forced his way into the establishment, and when he met the proprietor with a rifle in his hands, Bogan drew his revolver and shot him in cold blood. Bill Calkin, the editor of the local newspaper, wrote that Bogan was possible a cowboy wanted in Texas, and who had gone by at least two other names in the past. Bogan was infuriated, and Bogan set <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> for him, accompanied by cowboy Sterling Balou. The two entered the Cleveland Brothers Saloon, at which point Bogan drew his pistol calling for Calkin, and daring any of his friends to challenge him. One of the Cleveland brothers was able to bring a sawed off shotgun to bear on the two cowboys, and seconds later Constable Charles S. Gunn entered with his own pistol drawn, backing Cleveland. Bogan and Balou retreated and fled.|$|E

25|$|When {{the ship}} {{approached}} {{the mouth of}} the Fraser River, McMillan set <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> for suitable locations for the establishment of the Fort. He found none in the immediate vicinity of the river's mouth and the Cadboro was unable to gain navigable access to the Fraser River for several days until a channel was discovered. Meanwhile, in the smaller boats, and proceeding further up river, McMillan surveyed several potential locations for the new fort on July 27–28. It was around this time that McMillan Island was named for him. Other islands named during this survey of the river were Barnston Island (for clerk George Barnston) and Annacis Island (for Clerk Francois Noel Annance). Unfortunately, the Cadboro was unable to weigh anchor close enough to shore to safely unload cargo at the site McMillan had preferred to establish the Fort. The next day it sailed downriver to another spot {{on the south side of}} the Fraser, which McMillan had remarked upon earlier. This location was just west of the Salmon River's confluence with the Fraser in an area later to be known as Derby. On Monday July 30, McMillan's party unloaded horses at the site and the laborious clearance of the forest commenced. The first post of the Fort was cut on August 1, 1827. On August 13, the first bastion of the fort—deemed to be the priority as a consequence of rumours of a pending massacre by Indians—was completed.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{was praised}} for his {{versatility}} {{and ability to}} fully inhabit any role, but specialized in playing creeps and misfits: [...] "his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies", writes the journalist Ryan Gilbey. Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of Love Liza, believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like an ordinary man and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of The Guardian remarked that the actor's particular talent was to [...] "take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it". [...] "The more pathetic or deluded the character," [...] writes Gilbey, [...] "the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous." [...] When asked in 2006 why he undertook such roles, Hoffman responded, [...] "I didn't go <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> for negative characters; I went <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> {{for people who have}} a struggle and a fight to tackle. That's what interests me." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson, who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury {{at the end}} of {{the film}} Iron Man, signed on to reprise the role in Thor as part of an {{unprecedented}} nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios. However, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in Thor. When asked why not Jackson explained, [...] "I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put my name in it. Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for Thor to serve as [...] "connective tissue" [...] for The Avengers. Also in February, a casting call went <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.|$|E

500|$|The next {{account of}} the 1848–49 events in the Elliston {{district}} that emerged was a short story called [...] "Doctor" [...] written by Ellen Liston, and published in the Adelaide Observer of 17 June 1882. It was based loosely on the murder of Annie Easton, although Liston's protagonist was pregnant and was not herself killed, but lost her baby {{as a result of}} the attack. In her story, the [...] "hands" [...] from surrounding stations then undertook a [...] "crusade against the natives". Foster et al. note that the Government Resident's clerk reported on 16 May 1849 that three parties of volunteers were <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> for the Aboriginal people responsible for the Beevor and Easton murders. Liston's story was reprinted twice in 1936, the centennial year of South Australia. In the first case, Liston's story was reprinted with the removal of three paragraphs; one about [...] "troublesome blacks", another about the protagonist's sense of a [...] "vast and terrible stillness", and the third about the [...] "hands" [...] conducting a [...] "crusade against the natives". In the second case, Liston's story was reproduced verbatim.|$|E
500|$|In {{the bottom}} of the ninth, rookie pitcher Adam Wainwright – filling in as {{emergency}} closer – found himself in a two-out, bases-loaded situation against center fielder Carlos Beltrán, who had already homered three times in the NLCS. [...] Molina called for a mound conference. [...] Initially, he wanted a sinker from Wainwright but changed his mind because he suspected Wainwright would overthrow it and give Beltrán an easy pitch to hit. [...] Molina made an unconventional choice by calling for a changeup to start the sequence against Beltrán. [...] It was called for a strike. [...] Had Beltrán successfully got a base hit, the scheme may have caused tension for the third-year catcher with La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan because throwing a first-pitch changeup ran contrary to Duncan's teaching. [...] Molina then called for two curveballs. [...] Beltrán fouled off the first, but Wainwright struck him <b>out</b> <b>looking</b> at a [...] "bender that started up and away and bit hard to the low inside corner" [...] for the final out of the game. [...] The Cardinals' conquest of the NLCS gave them a return trip to the World Series after two years. [...] They proceeded to defeat the Detroit Tigers in five games, giving Molina his first championship ring. [...] His mask was turned in for display at the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
