40|$|We {{report on}} a {{quantitative}} analysis of relationships between the number <b>of</b> <b>homicides,</b> population size and other ten urban metrics. By using data from Brazilian cities, we show that well defined average scaling laws with the population size emerge when investigating the relations between population and number <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> as well as population and urban metrics. We also show that the fluctuations around the scaling laws are log-normally distributed, which enabled us to model these scaling laws by a stochastic-like equation driven by a multiplicative and log-normally distributed noise. Because of the scaling laws, we {{argue that it is}} better to employ logarithms in order to describe the number <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> in function <b>of</b> the urban metrics via regression analysis. In addition to the regression analysis, we propose an approach to correlate crime and urban metrics via the evaluation of the distance between the actual value of the number <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> (as well as the value of the urban metrics) and the value that is expected by the scaling law with the population size. This approach have proved to be robust and useful for unveiling relationships/behaviors that were not properly carried out by the regression analysis, such as i) the non-explanatory potential of the elderly population when the number <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> is much above or much below the scaling law, ii) the fact that unemployment has explanatory potential only when the number <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> is considerably larger than the expected by the power law, and iii) a gender difference in number <b>of</b> <b>homicides,</b> where cities with female population below the scaling law are characterized by a number <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> above the power law.

5|$|The {{killing of}} another person must be unlawful. Some defences are {{therefore}} open to the defendant, among them self-defence. Carrying a lawful activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an unlawful homicide even if the child was born alive. Consent might be relevant to some forms <b>of</b> <b>homicide,</b> but not to murder.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, Obama became {{chairman}} of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.

During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} gang-motivated homicides in Chicago neighborhoods between 1985 and 1995. Qualitative studies have illustrated that gang-motivated homicides {{may have different}} characteristics than other types <b>of</b> <b>homicides.</b> Particularly at the neighborhood level, gang homicides {{have not yet been}} fully studied, and thus {{little is known about the}} interaction between gang violence and the neighborhoods they operate in. By examining the effects of social disorganization on both gang-related homicides and other types of homicides—such as intimate killings and homicides committed during street robberies—this study explores the relative uniqueness <b>of</b> gang <b>homicides.</b> Results indicate that social disorganization theory helps explain various types <b>of</b> <b>homicides,</b> including gang homicides. Nonetheless, gang homi-cides are also different from other types <b>of</b> <b>homicides,</b> justifying more research that looks at these homicides as a unique type of violence...|$|R
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means <b>of</b> <b>homicide.</b> Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to ethylene glycol are reported to poison control centers. Most deaths from ethylene glycol are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates <b>of</b> <b>homicide</b> linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural season <b>of</b> <b>Homicide</b> {{established}} a realistic visual style that would remain largely intact throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among the stylistic elements were the near-constant movement with hand-held Super 16 cameras to give the show a naturalistic documentary look and an editing style involving jump cuts that was unusual for television at the time. Wayne Ewing had used Super 16 cameras while filming promotional material for Toys, and that format allowed Homicide producers to film cheaply and with a smaller crew, giving them more time to focus on the actor's performances. While filming, Levinson said he would simply allow the actors to perform while he switched back and forth between them with the hand-held camera instead of filming carefully planned shots and individual scenes from multiple angles. Levinson said the camera and editing style was partially inspired by the Jean-Luc Godard film Breathless (1960), which he would often ask his directors to watch before filming Homicide episodes.|$|E

30|$|To {{visualize}} {{the size of}} the problem at hand we have graphed a very simple adjustment to the second projection. This is the short dashed line that begins in the same place as the second projection but lies below it. We have subtracted from the second projection the perverse positive effect <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> and we have also appealed to the AR(1) regression for the whole span of data (regression one) to tell us how much we should further lower the projection to account for the negative effect <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> in the late period. 21 So the dashed line is simply the projection less (0.0531  +  0.0192)*geomortalityrate: the first term removes the perversely positive influence <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> and the second accounts for the negative influence <b>of</b> <b>homicides</b> using the parameter from the full period AR(1). Visually this downwards adjustment of the late period projection is quite significant. It seems to roughly halve the yawning gap between the projection and the number of actual trips.|$|R

5|$|Who's That Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is {{the first}} soundtrack album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records to promote the film of the same name. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Coati Mundi and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused <b>of</b> <b>homicide.</b> However, due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise (1986), Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project, but later agreed, after Madonna convinced them and also {{because they wanted to}} cash in on Madonna's success with soundtracks.|$|E
