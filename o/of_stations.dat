5|$|Montgomery County, Maryland, {{similarly}} approved {{plans to}} install 20 stations and 200 bikes in the Rockville and Shady Grove areas near Washington Metro stations and high-traffic destinations such as Montgomery College and Rockville Town Center. The expansion {{will be paid}} for by a $1.288 million grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board with a $688,000 local match. Officials also cited plans to add 50 stations and 400 bicycles in southern areas of the county, including Bethesda, Silver Spring, Friendship Heights, and Takoma Park. However, bicycling advocates cautioned that clusters <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> in the county could be too far from each other as well as the larger network <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> within neighboring Washington, D.C. There was also concern that the county has too few bike lanes and trails to support the expected number of users. Despite these concerns, Montgomery County added its first stations in May 2013.|$|E
5|$|Murals, mostly {{replaced}} by monochromatic tin sheets, were also {{present on the}} church's ceilings. Though most ceiling paintings were unpreserved, an original work of Max Aya-ay in 1957 can still be seen on portions of the crossing.

5|$|The system {{currently}} has 61 stations, of which 37 stations {{are served by}} the Mountain View–Winchester line, 36 are served by the Alum Rock–Santa Teresa line, and 3 are served by the Ohlone/Chynoweth–Almaden line. The majority <b>of</b> <b>stations,</b> 41, are located in San Jose. Seven stations are in Sunnyvale and five are in Mountain View. Campbell, Milpitas, and Santa Clara each have three stations.|$|E
5|$|This {{means that}} 61% of the {{stations}} are {{below the surface}} (59% being fully underground and about 2% {{with most of the}} station below the surface). 39% <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> are above the surface or overground.|$|E
5|$|A Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) was {{installed}} in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances <b>of</b> <b>stations,</b> and provide real-time information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information. WMATA also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices. In 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside software developers, for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices. Free apps are {{available to the public}} on major mobile device software platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Palm). WMATA also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Bills {{for three}} {{similarly}} inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 parliamentary session, and, {{to ensure a}} consistent approach, a Joint Select Committee was established to review the proposals. The committee took evidence on various matters regarding the construction and operation of deep-tube railways, and made recommendations on the diameter of tube tunnels, method of traction, and the granting of wayleaves. After rejecting the construction <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> on land owned by the Crown Estate and the Duke of Portland between Oxford Circus and Baker Street, the Committee allowed the BS bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration.|$|E
5|$|In April 1901, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{announced}} track {{depression and}} raising throughout {{portions of the}} line through Newark and the Oranges. Although the depression went into Newark, most {{of the debate over}} localities <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> was basically into the Oranges. In 1903, the track depression reached the Roseville Avenue Station, and the lines were depressed through Roseville. The new station built during the track depression was of similar style, with the station {{in the middle of the}} five-track interlocking, with one platform servicing the Montclair Branch's two tracks and one for the Main Line's two tracks. Rather than crossing at-grade, Roseville Avenue was bridged over the tracks with a brand new street-level interlocking tower present at the intersection of Roseville and Seventh Avenues.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, {{the unit}} was reorganised {{as the war}} moved north and {{planning}} began for it to deploy further afield. Major Lennard Cumpston took over command from Guiney in March. Meanwhile, in March and April a number <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> closed or transferred to ANGAU following {{a reduction in the}} threat of large-scale air raids against Australian controlled territory. As debate about the future employment of Australian forces in the Pacific continued, the future of the unit was in doubt and there was consideration given to it being disbanded. However, following a request from the Americans a detachment of 43 signalers, cipher operators, and medical orderlies was subsequently attached to US forces during operations as part of the advance to Hollandia and Tadji, with the NGAWW being the only Australian unit involved in this action.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Improvement of {{existing}} methods {{for evaluation of}} condition and functioning quality <b>of</b> railway <b>stations</b> and development <b>of</b> the new ones {{in order to improve}} operation <b>of</b> railway <b>stations.</b> Methodology. During research the local, prognostic, aggregated and interactive analyses of condition and functioning quality <b>of</b> <b>station</b> infrastructure elements and train processing at the stations were applied. Local evaluations are obtained as the result of scheduled and off-schedule surveys. On the basis of local evaluations, aggregated evaluations of different generalization level are applied. Method for interactive evaluation is based on the analysis of compliance with train tables. Method of prognostic analysis applies the prehistory of evaluations obtained during previous surveys. Findings. Resulting from researches held, the complex determinative approach was proposed for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>station</b> sector <b>of</b> Ukrainian Railways. This approach allows determining comprehensive and objective notion about station, functioning quality and interaction between objects <b>of</b> <b>station</b> sector. Originality. Existing method for station infrastructure elements evaluation was improved. Proposed method for interactive evaluation allows performing continuous observation <b>of</b> <b>station</b> functioning quality between scheduled surveys. Practical value. Proposed methodology for complex evaluation may be applied to structural units <b>of</b> <b>station</b> sector <b>of</b> different hierarchy levels. Software developed allows navigating promptly over evaluation results and localizing drawbacks discovered...|$|R

5|$|Initially part of squadrons {{cruising}} off the French coast, {{she played}} {{an important part in}} the Action of 23 April 1794, capturing the French frigate Engageante, and at a later engagement, where she helped to capture the French frigate Virginie. From 1797 until the early 19th century she had especial success against privateers, capturing a large number in the West Indies and in the Atlantic. She had a narrow escape from a superior French force in 1801, but was able to batter her pursuer, the 40-gun Bravoure into submission. She was prevented from capturing her by the arrival of French reinforcements. Her last years were spent on a variety <b>of</b> <b>stations,</b> including at the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies. Laid up in 1807, she was sold for breaking up in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{planners}} {{designed the}} system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations. The open vaulted ceiling design <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> {{and the limited}} obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity. Station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights. Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States. There are nearly 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.|$|E
