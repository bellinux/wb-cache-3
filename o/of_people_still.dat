5|$|At {{the time}} of Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), barely 10% of the Roman Empire's {{population}} were Christians, with most of them being urban population and generally found {{in the eastern part}} of the Roman Empire. The majority <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> honoured the old gods in the public Roman way of religio. As Christianity became a complete philosophical system, whose theory and apologetics were heavily indebted to the Classic word, this changed. In addition, Constantine, as Pontifex Maximus, was responsible for the correct cultus or veneratio of the deity which was in accordance with former Roman practice. The move from the old religion to the new entailed some elements of continuity as well as break with the past, though the artistic heritage of paganism was literally broken by Christian zeal.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the town was growing fast. New roads were laid out in Callowland (North Watford) and in West Watford, on what had been until then farmland. However, a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> lived in the older cramped and unsanitary houses in the yards and alley-ways opening off the High Street. Some of these people were among those who rioted in 1902 when {{celebrations}} for the King's coronation were postponed. The Council had a programme of slum clearance and was building council houses when the outbreak of war in 1914 brought this to a halt. This work resumed after the war and in the 1920s the Harebreaks estate was developed.|$|E

25|$|From 1920 to 1950, Mexico was {{the third}} largest {{producer}} of handcrafts, behind Japan and China, with the support described above. However, this support {{did not lead to}} major museum collections or higher valuations on the work being produced. Some crafts did not benefit from being associated with the new myth of Mexican identity. One in particular is waxcrafting, as it is mostly associated with Catholic religious items and motifs. Today, only a handful <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> work with wax and for all intents and purposes, the craft is dead in Mexico. The glorification of crafts and national icons, archetypes and prototypes {{in the first half of}} the 20th century had some negative effects. Certain images such as the China Poblana, rural scenes, charros etc.,began to appear almost ubiquitously on products artisans were making. The promotion of Mexican artesanía was accepted earlier by foreigners than by Mexicans themselves. Very few examples of crafts from the early 20th century survive and most of the best collections of it are in North American or European hands.|$|E

Scottish Standard English, {{a variety of}} English as spoken in Scotland, is {{at one end of}} a bipolar linguistic continuum, with broad Scots at the other.

500|$|The Joshua Tree {{received}} critical acclaim, and {{the best}} reviews of U2's career to that point. Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "For a band that's always specialized in inspirational, larger-than-life gestures—a band utterly determined to be Important—The Joshua Tree could be the big one, and that's precisely what it sounds like." [...] The review described the album's sound as [...] "wed the diverse textures of The Unforgettable Fire to fully formed songs, many of them as aggressive as the hits on War". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe echoed these sentiments in his review, stating, [...] "It's another spiritual progress report, enwrapped in music that strikes a healthy balance between the lushness of their last album, 1984's The Unforgettable Fire, and the more volcanic rock of their early years." [...] Morse called it [...] "their most challenging work to date" [...] and the [...] "most rewarding rock record of the new year". NME praised the album as [...] "a better and braver record than anything else that's likely to appear in 1987... It's the sound <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> trying, still looking..." [...] Thom Duffy of the Orlando Sentinel said the songs have [...] "exultant power" [...] that, [...] "like the Joshua Tree's branches, stretch upward {{in stark contrast to}} their barren musical surroundings on rock radio". He praised the musicianship of the group members, calling Bono's vocals [...] "wrenching", the rhythm section of Mullen and Clayton [...] "razor-sharp", and the Edge's guitar playing [...] "never... better". The New Zealand Herald called The Joshua Tree [...] "the most compelling collection of music yet from a band that has cut its career with passionate, exciting slashes". It judged that the record's [...] "power lies in its restraint" [...] and that there is an [...] "urgency underlying virtually all of the 11 songs".|$|E

In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> hold to this approach.|$|E

In the book Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), authors Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson cite ongoing belief in the SRA phenomenon despite a complete lack of evidence as demonstration of the confirmation bias in believers; it further points out that a lack of evidence is actually considered by believers in SRA as more evidence, demonstrating [...] "how clever and evil the cult leaders were: They were eating those babies, bones and all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, guitarist/vocalist David Davidson, drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne and bassist Anthony Buda, who {{attended}} {{a high school in}} Boston, Massachusetts, formed Cryptic Warning, influenced by Guns N' Roses and Metallica. The band recorded its first demo in 2002 and gained an underground following in Boston, also performing outside of Massachusetts. A second demo, Internally Reviled, was recorded in 2004. In 2005, Cryptic Warning recorded its debut studio album, Sanity's Aberration, but was not content with the quality of the album's production. Remembering those recordings, Davidson said: [...] "We didn't record the album with a metal guy, so we didn't get the sound we wanted. The heaviest reference in our producer's discography was The Cult.

Many of the Uri party's supporters who identify as liberals were enraged at Roh holding that his party was not really different from the conservative opposition. The Grand National Party, enjoying relatively strong approval rate but still bent on revenge for the party's defeat in major elections, repeatedly declined to initiate a negotiation for the coalition. While the Uri Party grudgingly supported the President's proposal, a lawmaker defected from the party in protest of Roh's plan, {{and the loss of}} popularity was felt when the party suffered yet another complete defeat in the by-election on 26 October 2005, this time including one of the party's stronghold electoral districts.
