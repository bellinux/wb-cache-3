40|$|Background: Tight {{clustering}} arose recently from {{a desire}} to obtain tighter and potentially more informative clusters in gene expression studies. Scattered genes with relatively loose correlations should be excluded from the clusters. However, in the literature there is little work dedicated to this area of research. On the other hand, there has been extensive use of maximum likelihood techniques for model parameter estimation. By contrast, the minimum distance estimator has been largely ignored. Results: In this paper we show the inherent robustness of the minimum distance estimator {{that makes it a}} powerful tool for parameter estimation in model-based time-course clustering. To apply minimum distance estimation, a partial mixture model that can naturally incorporate replicate information and allow scattered genes is formulated. We provide experimental results of simulated data fitting, where the minimum distance estimator demonstrates superior performance to the maximum likelihood estimator. Both biological and statistical validations are conducted on a simulated dataset and two real gene expression datasets. Our proposed partial regression clustering algorithm scores top in Gene Ontology driven evaluation, in comparison with four other popular clustering algorithms. Conclusion: For the first time partial mixture model is successfully extended to time-course data analysis. The robustness of our partial regression clustering algorithm proves the suitability <b>of</b> the <b>ombination</b> <b>of</b> both partial mixture model and minimum distance estimator in this field. We show that tight clustering not only is capable to generate more profound understanding of the dataset under study well in accordance to established biological knowledge, but also presents interesting new hypotheses during interpretation of clustering results. In particular, we provide biological evidences that scattered genes can be relevant and are interesting subjects for study, in contrast to prevailing opinion...|$|R

40|$|An {{alkali lignin}} {{preparation}} from wheat straw {{was found to}} be compatible with a previously developed nitrated lignin assay for microbial lignin oxidation, allowing comparison of the susceptibility of different wheat lignins to microbial oxidation. Alkali lignin was prepared from a panel of 18 wheat varieties, and was analysed by FT-IR spectroscopy, revealing minor variations in the lignin structure. Samples of nitrated alkali lignin were assayed against five lignin degrading bacteria: Streptomyces viridosporus, Rhodococcus jostii RHA 1, Pseudomonas putida mt- 2, Microbacterium phyllosphaerae, and Sphingobacterium sp. T 2. Up to 5 -fold variation in rates of lignin oxidation were observed between different wheat varieties, and between different bacterial strain, with Sphingobacterium sp.

Testing of wheat varieties from two consecutive harvests, and from different locations, revealed that the observed variation was due to a <b>ombination</b> <b>of</b> genetic, seasonal and environmental factors, but that some wheat varieties showed consistently higher rates of oxidation.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about how GPs {{determine}} whether and when patients need palliative care. Little {{research has been done}} regarding the assumption underpinning Lynn and Adamson’s model that palliative care may start early {{in the course of the}} disease. This study was conducted to explore how GPs identify a need for palliative care in patients. Methods: A qualitative interview study was performed among 20 GPs in the Netherlands. Results: GPs reported that a <b>ombination</b> <b>of</b> several signals, often subtle and not explicit, made them identify a need for palliative care: signals from patients (increasing care dependency and not recuperating after intercurrent diseases) and signals from relatives or reports from medical specialists. GPs reported differences in how they identified a need for palliative care in cancer patients versus those with other diseases. In cancer patients, the need for palliative care was often relatively clear because of a relatively strict demarcation between the curative and palliative phase. However, in patients with e. g. COPD or in the very old, GPs' awareness of palliative care needs often arises gradually, relatively late in the disease trajectory. GPs consider the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness as a key point in the disease trajectory. However, this does not automatically mean that a patient needs palliative care at that point. Conclusions: GPs recognize a need for palliative care on the basis of various signals. They do not support the idea underlying Lynn and Adamson’s model that palliative care always starts early in the course of the disease. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{biogenic}} NO emissions (SNOx) play important {{direct and}} indirect roles in chemical processes of the troposphere. The most widely applied algorithm to calculate SNOx in global models was published 15 years ago by Yienger and Levy (1995), was based on very few measurements. Since then numerous new measurements have been published, which we used {{to build up a}} atabase of field measurements conducted world wide covering the period from 1978 to 2009, including 108 publications with 560 measurements. Recently, several satellite based top-down approaches, which recalculated the different sources of NOx (fossil fuel, biomass burning, soil and lightning), have shown an underestimation of SNOx by the algorithm of Yienger and Levy (1995). Nevertheless, to our knowledge no general improvements of this algorithm have yet been published. Here we present major improvements to the algorithm, which should help to optimize the representation of SNOx in atmospheric-chemistry global climate models, without modifying the underlying principal or mathematical equations. The changes include: 1) Using a new up to date land cover map, with twice the number of land cover classes, and using annually varying fertilizer application rates; 2) Adopting the fraction of SNOx induced by fertilizer application based on our database; 3) Switching from soil water column to volumetric soil moisture, to distinguish between the wet and dry state; 4) Tuning the emission factors to reproduce the measured emissions in our database and calculate the emissions based on their mean value. These steps lead us to increased global yearly SNOx, and our total SNOx source ends up being close to one of the top-down approaches. In some geographical regions the new results agree better with the top-down approach, but there are also distinct differences in other regions. This suggests that a <b>ombination</b> <b>of</b> both top-down and bottom-up approaches could be combined in a future attempt to provide an even better calculation of SNOx...|$|R

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the relationships of SS and SHS with brain lesion location and stroke side. Material and Methods: The inpatient files of the hemiplegic patients, who were hospitalized for rehabilitation, were evaluated resrospectively. Brain lesion location and involved hemisphere side were&nbsp;assessed by brain CT at the insult time. Brain lesion location groups were comprised as following 4 groups which included 35 patients in each group. Group I: Small superficial infarct. This type infarcts involve small area infarct (no more than 20 mm in diameter) on a cerebral lobe, such as a small right or left frontal lobe infarct. Group II: Large superficial infarct. Infarcts more than 20 mm in diameter on a cerebral lobe or two or more lobes of one cerebral hemisphere, such as a frontoparietal infarct in the left cerebral hemisphere or frontotemporo- parietal infarct in right or left cerebral hemisphere. Group III: Deep&nbsp; nfarct. Infarcts of the internal capsule, basal ganglia or thalamus. Group IV:&nbsp; <b>ombination</b> <b>of</b> deep and large superficial infarcts (combined group II+III).

A total of 140 hemiplegic patients&nbsp;then devided into 2 groups according to the development of SS and/or SHS. Results: A significant correlation was found between brain lesion locations and SS and/or SHS development. The groups with combined deep and large superficial, and large superficial infarcts showed more frequent SS and/or SHS development. Patients with SS and/or SHS had got low stages at baseline in the upper extremity according to upper extremity Brunnstroma level, upper extremity Ashworth stage and low stages of functional independence measure (FIM) scores. There wasn&rsquo;t significant difference in shoulder problem development in terms of involved hemisphere side. Conclusions:In our study, brain lesion location especially combined deep and large superficial, and large&nbsp; superficial infarcts seem to be a predictor factor for development of SS and/or SHS.

The rotational stability {{and the possibility of}} measuring the time-of-arrival of the "pulses" of emission with an extreme pre ision allows to onstrain the physi al parameters of these sour es, and to undertake a wide number of studies. In this PhD Thesis, we exploit this hara teristi to explore several aspe ts of pulsar physi s, mainly related with the "Pulsar Timing Array" experiments. The first aspe t is pulsar polarization. Pulsars are among the most polarized obje ts of the radio sky ever known, however, the origin of pulsar polarization and of the "modes" of polarization that hara terize pulsar emission is still obs ure.

It is focus ed primarily on co - metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria - Lactococcus la ctis and Lactobacillus plantarum - community whose composition was inspired by co - occurrence of yeast and LAB in a multitude of naturally fermented foods. Specifically, I w as interested in detecting metabolic interactions between budding yeast and lactic a cid bacteria, identifying transferred molecules, exploring metabolic mechanisms of their biosynthesis and excretion, and understanding possible causes behind them. A c <b>ombination</b> <b>of</b> experimental and computational methods was used to understand how nutritio nal dependencies shape communit ies of microorganisms. First step involved compos ing a synthetic community of common laboratory strains of yeast and lactic acid bacteria. Following a series of experiments with chemically defined media, LAB revealed their me tabolic dependency on yeast for growth and survival. This m ixed species community appears to be stable and is sustained through the flow of small nitrogenous molecule s from yeast to bacteria. Nutrient cross feeding was found to be a result of overflow meta bolis m in yeast, which release excess catabolit es under particular combinations of available nitrogen sources. The o bserved nutrient excretion involve s a set of genes that regulate yeast nitrogen metabolism when depleted of preferred nitrogen sources. We h ave recreated co - metabolism of yeast - LAB community, as well as multiple natural bacterial communities, with multi - species genome - scale metabolic modeling. Simulation results demonstrated a link between metabolic cross - feeding and species co - occurrence, and proved its high potential of the method for predicting metabolite exchange in microbial communities. In this project, the inter - kingdom model community of wild type microorganisms has been established and characterized. Peculiarities of yeast regulatory n etwork, in certain media compositions, cause “wasteful” excretion of amino acids and other metabolites. This in turn cr e ates a stable niche for growth of lactic acid bacteria, which are auxotro phic for multiple amino acids. D escribed scenario of metabolic dependency between yeast and lactic acid bacteria demonstrates how survival of one species can be driven by metabo lic idiosyncrasy of the other. The y east - LAB interaction is established instantly, and thus can serve as a first step in evolution of cooperat ion...|$|R
