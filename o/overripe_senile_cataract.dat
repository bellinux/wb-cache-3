40|$|Background: <b>Senile</b> <b>{{cataract}}</b> is {{the most}} common type of cataract characterized by gradual progressive thickening of the lens of the eye. Previously, many studies investigated the association between genetic polymorphism and <b>senile</b> <b>cataract.</b> Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) I/D polymorphism is the potential risk factor for many eye-related diseases such as retinopathy and glaucoma. CYP 46 A 1 enzyme converts cholesterol to 24 S-hydroxycholesterol; human lens' membranes contain the highest cholesterol content. Defects in enzymes of cholesterol metabolism can be associated with cataracts. Hence, the present study was carried out to investigate the association of ACE and CYP 46 A 1 genes polymorphism with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases and controls. Materials and Methods: ACE (rs 4646994) and CYP 46 A 1 (rs 754203) genes polymorphism in cases and controls were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: This study included 103 <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases (55 were males and 48 were females) and 102 controls (53 were males and 49 were females). Mean age of cases in this study was 52. 02 ± 12. 11 years while in control group 53. 74 ± 11. 87 years. Frequencies of ACE ID, DD, and II genotypes in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases were 64. 07 %, 4. 85 %, and 31. 06 % and controls were 61. 76 %, 26. 47 %, and 11. 76 %, respectively. The CYP 46 A 1 gene CT, CC, and TT genotype frequencies were 48. 54 %, 8. 73 %, and 42. 71 % in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases and 28. 43 %, 3. 92 %, and 67. 64 % in healthy controls, respectively. ACE DD and II genotypes (P < 0. 001,P = 0. 0008) and CYP 46 A 1 CT and TT genotypes (P = 0. 003,P = 0. 0003) were significantly associated with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases compared to the controls. Conclusion: Findings of this study suggest that ACE and CYP 46 A 1 genes polymorphism may be a predictive marker for early identification of population at risk of <b>senile</b> <b>cataract.</b> This potential role of ACE and CYP 46 A 1 genes polymorphism as a marker of susceptibility to <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> needs further validation in studies involving larger number of patients from different regions...|$|R
40|$|Many {{factors such}} as aging, changes in blood {{electrolytes}} levels, and possibly family history are involved in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> formation. Changes in serum electrolytes levels can induce changes in aqueous electrolytes levels and effect on lens metabolism and probably cataract formation. In this paper, we study serum level of Na + and K + in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients and normal individuals. Methods and materials: 155 <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients scheduled for cataract surgery in eye clinic of Rasoul hospital and 155 normal individuals were selected. Serum Na + and K + levels were measured by Flame Photometry technique and means compared between two groups by t-test. Results: 1. Mean serum Na + level in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients and normal individuals was 144. 96 ± 6. 04 mEq/lit and 140. 88 ± 2. 27 mEq/lit respectively, and there was statistically significant difference (P + level in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients and normal individuals was 4. 20 ± 0. 34 mEq/lit and 4. 15 ± 0. 32 mEq/lit respectively, {{and there was no}} statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Serum Na + level in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients was higher than normal individuals in this study. This result might suggest that diets with high Na + content are a risk factor for age-related cataract formation, as high Na + content of the diet leads to high level of serum Na +, which in turn contributes to formation of age-related cataract. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{pathogenesis}} of cataract {{has been}} found to be influenced by a number of factors including oxidative stress. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) are some of the antioxidant enzymes that protect the body from oxidative damage. The present study investigates the activities of erythrocyte catalase, GPX, and SOD with respect to <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> (non-diabetic cataract) and osmotic cataract (diabetic cataract) in a Sri Lankan population. One hundred and two non-diabetic subjects (50 with cataract and 52 non-cataract) and 106 diabetic subjects (56 with cataract and 50 non-cataract) were recruited into the study. Erythrocyte catalase, GPX, and SOD activities were assayed and the data were analysed by t-test (p < 0. 05 for significance). In the non-diabetic group, significantly low levels of catalase, GPX, and SOD activities were associated with cataract when compared with non-cataract. No significant changes in catalase, GPX, and SOD activities were observed in the diabetic group between <b>cataract</b> and non-cataract. <b>Senile</b> <b>cataract</b> (non-diabetic cataract) was associated with significantly low levels of erythrocyte catalase, GPX, and SOD when compared with osmotic cataract (diabetic cataract). Positive correlations were observed between catalase and SOD (r = 0. 75), catalase and GPX (r = 0. 63), and SOD and GPX (r = 0. 59) in subjects with <b>senile</b> <b>cataracts.</b> Our results indicate that erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme levels are decreased in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> as opposed to osmotic cataract.

Methods: A total of 295 patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> {{were divided into}} two groups according to lens maturation: 105 patients with mature <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> comprised Group 1 (study group) and the remaining 190 with non-mature <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> comprised Group 2 (control group). Prior to surgery, ophthalmological examination was undertaken. Patients&rsquo; best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure were measured and a slit-lamp examination and funduscopy performed. All examination data were recorded and any capsule-related problems during surgery were also recorded. Patient files were reviewed retrospectively and compared between groups. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was used in the statistical analysis. Results: In Group 1, the capsule-related problems found were: inability to complete capsulorhexis (seven eyes [6. 6 %]), posterior capsular perforation (three eyes [2. 8 %]), and conversion to extracapsular surgery (one eye [0. 9 %]). A posterior capsular perforation was seen in one eye (1 %) in the control group. An intraocular lens was inserted into the sulcus in six eyes (5. 7 %) and one anterior chamber (0. 9 %) in Group 1 and into the sulcus in one eye (0. 5 %) of Group 2. The lens was inserted into the capsular bag in all other patients. Conclusion: Delaying surgery in patients with cataracts creates a high risk for capsule-related surgical complications.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy of cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation {{in patients with}} <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> and hematologic disease. METHODS: Forty patients(58 eyes) with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> and hematologic disease underwent cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Preoperative assessment included blood coagulation testing, leukocyte classification, and bone marrow examination. Appropriate preoperative treatments were administered to patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> and thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, and/or pancytopenia(identified through blood testing). Thirty patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> and normal routine bloodwork findings, with ages {{similar to those of}} patients in the study group, were randomly recruited as a control group. Postoperative corrected visual acuity and intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. The causes of hematologic disease in patients in the study group were recorded. Blood clotting data were compared between groups using t -tests. RESULTS: Plasma prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time did not differ significantly between the study and control groups(P = 0. 379 and P = 0. 945, respectively). Surgery improved corrected visual acuity in all patients(> 0. 4 in 56 〖 96. 55 %〗 eyes). No postoperative infection, bleeding or fever occurred.

40|$|Introduction. Reduced {{compound}} glutathione (GSH) in {{the lens}} has the function {{to protect the}} thiol group of lens proteins, and as a substrate of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Protein containing thiol groups is significant for the normal function of lens epithelium, i. e. enzymes Na-K-ATP-ase, thus influencing cell permeability. The relationship GSH/GSSG (oxidized glutathione) is normally high in the lens and other ocular tissue owing to the glutathioneredox cycle, which is localized in the lens epithelium and cortex surface. Objective. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate non-enzymic factors of the antioxidant protection of non-protein and protein tiol, as well as to determine glutathione-dependent enzyme activity in the corticonuclear blocks of lenses in patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract.</b> Methods. Biochemical studies of lens were carried on 101 patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract.</b> According to cataract maturity degree, the patients were classified into two groups: <b>senile</b> incipient <b>cataract</b> (N= 41) and mature <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> (N= 60). GSH concentration was determined by Ellman’s reagent. GPx activity was assayed with cumene hydroperoxide, and that of glutathione S-transferase by follow-up of glutathione conjugation and 1 -chloro- 2. 4 -dinitrobenzene rates. Results. A significantly higher GSH concentration was found in the corticonuclear blocks of lenses with initial as related to mature cataract (p< 0. 001). The activity of enzyme GPx and GST was considerably higher in the corticonuclear blocks of lenses with initial cataract (p< 0. 001). With cataract progression, the quantity of available GSH, necessary for GPx and GST functioning, declined, so that the activity of these enzymes was also significantly decreased in mature cataract. Conclusion. The determined lower GSH concentration and antioxidant enzyme activity in corticonuclear blocks of lenses, particularly in cataract with a nuclear component, indicate the weakened antioxidant response of lens tissue during the development of <b>senile</b> <b>cataract...</b>|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the levels of}} aquaporin- 1 (AQP- 1) in the lens epithelial cells (LECs) of primary glaucoma and to clarify its correlation with lens thickness. METHODS: This study comprised 64 eyes of 64 patients with primary glaucoma, who were divided into 3 groups: 25 eyes of 25 patients with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG), 19 eyes of 19 patients with chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma (CPACG) and 20 eyes of 20 patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). This study also included 12 eyes of 12 patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> as controls. The levels of AQP- 1 in LECs were examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. The lens thickness was measured by A-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The AQP- 1 mRNA levels of LECs were 0. 84 ± 0. 27, 0. 69 ± 0. 34, 0. 44 ± 0. 19 and 0. 51 ± 0. 21 in APACG, CPACG, POAG and <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> group, respectively. The levels of AQP- 1 m RNA were significantly higher in PACG groups compared with those in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> and POAG group (all P< 0. 05).

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a simple but}} sensitive HPLC chromatographic method with a stability-indicating assay for determination and physicochemical characterisation of L-carnosine, a promising <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> prophylactic agent. Chromatographic analysis was conducted using a reverse phase (RP) -HPLC system and an isocratic mobile phase of 98 % v/v trifluoroacetic acid (0. 1 % v/v) and 2 % v/v acetonitrile with detection at 220 nm. L-carnosine was subjected to stress conditions to force its degradation using chemical and thermal agents and was subsequently detected from its degradation products using ESI-MS. The lipophilicity of the drug and 1 : 1 drug to phospholipid complex (PC) mol/mol was determined by estimating the partition coefficient (P). Lipophilicity was greatly enhanced when L-carnosine was formulated as a phospholipid complex using the solvent evaporation method. L-carnosine-phospholipid complex could be a promising approach for effective delivery to the human lens as offers a potential novel treatment for <b>senile</b> <b>cataract...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Most of {{the studies}} {{regarding}} DNA damage in lens epithelial cells (LECs) of cataract patients have been done on lymphocyte or human LECs cultures. Studies of DNA damage directly in LECs of cataract patients are scanty and, to our knowledge, neither photographic evidence nor has a quantitative assessment of DNA damage have been put forward. In our study, we assessed and quantified DNA damage directly in the LECs of <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients, right after cataract surgery. Methods: LECs were taken from different morphologic types of <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients after surgery and DNA damage was immediately assessed by comet assay. Quantitative assessment of DNA damage was conducted using CometScore ™ software. Results: There were no prominent comets {{in most of the}} LECs of the control subjects, but comets were found in cataractous LECs. DNA fragments in the tail of the comet gave smearing (not banded), which was indicative of chemical damage (i. e., not site specific). DNA damage in the LECs of cataract patients was highly significant (p< 0. 001). DNA damage in cortical cataracts was significant (p< 0. 01) when compared to that of nuclear or posterior subcapsular cataracts, but the DNA damage between nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataracts was not significant. Furthermore, we found disrupted nuclear membranes in some of the nuclei in LECs of patients, but not in the control subjects. Conclusions: In <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients, LECs DNA was randomly damaged and this type of damage was possible b...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To analyze cytokines as {{biomarkers}} {{for evaluation}} of severity of glaucoma. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study including 29 eyes with glaucoma. Besides, 28 eyes with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> were used as control. Patients were classified into four groups: acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG), chronic angle closure glaucoma (CACG), primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and <b>senile</b> <b>cataract.</b> Undiluted vitreous samples were collected, then vitreous concentrations of 9 types of cytokines were determined by cytometric bead assay system: γ-interferon (IFNg), interleukin (IL) - 10, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 5, interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP) - 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We also recorded the intraocular pressure (IOP) of patients in each group and Pearson correlated analysis was performed to analysis the correlation between each type of cytokine with IOP. RESULTS: Vitreous levels of IL- 2, IL- 5, MCP- 1, TNF-α and IP- 10 were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in AACG group. Patients with AACG, CACG and POAG have higher IOP than <b>senile</b> <b>cataract,</b> but we didn’t find any significant correlation between IOP with any type of the cytokines. CONCLUSION: Inflammation and immune reaction have a strong link with the pathology of glaucoma especially AACG. Some cytokines may act as biomarkers to evaluate the severity of glaucoma. Anti-inflammatory treatments and controlling of IOP are necessary for the therapy of glaucoma...|$|R
40|$|Background/aim The {{present study}} aims to compare {{postoperative}} endothelial outcome after cataract surgery performed with longitudinal phacoemulsification with that performed with torsional phacoemulsification {{in patients with}} <b>senile</b> <b>cataract.</b> Patients and methods In this prospective observational study, 20 eyes with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> of different grades of nuclear hardness underwent phacoemulsification {{by means of a}} 2. 8 -mm clear corneal incision using Ozil IP, 10 of which underwent torsional phacoemulsification and 10 underwent longitudinal phacoemulsification. Central endothelial cell counts were taken in all patients preoperatively, at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. Results The study included 20 patients with age-related cataract whose ages ranged from 55 to 64 years. There was highly statistically significant endothelial cell loss throughout the study in the two groups and also significant endothelial cell loss between the two groups by the third month (P = 0. 02). Conclusion Both torsional and longitudinal phacoemulsification techniques were efficient in removing noncomplicated cataract; however, statistically significant endothelial cell loss was noted, especially with longitudinal phacoemulsification...|$|R
40|$|An {{account is}} given of {{asymptomatic}} diabetes mellitus. To determine the incidence in 200 patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> 3 tests are described, namely, a modified standard glucose tolerance test, a provocative steroid glucose tolerance test, {{and a standard}} glucose tolerance test. Known diabetics and patients with a fasting blood glucose in excess of 5. 5 mmol/l or glycosuria were excluded. Eighty-eight patients had an abnormal modified standard glucose tolerance test. Of these, 41 had an abnormal curve after a provocative steroid glucose tolerance test, and 30 had an abnormal curve after a standard glucose tolerance test. Forty-three of the 71 patients with abnormal curves had no glycosuria, although the blood glucose level exceeded an arbitrary renal threshold of 10 mmol/l. Asymptomatic diabetes was diagnosed in patients of all age groups. It is concluded that glucose intolerance is common in patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> who show no glycosuria and have a normal fasting blood sugar on routine examination...|$|R
40|$|The tissue {{localization}} and subcellular {{distribution of}} drug-metabolizing enzymes {{in the eye}} are described. With the use of inbred strains of mice, the [Ah] complex is shown {{to be an important}} experimental system for probing genetic differences in drug metabolism and related drug toxicities. Although the genetic system described in detail here involves mice, there is ample evidence that the same system operates in man. Genetic differences in acetaminophen- and naphthalene-induced cataract formation and and other ocular degeneration are shown {{to be related to the}} [Ah] complex. Because this toxicity appears similar to <b>senile</b> <b>cataracts,</b> we propose that certain types of drug-induced cataracts might exist among clinical populations of <b>senile</b> <b>cataracts</b> but that any cause-and-effect relationship would be very difficult to determine because of underlying interindividual differences in genetic predisposition. It is therefore suggested that genetic differences in drug metabolism be an important consideration in the clinical assessment of ocular toxicity caused by drugs and other environmental pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Three {{districts in}} the Punjab plains were {{surveyed}} in 1976 - 7 for <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> and potential risk factors. The prevalence of <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> was 15. 3 % among 1269 persons examined who were aged 30 ang older, and 4. 3 % for all ages. These figures confirmed previous reports of high prevalence. The prevalence was 1 % for ages 30 - 49 and increased markedly in the sixth and seventh decades to 67 % for ages 70 and older. Univariate age-adjusted analyses of selected socioeconomic, demographic, dietary, and other variables suggested that a higher prevalence was associated with being widowed, low education, use of rock salt in cooking, infrequent consumption of various protein foods (beans and lentils, milk, eggs, and curd), short height, and low weight. Multivariate analysis further suggested low total protein consumption as a risk factor that may account {{for as much as}} 40 % of the excess prevalence of Punjab cataract over that in a US population study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Oxidative and osmotic stress {{have been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of cataracts. Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) mediate peroxidation of membrane lipids and cause irre-versible damage to lens proteins. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the changes in erythrocyte glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme (G 6 PD) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the development of <b>senile</b> and diabetic <b>cataracts.</b> The activity of erythrocyte G 6 PD and the concentration of GSH were measured to assess changes in oxidation-reduction status. The oxidation-reduction status of 26 non-diabetic non-cataract (control) subjects were compared with 24 diabetic non-cataract, 30 diabetic cataract and 28 non-diabetic cataract subjects. The results revealed that the GSH and G 6 PD levels of the subjects with senile cata-racts were significantly lower than the subjects without cataracts. The present study reveals the risk of developing <b>senile</b> <b>cataracts</b> is associated with decreased levels of erythrocyte G 6 PD and GSH. In the formation of diabetic cataracts an adequate supply of NADPH (G 6 PD activity) is essential to produce osmotically active sorbitol in the lens. viduals (osmotic cataracts) as well as in non-diabetic individuals (<b>senile</b> <b>cataracts).</b> It is be...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} effect of {{compound}} electrolyte solution and lactated Ringer's solution on corneal function in cataract phacoemulsification, and to provide scientific basis for clinical selection of appropriate perfusion fluid. METHODS: The patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> were randomly divided into control group with lactated Ringer's solution as anterior chamber perfusion and experimental group with compound electrolyte as anterior chamber perfusion. Surgical removal of cataract and phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation were taken. The corneal endothelial cell density, central corneal thickness, hexagonal cell ratio and endothelial cell coefficient of variation were measured at preoperative and postoperative points. RESULTS: Totally 60 patients successfully completed all follow-ups, the experimental group of 30 cases, the control group of 30 cases. The density of corneal endothelial cells in experimental group {{was significantly higher than}} those in the lactated Ringer's solution group at 1 and 3 d after operations(P = 0. 030, 0. 046). The coefficient of variation of corneal endothelial cells in lactated Ringer's solution group was higher than that in compound electrolyte group at 1 and 14 d after operation(P = 0. 025, 0. 014). The visual acuity of the compound electrolyte group was better than that of the lactated Ringer's solution on the first day after operation(P= 0. 04). CONCLUSION: In the phacoemulsification of <b>senile</b> <b>cataract,</b> the compound electrolyte perfusion has better histocompatibility, which can maintain the stability of corneal endothelial cell structure and reduce corneal endothelial cell injury. The compound electrolyte perfusion solution is more suitable for <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> phacoemulsification surgery...|$|R
