5|$|Banksia lemanniana, {{commonly}} known as the yellow lantern banksia or Lemann's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as an open shrub <b>or</b> <b>small</b> tree to five metres (15ft) high with stiff serrated leaves, and unusual hanging inflorescences. Flowering occurs over summer, the greenish buds developing into oval flower spikes before turning grey and developing the characteristic large woody follicles. It occurs within and just east of the Fitzgerald River National Park on the southern coast of the state. Banksia lemanniana is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, <b>or</b> <b>small</b> animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} <b>or</b> <b>small</b> family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated.

Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E

The first minor male gay characters to appear were Andrew MacKenzie (John Morris) and Alf Taylor (Frank Bren) in 1994. The following year a gay schoolteacher, Andrew Watson (Chris Uhlman), became the victim of a dismissal campaign by his pupils. Hairdresser Gino Esposito (Shane McNamara) was often hinted at being gay.|$|E
5|$|Few {{documents}} {{written in}} either the Khitan large <b>or</b> <b>small</b> script survive to this day. Most surviving specimens of both Khitan scripts are epitaph inscriptions on stone tablets, {{as well as a}} number of inscriptions on coins, mirrors and seals. Only a single manuscript text in the Khitan large script is known (Nova N 176), and no manuscripts in the Khitan small script are known. The Liao emperors could read Chinese, and while there were some Chinese works translated into Khitan during the Liao dynasty, the Confucian classics, which served as the core guide to the administration of government in China, are not known to have been translated into Khitan.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated <b>or</b> <b>small</b> populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
