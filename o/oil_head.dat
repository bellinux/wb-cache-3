By 1979, WGBH was bringing in a diverse array of British programming, to the point that Mobil saw an advantage to creating a unique time slot for the crime/police drama genre.Mobil spent 2.3 million in 1979 and 3.2 million in 1980 toward the shows it sponsored on PBS, including for the kickoff of Mystery!.

40|$|The {{application}} of Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT MS) {{to the analysis}} of olive oil shows several distinct advantages over more conventional analysis techniques. The two areas described in this thesis examining olive oil quality are the analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and the assessment of antioxidant activity. VOCs are responsible for the aroma and much of the taste of olive oil, while antioxidants afford some protection from harmful reactions involving radical species inside the body by scavenging radicals when olive oil is ingested. The VOCs of olive oil are used by sensory panel judges to classify oils by their degree of suitability for human consumption. The major parameters used for this evaluation are the strengths of any defects and the degree of fruitiness. A defect is an indication of an undesired process which has occurred in the oil, while fruitiness is a fragile attribute which denotes a good quality oil and is easily masked by defects. SIFT MS was used to measure the strengths of the olive oil defects rancid, winey, musty, fusty and muddy. Great potential was demonstrated for all defects except musty and the concentrations of VOCs in olive <b>oil</b> <b>head</b> space were correlated with the peroxide value, a measure of the degree of oil oxidation. A study aimed at correlating the strength of the fruitiness attribute as determined by a sensory panel with the concentrations of VOCs in olive <b>oil</b> <b>head</b> space was unsuccessful. The SIFT MS Total Oxyradical Scavenging Capacity (TOSC) assay was used to measure olive oil antioxidants. This assay measures all antioxidants in oil, not only those removed by extraction with a solvent, as it is conducted in an emulsion. SIFT MS TOSC assay results were found to correlate well with those of the widely used Folin Ciocalteu assay and the total concentration of phenolic compounds present in olive oil. Discrepancies between the two assays were most likely due to hydrophobic antioxidants which are measured by the SIFT MS TOSC assay but not the other tests...|$|E
40|$|The elastic {{properties}} of oil/water/surfactant interfaces {{play an important}} role in the phase behaviour of microemulsions and for the stability of macroemulsions. The aim of this thesis is to obtain an understanding of the relationship between the structure of the surfactant molecules, the structure of the interface, and macroscopic interfacial properties. To achieve this aim, we performed molecular simulations of oil/water/surfactant systems. We made a quantitative comparison of various model surfactants to determine how structural changes affect interfacial properties and film rupture. The model consists of water, <b>oil,</b> <b>head,</b> and tail beads, and surfactants are constructed by coupling head and tail beads with harmonic springs. We used a hybrid dissipative particle dynamics-Monte Carlo scheme. The former was used to simulate particle trajectories and the Monte Carlo scheme was used to mimic experimental conditions: bulk-interface phase equilibrium, tensionless interfaces in microemulsions, and the surface force apparatus. A detailed comparison of various non-ionic model surfactants showed how structural changes affect interfacial properties: Comparison between linear and branched surfactants showed that the efficiency of adsorption is higher for linear surfactants, although branched surfactants are more efficient at a given surface density. Linear surfactants can be more efficient also at the same surface density if the head group is sufficiently soluble in oil, because low head-oil repulsion makes the branched isomers stagger at the interface. The bending rigidity is higher for linear surfactants. Furthermore, branched surfactants make oil droplets coalesce more easily than linear surfactants do, but linear and branched surfactants have roughly the same effect on water droplet coalescence. Comparison of linear surfactants with varying chain lengths showed that longer surfactants have a lower surface tension and higher bending rigidity. The increase in rigidity with chain length follows a power law, but the exponent is higher for surfactant monolayers at a fixed density than at a fixed tension. Longer tails and/or denser monolayers influence the stability of water droplets in a positive direction, and the stability of oil droplets in a negative direction. Addition of cosurfactant showed that mixed monolayers have a lower bending rigidity than pure monolayers at the same average chain length and tension. Cosurfactants have a negative effect on the stability of water droplets, and a positive effect on the stability of oil droplets. Paper I reprinted with kind permission of EDP Sciences.
