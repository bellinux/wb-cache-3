40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to determine the psychological effect <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers upon children living in joint and nuclear family structures of Pakistan. After detailed literature review it was hypothesized that (1) Children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure will have more psychological problems as compared to the children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. (2) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure. (3) Children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the children of non-working mothers in joint family structure. (4) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children <b>of</b> non- <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure. (5) Children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the children of non-working mothers in nuclear family structure. (6) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children <b>of</b> non- <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. On hypothesis 1, 3 and 5 the difference will be evident on the variables of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problems, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment Sample of the present research consisted of 256 Adolescent children <b>of</b> the <b>working</b> and non working mothers, including 64 children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>of</b> joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 children <b>of</b> non <b>working</b> mothers <b>of</b> joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female), and 64 children <b>of</b> non <b>working</b> mothers belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female). Their age range was from 12 years to 18 years. Subjects were interviewed & then SPM, WRAT-R & RASSI were administered according to standard procedure test was calculated {{in order to determine the}} difference of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problem, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment between the Adolescent children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>of</b> joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> and non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure and Adolescent children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> and non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. Pearson Product Moment Coefficient Correlation was applied to analyze the relationship between the intellectual capacity and academic achievement of Adolescent children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>of</b> joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> and non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure and Adolescent children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> and non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. Further z-test was calculated to determine the significant difference between correlations of above mentioned groups. The results showed significant differences between adolescent children of employed mothers of two family structures (Joint and nuclear) on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems, Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment. There was a significant difference on the variables of Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment and insignificant differences on other two variables i. e. of Antisocial behavior and Anger control problems, between adolescents children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> and Non-working mothers in joint family structures. There was also significant differences on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems and Adjustment and insignificant differences on the variables of, Emotional distress and Positive self between adolescent children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> and Non- <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structures. Further the correlation of intellectual capacity and academic achievement was more positive (i) for children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure. (ii) for children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure as compared to children <b>of</b> non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure and (iii) for children <b>of</b> <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to children <b>of</b> non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure.

40|$|Thanks {{to modern}} {{medicine}} {{there is a}} growing number of patients with apallic syndrome. They are hospitalized in various hospital units. Treating such patients is without question demanding with regard to instruments needed in hospital units, with regard to staffing but high demands are also set on nursing staff who are supposed to provide specialist and difficult care. Providing such care is mostly in competence of a nurse for whom it may represent greater or smaller mental and physical stress. As a result the quality of provided care may be influenced. The objective of my thesis was to evaluate mental and physical stress of nurses providing care to clients with apallic syndrome depending on hospital unit. Two hypotheses were stated. H 1 : Mental stress <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> apallic unit is lower than the stress <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> other hospital units. H 2 : Physical stress <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> apallic unit is lower than the stress <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> other hospital units. I used the method of questioning (questionnaire method) to achieve the objective and to verify the hypotheses. The research set of data consisted of 87 nurses from three types of hospital units. Evaluation of results showed that: H 1 - Mental stress <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> apallic unit is lower than the stress <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> other hospital units - was confirmed. H 2 - Physical stress <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> apallic unit is lower that the stress <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> other hospital units - was not confirmed. In the last part of my thesis I suggested recommendations to key personnel of hospital units where the research work was carried out. The results of the research show that nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> standard units and in intensive care units suffer from greater mental stress while taking care of patients with apallic syndrome. Nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> apallic units suffer from greater physical stress while taking care of patients with apallic syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of nurses′ workplace on burnout syndrome among nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> Isfahan′s Alzahra Hospital as a reference and typical university affiliated hospital, in 2010. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 nurses were randomly selected among those <b>working</b> <b>in</b> emergency, orthopedic, dialysis wards and intensive care unit (ICU). Required data on determination of occupational burnout rate among the nurses of these wards were collected using Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) standard and validated questionnaire. Nurses were selected using simple random sampling. Results: The multivariate ANOVA analysis showed that occupational burnout mean values <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> orthopedic and dialysis wards were significantly less than those <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> emergency ward and ICU (P 0 = 0. 01). There was also no significant difference between occupational burnout mean values <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> emergency ward and ICU (P > 0. 05). t-test showed that there was a difference between occupational burnout values of men and women, as these values for women were higher than those of men (P = 0. 001). Conclusion: Results showed that occupational burnout mean values <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> emergency ward and ICU were significantly more than those <b>of</b> nurses <b>working</b> <b>in</b> orthopedic and dialysis wards...|$|R

Through his Princeton classmates, {{he was hired by}} Wall Street insurance firm Johnson & Higgins upon his return to the United States. Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though ten years older than Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed Baker to stay at his house at 263 Madison Avenue. Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> an office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.|$|E

5|$|A {{research}} survey at Kodumanal has unearthed {{the remains}} of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, {{which may have been}} the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing the remains <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, {{in the form of a}} number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.|$|E
