2500|$|The ISUCF'V'MB {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} and traditional marching style during its pregame presentations. The high-step march (used {{for the majority of}} pregame) incorporates a high leg/knee motion combined with a downward toe point. In addition, a similar half-height, double-time version of the high-step, called 'X'ing, is used to enter the field for pregame performances. The swing cadence the band uses to march into the tunnel is also an ISUCF'V'MB signature; members move in a half-time while jumping from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other to cadence in a motion that is similar to hopping. For halftime performances the band uses [...] "glide step", which allows it to maximize its musical and marching output. This is the step the band uses during parades.|$|E

50|$|Adaptor {{molecules}} {{are responsible}} for self-assembly and recruitment. Two examples of adaptor proteins are AP180 and epsin. AP180 is used in synaptic vesicle formation. It recruits clathrin to membranes and also promotes its polymerization. Epsin also recruits clathrin to membranes and promotes its polymerization, and can help deform the membrane, and thus clathrin-coated vesicles can bud. In a cell, a triskelion floating in <b>the</b> cytoplasm binds <b>to</b> an adaptor protein, linking <b>one</b> of its <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> membrane at a time.

40|$|Bipedal walking {{may be a}} {{difficult}} task to execute by a bipedal robot. Different {{factors such as the}} arm movement or the constant changing of the Center of Mass may lead to an unstable gait. This {{may be one of the}} reasons the trajectory of the Center of Mass should be calculated before making the next step. This paper presents a walking algorithm based on Zero Moment Point for the NAO robot. NAO is a 58 cm tall humanoid bipedal robot produced by the French company Aldebaran Robotics. Bipedal walking can be a quite difficult task, since the Center of Mass moves from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another during <b>the</b> walking. For the NAO robot, walking is an even more difficult task, due to its limitations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 This thesis {{investigated}} {{the contribution of}} <b>the</b> forest <b>to</b> neighboring property prices and explored the possible impacts from different neighboring forest characteristics with the hedonic property price model. The quadratic Box-Cox model was applied <b>to</b> choose <b>the</b> proper functional form. The square root model was chosen <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> interpretable functional form that best explained <b>the</b> data. <b>To</b> check <b>the</b> strength of the regression estimation, the linear model and a weighted regression were also applied. The distance from the forest has a significant negative relationship with property prices {{in all of the}} estimations. The implicit price of proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forest increases as distance decreases and this relationship is stronger for closer houses in the estimated square root model. For example, the property price change is 6. 13 per foot for a house 100 ft away, while it is 1. 94 per foot for a house 1000 ft away. In the linear model, for each <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forest, the house price is worth about 2. 87 more at any distance. After accounting for the contribution of proximity <b>to</b> McDonald-Dunn Forest, <b>the</b> variables for the neighboring forest characteristics were applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hedonic price model. Being close to even-aged forests results in a negative contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> property price, while being close to shelterwood stands with taller trees has positive impacts. When the property is close to agricultural pasture rather than to forestland, property prices tend to be much lower. Neighboring pure conifer stands have higher contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> property price than hardwood or mixed stands. The visibility of clearcut sites in the forest was analyzed by using GIS and the elevation of the area. If all other characteristics of a property are identical, the sales price is lower for the property where clearcut sites are visible at the time of purchase. This study applied the hedonic price model <b>to</b> <b>the</b> near urban forest area and expanded the possibility of GIS application in measuring locational amenities. Results of this study could be used to negotiate arguments between forest owners and neighboring homeowners to produce forest characteristics that are acceptable to neighbors, while providing compensation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forest owners...|$|R
