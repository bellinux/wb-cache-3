5|$|Harding also {{wished to}} promote aviation, and Hoover again took the lead, {{convening}} a national conference on commercial aviation. The discussions focused on safety matters, inspection <b>of</b> <b>airplanes,</b> and licensing of pilots.

5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during {{a demonstration of the}} Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity <b>of</b> <b>airplanes.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{a form of}} {{sympathetic}} magic, many built life-size replicas <b>of</b> <b>airplanes</b> out {{of straw}} and cut new military-style landing strips out of the jungle, hoping to attract more airplanes.
