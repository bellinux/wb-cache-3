5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kīlauea started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea with a series <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> eruptions about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Log Revolution and the end of April 1991, nearly 200 incidents involving the use <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> devices and 89 attacks on the Croatian police were recorded. The Croatian Ministry of the Interior started arming an increasing number of special police forces, and this led to the building of a real army. On 9 April 1991, Croatian President Tuđman ordered the special police forces to be renamed Zbor Narodne Garde ("National Guard"); this marks the creation of a separate military of Croatia.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> that encases the tamper. Test firings <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E
5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E
5|$|By midday on September24, {{the system}} became {{embedded}} within the mid-latitude westerlies and rapidly accelerated towards the northeast. The National Hurricane Center anticipated that Emily would undergo an extratropical transition within 24hours {{at this point}} as they forecast it to merge with the frontal system to the northeast. However, the storm unexpectedly underwent a second phase of rapid intensification on September25, at one point reaching the rate <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> intensification with the central pressure decreasing at 2.5mbar per hour. By 0600UTC, Emily had re-attained hurricane intensity and at 1145UTC, the center passed directly over Bermuda with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Soon after, the storm reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum pressure of 974mbar (hPa; 28.76inHg).|$|E

40|$|Detection <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> {{has become}} an {{important}} field of research due to the increased number of terrorist attacks utilizing improvised explosive devices (IEDs). We show that UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy is a sensitive and incisive technique for detection <b>of</b> <b>explosives.</b> Deep UV excitation <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> gives resonance enhancement and greater sensitivity enabling trace detection <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> and their photochemical products. We demonstrate how we can utilize UVRR to analyze characteristic spectral changes that result from explosives’ photochemistry. In this work, we examined the 229 nm photochemistry {{of some of the}} main military explosives, TNT, RDX, and PETN in solution and solid state. We monitored the decrease in intensity of the UVRR bands <b>of</b> the initial <b>explosive</b> and the increase in intensity of the UVRR photoproduct bands during photolysis. Detection of photochemical product UVRR bands can be used to detect the previous presence <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> even after they have been photolyzed. We determined solution state quantum yields, which gives insight to the susceptibility <b>of</b> the <b>explosive</b> to photolysis upon irradiation.

5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ethel {{originated}} {{from a small}} tropical disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico {{on the morning of}} September14, 1960. It is estimated that Ethel developed into a tropical storm at 1200UTC on that day, with an initial intensity of 45mph (75km/h). The disturbance quickly developed within a region favoring intensification and the New Orleans Hurricane Warning Office issued their first advisory on the system, classifying it as an area of low pressure, at 1500UTC. Roughly six hours after becoming a tropical storm, Ethel was upgraded to a hurricane as it underwent an intense phase <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> deepening. By this time, gale-force winds extended 150miles (240km) {{to the north of the}} center and 80miles (130km) to the south. Ethel further intensified into a major hurricane, as it approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Improvements to {{artillery}} technology necessitated {{significant changes}} to the fort's structure {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra weight on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.|$|E

5|$|Later on September9, Sarah turned sharply northward as the {{lee side}} low rapidly tracked northeast. Reintensification {{gradually}} took {{place as the}} storm {{moved away from the}} Philippines, with the storm reaching typhoon status by September10. Tracking generally towards the north-northwest, Sarah entered a favorable region for development and underwent a period <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> intensification on September11. Over a six-hour span, the storm's winds increased from 140km/h (85mph) to 215km/h (135mph). A powerful typhoon, Sarah featured a well-defined eye and multiple outflow channels. The storm reached its peak strength later that day as a Category4equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). The JMA assessed Sarah to have been somewhat weaker, estimating peak ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) along with a barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg).|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer, {{reviewing}} {{his options}} in early 1943, gave {{priority to the}} gun-type weapon, but as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation, he created the E-5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely.

5|$|The Disney bomb, by contrast, was {{designed}} {{from the start}} to penetrate the thick concrete roofs of fortified bunkers. Whereas the earthquake bomb's target was the bunker itself, the Disney bomb's target was the bunker's contents. To this end, the warhead was composed of an unusually thick steel shell containing a comparatively small amount <b>of</b> <b>explosive.</b> It was much slimmer than was usual for aircraft-dropped bombs, and a cluster of booster rockets accelerated the weapon as it fell. These features accord with Newton's approximation for impact depth and the empirical design equation known as Young's equation that states that the deepest target penetration is achieved by a projectile that is dense, long and thin (i.e. has a large sectional density), and strikes with a high velocity.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this thesis is to develop {{analytical}} methods for the chemical profiling <b>of</b> <b>explosives.</b> Current methodologies for the forensic analysis <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> focus on identification <b>of</b> the <b>explosive</b> material. However, chemical profiling <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> becomes increasingly important, as this allows studying relationships between explosive material found on a crime scene and material associated with a suspect. A range of approaches to chemical profiling is explored in this thesis for various purposes and various types <b>of</b> <b>explosives.</b> Chemical profiling is used to study relationships between two explosives samples (i. e. a crime-scene sample and a sample from a suspect) and between a home-made explosive and its precursors. These relationships were studied using impurity profiles, isotope ratios or elemental compositions, all characteristic features of the origin <b>of</b> the <b>explosive</b> materials. In addition to the ‘source-level’ comparisons, we also demonstrate the use of chemical profiling for ‘activity-level’ investigations. In the latter case, it was demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to establish whether a suspect with explosives residues on his clothing has been present at an explosion scene...|$|R

Rapid weakening took place as the hurricane moved inland, with the system dissipating during the afternoon of October22.|$|E
5|$|Though many {{remained}} unimpressed, Oppenheimer appointed Neddermeyer {{the head}} of a new group to test implosion. His group became the E-5 (Implosion) Group, which was part of Captain William S. Parsons' E Division. A gun-type nuclear weapon was the preferred method, but implosion research constituted a backup. Neddermeyer embarked on an intensive series of experiments testing cylindrical implosions. The result was a series of distorted shapes. Progress was made; Neddermeyer and a member of his team, Hugh Bradner, along with James L. Tuck from the British Mission, conceived the idea <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> lenses, in which shaped charges are used to focus the force of an explosion. Nevertheless, seemingly unsolvable problems with shock wave uniformity brought progress on implosion to a crawl.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Dot, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Saling, was the strongest storm of the 1985 season. Dot {{originated}} from a small area of thunderstorm activity in early to mid October.

Dot attained typhoon strength on October15, and subsequently entered a period <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> deepening, which was not anticipated by forecasters. The next day the intensification rate slowed, but that evening, Dot attained its maximum intensify. A steady weakening trend began on October17, though the system maintained typhoon intensity through the passage of the Philippines. After entering the South China Sea late on October18, Dot briefly re-intensified, only to weaken as it approached Vietnam. On October21, Dot struck Vietnam while still a typhoon, but dissipated the next day over the high terrain of the nation.|$|E
