25|$|The rear {{portion of}} the omah consist of three {{enclosed}} rooms called senthong. The western senthong is used as storing rice and other agricultural produce, while the eastern senthong is used to store farming equipment. The central senthong is typically very small, build with a raised floor, lavishly decorated, and often curtained off from the house proper; resembling an enclosed bed than a room. Traditionally the central senthong was the abode of Sri herself. It is the room where incense is burnt for ceremonies, and in some areas the first rice grains of the harvest are placed here. In wealthy village houses in Central Java, the central senthong is flanked {{by a pair of}} mirrors and a pair of cabinets for holding important textiles. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the senthong is the loro blonyo, a statue of male and female in bridal attire, representing Sri and her male companion Raden Sadono. Also decorating the front of the central senthong are paired spittoons, textiles, and Madura wooden geese. The central senthong is also used as a sleeping room for newly married couples.|$|E

A great glass case at the end underneath a stylish black and white photograph contained a selected few hundred {{of the thousands of}} condolence books the Spencer received from around the world, designed to give a [...] "final sense of scale to the impact of Diana's life and of her death". A sleek, silk-bound copy of the incendiary address that her brother Charles delivered at Diana's funeral was available for £25.|$|E
500|$|Lucius Caecilius Metellus, a {{military}} tribune, despaired {{so much of}} the Roman cause as to suggest that everything was lost, and called the other tribunes to sail overseas and hire themselves into the service of some foreign prince. Afterwards, he was forced by his own example to swear an oath of allegiance to Rome for all time. The survivors of Cannae were reconstituted as two legions and assigned to Sicily {{for the remainder of the}} war as punishment for their humiliating desertion of the battlefield. In addition to the physical loss of her army, Rome suffered a symbolic defeat of prestige. A gold ring was a token of membership in the upper classes of Roman society; Hannibal and his men collected more than 200 from the corpses on the battlefield, and sent this collection to Carthage as proof of his victory. The collection was poured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Punic Senate, and was judged to be [...] "three and a half measures." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a patron}} entered the front doors, {{he would have}} {{found himself in a}} lobby with two {{stairwells}} leading up to the balcony, a manager's office, and a smoking room. [...] Upon stepping through the terracotta leather covered and gold trimmed wooden doors into the auditorium, a patron would have been softly bathed in the shimmering glow of 94 gas lights. [...] These lights, were crafted of polished brass and fitted with etched glass globes. [...] The stage itself was equipped with 174 gas lights. [...] All the lights in the entire theatre were controlled from the stage by means of a pipe system, allowing the stage manager to ignite or extinguish any or all of these brilliant lights in an instant. [...] Beneath a dome resplendent with painted cherubs, a large chandelier, known as an [...] "Opal glass reflector", scattered sparkles of reflected light over all. [...] Elegant red Brussels' carpet softened patrons' steps, and grand opera chairs, upholstered in dark Cardinal plush awaited to seat them. [...] These chairs were engraved with the monogram, B.S.T., Barton Tibbits' initials, and many of these chairs offered foot rests and hat and umbrella racks. [...] Amazingly the auditorium originally held 1,000 seats for patrons. [...] The seating area was divided into the parquet and the parquet circle – two separate areas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the orchestra pit. [...] The walls of the auditorium, colored in cameo tints and dashes of cardinal, green, and gold color in [...] "conventional figures" [...] produced [...] "a warm, sunny effect and [...] the auditorium a bright and airy appearance which is very pleasing." [...] Dominating the scene was a grandly ornate -wide by -long proscenium stage with elegant opera boxes situated within the massive tin and plaster arch.|$|E

Not only did I see the black broadcloth suit--not laid out at length, but all in a compact heap--but I saw the shoes and stockings, the collar and cravat; everything. Near by lay a whisk broom.|$|E
60|$|The hamper was {{so heavy}} and large, and Jean-Marie himself so little and so weary, {{that it had}} taken him a great while to bundle it upstairs to the Desprez' private room; and he had just set it down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Anastasie, when the Doctor arrived, and was closely {{followed}} by the man of business.

A rat made a clatter among these bottles, jumped down, and ran over the real live Hermit on his way to his hole, or the man in his hole would not have been so easily discernible. Tickled in the face by the rat's tail, the owner of Tom Tiddler's ground opened his eyes, saw Mr. Traveller, started up, and sprang to the window.|$|E
