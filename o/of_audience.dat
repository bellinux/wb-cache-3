5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was a survey <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> {{responses to a}} radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E
5|$|Hadji Ali (c.1887–92– November5, 1937) was a {{vaudeville}} performance artist, {{thought to}} be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed.|$|E

5|$|Sleight of hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> to see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring sleight of hand in his stage shows.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Songs chart is {{a record}} chart {{compiled}} by Billboard magazine.

While all Christian radio formats are covered by the Christian Songs chart, it is dominated by Christian adult contemporary (Christian AC) radio stations, which cater to a mostly adult audience. As opposed to Christian stations that cater to young audiences, Christian AC stations tend to play hits often and for long periods. As a result, number-one singles on the Christian Songs chart often have lengthy stays at the top position.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} {{precedence}} in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E
5|$|HIStory was {{promoted}} with the successful HIStory World Tour, beginning on September 7, 1996, and ending on October 15, 1997. Jackson performed 82 concerts in five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, and grossed {{a total of}} , becoming Jackson's most successful tour in terms <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> figures. During the tour, Jackson married his longtime friend Deborah Jeanne Rowe, a dermatology nurse, in an impromptu ceremony in Sydney, Australia. Rowe was approximately six months pregnant with the couple's first child at the time. Originally, Rowe and Jackson {{had no plans to}} marry, but Jackson's mother Katherine persuaded them to do so. Michael Joseph Jackson Jr (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997; his sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born a year later on April 3, 1998. The couple divorced in 1999, and Jackson received full custody of the children. The divorce was relatively amicable, but a subsequent custody suit was not settled until 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Serjeants had {{for many}} centuries {{exclusive}} {{jurisdiction over the}} Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed {{to argue a case}} there. At the same time they had rights <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace {{at the top of the}} wig.|$|E

40|$|Audiences {{have always}} misbehaved. Yet {{the form that}} this ‘misbehaviour’ has taken has changed over time, {{in the face of}} {{shifting}} notions of the ‘rights’ <b>of</b> <b>audiences</b> and varying ideas regarding ‘appropriate’ audience behaviour (Butsch, 2000). As industry struggles to regulate the activities <b>of</b> contemporary <b>audiences,</b> this chapter examines the ethical stances constructed by academics in their work on audiences and intellectual property. Drawing from constructionist/discursive approaches to the audience, the chapter argues that just as the audience ‘does not exist,’ neither do the ethics <b>of</b> <b>audiences.</b> It suggests that scholars might reflect on how they deny/assert the rights and responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>audiences,</b> and how, in positioning the audience as ethical/unethical, they also position themselves. A distinction between ethical competence and ethical performance is presented as providing one way of interrogating the ethical positioning in this scholarship. This distinction provides a conceptual framework for examining researchers’ assessments of the ethics <b>of</b> contemporary <b>audiences</b> and the slippages between normative and descriptive formulations in this growing body of literature.

5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} element of this Part was the extension of rights <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the higher courts to solicitors and other legal professionals. Sections 27 and 28 of Part II give an advocate rights <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> {{and the right to}} conduct litigation if the advocate is qualified to do so, is a member of a professional body recognised by the Lord Chancellor and that body considers him qualified to conduct litigation. A person also has rights <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> if they have been directly granted it, for example by the Lord Chancellor in County Court proceedings. The most immediate effect of this is that solicitors can now gain rights <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the Crown Court, High Court, Court of Appeal, Court of Session, Privy Council, and House of Lords if they qualify as Solicitor Advocates. Solicitor's clerks also have rights <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the chambers of judges in the Crown Court and High Court, assuming they are being instructed by a qualified solicitor.|$|E
