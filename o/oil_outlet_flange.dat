The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), worm shaft (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), <b>oil</b> and cake <b>outlet,</b> hopper, conical restrictor, pulley and transmission belts.

The most popular solution is a system where a throttling control valve is fed by a constant capacity pump cooperating with an overfl ow valve. This system, working with a constant pressure, achieves a high energy effi ciency value η only at the point of maximum motor load coeffi cient MM and maximum motor speed coeffi cient ωM.

The comparison was made by using the same bearing for both groove configurations but the oil feeding to the - 90 º groove was shut with a valve in one of the cases in order to emulate a single groove bearing. Measurements of total and partial lubricant flow rate through each groove, shaft locus, inner bush surface temperature, <b>oil</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature and electrical motor consumption were performed. For the range of applied loads tested the twin groove journal bearing displayed a lower maximum temperature but a higher outlet temperature and eccentricity than the single groove journal bearing. Also the measured total flow rate in the bearing was approximately the same for the single and the twin groove arrangements. For the twin groove bearing, the partial flow rate through each groove varied dramatically with increasing load: At high eccentricities the flow being supplied to the active land of the bearing through the + 90 º groove was much lower than that supplied to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. Actually, the measured flow rate at the + 90 º groove was almost zero for the highest load tested, with nearly all the lubricant being fed to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. This means that under heavy load operation, the existence of an extra groove at - 90 º to the load line might actually deteriorate lubrication effectiveness when compared with a single groove arrangement...|$|R

Aufgrund seiner herausragenden Wärmeleitfähigkeit findet es insbesondere in der modernen Hochtemperatur- und Hochleistungselektronik ein zukunftsträchtiges Anwendungsfeld, welches jedoch die Entwicklung großer und hochreiner Einkristalle erfordert. Das zur Zeit wichtigste Verfahren zur Herstellung von SiC Einkristallen ist die Physikalische Gasphasenabscheidung(Physical Vapor Transport-Deposition, PVT), das auf der Herstellung von SiC-Pulver, der nachfolgenden Sublimation des Pulvers und der anschließenden homoepitaktischen Abscheidung von SiC aus der Gasphase auf SiC-Impfkristallen beruht. Die dazu notwendigen, extrem hohen Sublimations- und Schmelztemperaturen (2500 - 2600 °C) bilden allerdings ein großes Hindernis für die Herstellung größerer Einkristalle geringer Defektdichte; zudem benötigt der Gesamtprozeß ein hohes Maß an zuzuführender Energie, u. a. für die zusätzliche Bereitstellung des SiC-Pulvers. Hier erstmalig vorgestellt wird nun ein neuartiges Verfahren, das auf der homoepitaktischen Chemischen Gasphasenabscheidung von SiC auf SiC-Impfkristallen bei Temperaturen um etwa 1900 - 2300 °C (High Temperature Chemical Vapor Deposition, HTCVD) besteht. Als Vorläufer dieses Prozesses dienen Silan (SiH 4) und Propan C 3 H 8. Im Gegensatz zum herkömmlichen PVT-Verfahren wird das SiC direkt unter einmaligem Aufheizen der Vorläufer gebildet; so kann ein großer Teil der für den Prozeß benötigten Energie eingespart werden. Die vorgelegte Arbeit beschreibt zum einen die Konstruktion, Entwicklung und Inbetriebnahme eines induktiv beheizten Heißwandreaktorsystems für reine Silanvorläufer und extreme Prozesstemperaturen (3 für Kohlenwasserstoff (Propan) und 0. 996 mol/m 3 für Silan. Höhere Wachstumsraten wurden nur bei höheren Substrattemperaturen und auf 6 H-SiC-Keimkristallen mit 3. 5 ° "off-axis"-Orientierung erzielt: 100 µm/h bei 2060 °C, der maximal zulässigen Temperatur des verwendeten Reaktors. Nach erfolgreicher längerer Abscheidedauer (bis zu 3 Stunden) konnten größere Einkristalle mit Schichtdicken von etwa 150 µm beobachtet werden. Das resultierte Wachstum wurde gravimetrisch sowie mittels optischer Mikroskopie, XRD, SEM, EDX und LEED analysiert. Silicon Carbide (SiC) is an {{important}} compound with many benefits to man kind, ranging from early usage as an abrasive to its recent use as an intrinsic semiconductor. SiC is typically man made, since it rarely exists in nature {{in the form of}} the natural moissanite. The production of crystalline SiC with increasing size and high quality has been accomplished using Physical Vapor Transport (PVT) for the high power and low frequency applications. Although high quality crystals could be produced using this method, growth defects like micropipes, dislocations, etc., could not be completely inhibited. Thus, the preparation of the SiC powder used in this process requires additional energy, which makes the High Temperature Chemical Vapor Deposition (HTCVD) technique more attractive and could be considered as an efficient alternative to the PVT method, which requires lower throughput capacity than PVT due to saving the exergy destroyed in the powder formation process (used in the PVT method) and due to its low precursor’s cost and their disposition for continuous feeding. Therefore, in this work, a vertical hot-wall reactor with an upward flow direction, was built and suited for the investigation of the epitaxial growth of low defect SiC single crystalline using the HTCVD technique. The gases are injected into the reactor through a water cooled flange and a nozzle including an optical access for the temperature measurement. The exhaust gases were removed by four openings at the top of the reactor. The substrates were fastened on a graphite seed-holder and hanged in the reactor using a graphite cord. The precursors used were silane (SiH 4), propane (C 3 H 8) and hydrogen (H 2) while helium was used as a carrier gas. The temperature profile was measured by means of two color pyrometer. A maximum temperature of 2180 °C was measured on the reactor walls, while a temperature of 2025 °C was measured on the seed-holder, which was hanged 18 cm below the <b>outlet</b> <b>flange.</b> Non-seeded growth of polycrystalline SiC was carried out and used for indicating the growth parameters that were later used as a reference for the setup of the epitaxial growth experiments. In the epitaxial growth experiments the deposition was firstly performed on on-axis 6 H-SiC seeds. At a temperature of 1995 °C, a growth rate of 32 µm/h was achieved. This temperature was achieved at a substrate position of 30 cm below the <b>outlet</b> <b>flange</b> (5 cm above the middle plane of the inductive coil). Layers that grew on on-axis substrates were shown to have a plain surface morphology. The growth rate has shown a significant dependency on the C 3 H 8 within low range of its concentrations. The step flow mechanism is activated when off-axis seed-crystals with a tilt angle of 3. 5 ° and 8 ° are used. On the film layers that were grown on the off-axis substrate with a tilt angle of 3. 5 °, flat terraces with sharp edges could be recognized by optical microscopy. Instead, wavy surface morphology resulted on the films grown on the 8 ° off-axis seed. Increasing the temperature beyond 1955 °C resulted in higher growth rates on the off-axis surfaces; meanwhile, no growth rate enhancement was obtained on the on-axis surfaces. A maximum growth rate of 100 µm/h was achieved at a growth emperature of 2060 °C. The epitaxial growth of SiC by HTCVD was successfully carried out for long periods up to 3 hours using the hot-wall reactor. The growth of thick epilayers of SiC can be realized at high growth rates for several hours, which makes it very important to measure the mass change of the substrate during deposition. On the other hand, investigating the growth rate for a wide range of the process parameters, can be accomplished by the application of an in-situ measuring technique, which can save a lot of experimental time and cost. Accordingly, a magnetic suspension balance (MSB) was successfully integrated into the hot-wall reactor and used for the in-situ measurement of the mass change during deposition. In order to minimize the experimental cost, this technique was only applied during non-seeded growth experiments, where polycrystalline SiC was deposited directly on a graphite seed-holder with 50 mm diameter. The mass change could be successfully recorded at a growth temperature of 1950 °C, flow velocity of 0. 0075 m/s and a pressure of 800 mbar. The dependency of the growth rate on the precursor (SiH 4, C 3 H 8 and H 2 concentrations was investigated individually while the mass change was recorded in-situ...|$|R
