It is estimated that annual savings of $ 46, 500 can be realized by optimizing the <b>operation</b> <b>schedule</b> and partially closing cold deck coils. The majority of energy savings occur because the optimized <b>operation</b> <b>schedule</b> reduces reheat substantially. Our analysis indicates that the indoor comfort level will not be degraded by this measure. The economizer cycle can reduce the annual energy costs by amount of $ 26, 100. These two measures can reduce the annual energy costs by $ 71, 500, or 37 % of the total building energy costs. To maintain the humidity levels, the optimized schedule should be implemented by partially closed coils. It cannot be implemented by increasing cold deck temperature.

Detailed observing schedules are created each week, including, in the case of HST <b>operations,</b> <b>scheduling</b> the data communication paths via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) and generating the binary command loads for uplink to the spacecraft. Adjustments can be made to both long-range and weekly plans in response to Targets of Opportunity (e.g., for transient events like supernovae or coordination with one-of-a-kind events such as comet impact spacecraft). The STScI uses the Min-conflicts algorithm to schedule observation time on the telescope. The STScI is currently developing similar processes for JWST, although the operational details will be very different due to its different instrumentation and spacecraft constraints, and its location at the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point (~1.5 million km from Earth) rather than the low Earth orbit (~565 km) used by HST.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the short-term scheduling of multistage continuous multiproduct plants. In the literature {{this problem is}} generally modeled as a monolithic mixed-integer program. In this paper we follow a closed-loop approach which starts from a decomposition of the problem into an operations planning and an <b>operations</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem. The operations planning problem consists in optimizing the operating conditions of the operations and can be formulated as a nonlinear program of moderate size. The solution to the operations planning problem provides a set of operations with fixed operating conditions, which have to be scheduled on the processing units of the plant. For solving this <b>operations</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem we use a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Having computed a feasible production schedule, {{we return to the}} operations planning phase, where we re-optimize the operating conditions {{in such a way that}} we can guarantee the existence of a feasible s olution to the <b>operations</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem.

The differences come about because: the duration of each operation is dependent upon the combination of constrained resources allocated to it, individual worker-equipment allocation is restricted, and minimum or maximum time lags can be imposed.
