5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> of these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.|$|E

5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> {{of the power}} that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required {{a return to the}} facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

So the observable universe (the so-called particle horizon of the universe) is the result of processes that follow some general physical laws, including quantum mechanics and general relativity. Some of these processes are random: for example, the distribution of galaxies throughout the universe can only be described statistically and cannot be derived from first principles.|$|R

We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging “equivalent ” stacks based on feature values. Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce dependency parser with no loss in accuracy. Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster. ...|$|R

At each temperature there is a partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of available evidence of the potential role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular dysfunction. RECENT FINDINGS Arterial hypertension is a highly heritable condition. Surprisingly, however, genetic variants <b>only</b> explain <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> of the phenotypic variation and the term 'missing heritability' has been coined to describe this phenomenon. Recent evidence suggests that phenotypic alteration that is unrelated to changes in DNA sequence (thereby escaping detection by classic genetic methodology) offers a potential explanation. Here, we present some basic information on epigenetics and review recent work consistent with the hypothesis of epigenetically induced arterial hypertension. SUMMARY New technologies that enable the rigorous assessment of epigenetic changes and their phenotypic consequences may provide the basis for explaining the missing heritability of arterial hypertension and offer new possibilities for treatment and/or prevention...|$|R

25|$|The {{decay of}} {{a mixture of}} two or more {{materials}} which each decay exponentially, but with different half-lives, is not exponential. Mathematically, the sum of two exponential functions is not a single exponential function. A common example of such a situation is the waste of nuclear power stations, which is a mix of substances with vastly different half-lives. Consider a mixture of a rapidly decaying element A, with a half-life of 1 second, and a slowly decaying element B, with a half-life of 1 year. In a couple of minutes, almost all atoms of element A will have decayed after repeated halving of the initial number of atoms, but very few of the atoms of element B will have done so as <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> of its half-life has elapsed.

These places can vary greatly in format, including luggage, inside of vehicles, within furniture, amongst bedside clutter—even inside electrical sockets and nearby laptop computers. Bed bugs may also nest near animals that have nested within a dwelling, such as bats, birds, or rodents.
