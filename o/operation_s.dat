40|$|Introduction This draft paper {{contains}} {{a description of}} a type inference system based on subtyping constraints, including, in particular, a form of conditional constraints. It contains descriptions and proofs of the main algorithms used for constraint resolution and simplification. Because the system is an extension of the one described in [Pot 98], most proofs are partial, and describe only the modifications required to accomodate conditional constraints. Both papers, taken together, form a full description of the system. The paper is currently in a preliminary state, where all technical material is present, but most explanations are missing. 2 Definitions 2. 1 Ground types Definition 1 Let S be a lattice of symbols, with computable <b>operations</b> ?<b>S,</b> ?S, S, tS and uS.
