5|$|In March 2001, Kikuta founded Norstrilia, {{named after}} the novel of the same name. The company serves as his private record label, and publishes his albums. For {{the next few years}} he worked as concept designer, game planner, and {{composer}} for Chou Bukyo Taisen, a Chinese MMORPG, the original design for which he proposed to Enix. Development of the game ceased in 2004 due to disagreements between Enix and the Chinese company that was to maintain the game while it was in progress and it was never released. Since then he has gone on to score six other games, including the eroge visual novel Sora no Iro, Mizu no Iro and the MMORPG Concerto Gate. None of these games have been released outside Japan; to date the only video games that Kikuta has worked on to appear in North America <b>or</b> <b>Europe</b> are Secret of Mana and Koudelka.|$|E
5|$|The 1972 Winter Games, held in Sapporo, Japan, {{were the}} first to be hosted outside North America <b>or</b> <b>Europe.</b> The issue of professionalism became {{contentious}} during the Sapporo Games. Three days before the Games IOC president Avery Brundage threatened to bar a number of alpine skiers from competing because they participated in a ski camp at Mammoth Mountain in the United States. Brundage reasoned that the skiers had financially benefited from their status as athletes and were therefore no longer amateurs. Eventually only Austrian Karl Schranz, who earned more than all the other skiers, was not allowed to compete. Canada did not send teams to the 1972 or 1976 ice hockey tournaments in protest at not being able to use players from professional leagues. Francisco Fernández Ochoa became the first (and as of 2017 only) Spaniard to win a Winter Olympic gold medal; he triumphed in the slalom.|$|E

The Nintendo DS version of the game was positively received, selling over one million copies in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{structures}} on St Kilda {{are the most}} enigmatic. Large sheepfolds lie inland from the existing village at An Lag Bho'n Tuath (English: the hollow in the north) and contain curious 'boat-shaped' stone rings, or 'settings'. Soil samples suggest a date of 1850 BC, but they are unique to St Kilda, and their purpose is unknown. In Gleann Mòr, (north-west of Village Bay beyond Hirta's central ridge), there are 20 'horned structures', essentially ruined buildings with a main court measuring about , two or more smaller cells and a forecourt formed by two curved or horn-shaped walls. Again, nothing like them exists anywhere else in Britain <b>or</b> <b>Europe,</b> and their original use is unknown. Also in Gleann Mòr is Taigh na Banaghaisgeich, the 'Amazon's House'. As Martin (1703) reported, many St Kilda tales are told about this female warrior.|$|E
