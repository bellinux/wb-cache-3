5|$|The first {{divided highway}} project on US113 in Maryland was the four-lane divided Berlin bypass, which was {{constructed}} between 1955 and 1957. A second carriageway {{was added to}} the existing highway from Hayes Landing Road to Main Street south <b>of</b> <b>Berlin</b> and for a short stretch north of Main Street on the north side <b>of</b> <b>Berlin.</b> Main Street through Berlin became MD818 in 1958. When US50's bypass <b>of</b> <b>Berlin</b> was built between 1957 and 1959, ramps from westbound US 50 to northbound US 113 and from eastbound US 50 to southbound US 113 were added. The remaining six ramps of the cloverleaf interchange and US113's bridges across US50 were completed in 1975 and 1976.|$|E

5|$|The {{successes of}} the 1st Ukrainian Front during the first nine days of the battle meant that by 25 April, they were occupying large swathes of the area south and {{south-west}} <b>of</b> <b>Berlin.</b> Their spearheads had met elements of the 1st Belorussian Front west <b>of</b> <b>Berlin,</b> completing the investment of the city. Meanwhile, the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army in 1st Ukrainian Front made contact with the 69th Infantry Division (United States) of the United States First Army near Torgau, on the Elbe River. These manoeuvres had broken the German forces south <b>of</b> <b>Berlin</b> into three parts. The German IX Army was surrounded in the Halbe pocket. Wenck's XII Army, obeying Hitler's command of 22 April, was attempting to force its way into Berlin from the south-west but met stiff resistance from 1st Ukrainian Front around Potsdam. Schörner's Army Group Centre was forced {{to withdraw from the}} Battle <b>of</b> <b>Berlin,</b> along its lines of communications towards Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|In {{denial about}} the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the units {{commanded}} by Waffen-SS General Felix Steiner, the Armeeabteilung Steiner ("Army Detachment Steiner"). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner {{to attack the}} northern flank of the encircling Soviet salient and ordered the German Ninth Army, south-east <b>of</b> <b>Berlin,</b> to attack northward in a pincer attack. By that evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts <b>of</b> <b>Berlin.</b> At his afternoon situation conference on 22 April, Hitler was told Steiner's forces had not moved. Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack {{was not going to}} be carried out. He openly declared for the first time the war was lost—and blamed his generals. He announced he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.|$|E

5|$|Balmer relinquished {{command of}} No.100 Squadron in April 1943, and was posted from the South West Pacific to the European theatre that June. His planned {{secondment}} to the RAF was for two years. Partly {{in an effort}} to bolster Australian aspirations to form a distinct RAAF group within RAF Bomber Command, in August he was appointed commanding officer of No.467 Squadron, based at RAF Bottesford, Leicestershire. The squadron had been raised under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme, and operated Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Balmer led his unit in a costly raid on Nuremberg the night of 27/28August, before attacking Hanover in September and October. From its new base at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, Balmer then took No.467 Squadron through the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Berlin</b> that commenced in November 1943 and continued until March 1944. The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50 per cent, and during the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Berlin,</b> loss rates were far higher. No.467 Squadron was the only Australian unit to take part in all sixteen heavy attacks against the German capital during the battle. In the same period it also raided Frankfurt, Leipzig, Stettin, Stuttgart, Essen, and Augsburg.|$|E
