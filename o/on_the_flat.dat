5|$|The revolt {{developed}} from local disturbances {{in the first}} half of 1437. The villagers from Daróc, Mákó and Türe (Dorolțu, Macău and Turea) assaulted the abbot of Kolozsmonostor at Bogártelke (Băgara) in March. In Alsó-Fehér County and around Déva (Deva), the serfs gathered into small bands and attacked the noblemen's manors. Peasants from Alparét and Bogáta (Bogata de Sus) were the first to settle on the top of the nearby Mount Bábolna in May or June. Being surrounded by high cliffs and dense forests and crowned by a plateau of about , the mountain was an ideal place for defence. Following the Taborites' military strategy, the rebels established a camp <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> summit of the mountain.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} six well-situated and {{developed}} redoubts {{making up the}} strong Ottoman garrison position at Magdhaba reflected considerable planning; the redoubts were almost impossible to locate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> ground {{on both sides of}} the Wadi el Arish. Clearly, the move of the Ottoman garrison from El Arish had not been a sudden, panicked reaction; indeed it was first noticed by Allied aerial reconnaissance planes as early as 25 October.|$|E
5|$|Under LSWR ownership, the N15s were {{initially}} well received by crews, though the batch soon {{gained a reputation}} for poor steaming on long runs. Through running of the class into Exeter was stopped in favour of engine changes at Salisbury, and Urie attributed the problem to poor driving technique. A series of trial runs changed this assumption, and demonstrated that steam pressure gradually decreased <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat.</b> The trials also revealed that the robust construction of the motion produced the heaviest hammerblow of any British locomotive class, and had caused cracked frames on the test locomotive.|$|E

5|$|Excluding Kingston upon Hull {{there are}} several areas of {{settlement}} in the East Riding, each giving rise to distinctive types of small to medium-sized towns and villages. Cottingham and Willerby are exceptional {{in that they are}} suburban villages which are almost contiguous with the Hull urban area. Bridlington is the most populous of the coastal settlements, which also include Flamborough, Hornsea, Withernsea and Aldbrough. Towns and villages <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> agricultural area of Holderness are Hedon and Roos, and nestling in the Great Wold Valley is Rudston. Along the eastern foot of the Wolds lie Beverley, Bishop Burton, Driffield and Lockington. In the low-lying lands close to the Humber Estuary are Goole, Brough, North Ferriby, Hessle and Kirk Ella. Stamford Bridge, Pocklington, Market Weighton, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, Howden and South Cave all lie to the north and west of the area, between the River Derwent and the scarp slope of the Wolds.|$|E
5|$|Gold, {{commonly}} known as Gold Beach, was the code name {{for one of the}} five areas of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, during the Second World War. Gold, the central of the five areas, was located between Port-en-Bessin on the west and La Rivière on the east. High cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings took place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> section between Le Hamel and La Rivière, in the sectors code-named Jig and King. Taking Gold was to be the responsibility of the British Army, with sea transport, mine sweeping, and a naval bombardment force provided by the Royal Navy as well as elements from the Dutch, Polish and other Allied navies.|$|E
5|$|Quinziato, {{the weakest}} climber {{of the three}} leading riders, {{attacked}} at {{the summit of the}} Denderoordberg, the penultimate climb of the day, quickly dropping Lampaert. Leukemans attempted to hold Quinziato's wheel, but was dropped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat.</b> Quinziato soon had half a minute's lead and entered the base of the Muur alone. He had more difficulty on the climb, however: as Leukemans and Lampaert reached the cobbles, they quickly began to catch him. Quinziato eventually crossed the line with just a few seconds to spare. This was the second professional victory of his career, nine years after his first, which had come in the 2006 Eneco Tour. Wellens finished in a large group 42 seconds back and sealed his overall victory in the race.|$|E
5000|$|The year 1868 {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of the Catholic Polish immigration to Cleveland. It was then that a few families of Poles settled in the [...] "Forest City". By the end of 1873 their number so increased that Bishop Richard Gilmour found it necessary to organize them into a separate congregation. As they were too poor, and too few in number, to build their own church, Gilmour gave them the use of St. Mary's <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flats.</b> George Francis Houck wrote that Catholic Poles of Cleveland were the last to occupy St. Mary's <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flats,</b> <b>the</b> first Catholic church building in Cleveland, from 1872 to 1879, before organizing as the St. Stanislaus congregation. Poles were the last to occupy the proto-cathedral of Cleveland.|$|R

5|$|Several major premodern Native American groups {{eventually}} {{gained control}} of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived in the mountain headwaters of the Santa Ana River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day San Bernardino County, {{as well as in}} the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Tongva lived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> coastal plains of present-day Orange County south of the Santa Ana Mountains. They were also the larger of the two groups, controlling all the coastal lands from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Aliso Creek in the south, including all of the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E
5|$|The Transylvanian peasants {{had already}} been outraged because of the {{increase}} of existing seigneurial duties and taxes {{and the introduction of}} new taxes during {{the first decades of the}} century. The bishop also tried to collect the tithe from the petty noblemen and from Orthodox Vlachs who had settled in parcels abandoned by Catholic peasants. In the spring of 1437, Hungarian and Vlach commoners, poor townspeople from Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and petty noblemen started to assemble <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> summit of Mount Bábolna near Alparét (Bobâlna) where they set up a fortified camp. The bishop and his brother, Roland Lépes, the deputy of the voivode (or royal governor) of Transylvania, gathered their troops to fight against the rebels. The voivode, the two counts of the Székelys and many Transylvanian noblemen also hurried to the mountain to assist them against the rebels.|$|E
5|$|The breakaway's {{lead was}} reduced to {{less than two minutes}} {{at the foot of the}} first climb. Howes {{attacked}} alone, with Madrazo following. On the descent, however, Howes fell. He was passed by Madrazo and by the peloton, which had caught the remainder of the breakaway. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> section that followed the climb, several groups, including that of Chaves, came back together. Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step) attacked, but was soon caught and passed by his teammate Gianluca Brambilla, who was part of a four-man group that formed on the final ascent of the day. Tom Dumoulin attempted to control the peloton on the climb, but there were attacks from various riders including some of the general classification favourites. After the descent, the groups came back together and the lead group was formed of approximately 40 riders.|$|E
60|$|That {{night they}} all encamped, as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} night, {{in the midst}} of the pack, spreading their skins and furs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flattest</b> ice they could find, and keeping as far from overhanging lumps as possible.|$|R

MTN-Qhubeka was the first of these, while Cofidis were unable to position Bouhanni correctly. , who had not been involved in the chase for most of the stage, came to the front for the final section, with its several tight corners. Degenkolb was the first to open the sprint with Sagan on his wheel, but 's Caleb Ewan was able to come past both of them to take the stage victory. Degenkolb was second and Sagan third. The stage was Ewan's first Grand Tour stage victory: the Vuelta was his first Grand Tour and came in the first year of his professional career.|$|E

5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated {{at the base}} of a magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost heaving into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{seventeen}} sectors {{along the}} Normandy coastline {{had been selected}} as possible invasion sites and each were provided with a code name taken {{from one of the}} spelling alphabets of the time. The coast was divided between Able, west of Omaha, to Rodger on the eastern flank of the invasion area. Eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include Utah. Each sector was further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and White. Gold did not refer to a particular beach but to a landing area. It was delineated by Port-en-Bessin on the west and La Rivière on the east, and included Arromanches, location of one of the artificial Mulberry harbours that were to be constructed shortly after the invasion. High cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings would be undertaken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> beach between Le Hamel and La Rivière, in the sectors code-named Jig and King. The area immediately behind the beach was marshy, with open ground and bocage (small fields surrounded by hedges and embankments) further inland. Roads led to the south via Asnelles and Ver-sur-Mer. The terrain to the south-east rose to a ridge at Meuvaines, where on D-Day were located machine gun nests of the German 726th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha {{army was}} {{a mix of}} Rohillas, Rajputs, and Marathas. It also {{included}} a small force of the Portuguese under their officer, de Pinto. The left flank of the Maratha army, commanded by Moropant Dixit and Raste, was stationed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> ground on which the University of Pune stands today. The centre was commanded by Bapu Gokhale and the right was under Vinchurkar. British troop movements began on 1 November 1817 when Colonel Burr moved his forces towards what is now Bund Garden via the Holkar Bridge. The Maratha were successful initially in creating and exploiting {{a gap in the}} British left and centre. These successes were nullified by the Maratha horses being thrown into disarray by a hidden canal and the temporary loss of command by Gokhale, whose horse was shot. The Marathas were rendered leaderless when Moropant Dixit on the right was shot dead. The British infantry advanced steadily, firing volley after volley, causing the Maratha cavalry to retreat in a matter of four hours. The British soon claimed victory. The British lost 86 men and the Maratha about 500.|$|E
