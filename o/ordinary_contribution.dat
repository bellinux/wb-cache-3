40|$|In {{this work}} we {{present the results}} of {{theoretical}} analysis of magnetic quantum oscillations of the velocity and attenuation of high frequency ultrasound waves traveling in quasi-two-dimensional conductors. We chose a geometry where the wave vector of the longitudinal sound wave and the external magnetic field are directed along the axis of symmetry of the Fermi surface. Assuming a moderately weak Fermi surface corrugation we showed that the oscillating correction to the sound velocity may include a special term besides an <b>ordinary</b> <b>contribution</b> originating from quantum oscillations of the charge carriers density of states at the Fermi surface. This additional term is generated by a "phase stability" resonance occurring when the charge carriers velocity {{in the direction of}} the wave propagation equals the sound velocity.

The appearance of the extra term may bring significant changes in magnetic quantum oscillations of the velocity of sound in Q 2 D conductors, especially at low temperatures.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{following}} {{our work}} on the two-state outer neighbor mixed bonding model of water, it is proposed that polar groups promote {{the formation of the}} low density ice Ih-type bonding in their neighborhood, whereas nonpolar groups tend to promote the higher density ice II-type structure. In a protein, because of the large numbers of exposed polar and nonpolar groups, large changes in the neighboring water structure can occur. These changes, of course, depend on whether the protein is in its native or its unfolded state and will be shown here to have a direct impact on the thermodynamics of protein unfolding at both high and low temperatures. For example, it is known that the polar hydration entropies become rapidly more negative with increasing temperature. This very unusual behavior can be directly related to the promotion in the outer bulk liquid of the more stable Ih-type bonding at the expense of II-type bonding by polar groups of the protein. In contrast, nonpolar groups have an opposite effect on the thermodynamics. It is the delicate balance created by these outer hydration <b>contributions,</b> mixed with <b>ordinary</b> thermodynamic <b>contributions</b> from the inner hydration shell and those from hydrogen-bond and van der Waals forces within the protein molecule itself that is responsible for both heat and cold denaturation of proteins...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of the full angular dependence of the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in a thin film of epitaxial antiferromagnetic NiO, without any ferromagnetic element. The angular dependence of the magnetoresistance was measured in magnetic fields up to 11 T, using three orthogonal angular scans. We find that the total magnetoresistance has contributions arising both from SMR and ordinary magnetoresistance. Due to the particular NiO(001) orientation, and {{due to the fact}} that NiO(111) planes are easy-planes for the antiferromagnetic moment rotation, SMR is observable in all orthogonal planes. The onset of the SMR signal occurs between 1 and 3 T and no saturation is visible up to 11 T. The sign of the SMR is consistent with recent theoretical predictions and our results can be explained more quantitatively by a model considering the field-induced redistribution of S-domains, competing with the destressing energy arising from the interaction of the magnetostrictive NiO layer with the nonmagnetic MgO substrate. From the observed SMR ratio, we estimate the spin mixing conductance at the NiO/Pt interface to be greater than 1 × 10 ^ 14 Ω^- 1 m^- 2, comparable to early works on YIG/Pt systems. Our results highlight the presence of negative SMR in antiferromagnetic thin films, confirming the existence of efficient spin transport and suggesting the possibility of an electrical detection of the Néel vector in this class of materials, even for thin films relevant for applications. Moreover, we show that a careful subtraction of the <b>ordinary</b> magnetoresistance <b>contribution</b> is crucial to correctly estimate the size of the SMR...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we study effects of parity nonconservation in atomic dysprosium, where one has a pair of nearly {{degenerate}} levels of opposite parity. We consider the time evolution of this two-level system within oscillatory electric and magnetic fields. These are chosen to have a periodical structure with the same period, such that a Floquet matrix describes the time evolution of the quantum states. We show that, if the states are unstable, the eigenvalues of the Floquet matrix may have contributions proportional to the square root of the parity violating interaction matrix element H_w while they are almost degenerate in their parity even part. This leads to beat frequencies proportional to √(H_w) which {{are expected to be}} larger by several orders of magnitude compared to <b>ordinary</b> P-violating <b>contributions</b> which are of order H_w. However, for the simple field configurations we considered, it still seems to be difficult to observe these P-violating beat effects, since the states decay too fast. On the other hand, we found that, within only a few Floquet cycles, very large parity violating asymmetries with respect to experimental setups of opposite chirality may be obtained. The electric and magnetic fields as well as the time intervals necessary for this are in an experimentally accessible range. For statistically significant effects beyond one standard deviation a number of about 10 ^ 7 atoms is required. Our ideas may be applied directly to other 2 -level atomic systems and different field configurations. We hope that these ideas will stimulate experimental work in this direction.

40|$|AbstractWe {{argue that}} TeVeS-like vector fields appear {{naturally}} in certain string theory backgrounds involving D 0 -branes, {{as a result}} of the recoil velocity field, expressing the interaction of neutrino string matter with point-like branes. However, the similarity with TeVeS models is restricted only to the bi-metric properties of space–time, namely the difference of the background metric from the one felt by (some) matter fields interacting, in a topologically non-trivial manner, with the D 0 -brane defects. In our approach, neutrinos appear as dark matter candidates that could be “captured” by the D 0 -branes, {{as a result of}} stringy properties, and thus couple with the recoil-vector fields. Moreover, we argue in support of a possibly preferential rôle of neutrinos in inducing novel non-perturbative contributions to “vacuum” (dark) energy, in addition to their <b>ordinary</b> dark matter <b>contribution.</b> In fact, the rôle of neutrinos as providing substantial contributions to dark matter and dark energy components of the Universe, suggested by our approach, appears also to be necessitated by the need to reproduce the peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation spectrum, as claimed recently in the literature.

At ambient pressure, the system undergoes a first order metamagnetic transition at the critical field B_m = 0. 7 T from a paramagnetic ground state to a field-induced ferromagnetic state. The Hall signal is linear at low field and shows a step-like anomaly at the transition, with only little change of the Hall coefficient. The anomaly is sharpest at {{the temperature of the}} critical end point T_ 0 = 12 K above which the first order metamagnetic transition becomes a crossover. Under pressure B_m increases and T_ 0 decreases. The step-like anomaly in the Hall effect disappears at P_M ~= 1. 3 GPa and the metamagnetic transition is not detected above the quantum critical end point (QCEP) at P_Delta ~= 1. 7 GPa, B_m ~= 7 T.
