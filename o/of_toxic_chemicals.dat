5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E

5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L.

Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E

Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E

40|$|The use of Carbon Adsorption Technology for the {{development}} of a Prototype Portable Carbon Adsorption Unit was investigated. Carbon adsorption is a well-established treatment process. It is much safer and more economical in comparison with other conventional neutralisation techniques used for <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> spill clean up. This thesis begins by examining the nature <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> spills, the effects on the environment and the economy, and the currently available response methods and treatment technologies. The discussion then continues into the use of Carbon Adsorption Technology for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> spills. This is further developed by the conceptual design of a portable adsorption unit. Small scale column experiments were carried out in order to determine the flow configuration to be adopted by the unit. These experiments showed that an upflow configuration had greater potential to increase adsorption efficiency. From the conceptual design stage a full detailed design of the unit was done from which the unit was constructed. The constructed prototype portable adsorption unit was then evaluated by performing a series of adsorption experiments on a single column. The conclusion reached is that Carbon Adsorption Technology can be successfully applied on a small scale for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> spills...|$|R

40|$|Methodology for {{application}} of a Geographical Information System (GIS) to the distribution <b>of</b> selected <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in Lake Erie of the Great Lakes is proposed and described in detail in this paper. Seventeen different organic compounds were selected as <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> An integrated analysis was conducted utilizing a GIS system [...] SPANS. Concentration distributions for individual organic compounds were mapped in GIS by applying the spatial interpolation of point data. An overlay map <b>of</b> fourteen selected <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> was produced in GIS displaying an overall concentration pattern. On this overlay map different levels <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> concentrations in Lake Erie were clearly identified taking into consideration the fourteen chemicals. The {{results indicated that the}} distributions <b>of</b> the selected <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> displayed higher concentration primarily in the West Basin, near the Detroit River, of the lake. Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and Dieldrin which come from the sediments are the predominant organic pollutants in Lake Erie. The area analysis in GIS showed that 95. 60 % of the total water in Lake Erie displayed moderate and low concentration <b>of</b> the selected <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> This study shows that the proposed methodology for {{application of}} GIS is suitable for mapping the distribution of organic pollutants and for managing water quality in a large water body such as Lake Erie...|$|R
