40|$|Many commercialjet fuels have {{basically}} the same composition as kerosene, but they are made under more stringent specifications than those for <b>kerosene.</b> <b>Other</b> commercial and miltary jet fuels {{are referred to as}} wide-cut fuels and are usually made by blending kerosene fractions with lower boiling streams to include more volatile hydrocarbons. Because the chemical composition of kerosene and most jet fuels is approximately similar, except for the additives, kerosene used for aviation purposes is described in this monograph. The <b>other</b> uses of <b>kerosene,</b> e. g., as a fuel oil or lamp oil, are described in the monograph on fuel oils (Fuel Oil No. 1). Readily available commercial iluminating kerosene was the fuel chosen for early jet engines, largely because its use would not interfere with needs for gasoline, which was in short supply during wartime. The development of commercial jet aircraft following the Second W orld War centred primarily on the use of kerosene-type fuels. High-altitude flying requires fuel with a very low freezing-point; also, the fuel must be extremely clean (free of foreign matter), have a very low moisture content, burn cleanly (essentially free of smoke) and not cause corrosion of engine parts in prolonged service. Different types of engines used for different types of service require fuels with specifie chemical and physical properties, and individual specifications have evolved to meet these needs. As international jet service increased, fuels with similar characteristics had to be available worldwide. Thus, steps were taken to me et these needs, although sorne variation in specifications stil exists among different countries.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is on the {{modelling}} of evaporation and spray penetration for alternative fuels. The extension model approach is presented and validated for alternative fuels, namely, Kerosene (KE), Ethanol (ETH), Methanol (MTH), Microalgae biofuel (MA), Jatropha biofuel (JA), and Camelina biofuel (CA). The results for atomization and spray penetration are shown in a time variant condition. Comparisons {{have been made to}} visualize the transient behaviour of these fuels. The vapour pressure tendencies are revealed to have significant effects on the transient shape of the evaporation process. In a given time frame, ethanol fuel exhibits the highest evaporation rate and followed by methanol, <b>other</b> biofuels and <b>kerosene.</b> Ethanol also propagates the farthest distance and followed by methanol and kerosene. However, all biofuels have a shorter penetration length in the given time. These give penalty costs to biofuels emissions formation. The influences of initial conditions such as temperature and droplet velocity are also explored numerically. High initial temperature and velocity could accelerate evaporation rate. However, high initial temperature has resulted in low penetration length while high initial velocity produces contrasting results...|$|R

This research was conducted in the Laboratory of Agricultural Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Bengkulu and PT Sucofindo Bengkulu. It examined four types of biobriquet which are palm shell charcoal biobriquet (A), Empty fruit bunch (EFB) charcoal + coal biobriquet (B), EFB charcoal biobriquet (C) and non-choarcoling oil palm shells biobriquet (D). Observed variables are the calorific value, moisture content, ash content, levels of substance to fly, lighting time, burning time, Water Boiling Test (WBT), Control Cooking Test (CCT), intensity of smoke, and water content changes in packaging of biobriquet. The results showed that non-choarcoling palm oil shells biobriquet (D) is the best biobriquet based on performance quality. If it compared with kerosene, non-choarcoling palm oil shells biobriquet (D) is better than <b>kerosene,</b> while in <b>other</b> biobriquets, <b>kerosene</b> is still the best one. Based on other biobriquet tests (water content, calorific value, ash content, levels of substance to fly, lighting time, burning time and fuel consumption biobriquet), the best biobriquet that replaced kerosene is TKKS charcoal biobriquet (C), however, for the variables which compared with kerosene (burning time and fuel consumption), kerosene is still the best one.

40|$|Two {{questionnaire}} {{surveys of}} fuel use by low-income households in Zimbabwe {{were conducted in}} four small towns in 1994, and in these towns plus four larger towns in 1999. An energy transition from wood through kerosene to electricity occured (a) with rising household income, (b) with increasing electrification status among towns and (c) over time in the smaller towns, in spite of falling household incomes {{in two of the}} towns. Increasing discrepancy in the incomes of higher and lower income groups over time was not associated with greater divergence in their fuel choices. By 1999 electricity was used by almost all households in towns with good electricity supplies, while use of firewood in these towns was infrequent. However, even the wealthiest households continued to combine electricity with <b>other</b> fuels, usually <b>kerosene.</b> Electricity use by less affluent households is apparently limited to lack of connections in the home and by access to appliances, while fuel prices, which are subject to government subsidies and fell in real terms over 5 years, have been less important.

40|$|As {{worldwide}} petroleum supplies diminish {{and prices}} escalate, the aviation industry {{will be forced}} to consider relying on energy resources <b>other</b> than <b>kerosene</b> for its aviation fuel needs. Additionally, there is growing environmental concern regarding greenhouse emissions particularly as aircraft cause pollution in sensitive layers of the atmosphere. These are serious implications necessitating prudence in seeking alternative fuels sooner rather than later. Liquid Hydrogen (LH 2) combustion produces zero CO 2 emissions, very little NOx, and water providing a solution to sustain air traffic growth whilst preventing further atmospheric pollution. Hydrogen itself is abundant and can be produced from renewable sources meaning worldwide availability and sustainability permitting sustainable growth of aviation at high rates (typically 4 - 5 % per year). Despite these major advantages, there are compromises to be made. The low density fuel means ingenuity must be exercised to design an aircraft configuration which will accommodate a fuel volume more than four times that which would normally be required. Practical unconventional aircraft conceptual designs providing solutions to this problem are presented including estimates of performance, mass, and relative cost- and energy-effectiveness. To provide a means to produce, store and transport the fuel safely and efficiently, ground support operations have been systematically checked and the required airport infrastructure defined. Technical issues such as safety, airworthiness certification, environmental issues and system synergies are also discussed, and an outline plan is presented providing the R&D necessary to introduce LH 2 -fuelled civil aircraft into service. This Thesis proves that LH 2 has sufficient long term promise to justify more substantial R&D offering possible improvement in performance and engine reliability. The overall cost for a LH 2 aircraft are within reasonable values, and the requirement for new equipment to maintain and support LH 2 -fuelled aircraft is not extensive. Importantly LH 2 is at least as safe. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} infection primarily cough and rapid breathing {{is a common}} cause of morbidity and death among children under five years of age. According to The Directorate General of Communicable Disease Control, Ministry of Health, incidence of acute {{respiratory infection}} is 10 %. The National Household Health Survey indicated that 25. 2 % of infant deaths were caused by this disease. The objective of this analysis was to identify the determinant factors related to the occurence of cough with rapid breathing among children under five years of age. Data were taken from Indonesia Demographic Health Survey 1994. The dependent variable was children of under five years of age who were suffering from cough with rapid breathing and as independent variables were mother's education and activities, overcrowding of household occupants, house's wall materials, roof materials and use of kerosene stove. The result showed that among social factors, mother's education and participation in social organization {{were significantly associated with}} the morbidity of cough with rapid breathing. The risk of having cough with rapid breathing was 0. 7 less likely to occur among children born to mothers who participated in the social organization activities (OR= 0. 7) compared to mothers who did not participate in those activities. While, among environmental factors: overcrowding of household occupant, houses's wall material, use of kerosene stove were significantly associated with the occurance of cough with rapid breathing among children under 5 years of age. The overall analysis of environmental and social factors analysis showed that the risk of children whose mothers have low education and do not participate in social organization activity was 2 times higher than those born to mothers with higher education and participation in social organization activities.

30|$|We {{measured}} the household environmental deprivation {{of all the}} three domains—sanitation, drinking water and cooking fuel. A household {{is said to be}} poor in household environment if it does not have access to any two of the three household environmental conditions: sanitation, improved cooking fuel and improved drinking water. Access to toilet facility is considered improved sanitation, especially if the household uses the pit latrine, semi-flush (septic tank) latrine or flush toilet. Improved drinking water is defined as access to drinking water from piped tap, tube well, hand pump, covered well, rainwater and bottled water. Similarly, the household was considered not deprived of clean cooking fuel if it used improved chulla with chimney or fuel <b>other</b> than biomass (<b>kerosene,</b> LPG, etc.) for cooking. If the household does not use an improved source, it is referred to as unimproved. The inter-dimensional responsiveness of the three variables is shown in Appendix 1. In India, 29.7 % households had access to improved drinking water, sanitation and cooking fuel, 16.2 % had access to improved drinking water and sanitation only, 8.8 % had access to improved drinking water and cooking fuel only and 2.4 % had access to improved sanitation and cooking fuel only.|$|R
50|$|From Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 11, {{it appears}} that sugar-cane, indigo and poppy were grown {{in the land of}} this and {{adjacent}} villages during and before British rule. Between 1800 and early nineteenth century, the cultivation of indigo plants (Indigofera tinctoria, also known as I. sumatrana) and poppy (a flowering plant in the subfamily Papaveroideae of the family Papaveraceae) was more prevalent. Indigo dye made in India was exported by British to the Greeks and the Romans, where it was valued as a luxury product. Maharaja of Darbhanga abandoned the cultivation of indigo around 1901, because the fall in the price of the indigo dye, due to the competition of artificial substitutes, has caused many other factories to abandon. The chief feature of the indigo industry in Umaidpur regions, as compared with the other indigo-growing tracts in North Bihar, was the large area cultivated direct by the factories themselves in the Samastipur subdivision. The plant, when cut, was fermented in masonry vats and oxidized either by beating or by currents of steam. The dye thus precipitated was boiled and dried into cakes. Due to the fall in the value of indigo dye, the factories have taken to the growing of ordinary crops, sugar kanes. The principal exports were rice, indigo, gram, pulses, linseed, mustard seed, saltpetre, tobacco, hides, and ghee; and the principal imports were rice and <b>other</b> food-grains, salt, <b>kerosene</b> oil, gunny-bags, coal and. coke, European cotton piece-goods, and raw cotton. Gram, pulses, and oilseeds are chiefly sent to Calcutta, and rice and other food-grains to Saran and Muzaffarpur. The imports of food-grains came for the most part from Bhagalpur and Nepal, coal and coke from Burdwary kerosene oil from the Twenty-four Parganas, and salt and piece-goods from Calcutta.|$|R
30|$|First, we {{measured}} the signal (S) from the smooth glass disk {{and got the}} value S[*]=[*] 184 air as the ambient medium. Then the same disk was roughened as described above, and repeated the measurement and got S[*]=[*] 106 for the rough disk. Table 1 also shows the readings (S) obtained from the fuel samples with the prototype, which are averages of several measurements. The prototype was fixed on a stable stand during the measurements. The first column shows S after 1 minute of {{the introduction of the}} fuel drop over the rough glass, and the second column gives data after 20  min had elapsed, and the system was stable. The highest signal was obtained for kerosene and lowest for diesel oil. Both 1  min and 20  min data for the adulterated samples are consistent regarding the relative magnitude of measured S reading. However, by comparing the 1  min and 20  min data, it is evident that dynamic processes occur in {{the very beginning of the}} experiment as manifested in the rather high reading for 5 % adulterated diesel oil obtained after 1  min. This dynamic processes almost vanishes after 20  mins (thus when the oil has fully settled on the disk) which makes the data measured after 20  min more reliable. The accuracy of the reading is about ± 1  S units. The strength of the detected signal depends on the refractive index mismatch between the rough glass and the fuel interface where scattering of light occurs. Furthermore, the surface smoothness of the back surface of the fuel film-air interface has importance, namely it may imitate a plane/curved mirror or a rough surface depending on the liquid settling over the rough surface, and especially the contact angle. In case of diesel oil, due to its high contact angle, the surface of the fuel layer that settles on the roughened glass tends to assume similar shape as the surface undulations on the rough glass, and hence acts similar to the case of rough glass surface-air only, which yields the low S reading at 20  min. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>kerosene,</b> due its relatively low contact angle, tends to fill the valleys of the rough surface and forms more or less like a plane mirror yielding the relatively high S reading obtained at 20  min. This phenomenon resembles the case of the smooth glass for which S[*]=[*] 184. The signal strength depends simultaneously on both the surface roughness and the refractive index mismatch. The complexity of the phenomenon is obvious because the data for the adulterated samples shown in Table 1 are not following a simple rule that one might assume, namely increasing the percentage of kerosene should result in higher values of S. However, this is not the case, since wetting of the rough surface is an important factor that should be considered regarding the strength of the detected signal. Unfortunately, the behaviour of the contact angle of a liquid over a rough surface is rather a difficult and complex phenomenon that demands development of appropriate theory. This theory is assumed to be based on van der Waals interactions and the exploitation of the Hamaker constant, which depends on the permittivity of the glass and fuel, respectively. This permittivity is not the well-known conventional permittivity because it depends on purely imaginary wavelength (this can be calculated from a Kramers-Kronig relation [25] where the real-valued angular frequency is replaced by purely imaginary-valued angular frequency). This type of theoretical treatment is beyond the scope of this study. So far, we know that the measured signal is a delicate indicator of small change in the magnitude of the refractive index of the fuel and, in addition to even or uneven settling of the fuel, due to its viscosity, over a rough surface. Anyhow, from Table 1 it is evident that the experimental data for 5 – 15 % adulteration supports the validity of the measurement method with relatively high confidence. Naturally, the stable laboratory conditions favour the operation of the prototype, therefore more design and tests are necessary to further develop and optimise the portable prototype sensor to meet the quite challenging field conditions.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to perform a {{baseline}} energy survey to understand the existing energy demand and usepattern and to verify the feasibility of a small scale poly-generation project supported by renewable sources ofenergy (biogas based) in a rural area of Bangladesh. A poly-generation solution shall provide multiple outputservices of clean gas, electricity and arsenic free water supply. The project requires using animal dung oragricultural waste to produce biogas and electric energy. The study has analyzed the demand of domesticenergy and water of the village named ‘Matipukur’ in the Jessore district in Bangladesh. The study alsoconsidered available biomass feedstock and energy potential surrounding the village area, as well as the socioeconomicstatus of villagers. The case study included a door to door survey to collect relevant information. Three different economic groups in terms of income scale were investigated throughout the study to obtainbetter insight of the energy-water access situation, requirements and related problems in the village. Almost 98 % household of this village relies on biomass for energy due to limited access of modern fuel. Thevillage has various biomass potential in the form of animal dung, fuel wood and agricultural waste which can beused for cooking or serve as the basis for <b>other</b> energy carriers. <b>Kerosene</b> is used for lighting. Among thedifferent fuels, dung meets about 44 % of the total demand. The contribution of other fuels for domestic use is 24 % firewood, 22 % agricultural waste, and 2 % kerosene. The analytical observation found that the annualaverage energy demand of the village is 8. 45 GJ per capita. The share of average demand for cooking and 3 lighting energy is 8. 24 GJ per person/year and 0. 21 GJ per person/year respectively. The energy consumptionvaries within different income groups. This study has examined the income per capita, family size, education,agricultural land holding per capita, priorities of their annual expenditure etc. which have direct influence onthe fuel consumption pattern of the household. It could be observed that expenses on energy changes as theincome level increases. About awareness of biogas opportunities and willingness to provide feedstock for apoly generation project, the majority of households answered positively, that is, indicating that they wouldcontribute. Educated respondents showed more positive attitude. Regarding changing of traditional cooking,about 95 % of the respondents want to change to a more efficient and reliable cooking system to avoid healthand environmental problems associated with indoor biomass cooking. The study has revealed that only cow dung is not enough to produce clean energy according to demand so theco-digestion method is considered to producing biogas from various energy potentials (animal manure &agricultural waste). The poly-generation system could work with the scenario providing electricity and watersupply for the entire household and cooking gas is limited only for 2 / 3 rd household. Rest 1 / 3 rd household fromlow income group then could be supplied with improve cook stove to meet their daily cooking demand and tominimize indoor pollutions. It is observed that, majority of household has expressed their willingness toprovide raw materials for poly-generation plant though they are using.
