5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped near the center <b>of</b> <b>Fred,</b> and regeneration into a tropical cyclone {{was seen as a}} possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation <b>of</b> <b>Fred</b> became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Fred</b> roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E

40|$|FR 10024 is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis {{is greater than}} that of any of the cephalosporins developed to date. Indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter are resistant to FR 10024, as is true for the other cephalosporins. However, {{more than half of the}} strains of Enterobacter and Citrobacter tested were susceptible to FR 10024 at an inoculum of 106 cells/ml. A single subcutaneous injection <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 to mice with peritoneal infections due to S. aureus and several species of gram-negative bacilli gave a protective effect inferior to that of cefazolin but appeared to be superior to that of cephalothin. When given in two divided doses, however, the protective effect <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 was enhanced and almost equaled that of cefazolin. The serum levels and rates of urinary recovery <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 varied in different animal species. The mean peak serum level <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 in humans after a single intramuscular injection of 500 mg was two times higher than that of cephalothin. The serum half-life after intramuscular injections of 250 and 500 mg was slightly shorter than that of cephalothin. After receiving 250 mg <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 intramuscularly the urinary recovery rate was 87. 7 % in healthy volunteers. The biliary excretion rate <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 was particularly high. The 24 -h excretion <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 in rats was 63. 3 %, this being six to seven times higher than that for cefazolin, which has the highest biliary excretion of the other known cephalosporins. When FR 10024 was injected intramuscularly (20 mg/kg), it was found that the hepatic levels <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 in rats were the highest of all the cephalosporins, including cefazolin, but the levels <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 10024 in other tissues were not as high as those of cefazolin...|$|R

5|$|Hours after {{attaining}} {{its peak}} intensity, Fred began to weaken as clouds {{began to fill}} the eye. By this time, the hurricane was beginning to turn toward the northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened. Continued weakening took place as dry air started to erode convection along {{the southern edge of}} the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased. Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane. By September10, the mid-level circulation center was displaced from the low-level circulation center. On September11, the convective pattern <b>of</b> <b>Fred</b> had no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. Unrelenting shear and dry air finally took their toll on September12. By that time, no deep convection was associated with the main circulation <b>of</b> <b>Fred,</b> leaving the center fully exposed. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

40|$|FR 264205 {{is a novel}} {{parenteral}} 3 ′-aminopyrazolium cephalosporin. This study {{evaluated the}} in vitro and in vivo activities <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 264205 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The MIC <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 264205 at which 90 % of 193 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were inhibited was 1 μg/ml, 8 - to 16 -fold {{lower than those of}} ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IPM), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). FR 264205 also exhibited this level of activity against CAZ-, IPM-, and CIP-resistant P. aeruginosa. The reduction in the susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 264205 by AmpC β-lactamase was lower than that of CAZ, indicating a relatively high stability <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 264205 against AmpC β-lactamase, the main resistance mechanism for cephalosporins. Neither expression of efflux pumps nor deficiency of OprD decreased the activity <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 264205. No spontaneous resistance mutants were selected in the presence <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 264205, and the reduction in susceptibility to FR 264205 was lower than that to CAZ, IPM, and CIP after serial passage, suggesting that FR 264205 has a low propensity for selecting resistance. In murine pulmonary, urinary tract, and burn wound models of infection caused by P. aeruginosa, the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>FR</b> 264205 was superior or comparable to those of CAZ and IPM. These results indicate that FR 264205 should have good potential as an antibacterial agent for P. aeruginosa...|$|R
5|$|Throughout September10, Fred {{maintained}} Category 2 status before weakening to a Category 1 hurricane.
