5|$|The common {{production}} route <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> constitutes concentration <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> minerals; extraction <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> {{from the}} concentrate; purification of thorium; and (optionally) conversion to compounds, such as thorium dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> {{is a few}} tens of {{tons per}} year. The low demand makes working mines for extraction <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of production of other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer on the surface <b>of</b> <b>thorium.</b> The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires {{have been used in}} electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E

50|$|Protactinium-233 is {{also part}} <b>of</b> the <b>thorium</b> fuel cycle.

5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts <b>of</b> <b>thorium,</b> {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol <b>of</b> <b>thorium,</b> such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E
5|$|Non-radioactivity-related uses {{have been}} in decline since the 1950s due to {{environmental}} concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> and its decay products.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{is rather}} active chemically. Owing {{to lack of}} {{electrons}} on 6d and 5f orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless. At pH < 3, the solutions <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> salts are dominated by the cations 4+. The Th4+ ion is relatively large, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Å. As a result, thorium salts have a weak tendency to hydrolyse. The distinctive ability <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E

An extreme example is ekanite, (Ca,Fe,Pb)2(Th,U)Si8O20, which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to the thorium it contains.Si8O20|journal=Canadian Mineralogist|volume =20| pages =65–75|year= 1982}} ...|$|R

5|$|On Earth, thorium {{is not a}} rare element as was {{previously}} thought, having a crustal abundance {{comparable to that of}} lead and molybdenum, twice that of arsenic, and three times that of tin.

5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in {{the periodic table}} {{to the left of}} uranium and to the right <b>of</b> <b>thorium,</b> and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkalis.|$|E

40|$|A simple, {{novel and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method was described for simultaneous determination <b>of</b> uranium and <b>thorium.</b> The method {{is based on}} the complex formation <b>of</b> uranium and <b>thorium</b> with Arsenazo III at pH 3. 0. All factors affecting the sensitivity were optimized and the linear dynamic range for determination <b>of</b> uranium and <b>thorium</b> found. The simultaneous determination <b>of</b> uranium and <b>thorium</b> mixtures by using spectrophotometric methods is a difficult problem, due to spectral interferences. By multivariate calibration methods such as partial least squares (PLS), it is possible to obtain a model adjusted to the concentration values of the mixtures used in the calibration range. Orthogonal signal correction (OSC) is a preprocessing technique used for removing the information unrelated to the target variables based on constrained principal component analysis. OSC is a suitable preprocessing method for PLS calibration of mixtures without loss of prediction capacity using spectrophotometric method.

5|$|Thorium {{exists in}} very small {{quantities}} everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> and typically consumes three micrograms per day.

5|$|Thorium is {{odourless}} and tasteless. The chemical toxicity <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> is low because thorium and {{its most}} common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If thorium is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E

5|$|The decay {{products}} of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products is created {{as the result}} of the slow decay <b>of</b> <b>thorium,</b> a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters <b>of</b> <b>thorium</b> have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram.|$|E
