2500|$|In {{the third}} group, di Grassi set the fastest overall lap time of any driver at {{one minute and}} 23.026 seconds. He was {{followed}} by Buemi in second position, followed by the third-placed Rosenqvist. Vergne made an error en route to fourth place and Evans was the third group's slowest competitor. Carroll set the fastest lap time of the fourth group with Turvey in second. Tom Dillmann was third-fastest, ahead of the fourth group's slowest two drivers: Heidfeld and Engel. Heidfeld's slow form was caused by him sliding through the first turn and Engel appeared to have a similar problem to both Virgin cars. After group qualifying ended, the lap times set by di Grassi, Buemi, Sarrazin, Rosenqvist and Prost were fast enough to progress them to super pole. Di Grassi clinched his third pole position {{of the season with}} a time of one minute and 22.869 seconds, despite going four hundredths of a second slower in the first sector but regained time in the second sector. He was joined on the grid's front row by Buemi who recorded a lap 0.196 seconds <b>off</b> <b>di</b> Grassi's pace. Sarrazin took third place by judging the first braking point correctly and demonstrated strong rear-end grip despite [...] losing seven hundredths of a second through a driving error. Although he had minor oversteer moments which cost him time Prost secured fourth. Rosenqvist locked his rear brakes going into the first corner, losing him one second worth of time and mustered fifth. After qualifying ended, Buemi was demoted ten places on the grid because he changed his car's battery following his heavy second practice crash.|$|E

500|$|SM UB-15 was {{commissioned}} into the German Imperial Navy {{under the command}} of Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg on 11 April.

On 10 June, UB-15 sank the Italian submarine Medusa for a loss of 245 tons <b>off</b> Porto <b>di</b> Piave Vecchia in the Northern Adriatic. Like all Type UB I and U-10 class submarines, UB-15 was equipped with compensating tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of one of the [...] C/06 torpedoes. However, they did not always function correctly; when firing from periscope depth the boat could broach after firing or, if too much weight was taken on, plunge to the depths. When UB-15 torpedoed and sank Medusa, the tank failed to properly compensate, forcing all of the crewmen to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance and prevent the ship from sinking.|$|R

50|$|By 667 BC, Qi {{had clearly}} shown its {{economic}} and military predominance, and Duke Huan assembled the leaders of Lu, Song, Chen, and Zheng, who elected him as their leader. Soon after, King Hui of Zhou conferred the title of bà (hegemon), giving Duke Huan royal authority in military ventures. An important basis for justifying Qi's dominance over the other states was presented in the slogan 'supporting the king, and expelling the barbarians' (尊王攘夷 zun wang rang yi); the role of subsequent hegemons would also be framed in this way, as the primary defender and supporter of nominal Zhou authority and the existing order. Using this authority, Duke Huan intervened in a power struggle in Lu; protected Yan from encroaching Western Rong nomads (664 BC); drove <b>off</b> Northern <b>Di</b> nomads after they'd invaded Wey (660 BC) and Xing (659 BC), providing the people with provisions and protective garrison units; and led an alliance of eight states to conquer Cai and thereby block the northward expansion of Chu (656 BC).|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new methodological approach, Life Cycle Cost Assessment, {{is applied to}} {{evaluate}} the investment concerning a wind offshore plant location in Sicily East Coast, {{with the aim of}} highlighting the opportunity for distinguishing the single amounts of costs and of monetary and non-monetary benefits throughout the whole life cycle of the investment. In particular, we analyze economic quantification of the damage deriving from the construction of the system, divided into environmental impacts due to the construction of a single turbine and environmental impacts {{as a consequence of the}} construction of the foundations. The preliminary economic information for the LCCA analysis of the examined wind park offshore regards the management of the monetary capital initially invested, evaluation of the interest rate and other useful parameters, used to compute the present value of the cash-flows accrue during the project lifetime. In particular, the costs for the construction of the plant, disposal of material, operation and maintenance are evaluated. Moreover, the positive cash-flows are quantified as a consequence of the sell of wind energy and Renewable Energy Certificates. In this way, a more precise implementation of the LCCA in whatever type of structural investment is made possible, allowing the examination of all information useful for supporting the decision process.

60|$|What {{is going}} on in Maggiore {{is going on}} equally in all the other sub-Alpine lakes of the Po valley. They are being {{gradually}} filled in, every one of them, by the aggressive mud sheet. The upper end of Lugano, for example, has already been cut off, as the Lago del Piano, from the main body; and the piano itself, from which the little isolated tarn takes its name, is the alluvial mud fiat of a lateral torrent--the mud flat, in fact, which the railway from Porlezza traverses for twenty minutes before it begins its steep and picturesque climb by successive zigzags over the mountains to Menaggio. Similarly the influx of the Adda at the upper end of Como has cut <b>off</b> the Lago <b>di</b> Mezzola from the main lake, and has formed the alluvial level that stretches so drearily all around Colico. Slowly the mud fiend encroaches everywhere on the lakes; and if you look for him when you go, there you can see him actually at work every spring under your very eyes, piling up fresh banks and deltas with alarming industry, and preparing (in a few hundred thousand years) to ruin the tourist trade of Cadenabbia and Bellagio.|$|R
