5|$|In {{the next}} match, Men <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> {{challenged}} The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Although The Quebecers attacked Men <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel {{but did not}} get a pinfall. Men <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers' manager, Johnny Polo, to pull his wrestlers out of the ring.
