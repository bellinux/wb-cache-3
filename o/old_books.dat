25|$|Eventually, in 1874, Safirin {{was ordained}} a deacon for the Râmnic Diocese. He also resumed {{his work in}} teaching, {{encouraged}} {{to do so by}} bishop Athanasie Stoenescu and by his former students. From 1875 to 1889, he taught morals, liturgics and pastoral theology at the Râmnicu Vâlcea seminary. He began collecting <b>old</b> <b>books</b> for the Romanian Synod's library, and, in 1877, transported hundreds of books from Horezu Monastery to Bucharest.|$|E

Dee's library, a centre of learning outside the universities, became the greatest in England and attracted many scholars.|$|E

25|$|In 1897, a {{group of}} women in Alexandria formed the Alexandria Library Association. The leaders of the group were Virginia Corse, Mrs. William B. Smoot, and Virginia Burke. They petitioned the school board to open a {{subscription}} library in Peabody Hall, using the <b>old</b> <b>books</b> stored there. Permission was given and doors to the new subscription library opened on December 1, 1897. In 1902, the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of Prince Street while negotiations were underway for a permanent move to the Confederate Hall, located at 806 Prince Street. In May 1903, the library moved to the Confederate Hall, now known as the Robert E. Lee Camp Hall Museum, where it stayed for 34 years.|$|E
25|$|Konstantin Tolstoy and Anna Perovskaya's {{marriage}} was short-lived; they divorced in October 1817. With her six weeks old son, Anna moved first {{to her own}} Blistava estate in Chernigov Governorate, then to Krasny Rog, an estate belonging to her brother Aleksey Perovsky, who became Aleksey Konstantinovich's tutor and a long-time companion. Common knowledge has it that Pogorelsky's famous fantasy fairytale The Black Chicken or The People of the Underground was premiered at home, his young nephew being {{the only member of}} Pogorelsky's audience. It was under the latter's influence that Aleksey started to write poetry, as early as 1823, inspired by some <b>old</b> <b>books</b> he found at home. Aleksey had good teachers and at the age of six he fluently spoke French, German and English. Later he learned Italian as well.|$|E

5000|$|The superstitious tale {{surrounding}} <b>Old</b> <b>Book</b> {{is somewhat}} unusual among ghost stories {{in that it}} was reportedly witnessed by hundreds of people. The story goes that when <b>Old</b> <b>Book</b> died his funeral was attended by hundreds of patients and staff members who became witnesses to the ghostly phenomena that was about to transpire. As workers were attempting to lower {{what should have been a}} heavy casket they discovered that it instead felt empty. Suddenly, a crying sound echoed from the Graveyard Elm and everyone in attendance turned and looked, including Dr. Zeller, who later detailed Bookbinder and the surrounding events in his diary. They all claimed to have seen <b>Old</b> <b>Book</b> standing by the tree. They so believed it to be true that Zeller had the casket opened to ensure that <b>Old</b> <b>Book</b> still lay inside. As the lid was opened the crying ceased and <b>Old</b> <b>Book's</b> corpse was found undisturbed in the coffin. Days passed and the tree began to die. Several of the grounds crewmen tried to remove the Graveyard Elm or the [...] "crying tree", as it was also known. None were successful, citing the weeping emanating from the tree.|$|R
25|$|Part of the {{preparation}} involved the 1898 press publication of an appeal for <b>old</b> <b>books,</b> in which priests, teachers, professors {{and others who}} owned or knew of books printed between 1508 and 1830 were asked to inform the library of their existence and if possible loan them. The appeal {{was accompanied by a}} list of 621 titles of known books in this category; its author was particularly interested in books not on the list. Bianu's call was received with particular enthusiasm in Transylvania. His former teacher Moldovan emerged as a steady collaborator, not only facilitating access to his library and Cipariu's diocesan collection, but also providing valuable advice over the years. In his turn, Moldovan {{sent a letter to the}} province's Greek-Catholic clergy, asking them to supply information about the rare books in their parishes, and Bianu soon received 140 responses regarding books that were not on his initial list.|$|E
500|$|Collections of {{exemplary}} calligraphy, or tekagami (lit. [...] "mirror of the hands"), {{were created}} by cutting pages and sections of <b>old</b> <b>books</b> and scrolls of sutras, poems and letters, which were arranged in albums in a chronological order or according to social status. By the early-16th century, calligraphic connoisseurs of the Kohitsu house had practiced activities aimed at preserving ancient calligraphic works. Tekagami production appears to have started in the Momoyama period. These albums served as model books for calligraphy practice, the emulation of old styles, and as reference works for authentication in the growing antique market. Today, the selection of calligraphers, {{and the type of}} calligraphies in a tekagami, show the changing tastes in classical Japanese-style calligraphy over the years. Four tekagami containing works from the 8th century Nara to the 15th century Muromachi period have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
500|$|Weinstein {{said that}} this episode was an {{opportunity}} for him, Oakley, and Swartzwelder to [...] "go nuts" [...] with the [...] "Burns-ism". He said that they enjoy writing for characters such as Burns and Abe Simpson because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because they get to use thesauruses for looking up [...] "old time slang". For example, Burns answers the phone by saying [...] "Ahoy, hoy!", which was suggested by Alexander Graham Bell {{to be used as}} the proper telephone answer when the telephone was first invented. Burns' kitchen is full of [...] "crazy old-time" [...] devices and contraptions. For inspiration, Weinstein brought in [...] "a bunch" [...] of <b>old</b> <b>books</b> with designs of old kitchen devices. Oakley commented that the stuffed polar bear had always been in Burns' office, and they were excited to [...] "finally" [...] have a use for it.|$|E
