5|$|During {{subsequent}} {{discussions with}} a US consular official, Terrazas gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> had truly intended to abandon his rights as a US citizen when he applied for his certificate of Mexican nationality. The State Department eventually concluded {{that he had lost}} his US citizenship, a decision which Terrazas appealed, first before the State Department's board of appellate review, and subsequently to the courts.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{began to}} {{assemble}} his campaign team, setting up campaign offices and hiring {{his campaign manager}} {{in the beginning of}} 2015, fueling speculation that he was preparing to enter the Presidential race. In February 2015, Paul said he would make an announcement about whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would be running in late March or early April.|$|E
5|$|The film {{ends with}} Abraham's narration, {{examining}} {{the life that}} Silk has led, and he questions whether the consequences she faced from her actions were justified <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> concludes by realizing that {{we will never know}} if her way of life was right or wrong, or if we should judge her at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Tom, [...] "honest <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>he's</b> thriving; {{came down}} inside the coach, {{dressed in the}} {{distinguished}} foreigner style, with lavender kid gloves, and French boots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whether <b>he</b> {{wants to}} <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>he's</b> {{gone so far}} he'll have to. I've knowed {{for a long time}} she's been after him, but I didn't think she'd catch him just yet." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{timing of}} Frederick's {{death and the}} length of his reign are {{important}} topics among historians. The premature demise of Frederick III is considered a potential turning point in German history; and whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would have made the Empire more liberal if he had lived longer is still discussed.|$|E
5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California legislature along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt to remove him from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to get an answer from Steinmetz about whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> was a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year not decided whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party {{at the start of}} October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E

5000|$|Joe (Brandon McGibbon), Lucie's brother, is {{a junkie}} who's also usually hanging around Carlos {{waiting for his}} next fix. Thoroughly addled by his drug habit, he has a {{difficult}} time remembering anything — including, as he tells Carol at one point, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he's</b> gay.|$|R
5|$|In the episode, Jack's (Sean Hayes) {{talk show}} Jack Talk is {{completely}} revamped, after right-wing conservatives {{take over the}} gay network, OutTV. The new owners hire the ultra-conservative Amber-Louise (Spears) as Jack Talks new co-host, infuriating Jack. While Jack is deciding whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> will stand up to his new bosses, Karen (Megan Mullally) desires a baby of her own. After seeing Grace (Debra Messing) so happy about her pregnancy, Karen decides she wants a baby and offers to pay a surrogate (Sykes) to carry one for her.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> should compare his beloved {{to the summer}} season, and argues {{that he should not}} because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the Imperial leaders {{we see in}} {{the movies}} rule through a {{combination}} of fear and manipulation. I wanted to create something different: a commander who could lead through loyalty. The result was Thrawn, a tactical genius whose troops follow him willingly, and who will fight for him whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he's</b> watching over their shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the girl}} with her!" [...] exclaimed Jimmy mentally. [...] "She was no slouch either. They are the two best-looking girls I have seen in this town, {{notwithstanding}} the fact that whether one likes Chicago <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he's</b> got to admit {{that there are more}} pretty girls here than in any other city in the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{man might}} have been dangerous, but we need not fear any further trouble from him. There are two points worth noting, though I cannot tell whether they concern us <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He's</b> anxious to avoid {{anything}} that might damage his credit and make him leave {{this part of the}} country; and he expects some money before long. Can ye account for this?" ...|$|R
5|$|Maxwell {{made this}} {{announcement}} on a Saturday when most Football League clubs, including Oxford and Reading, were playing League fixtures. Oxford were playing away at Doncaster Rovers. Jim Smith {{learned of the}} announcement shortly before kick-off at Doncaster's Belle Vue ground from John Ley, a journalist with the Oxford Mail, who had heard the news from another newsman by telephone. Smith immediately called Maxwell to ask whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would be retained to manage Thames Valley Royals, {{and was told that}} he would be.|$|E
5|$|Named to the see of Canterbury in 735, Nothhelm was consecrated {{the same}} year. Pope Gregory III {{sent him a}} pallium in 736. He may have been {{appointed}} by Æthelbald, King of Mercia, whose councilor he was. Whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> owed his appointment to Æthelbald, Nothhelm {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who became Archbishop of Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, during a time of expanding Mercian influence. He held a synod in 736 or 737, which drew nine bishops; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington. A significant feature of this synod was the fact that no king attended, but yet the synod still rendered judgement in the ownership even without secular oversight, which was more usual.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 2012, Booker {{announced}} that he would explore running for the U.S. Senate seat that was then occupied by Frank Lautenberg in the 2014 election, ending speculation that he would challenge Governor Chris Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election. On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would run. Roughly one month after declaring his interest in running for the Senate, incumbent Lautenberg {{announced that}} he would not seek reelection.|$|E

5|$|On the November 28 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria interviewed then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, {{and asked him}} whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> {{thought he was going}} to be fired. He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E
5|$|Philip was {{now able}} {{to turn to the}} Illyrians, who were still occupying much of upper Macedon (whether agreed by treaty <b>or</b> <b>not).</b> <b>He</b> held an {{assembly}} of the army, gathered together a force of 10,000 men and 600 cavalry and marched into Illyria. Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing peace {{on the basis of the}} status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 men and 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|Ravenstahl had an {{unstable}} {{relationship with the}} Pittsburgh City Council throughout his term as Mayor, which included disagreements over the city budget. City Councilman Bill Peduto emerged as a political opponent of Ravenstahl's, with Peduto mounting a primary election challenge against Ravenstahl in 2007 before dropping out a short time later. Prior to the 2013 election, Ravenstahl had not held a fundraiser since 2009 and it was uncertain whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would seek another term; however, an undisclosed source indicated to local news outlet KDKA in September 2011 that Ravenstahl would run for re-election in 2013.|$|E

6000|$|<b>He</b> could <b>not</b> {{tell whether}} she was appeased <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> and <b>he</b> rather feared <b>not.</b> [...] "You don't ask why. And I asked you why at once." ...|$|R
5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight as to whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} general surgeon Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) {{performing}} a special surgery, {{and to her}} dismay, the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) is absent from the operating room. At Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is engaging in sexual activity with Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), while his wife, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is estranged. In the next room, Meredith begins arguing with her husband, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), over whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> should report the chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.)'s alcoholism to Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), the hospital's president.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> had an intention to commit it.|$|E

60|$|He {{studied the}} hazy bluish cloud for some time, {{but it was}} so many miles away that <b>he</b> could <b>not</b> be certain whether it was smoke <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> so <b>he</b> decided to ride over and make sure. None of the Naabs was in camp, and there was no telling when they would return, so he set off alone. He {{expected}} to get back before dark, but it was of little consequence whether <b>he</b> did <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> for <b>he</b> had his blanket under the saddle, and grain for Silvermane and food for himself in the saddle-bags.|$|R
