40|$|Rarity of macroinvertebrates {{can be used}} in {{assessing}} the ecological quality or conservation value of freshwaters. To select target species for nature conservation and to compare rarity or commonness between regions a classification of species distributions is needed. A distribution classification for Dutch macroinvertebrate taxa is presented. Frequencies of occurrence in surface waters of aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa were extracted from databases of water district managers and included data from 7608 sites from 1980 to 1998. Six classes were defined: very rare, rare, uncommon, common, very common, and abundant. The boundaries for these classes were established using the number of occurrences of the taxa and the expert <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> of water district managers and taxonomic experts. A distribution class was assigned to each of 1544 taxa, including 1514 species and 30 taxa on higher taxonomic level (groups, aggregates, genera). There were still many taxa for which the distribution was unknown due to their small size, their special habitat requirements, or identification difficulties due to immature animals and incomplete taxonomic information. The number of rare species differed between the 24 water management districts and depended on characteristics of the area, sampling strategy, and sampling intensity. The percentage of rare species differed between taxonomic groups. The definition of distribution classes and their boundaries can be applied at different scales, (e. g., water management district or national scale), which makes results comparable between scales and provides a broad application in bioassessment and conservation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe broadly {{consider}} {{the topic of}} ranking entities from surveys/opinions. Often, numerous ranks from different respondents are available for the same entity, e. g., a candidate from a pool, and yet <b>an</b> averaging <b>of</b> those ranks may not serve the purpose <b>of</b> identifying <b>a</b> consensus candidate. We first consider a risk-adjusted paradigm for ranking, where the rank {{is defined as the}} average (mean) rank plus a scalar times the risk in the rank; we use standard deviation as a risk metric. In case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> candidate being ranked either on the basis <b>of</b> <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> selection <b>committee's</b> members or on social interactions in a social network such as Facebook, risk-adjusted ranking can result in selecting a consensus candidate who/which does not secure the best average rank, but is acceptable to <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> the <b>opinion</b> providers. Second, we present an approach to develop the margin of error in Likert surveys, which are increasingly being used in data analytics, where the responses are on a five-point scale, but one is interested in a binary response, e. g., yes-no, agree-disagree. Computing the margin of error in Likert surveys is an open problem...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{evaluated}} the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole compared with standard azole therapy (SAT; fluconazole or itraconazole) {{for the prevention}} of invasive fungal infections (IFI) and the reduction of overall mortality in high-risk neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The perspective was that of the Spanish National Health Service (NHS). Methods A decision-analytic model, based on a randomised phase III trial, was used to predict IFI avoided, life-years saved (LYS), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; incremental cost per LYS) over patients' lifetime horizon. Data for the analyses included life expectancy, procedures, and costs associated with IFI and the drugs (in euros at November 2009 values) which were obtained from the published literature and <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expert <b>committee.</b> <b>A</b> probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PAS) was performed. Results Posaconazole was associated with fewer IFI (0. 05 versus 0. 11), increased LYS (2. 52 versus 2. 43), and significantly lower costs excluding costs of the underlying condition (€ 6, 121 versus € 7, 928) per patient relative to SAT. There is an 85 % probability that posaconazole is a cost-saving strategy compared to SAT and a 97 % probability that the ICER for posaconazole relative to SAT is below the cost per LYS threshold of € 30, 000 currently accepted in Spain. Conclusions Posaconazole is a cost-saving prophylactic strategy (lower costs and greater efficacy) compared with fluconazole or itraconazole in high-risk neutropenic patients. </p...|$|R

Outside director ratio, presence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> audit <b>committee</b> and remuneration of board members turn out to be negatively associated with the probability of corporate failure, While CEO duality is positively related with the likelihood of corporate failure.

40|$|BACKGROUND—A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} usefulness of the SimpliRED D-dimer test, arterial oxygen tension, and respiratory rate measurement for excluding pulmonary embolism (PE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE).  METHODS—Lung scans were performed in 517 consecutive medical inpatients with suspected acute PE over a one year period. Predetermined end points for objectively diagnosed PE in order of precedence were (1) a post mortem diagnosis, (2) a positive pulmonary angiogram, (3) a high probability ventilation perfusion lung scan when the pretest probability was also high, and (4) the unanimous <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adjudication <b>committee.</b> Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was diagnosed by standard ultrasound and venography.  RESULTS—A total of 40 cases of PE and 37 cases of DVT were objectively diagnosed. The predictive value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> negative SimpliRED test for excluding objectively diagnosed PE was 0. 99 (error rate 2 / 249), that of PaO 2 of ⩾ 80 mm Hg (10. 7 kPa) was 0. 97 (error rate 5 / 160), and that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> respiratory rate <b>of</b> ⩽ 20 /min was 0. 95 (error rate 14 / 308). The best combination of findings for excluding PE was a negative SimpliRED test and PaO 2 ⩾ 80 mm Hg, which gave <b>a</b> predictive value <b>of</b> 1. 0 (error rate 0 / 93). The predictive value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> negative SimpliRED test for excluding VTE was 0. 98 (error rate 5 / 249).  CONCLUSIONS—All three of these observations are helpful in excluding PE. When any two parameters were normal, PE was very unlikely. In patients with a negative SimpliRED test and PaO 2 of ⩾ 80 mm Hg a lung scan is usually unnecessary. Application of this approach for triage in the preliminary assessment of suspected PE could lead to <b>a</b> reduced rate <b>of</b> false positive diagnoses and considerable resource savings. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsData on {{the optimal}} use of {{conventional}} therapies in Crohn's disease are lacking in guidelines. An educational programme {{was established to}} explore questions raised in clinical practice and to provide practical answers. MethodsTelephone interviews with 96 gastroenterologists and <b>a</b> web survey <b>of</b> 1370 gastroenterologists identified 26 key questions. Ten questions were taken {{forward to the next}} stage based on the <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> International Steering <b>Committee.</b> Draft answers to the questions were prepared from available evidence following a literature search. The draft answers were debated in national meetings of participating countries (n= 36) and voted on using a standard scoring system. Revised answers went forward to an international meeting and were debated and voted on using the same methodology. Final answers were developed, based on evidence and clinical experience of the participants. ResultsEvidence on corticosteroid and immunomodulator use such as dosage, timing and duration, choice of drug or regimen, and safety is scarce. Key points of the answers included the importance of: identifying patients with poor prognosis; early intervention with optimal doses of immunomodulators; avoiding prolonged or repetitive corticosteroid therapy; achieving corticosteroid-free remission; achieving a balance between clinical benefit and safety when intensifying or prolonging therapy or combining different agents; re-evaluating therapy at appropriate time points; and considering the role of biomarkers and mucosal healing. ConclusionsThe answers to 10 key questions were based on available evidence and clinical experience of programme participants. It is hoped they will be of practical use in everyday gastroenterology practice...|$|R
