25|$|If {{none of the}} six schools chosen {{accept the}} pupil, the Ministry of Education will work towards finding a school based on {{proximity}} and location, rather than academic excellence of the school, without consulting the student. This makes proper selection of the six choices important.

25|$|Game theorists use the Nash {{equilibrium}} {{concept to}} analyze {{the outcome of the}} strategic interaction of several decision makers. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.|$|E

In 1921, it entered into an economic and monetary union with Belgium, the Union Économique Belgo-Luxembourgeoise (UEBL). During most of the 20th century, however, Germany remained its most important economic partner.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{concentrates on}} consumer <b>choice</b> and <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> current modelling approaches to capture <b>the</b> underlying behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual decision-makers. <b>The</b> standard assumption <b>of</b> a rational utility maximising individual {{and its implications}} for observed behaviour are examined and demonstrated empirically to be incompatible with actual consumer <b>choices.</b> In particular <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> situation, and its various components, are found to be major determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> outcomes. Both <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> outcome and as well as the process leading to the decision are found to vary with <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> set. Framing effects are also seen to lead individuals to indicate different preferences depending on <b>the</b> setting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision task. Models that allow for these deviations from the behaviour predicted under standard modelling assumptions are developed and <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> such models is discussed and illustrated utilising two major consumer surveys for the Dutch population. ...|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} two non-fiction books {{released}} that chronicle the Hellraiser franchise. The first, released on 21 May 2004, was published by Titan Books and titled The Hellraiser Chronicles. Written by Peter Atkins and Stephen Jones, with a foreword by Clive Barker, The Hellraiser Chronicles {{is a collection of}} production photographs, design sketches, excerpts from the scripts, and interviews with the cast and crew. The next book, The Hellraiser Films And Their Legacy, was released by McFarland & Company on 27 November 2006; it was written by Paul Kane, and features foreword by Pinhead actor Doug Bradley. Hellraiser Films collects the production history of all eight films, their spin-offs, as well as how the series relates to popular culture. The book provides an in-depth look at the film characters, and interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> those characters make in the film. Hellraiser Films also provides a brief look at the fan short film No More Souls.|$|E
25|$|She {{finds out}} that Zachariah is {{actually}} alive and {{has been living in}} the jail of the Seahawk with the help of another sailor, Keetch, who supplies him with food. With Zachariah's help, she escapes the prison and plans to steal the captain's guns and usurp his title. Instead, she finds the captain waiting for her. The Captain says that he has been waiting for her all along. Keetch had told him everything. Jaggery reveals that he himself had killed Hollybrass, but claims that he had been threatened and {{had no choice but to}} murder him. Not wanting to lose his title, he blames the death on Charlotte. He tells her she has three choices. She can 1) take the muskets and disrespect her family and herself by killing Captain Jaggery, 2) put on her proper clothing and wait at the docks like a proper lady, forgetting all about the fights, and begging him for mercy in front of the crew, or 3) consent to be hanged. She refuses to take any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choices,</b> and flees the cabin. Jaggery attempts to kill her in front of the crew, but falls off the ship's bowsprit to his death while chasing Charlotte, despite Charlotte's awkward attempt to save him. Zachariah tells the crew that a new captain must be named, and that it should be Charlotte, because she has done what they could not. She is elected by the crew, but serves primarily as a figurehead due to her lack of experience. Zachariah openly exercises the powers of the captain, after she insists on it. They land in Providence, Rhode Island, 12 hours later.|$|E

AllMusic's Fred Thomas {{in his review}} of PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone stated: [...] "The ever-winding path of John Frusciante's solo career is a confusing one to say the least. [...] The thing is, there's no doubt that Frusciante is sincere in his expression with this incredibly warped music. There's no easy explanation for these sounds, no context for a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> he makes with the rapid-fire style changes and jarring production choices that come one after another after another on almost every song here." ...|$|E

Both sides recognized that more people had voted against responsible government than for it, which encouraged the CA and discouraged its opponents, although the RGL and EUP now became allies. The confederates widely publicized the Roman Catholic Archbishop E. P. Roche's strong opposition to confederation, and persuaded the Loyal Orange Association to advise Protestants to resist Catholic influence. The CA also denounced anti-confederates as anti-British and pro-republican, and called confederation with Canada [...] "British Union". Anti-confederates responded that [...] "Confederation Means British Union With French Canada".|$|E
