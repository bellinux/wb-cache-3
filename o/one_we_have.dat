Prior to this, the police department of Kohala had gained a reputation for corruption. After his appointment, the new deputy sheriff became popular in the community for his competency, [...] "strict attention to his duties, {{as well as his}} thorough integrity". During his tenure, news reports claimed [...] "he is acknowledged by all law-loving residents to be by far the best <b>one</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had for many year, He is not to be bought, and is no respecter of persons or position, especially when the interest of the public are concerned." [...] However, he did not hold this position for long and was succeeded by J. W. Moanauli. By 1885, White had moved to Hilo where he had begun practicing law.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool midfielder Vladimír Šmicer {{was looking}} forward to playing a part in the final: [...] "Everyone wants to play in the final, I'm no different. I was just happy to be on the pitch against Auxerre because I didn't know even the day before whether I'd be fit enough after my injury problem. I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well this week and be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, but there is still plenty to play for. We have not said this is a bad season, let's forget about it and {{concentrate}} on the next <b>one,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, we have to be honest, we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Historian James J. Weingartner sees a {{connection}} between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. [...] "he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands." [...] On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: [...] "The only language they seem to understand is the <b>one</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been using to bombard them.

2500|$|Borrowing themes from Mesopotamian mythology, but {{adapting}} {{them to the}} Israelite people's {{belief in}} one God, the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch (the series of five books which begins with Genesis and ends with Deuteronomy) was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the Jahwist source) and was later expanded by other authors (the Priestly source) into a work very like the <b>one</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> today. The two sources can be identified in the creation narrative: [...] is Priestly and [...] is Jahwistic. The combined narrative is {{a critique of the}} Mesopotamian theology of creation: Genesis affirms monotheism and denies polytheism. Robert Alter described the combined narrative as [...] "compelling in its archetypal character, its adaptation of myth to monotheistic ends".|$|E
2500|$|On 8 July 2008, the U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{before her}} arrival in Tbilisi said that {{granting}} NATO Membership Action Plan to Georgia would help resolve the Abkhaz and South Ossetian problems. The statement caused a negative outcry in Moscow: the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov responded, during {{his meeting with}} the de facto Abkhaz president Sergei Bagapsh, that Georgia's NATO integration process [...] "may undermine the conflict resolution" [...] process. Rice arrived in Georgia on 9 July. [...] "Frankly, {{some of the things}} that Russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region," [...] she said in Tbilisi. [...] "Georgia is an independent state. It has to be treated like <b>one.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> said that both Georgia and Russia need to avoid provocative behavior."

In January 2016, Gunn revealed that he had chosen an additional Bowie song to appear in the film, but had cut the original scene it was featured in. The inclusion would have made Bowie the only artist to be featured on both mixtapes. With Bowie's death that month, Gunn hoped {{to find a way to}} include the chosen song somewhere else in the film as a [...] "fair and appropriate" [...] way to honor him, as Bowie was one of Gunn's idols.

2500|$|Cardinal de Talleyrand was at {{the height}} of his {{influence}} and power. In September 1362, after the death of Pope Innocent VI, the College of Cardinals was divided (according to Jean Froissart) into two factions, one supporting Guy of Boulogne and the other Hélie de Talleyrand. The two competitors were strong enough to ensure that the other could not be elected with the two-thirds majority required by Canon Law. In the end, the Cardinals had to go outside the College of Cardinals, and a compromise candidate was elected, Abbot Guillaume Grimoald of S. Vincent in Marseille, who was Legate of the Apostolic See in the Kingdom of Sicily, and was not present at the Conclave. He was not even a cardinal. The decision was taken perhaps on September 28, but it was not made public until the day after the arrival of Abbot Grimoald in Avignon, 31 October. [...] After he had accepted election, Grimoald was proclaimed Pope Urban V. [...] Shortly after the election, Cardinal Talleyrand is said to have remarked to one of his familiars, [...] "Now we have a pope. We honored other ones out of duty, but this <b>one</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to fear and revere, because he is powerful in word and deed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In France, Le Chatelier {{translated}} Taylor's {{work and}} introduced scientific management throughout government owned plants during World War I. This influenced the French theorist Henri Fayol, whose 1916 Administration Industrielle et Générale emphasized organizational structure in management. In the classic General and Industrial Management Fayol wrote that [...] "Taylor's approach {{differs from the}} <b>one</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> outlined in that he examines the firm from the 'bottom up.' He starts with the most elemental units of activity – the workers' actions – then studies the effects of their actions on productivity, devises new methods for making them more efficient, and applies what he learns at lower levels to the hierarchy..." [...] He suggests that Taylor has staff analysts and advisors working with individuals at lower levels of the organization to identify the ways to improve efficiency. According to Fayol, the approach results in a [...] "negation {{of the principle of}} unity of command." [...] Fayol criticized Taylor's functional management in this way: In Shop Management, [...] Taylor said « ... the most marked outward characteristics of functional management {{lies in the fact that}} each workman, instead of coming in direct contact with the management at one point only, ... receives his daily orders and help from eight different bosses... these eight were (1) route clerks, (2) instruction card men, (3) cost and time clerks, (4) gang bosses, (5) speed bosses, (6) inspectors, (7) repair bosses, and the (8) shop disciplinarian. » Fayol said that this was an unworkable situation and that Taylor must have reconciled the differences in some way not described in Taylor's works.|$|E
