5|$|By {{this time}} the ship was in poor shape and {{required}} an extensive refit; the work last from 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich, London shipyard of Harland and Wolff. After working up, she {{was assigned to the}} 14th Escort Group for anti-submarine operations in the Western Approaches. Duncan conducted convoy escort and anti-submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool. The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May and was transferred to Barrow on 9 June. She approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Duncan was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards, but demolition was not completed until 1949.|$|E
25|$|Water, {{along with}} grassy vegetation, is another major {{component}} of the Przewalski horse's diet. A study, conducted by K.M. Scheibe {{and a team of}} scientists, documented the water consumption of 12 female Przewalski horses that were living in a semireserve over a course of 17 months. Their results show that, on average, a Przewalski horse drinks between 2.4 and 8.3 liters <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> which is less than the amount of water a domestic horse drinks daily. In fact, the Przewalski horse that consumed the most water in the study drank on average 8.6 liters <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> This almost equals the lowest amount of water consumption for a domestic horse which is 8.4 liters a day.|$|E
25|$|In October 2008, The Sun {{newspaper}} reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million liters (6.2 million US gal) <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a 'dipper well' {{in each of}} its stores, but this is often required by governmental public health code.|$|E

25|$|The {{main source}} of water in Hong Kong was China. A {{contract}} was signed in 1964 when Hong Kong purchased 15,000 gallons <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> drawn from China's East river. When political turmoil came to Hong Kong, China turned off the supply periodically and caused water shortages. Rationing was imposed by the government.|$|E

25|$|Water is {{essential}} for life. The amount of drinking water required is variable. It depends on physical activity, age, health issues, and environmental conditions. It is estimated that the average American drinks about one litre <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> with 95% drinking less than three litres per day. For those working in a hot climate, up to 16 liters a day may be required. Water makes up about 60% of weight in men and 55% of weight in women. Infants are about 70% to 80% water while the elderly are around 45%.|$|E
25|$|On Thursday 13 June the Field Ambulance {{packed up}} and moved onto the Jerusalem road at about 18:00 {{travelling}} on the very steep up-hill road till 23:00; on the way picking up four patients. They rested till 01.30 on Friday, before going on to arrive at Jerusalem, about 06:00, then on to Bethlehem, and two miles beyond, reached Solomon's Pools by 09:00. Here the three huge rock-lined reservoirs, built by King Solomon about 970 BC to supply water by aqueducts to Jerusalem, were still in reasonable repair as were the aqueducts which were still supplying about 40,000 gallons <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|For {{the nearly}} two decades of Napoleon III's reign, and for a decade afterwards, most of Paris was an {{enormous}} construction site. To bring fresh water to the city, his hydraulic engineer, Eugène Belgrand, built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the Vanne River in Champagne, and a new huge reservoir near the future Parc Montsouris. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic metres <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> He laid hundreds of kilometres of pipes to distribute the water throughout the city, and built a second network, using the less-clean water from the Ourq and the Seine, to wash the streets and water the new park and gardens. He completely rebuilt the Paris sewers, and installed miles of pipes to distribute gas for thousands of new streetlights along the Paris streets.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} I set out again. It was five-and-thirty miles to Ecija, {{but a new}} high road {{stretched}} {{from place to place}} and I expected easy riding. Carmona stands {{on the top of a}} precipitous hill, round which winds the beginning of the road; below, after many zigzags, I saw its continuation, a straight white line reaching as far as I could see. In Andalusia, till a few years ago, there were practically no high roads, and even now they are few and bad. The chief communication from town to town is usually an uneven track, which none attempts to keep up, with deep ruts, and palmetto growing on either side, and occasional pools <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> <b>A</b> <b>day's</b> rain makes it a quagmire, impassable for anything beside the sure-footed mule.|$|R

25|$|The Science and Engineering {{building}} {{received a}} LEED Silver rating in March 2009. SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB {{was made to}} reflect 92 percent of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building and therefore, reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also pre-cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, {{as well as a}} drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape reduces water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> that is used to flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I {{constructed}} many lakes to {{meet the}} town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. In the earlier half of 20th century, the Nandi Hills waterworks was commissioned by Sir Mirza Ismail (Diwan of Mysore, 1926–41 CE) to provide a water supply to the city. Currently, the river Kaveri provides around 80% of the total water supply to the city with the remaining 20% being obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta reservoirs of the Arkavathi river. Bangalore receives 800 millionlitres (211 millionUS gallons) <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> {{more than any other}} Indian city. However, Bangalore sometimes does face water shortages, especially during summer- more so in the years of low rainfall. A random sampling study of the Air Quality Index (AQI) of twenty stations within the city indicated scores that ranged from 76 to 314, suggesting heavy to severe air pollution around areas of traffic concentration.|$|E
25|$|Greater than 75–95% of {{colorectal}} cancer occurs {{in people with}} little or no genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male gender, high intake of fat, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day. Drinking 5 glasses <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> is linked to a decrease in the risk of {{colorectal cancer}} and adenomatous polyps. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer. Some strains of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe. 25 to 80% of people with Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Seroprevalence of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.|$|E

25|$|In 1802 Napoleon {{built the}} Ourcq canal which brought 70,000 cubic meters <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to Paris, while the Seine river {{received}} up to 100,000 {{cubic meters of}} wastewater per day. The Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the {{public awareness of the}} necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and waste water in a better and healthier way. Between 1865 and 1920 Eugene Belgrand lead the development of a large scale system for water supply and waste water management. Between these years approximately 600 kilometres of aqueducts were built to bring in potable spring water, which freed the poor quality water to be used for flushing streets and sewers. By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified. Further, the lack of sewage treatment left Parisian sewage pollution to become concentrated downstream in the town of Clichy, effectively forcing residents to pack up and move elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 1975, Aquino {{announced}} that he was going on a hunger strike, a fast to the death to protest the injustices of his military trial. Ten days through his hunger strike, he instructed his lawyers to withdraw all motions he had submitted to the Supreme Court. As weeks went by, he subsisted solely on salt tablets, sodium bicarbonate, amino acids, and two glasses <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Even as he grew weaker, suffering from chills and cramps, soldiers forcibly dragged him to the military tribunal's session. His family and hundreds of friends and supporters heard Mass nightly at the Santuario de San Jose in Greenhills, San Juan, praying for his survival. Near the end, Aquino's weight had dropped from 54 to 36 kilos. Aquino nonetheless was able to walk throughout his ordeal. On May 13, 1975, on the 40th day, his family and several priests and friends, begged him to end his fast, pointing out that even Christ fasted only for 40 days. He acquiesced, confident that he had made a symbolic gesture. But he remained in prison, and the trial continued, drawn out for several years. On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission charged Aquino along with NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad. The death sentence was never carried out as Aquino's death sentence was commuted by President Marcos in May 1980.|$|E
