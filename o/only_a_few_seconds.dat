5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had lasted <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> when the glider {{crashed into a}} wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a}} few hops.|$|E
5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front wings of stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E
5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b>|$|E

5|$|The player {{does not}} receive any {{explicit}} guidance {{on how to}} play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabre Wulf graphics fill the screen with a minimal user interface consisting of the current game score, number of lives left and a high score meter on the top row. Sabreman can eat orchid power-ups, which bloom for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> to turn the colour of the orchid and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. invulnerability, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player's controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and extra lives scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases include a two-player mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.|$|E
5|$|While The Legend of Korra was {{produced}} in the United States and therefore not a work of Japanese animation ("anime") in the strict sense, The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, romance, fear, and death) {{and the quality of}} its voice acting as well as the visual style {{are similar to those of}} leading anime series such as , Bleach or Trigun. A notable difference from such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs; to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korras openings and endings last <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.|$|E

25|$|No pilot error or {{aircraft}} deficiency was found. Flight {{mass and}} centering were within norms. Owing to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While {{they did have}} some reasonable doubts {{as to whether or}} not the runway was occupied, these were allayed by the approach controller's reassurances. The crew had <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft. They were thus absolved of any blame.|$|E
25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or baking powder, starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to smart cards, which are simple devices performing a single function, personal computers are doing many things at once. Thus, {{it is much}} more difficult to perform electromagnetic side-channel attacks against them, due to high levels of noise and fast clock rates. Despite these issues, researchers in 2015 and 2016 showed attacks against a laptop using a near-field magnetic probe. The resulting signal, observed for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> was filtered, amplified, and digitized for offline key extraction. Most attacks require expensive, lab-grade equipment, and require the attacker to be extremely close to the victim computer. However, some researchers were able to show attacks using cheaper hardware and from distances of up to half a meter. These attacks, however, required the collection of more traces than the more expensive attacks.|$|E

25|$|Germany's {{opponent}} in the semifinals was Italy. The Italians had the better chances to score but Lehmann made several spectacular saves, including one in extra time where he dived out of goal to intercept an Italian player who had broken loose from the defence, punching the ball clear with his fist and temporarily knocking out the Italian in the process. He allowed two goals within a minute of each other with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> remaining in extra time, which put Italy into the World Cup final. The retiring Oliver Kahn was given the honour of starting in the third place play-off match, an offer made by Lehmann himself. Kahn was made captain for that game due to the injury to Michael Ballack. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 for the third place (bronze) medals.|$|E
25|$|Angina pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|E
25|$|Buemi gained two {{positions}} {{before entering}} the pit lane, with the driver voicing his anger over the radio. Because the loose bodywork part had fallen off, Buemi was stationary in his pit stall for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> and rejoined the track in 19th, ahead of teammate Prost. D'Ambrosio battled Abt and passed him to move into eighth place but the German driver regained the position after driving through the next few turns on the circuit. Heidfeld overtook Bird to take over third position and Dillmann started to battle the British driver. At {{the front of the}} field, Rosenqvist and Vergne pulled clear from Bird and Heidfeld. With both e.Dams drivers running {{at the rear of the}} pack, the team faced a predicament of pushing to secure the Teams' Championship or consolidate Buemi's hold on the driver's title. After ten laps of the race had been completed, Vergne mounted an attack on Rosenqvist for the lead as the French driver having more electrical energy to use than the Mahindra car ahead of him but could not find any space to move in front. Heidfeld and Bird backed themselves into Dillmann's path, prompting him to apply his brakes early and allowed López to challenge for third position. Heidfeld then slowed, enabling Bird and his teammate López to overtake him.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland {{lost to the}} Giants for {{the second}} time in the sixth game of the season at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Giants again managed to stymie the Browns' passing game, but {{employed}} a different strategy from the one they used in three weeks before. Instead of dropping their defensive ends into coverage to handle Cleveland's receivers, New York allowed single coverage on the receivers and had its ends rush Graham, giving him less time to find his men open. Graham lost 71 yards being tackled while dropping back to pass. A fumble by Graham early in the game was recovered by the Giants, leading to New York's first score, a 22-yard field goal. The Browns scored a field goal midway through the second quarter after going for it on fourth down at midfield and getting help from an interference penalty. Tony Adamle recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and the Browns drove into New York territory as time ran out in the first half. Groza kicked a field goal, putting the Browns ahead 6–3. After Cleveland kicked off to New York with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> left in the half, returner Jim Ostendarp let the ball roll to his own one-yard line and the Browns recovered the live ball. Graham then ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. The Giants dominated in the second half, scoring a touchdown on their second drive and adding another in the fourth quarter to win the game, 17–13. Graham was held to just 118 yards of passing on 10 completions. Cleveland defensive end Len Ford suffered a severe injury to his face during the game and had to be taken to the hospital. He sat out the remainder of the regular season and had to have his mouth wired shut so it could heal.|$|E
25|$|Continued {{investment}} in players followed in successive seasons, and results began {{to match the}} upturn in player quality. City reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, their first major final in over thirty years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-final, {{the first time they}} had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. They defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup, the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. In the same week, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time since}} 1968 with a 1–0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City passed Arsenal for third place in the Premier League, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage. Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, with the club beginning the following season in commanding form, including beating Tottenham 5–1 at White Hart Lane and humbling Manchester United by a 6–1 scoreline in United's own stadium. Although the strong form waned half-way through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their bitter rivals with only six games left to play, an unprecedented slump by the previous champions allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team in the relegation zone, they still managed to fall a goal behind by the end of normal time, leading some of United's players to finish their game celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time - including one scored almost five minutes after normal time had elapsed - resulted in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, City's first in 44 years, and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier League history. The game was only made all the more notable for former player Joey Barton's sending off, where he committed three separate red card-able incidents on three different players in the space of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> resulting in a 12-game ban which effectively forced him to leave English football.|$|E
