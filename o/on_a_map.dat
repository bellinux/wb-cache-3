5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map.</b> There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E
5|$|Having {{long been}} {{agricultural}} land, in the 18th century {{the town was}} divided up into five farms: Tanyard, Partington, Oakfield, Broadoak, and Elm. Hale Chapel was established in Hale Barns by Nonconformists in 1723 on what is now Chapel Lane. It underwent alterations around 1880. The chapel is the earliest place of worship in either Hale or Hale Barns and is a Grade II* listed building, one of only nine in Trafford. It also houses an eighteenth-century pulpit and nineteenth-century stained glass. In 1740, a school was founded by the Unitarian minister of Hale– a time when education was a rare commodity– and can be seen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of 1800 along with a tithe barn, two inns, five farms, four cottages, the school house and school rooms.|$|E

5|$|In England, the {{scientist}} Francis Galton {{heard of this}} work, {{as well as the}} pioneering weather forecasts of Robert Fitzroy. After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Pedro Montañés {{passed through}} the site and left {{graffiti}} with his name and the year 1752. Archives have revealed {{that he was a}} Spanish captain who visited the site on 14 August of that year. La Blanca was first documented {{in the early years of}} the 20th century. In 1905 explorer Teoberto Maler identified visible architecture at the site and marked it as El Castillito <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the region. Raymond E. Merwin visited La Blanca in 1913 on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He photographed the site and renamed it as Chac-Ha. At this time the site appears to have been covered in dense vegetation, making exploration of the ruins difficult and resulting in only a brief description of the acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E

5|$|Maclean (1972) further {{suggests}} that the Dutch simply made a cartographical error, and confused Hirta with Skildar, the old name for Haskeir island much nearer the main Outer Hebrides archipelago. Quine (2000) hypothesises that the name is derived {{from a series of}} cartographical errors, starting {{with the use of the}} Old Icelandic Skildir ("shields") and appearing as Skildar <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> by Nicholas de Nicolay (1583). This, so the hypothesis goes, was transcribed in error by Lucas J. Waghenaer in his 1592 charts without the trailing r and with a full stop after the S, creating S.Kilda. This was in turn assumed to stand for a saint by others, creating the form that has been used for several centuries, St Kilda.|$|E
5|$|Mobius Final Fantasy is a {{role-playing}} game {{designed for}} mobile phones. The player controls the game's protagonist Warrior of Light (Wol) while navigating Palamecia. Players can customize settings, graphical quality, and adjust controls for their dominant hand. During local navigation {{on the field}} map, the player taps a location <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> and the character travels to that location. In some self-contained areas, the player can directly control the character. Along with standard navigation, the player can navigate the game world using a fast-travel system, progressively unlocked as the player progresses through the story. Many of the features in the game, such as the leveling system and exploration, {{are similar to those}} from previous home console Final Fantasy games.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions taken}} in earlier {{parts of a}} map can affect later parts of that mission, {{triggering}} scripted changes in objectives and enemy behavior: for instance, when a castle is raided, the neighboring castle will have troops ready to swarm attackers. After each action, a player character gains experience points, along with raising their health and magic meters, and giving random boosts to their statistics such as strength and agility. They may also learn new skills, including skills which are unique to specific characters. If they are defeated in battle, all characters are subject to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the game. If the army's leader is killed, the map must be restarted. Victory is achieved when the map's objective has been completed, which can vary from defeating an enemy force to capturing specific points <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{main feature}} {{of the game is}} focused <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of Europe and western Russia, which {{displays}} accurate terrain such as mountain ranges, major cities, borders and all military forces belonging to each side. The game also features an arcade sequence which involves shooting down enemy units in order to secure combat bonuses; this gameplay mode, however, can be ignored by changing the game's settings. If the arcade sequences are turned on, the player will be notified to choose a battle on the map. Depending on the area chosen, an illustration of a battle commencing in countryside or a city is presented with various forms of military equipment including aeroplanes, helicopters and tanks. The player must shoot down and destroy enemy units using their cursor, in similar style to Missile Command. The outcome of the arcade sequence will affect the game; performing poorly will result in severe losses throughout that round.|$|E
5|$|There were gardens at Aberdour Castle from {{at least}} 1540. The terraced garden dates {{from the time of}} the 4th Earl of Morton, who succeeded in 1553, and {{comprises}} four broad L-shaped terraces. At the bottom of the terraces was an orchard, laid out in 1690, and recently replanted. The extent of the terracing was only rediscovered following excavations in the 1970s, after parts of the garden had been in use as a market garden. Archaeological investigations were undertaken between 1977 and 1980, to determine whether the lower terraces, which were depicted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of 1740, had indeed existed. Although the foundations of the terraces were found, the remains could not be precisely dated, but are thought to have been constructed in the second half of the 16th century. The high retaining walls were rebuilt in 1981, and the terraces were laid with grass, since the excavations had not revealed any evidence of historic planting schemes.|$|E
5|$|The street plan of {{the town}} still {{reflects}} the medieval layout of the town. Most shops lie along Fore Street with courts behind them linked by alleyways. The length of the high street reflects the prosperity of the town from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century {{when it was a}} centre of the cloth trade. The street plan is still fundamentally the same as shown <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of 1663, with a wider area at the North end where markets were held, roads to Tiverton and Ponsford and a small lane leading down to a mill (now known as Lower Mill). This map has only two buildings with roofs coloured blue (conventionally meaning they were of slate) – St Andrew's church and the Walronds. There are two grade I listed buildings in Cullompton: the fifteenth century parish church (St Andrew's) and the Walronds at 6 Fore Street. There are also seven grade II* listed buildings and ninety grade II listed buildings. The centre of the town is a conservation area – {{the only one in the}} Mid Devon area. Hillersdon House, a Victorian manor house is near to the town centre and within the parish.|$|E
