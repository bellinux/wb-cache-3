Europe, as a region, still has the highest share in world trade in services, with more than 43. 3 % of exports and more than 30. 7 % of imports in 2011. The intern services market is less integrated than that of material goods, situation demonstrated on the one hand, by the ratio of intra-EU <b>exports</b> and <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports,</b> shown by comparison for goods and services.

40|$|This {{analysis}} sheds {{new light}} on the gender-balance of the employment opportunities supported by <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports.</b> This is done using a Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) model with the information provided by the WIOD-World Input-Output Database (Timmer et al., 2015) and the EXIOBASE- 3 database (Stadler et al., 2017). On that basis we show that in 2011 almost 12 million women in the EU had jobs thanks to the exports of goods and services {{to the rest of the}} world. However the data also reveals that a gender gap to the disadvantage of women persisted as these jobs represented only 38 % of the total employment in the EU supported by exports to the rest of the world. The analysis suggests that such gender gap is largely due to the concentration of female employment in the less export-oriented sectors, notably in services. JRC.

40|$|Dual-use {{items are}} goods and {{technologies}} with civil and military uses. In several countries, including the EU Member States, {{the export of}} dual-use goods is controlled by national licensing processes {{as a measure of}} non-proliferation. Dual-use items relate to a variety of generally high-tech goods falling in diverse categories: nuclear materials, facilities and equipment; special materials and related equipment; materials processing; electronics; computers; telecommunications and information security; sensors and lasers; navigation and avionics; marine; aerospace and propulsion. In connection to the ongoing review of the EU export control policy, currently based on Regulation 428 / 2009 and amendments, it is of relevance to know the size of the EU dual-use sector and have a method to assess, in a quantitative way, the impact of export controls on trade. Because the dual-use trade draws from a range of industrial sectors, no single trade statistics exists today to portrait this cross-cutting sector ‘as a whole’. In this report we estimate the total intra- and <b>extra-EU</b> Dual-Use <b>Export</b> Value (DUEV). DUEV is meant to be an indicator of the relevance of the dual-use sector to the EU economy. To estimate DUEV, lower and upper bound values are first derived based on license data provided by EU Member States and on COMEXT export data available from Eurostat. The bounds are then combined in a single estimate to DUEV. As a result, DUEV is estimated to be at most 3. 3 % of the total intra- and <b>extra-EU</b> <b>export</b> in 2013, equivalent to about 150 Billion of Euros. The report explains the method used to derive these figures by qualitative reasoning on quantitative data. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
40|$|Austria's {{accession}} to the European Community {{has created a}} new framework against which to evaluate Austria's foreign trade sector. The EU 15 is the world's largest exporter. In 1994, exports of the EU, including trade within the EU, accounted for two fifths of world trade, twice as much as the trade share of the USA (11. 8 percent) and of Japan (9. 7 percent) taken together. Even excluding intra-EU trade, which in 1994 amounted to one fourth of world trade, the EU is the world's largest exporter with a share of 20 percent. In the 1990 s though, the EU suffered market losses. Foreign trade of the EU is heavily concentrated: the three largest countries (Germany, France, United Kingdom) account {{for more than half of}} total exports; the largest six countries account for more than four fifths (81 percent) of EU exports. About one fourth of EU exports originate in Germany alone. The EU countries conduct the major part of their foreign trade with each other. Intra-EU exports total 63 percent of total exports of the EU; intra-EU imports total 61 percent of total imports of the EU. With a share of 65 percent, Austria's integration into the EU is slightly above average. Even though Austria is one of the smaller EU countries, countries which as a rule are intensively engaged in trade, the relation of exports to GDP was only 22. 7 percent, slightly above the EU average (22. 3 percent). The EU's exports to countries outside the EU (<b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports)</b> amounted to 8. 4 percent of GDP. This figure was lower than that for Japan (8. 6 percent) and slightly higher than that for the USA Thus, foreign trade plays approximately the same role in all the regions of the triad. 75 percent of Austria's intra-EU imports originate in those seven EU countries which are considered likely candidates for the EMU. In both France and Germany, this figure is only 55 percent. These two countries, therefore, have the utmost interest in maintaining strict exchange rate discipline in the envisaged "EMS II". Austria is mainly concerned with Italy's participation in the EMU, because in that case the share of EU trade not jeopardized by exchange rate fluctuations would rise above 90 percent. The importance of the developing countries as a market for EU exports rose substantially during the early 1990 s. Sales to the non-OPEC countries advanced very rapidly, while OPEC's share in exports declined. 17. 7 percent of total <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> or almost half of the exports to the developing countries go to the Far East; the corresponding figures are 7. 5 percent for the Middle East, 8. 1 percent for Africa, and 5. 7 percent for Latin America. In Austria, 22 percent of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> were destined for the developing countries; Austria also had a relatively strong position in the OPEC (6 percent). Manufactured products dominate foreign trade of the EU: this group accounts for 84. 1 percent of total exports, and 78. 8 percent of total imports, with machinery and transport equipment constituting the most important items. The share of semi-manufactures (mostly low-grade goods used in manufacturing) in exports is substantially smaller in the EU (18. 2 percent) than in Austria (28. 9 percent); steel accounted for only 3. 5 percent of total EU exports (Austria 5. 3 percent); the figures for textiles are 3. 1 percent (4. 1 percent). As far as intermediary products are concerned, agricultural products with a share of 10 percent are the most important export items. Außenhandel der EU.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 1995 Austria's foreign trade {{can be divided into}} two separate areas: trade with the 14 other EU member states and trade with all other countries in the world. In 1994, intra-EU trade accounted for 65 percent of Austria's exports and 68 percent of imports. These shares exceed those of other EU member states. Thus, Austria's economy was closely linked to that of the EU through foreign trade even before accession to this group of countries. Intra-EU trade is favored vis-a-vis trade with third countries in a variety of ways: the abolishment of border controls, the elimination of variable import levies and tariffs on agricultural products and food, liberalization of public procurement, the abolishment of rules of origin and the simplification of technical provisions. Moreover, there is a tendency within the EU to impose anti-dumping tariffs on goods imported from successful competitors abroad. Suppliers from third countries are disadvantaged vis-a-vis sellers from within the EU at various levels. This {{was one of the reasons}} for Austria's decision to join the EU. In the recent past, Austria's trade with countries outside of the EU (extra-EU trade) has developed somewhat more dynamically than trade with EU countries (intra-EU trade) : in 1993 <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> rose by 3. 6 percent, while intra-EU exports declined by 7. 8 percent; in 1994 the figures were 11. 8 and 8. 4 percent. The difference can be attributed mainly to cyclical factors. After accession to the EU, Austria's intra-EU trade ought to grow faster than extra-EU trade thanks to more favorable conditions within the EU. This is likely to be the case in agricultural trade. As far as trade with manufacturing products is concerned, the impact of the improvement in trade relations might only be felt after some delay. Extra-EU trade (35 percent of total exports, 32 percent of total imports) might for analytical purposes be broken down into two parts: trade with countries "associated" with the EU (the remainder of the EFTA countries, the six countries of East-Central Europe with Europe agreements, as well the ACP countries), and trade with third countries. The countries of East-Central Europe associated with the EU accounted for 26 percent of Austria's <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> and 18 percent of extra-EU imports. The EFTA countries contributed 20 percent and 14 percent, respectively, to Austria's extra-EU trade. From Austria's perspective, the grouping of the overseas departments (DOM/TOM, e. g., the Canary Islands, Madeira), as well as the ACP countries (Africa, the Caribbean region, the Pacific region) is new. The latter group consists mainly of the former colonies of the founding members of the European Common Market. These countries enjoy special access to the markets of EU countries. At present, foreign trade with these countries is negligible, but might gain in importance in the future. Among the not associated third countries are the developing countries overseas (with a share of 22 percent in extra-EU trade) and the not associated countries of Eastern Europe (8 percent). Industrialized countries overseas account for 19 percent of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> and 33 percent of extra-EU imports. Austria's accession to the EU means that the compilation of statistics on trade with EU countries can no longer be based on data as recorded at the border but must be compiled at the firm level based on value added tax returns (Intrastat). Statistics on trade with third countries (Extrastat) will be gathered as before at the border. The changeover to the new system is creating substantial difficulties. For some time no data on foreign trade will be available; this comes at an inopportune time when the current account is turning negative. At the moment it is still unclear how the system of national accounts might be used to substitute for the foreign trade statistics.

Antidumping protection benefits non-exporters active on the protected market by raising their domestic sales, but hurts exporters of similar products as the protected ones. Export sales of protected firms fall by almost 8 % {{compared to a}} relevant control group of unprotected firms. This effect more than doubles for firms that are global, i. e. firms with foreign affiliates. Measured at the product-level, <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> of goods {{protected by}} antidumping fall by 36 % while exports to target countries fall {{by as much as}} 66 % following protection. Protection also has an effect on the extensive margin, by raising the probability to start exporting for firms that were initially nonexporters. Existing exporters face a higher probability to stop exporting during protection. Finally, we find that the productivity of exporters falls while that of non-exporters rises during antidumping protection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to gauge the main trends in the {{evolution}} and structure of the EU trade in goods, mainly after 2004, starting from a quantitative analysis and comparing trends in the trade in goods with trends in the trade in services, where necessary. We focus on the trade of the EU- 27 as a group, but we stress the differences and similarities between the old member states (EU- 15) and the new member states (NMS) as well. Structured in seven parts, the paper reveals several noteworthy conclusions. Firstly, the EU remains the world trade leader; nevertheless, its market shares have been diminishing in the recent years, both in the export and import flows, due to a complex of factors. Secondly, the NMS shares in the EU trade flows have been growing; yet, the NMS shares in the exports and imports of the EU- 27 remain at a very low level. Besides, the normalized trade balance of the NSM, compared with that of the EU- 15 underlines the different competitive advantages of the two groups. Thirdly, the trade deficit of the EU- 27 continues to deepen (the extra-EU trade deficit tripled in 2004 - 2008); however, there are significant differences between the manufactures trade balance (with large surpluses) and the commodities trade balance (with a deficit that doubled between 2004 and 2008). Fourth, the paper points out that the <b>extra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> and the imports are dominated by the manufactures; however the share of manufactures in the import flows is much smaller than that in the export flows. Finally, the present analysis traces evidence of the major impact of the global financial and economic crisis on the EU trade flows and the first signs of recovery.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the economic impact}} on Austria of three possible new EU free trade agreements: (1) an EU-US agreement; (2) an EU-Canada agreement; and (3) an EUArmenia/Georgia/Moldova agreement. This is done with a computational model of the global economy. The trade agreements are modeled as a mix of preferential tariff reductions and reductions in non-tariff measures that affect both goods and services. The primary impact follows from NTM reduction rather than tariff reductions. Of the three agreements, a potential agreement with the US {{is by far the}} most important. This follows from the size of the US economy. The US accounts for roughly one-quarter of <b>extra-EU</b> Austrian <b>exports.</b> Overall, the combined impact of the FTAs studied is positive.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the foreign trade {{performance}} of the new member countries in their {{first five years of}} membership (and, with two years for Bulgaria and Romania). The first part of the statistical survey focuses on trade developments supporting and/or defying some key issues of trade theory. Trade creation vs. trade diversion, trade balance between more and less developed countries of the same free trade area as well as differences in the commodity structure of exports due to different levels of development constitute the main pillars of the analysis. It is found that trade creation can be clearly identified in the dynamic growth of trade among the new member countries. On the contrary, the share of the old member countries experienced a partly dramatic decrease. For several reasons, growing <b>extra-EU</b> <b>export</b> orientation characterized most new members, a key challenge to traditional theories. Trade balance between new and old members points to a diversified picture. However, in case of the more developed new members that could attract substantial amount of foreign capital into their export-oriented industries, foreign trade balance with the EU- 15 registers relevant trade surplus, in line with giving priority to getting incorporated into the global division of labour through the international activities of transnational companies (including, of course, of Europe-rooted ones). Mainly for the same countries, neither the commodity pattern of exports seems to support traditional theoretical hypotheses. However, both regarding trade balance and commodity structure, the new member countries of the EU can be classified into rather different groups. The second part analyzes the impact of the crisis on trade developments with special regard to the Visegrád- 4 countries plus Slovenia. Following a statistical survey illustrating short-term trends, special attention is paid to the emerging protectionist efforts in selected countries of the EU- 15, {{as well as to the}} export-related impact of depreciated national currencies in some Central European member states. Finally, the vulnerability of selected new member states (concerning volume, structure, geographic orientation) characterized by clear and successful export-orientation strategies in the past two decades is addressed, with special reference to the possibility or desirability of any radical change in the catching-up-based and export-oriented growth pattern. ...|$|R
