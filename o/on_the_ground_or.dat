5|$|Mourning doves sunbathe or rainbathe by lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> {{on a flat}} tree limb, leaning over, {{stretching}} one wing, {{and keeping}} this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. Dustbathing is common as well.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} vocalizations are used and, like other corvids, grey jays may mimic other bird species, {{especially}} predators. Calls include a whistled quee-oo, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces {{a series of}} harsh clicks to signal a threat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>or</b> a series of repeated whistles to indicate a predator in the air.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells {{located at the}} genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E
5000|$|Posters on Prisontalk {{stated that}} prisoners and their {{families}} could walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>or</b> enjoy food cooked on a grill. One forum member describing herself as a mother of a prisoner stated that visitors were not searched and that the prison was [...] "a country club compared to others".|$|R

5|$|The attic {{floor above}} the second floor, {{which is not}} open to the public, {{contains}} some garret rooms that would always have been secondary bedchambers. It is likely that in the 16th and 17th centuries {{they would have been}} occupied by the senior servants; the lower servants would have slept in any vacant corner or space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> basement floors.|$|E
5|$|The life {{habits of}} Ypresiomyrma {{would have been}} {{similar to that of}} extant Myrmeciinae ants. Colonies nested in the soil or in trees, making them an {{arboreal}} nesting species. Workers were most likely solitary foragers, foraging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> onto low vegetation and trees while preying on arthropods or consuming nectar. Workers most likely did not recruit or lead nestmates to food sources, nor did workers lay down pheromone trails. Ypresiomyrma ants most likely used their large eyes to find prey and for navigational purposes.|$|E
5|$|These are noisy {{birds with}} a clear {{whistling}} kee-wee-ooo call given <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> in flight. Quarrelling birds also have a harsh repeated kee. In flight, the beating wings produce a dull sound. The calls {{of males and females}} show differences in structure and an acoustic analysis on 59 captive birds demonstrated 100% accuracy in sexing when compared with molecular methods.|$|E
50|$|Cellphones {{and other}} devices with a camera are forbidden. Physical public {{displays}} of affection or sexual advances are frowned upon and will cause the perpetrator to be expelled from the sauna.

5|$|These birds forage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> in vegetation; {{they also}} fly {{down from a}} perch to capture food. While foraging, they {{frequently}} spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over {{the purpose of this}} behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in groups <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies {{appear in the}} spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare. Its small size and dark color makes it easy to overlook.|$|E
5|$|Various customs arose {{around the}} writing of a kvitel. It is {{considered}} a bad omen if a kvitel falls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>or</b> if sand is placed on it. (Sand was commonly used as a drying agent for ink on paper.) Care is taken to write the kvitel without any mistakes, as Hasidic Jews believe that kvitelach contain deep secrets.|$|E

50|$|These birds forage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> under <b>or</b> near {{thickets}} or in low vegetation. They mainly eat seeds, {{insects and}} berries, and {{are attracted to}} bird feeders.|$|R
5|$|When {{disturbed}} at its roosting site, {{an angry}} barn owl lowers {{its head and}} sways it from side to side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. A defensive attitude involves lying flat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> crouching with wings spread out.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>or</b> placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E

5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> submerged in water.|$|E
5|$|Echolocation {{probably}} first derived in bats from communicative calls. The Eocene bats Icaronycteris and Palaeochiropteryx had cranial adaptations suggesting {{an ability}} to detect ultrasound, implying they used echolocation. This {{may have been used}} at first mainly for communicative purposes or for mapping out their surroundings during their gliding phase, only being used for hunting insects while foraging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> among vegetation. After the adaptation of flight was established, it may have been refined to target flying prey. Bats may have evolved echolocation through a shared common ancestor, in which case it was then lost in the Old World fruit bats, only to be regained in the horseshoe bats; or, echolocation evolved independently in both the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera lineages.|$|E
5|$|Hyndum repandum is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus. The fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> in leaf litter in both coniferous and deciduous forests. They can also grow in fairy rings. Fruiting occurs from summer to autumn. The species is widely {{distributed in the}} northern temperate zone, {{and is one of}} the most common of the tooth fungi. It has been recorded from Australia, Europe, northern Asia, and North America. In Europe, it has been listed as a vulnerable species in the Red Data Lists of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany; Sweden lists it as being of Least Concern.|$|E

50|$|These {{are often}} at beach clubs, or {{adjacent}} to swimming pools at resorts and hotels, and in private gardens. These are often small rooms with ground-level porches that have chairs and tables for relaxation and dining {{as well as}} storage for chairs, umbrellas and surfboards or other beach or pool playthings. Urban luxury hotels, such as the Mondrian Hotel and Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles, have semi-permanent ensembles of cabanas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> a rooftop terrace that offer outdoor privacy, and can acquire some social cachet.|$|R
5|$|Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex {{share similar}} {{behaviours}} with other Myrmeciinae relatives. Prionomyrmex may have foraged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> onto trees and low vegetation, feeding on nectar and arthropods. Nothomyrmecia workers, however, drink hemolymph from the insects they capture, and the larvae are carnivorous. It {{is not known}} if the ants were active during the day or night, but Nothomyrmecia is a nocturnal ground forager that prefers very cold nights. Both ants have large compound eyes, relying on their vision for prey and navigational purposes. Due to their primitive and simplified social life, workers of both genera do not recruit others to food sources or leave down trail pheromones, suggesting that both these ants are solitary foragers. Prionomyrmex ants were hosts to female stylopid parasites. Predators are unknown for both ants.|$|E
5|$|Nuptial flight occurs after rain {{for several}} days, taking place between summer and mid-autumn (December to March). The males and virgin queens emerge from their nest, and unlike other species who mate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> climb onto nearby trees or {{branches}} to fly off from, the reproductive alates will fly from the nest. Recorded nuptial flights usually {{took place on}} hilltops. M. nigriceps queens are not known to seal up their entrance during colony foundation, unlike other Myrmecia species such as M. regularis. Workers can live exceptionally long, with an average lifespan of 2.2 years; maximum longevity in workers varied from 2.1 to 2.4 years.|$|E
5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can be placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> on a tee, and a holder {{may be used in}} either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.|$|E
50|$|Laughing gulls {{breed in}} coastal marshes and ponds in large colonies. The large nest, made largely from grasses, is {{constructed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> 3 <b>or</b> 4 greenish eggs are incubated {{for about three}} weeks. These are omnivores like most gulls, and they will scavenge as well as seeking suitable small prey.|$|R
