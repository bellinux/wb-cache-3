5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frontier.</b> The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> sees it that way.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} again in 1809, {{settling}} on Bayou Teche in Louisiana before finding {{a permanent home}} in Opelousas in 1812. The Bowie children were raised <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> and even as small children were expected to help clear the land and plant crops. All the children learned {{to read and write}} in English, but James and his elder brother Rezin could also read, write, and speak Spanish and French fluently. The children learned to survive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> and how to fish and run a farm and plantation. James Bowie became proficient with pistol, rifle, and knife, and had a reputation for fearlessness. When he was a boy, one of his Indian friends even taught him to rope alligators.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790. Among the {{farmers in the}} region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash was always in short supply <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontier,</b> so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.|$|E

He was also elected to the Virginia House of Delegates.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{essential}} problem of large tribal groups <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> remained {{much the same}} as the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries, the 3rd century saw a marked increase in the overall threat, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome's ability to meet it declined. The Carpi and Sarmatians whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the Goths and likewise the Quadi and Marcomanni that Rome had defeated were replaced by the greater confederation of the Alamanni.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was {{compelled}} to cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also increased their military presence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontier,</b> building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues.|$|E

5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur.

The {{majority of people}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.|$|E
