5|$|In 1983, Carter {{began dating}} Dori Pierson, {{whom he had}} met through a cousin of hers {{who worked with him}} at Surfing Magazine. Pierson's {{connections}} at Walt Disney Studios led to chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg hiring Carter <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> contract. Carter began writing television films for the studio, penning The B.R.A.T. Patrol in 1986 and Meet the Munceys in 1988. These scripts led to Carter being associated with contemporary youth comedy at the studio, and although he enjoyed the work he felt that his real strengths and interests lay in serious drama instead.|$|E

5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E

5|$|The {{expanded}} and altered version of The Welsh Opera, The Grub-Street Opera, was first rehearsed in May 1731, {{but it never}} ran on stage. It was printed and exists in a complete printed format, {{and it is possible}} that it was not performed because of government intervention. Its original printing was done without Fielding's consent, and it is uncertain as to when Fielding's official version of the play was printed. The plot focuses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> love story but with characters that exhibit less than virtuous characteristics. The title pokes fun at the Grub Street Journal and also links to the theme within the plot of attacking theatre in general.|$|E

5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} delay line memory, the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device's temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode ray tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> CRT, the first random-access digital storage device. The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical storage device, by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point {{operations per second}} (FLOPS) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware. In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS, the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> x86 CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform some complex functions in one floating point operation which otherwise needs multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences. Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise {{a large majority of}} Folding@home's measured computing performance.|$|E
5|$|In general, the {{objective}} events follow a set organizational outline {{from year to}} year. Language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections {{which tend to be}} poems or excerpts from short stories. The art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information. Economics remains fairly static; 85% of the material focuses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> course of macroeconomics and microeconomics and the remaining 15% focuses on the year's topic. For example, in 2005 the themed material covered the economics of ancient Egypt and Rome. Science and social science reflect the season's theme. Unlike the other events, there is no basic information that carries over. The math curriculum has varied as well, occasionally dropping and adding new subjects or shifting the weight of particular subjects.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too {{has always had}} a close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was adorned with a lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects the word for king (shah) is pronounced as sher, homonymous with the word for lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence for the use of a lion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E

5|$|The Jiuzhang suanshu {{was perhaps}} the most {{groundbreaking}} of the three surviving Han treatises. It is the first known book to feature negative numbers, along with the Bakhshali manuscript (200 CE?– 600 CE?) of India and the book of the Greek mathematician Diophantus (fl. 3rd century) written in about 275 CE. Negative numbers appeared as black counting rods, while positive numbers appeared as red counting rods. Although the decimal system existed in China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BCE), the earliest evidence of a decimal fraction (i.e. the denominator is a power of ten) is an inscription <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> volume-measuring vessel dated 5 CE and used by the mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (46 BCE– 23 CE). Yet the first book to feature decimal fractions was the Jiuzhang suanshu, as a means to solve equations and represent measurements. Gaussian elimination, an algorithm used to solve linear equations, was known as the Array Rule in the Jiuzhang suanshu. While the book used continued fractions to find the roots of equations, Liu Hui built on this idea in the 3rd century when he increased the decimals to find the cube root of 1,860,867 (yielding the answer 123), the same method used in the Horner scheme named after William George Horner (1786–1837).|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E
