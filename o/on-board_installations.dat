40|$|AbstractHealth {{estimate}} of loco mechanical transmission components usually implies the <b>on-board</b> <b>installation</b> of fit-to-purpose devices {{and the use}} of specific protocols for data acquisition. In this paper the authors present a different approach, based on the acquisition and post-processing of the stator currents of an induction traction motor, easy to be measured and already monitored by standard on-board automation systems. The use of a PWM inverter for the electrical drive of the traction unit introduces harmonics in the stator currents, and an analogous effect is due to the presence, for instance, of a bearing fault. For this reason, the authors have paid great attention to the choice of a reliable de-noising technique for the removal of the harmonic content due to the electronic conversion unit. The so cleaned stator current time series have been then processed by the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method, in order to identify some current “features” able to predict motor condition. On the basis of a huge amount of data deriving from a laboratory test campaign, the author present and discuss in the paper the results of their study...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper deals with the application of different sensor technologies for fatigue crack damage monitoring of metallic helicopter fuselages. A test programme has been conducted, consisting of seven fatigue crack propagation tests on aluminium panels (skin with riveted stringers) representative of the rear fuselage of a helicopter. Electrical crack gauges and comparative vacuum monitoring sensors have been used locally to monitor propagating cracks. A network of optical fibre Bragg gratings is presented as a valid possibility for distributed monitoring (based on strain field dependence on damage), alternative to consolidated electrical resistance-based strain gauges. A Smart Layer based on piezoelectric transducers that emit and receive Lamb wave signals has also been analysed in this paper for distributed monitoring. Two damages have been considered: a skin crack artificially initiated on a panel bay and a skin crack propagating from a rivet hole after stringer failure. Damage sensitivity has been evaluated and compared among the considered technologies, thus providing useful recommendations for each considered system, together with advantages and drawbacks concerning their suitability for <b>on-board</b> <b>installation</b> and monitoring. The damage index sensitivity to operative condition, load in particular, is verified and compared with damage effect for distributed networks. A finite element model able to describe any selected feature sensitivity to the monitored damage is also presented as a useful tool for the optimization of the structural health monitoring system design process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUptake and {{discharge}} of ballast water by ocean-going ships contribute to the worldwide spread of aquatic invasive species, with negative impacts on the environment, economies, and public health. The International Ballast Water Management Convention aims at a global answer. The agreed standards for ballast water discharge will require ballast water treatment. Systems based on various physical and/or chemical methods were developed for <b>on-board</b> <b>installation</b> {{and approved by the}} International Maritime Organization. Most common are combinations of high-performance filters with oxidizing chemicals or UV radiation. A well-known problem of oxidative water treatment is the formation of disinfection by-products, many of which show genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or other long-term toxicity. In natural biota, genetic damages can affect reproductive success and ultimately impact biodiversity. The future exposure towards chemicals from ballast water treatment can only be estimated, based on land-based testing of treatment systems, mathematical models, and exposure scenarios. Systematic studies on the chemistry of oxidants in seawater are lacking, as are data about the background levels of disinfection by-products in the oceans and strategies for monitoring future developments. The international approval procedure of ballast water treatment systems compares the estimated exposure levels of individual substances with their experimental toxicity. While well established in many substance regulations, this approach is also criticised for its simplification, which may disregard critical aspects such as multiple exposures and long-term sub-lethal effects. Moreover, a truly holistic sustainability assessment would need to take into account factors beyond chemical hazards, e. g. energy consumption, air pollution or waste generation...|$|R
40|$|Significant R&D {{progress}} {{has been done in}} the area of SHM technologies in recent years. However real SHM application on aircraft board is still challenging and puts specific requirements on the SHM system design and operation. These challenges include assurance of reliable and provable damage detection capabilities, taking over decision-making responsibilities instead of a human inspector and other challenges related to <b>on-board</b> <b>installation</b> and operation during the flight. Further, minimal weight and dimension, and system reliability and durability should be considered. Due to these challenging requirements the SHM has not been widely implemented in aerospace industry yet. The paper deals with system architecture and operational concept of SHM system for L- 410 NG commuter aircraft. The SHM system is based on excitation, sensing and analysis of ultrasonic guided waves using PZT actuators / sensors. The SHM system is designed for monitoring of PSEs of metallic airframe that are hard to access or completely inaccessible for common inspection methods used in the aircraft maintenance. The design puts emphasis on integration of the SHM system within aircraft avionic system in order to achieve highly automated data acquisition and data transfer process to make the health data available for on-ground analysis. Finally, scenario of the SHM system operation in accordance to the L- 410 NG maintenance plan is proposed in the paper. The scenario assumes replacement of common inspections that are done within regular maintenance checks by the automated inspections using SHM system. Challenges of the proposed scenario {{from the point of view}} of the aircraft certification and operation are discussed as well. 1...|$|R
40|$|During a {{lifeboat}} training session, {{the authors}} experienced a lifeboat {{to be somewhat}} “on the edge” with regards to its stability, and an interest to practically test lifeboats’ stability and their compliance with the relevant requirements arose. This, together {{with the fact that}} one relatively newly manufactured and type-approved lifeboat was found to not fully comply with the relevant requirements in a recently performed test, despite having undergone and passed the regulated tests and evaluation in the classification process, prompted this study on stability and evaluation of lifeboat stability. This study investigates how well three type-approved lifeboats comply with the relevant stability requirements of the Life-saving Appliances Code (LSA), and how the responsibilities are delegated between the involved parties in the classification process of life-saving appliances. The theoretical chapter presents the relevant regulations, laws and requirements applicable to a totally enclosed lifeboat and the classification process of life-saving appliances. Furthermore, basic theory behind transverse ship stability and heel angle testing is presented. For answering the research questions of the study, two research methods were applied; an experimental method comprised of field experiments and systematic observations for testing of the lifeboats’ compliance with the stability requirements through practical heeling tests, and a documentary research method to investigate how the responsibilities are delegated within the classification process. The results from the experimental stability tests show that one of the tested lifeboats does not fully comply with the stability requirements of the LSA-Code. The results on the responsibility delegation show, that the regulations of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on life-saving appliances which in turn have been transposed into the legal system of the European Union, point towards a responsibility delegation where the Notified Bodies or Recognized Organisations as the controlling party, carry the responsibility for ensuring that the life-saving appliances comply with the requirements during manufacturing, as well as <b>on-board</b> <b>installation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{recently}} released new flight rule by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{a dream of}} imaging technology enthusiasts becomes reality: Visual guidance (VFR) of landing aircraft in adverse weather is no longer restricted by {{the performance of the}} human eye (measured as runway visual range, RVR). Based on the output of imaging sensors it is now allowed to continue the approach beyond the classical minimum decision altitude (MDA) or decision height (DH) down to about 100 ft whenever at DH or MDA the runway can be clearly identified within the sensor image. This rule change in aircraft operation will allow to conduct bad weather landings to non-ILS- equipped airfields and without an expensive <b>on-board</b> ILS <b>installation.</b> However, after this “quantum leap in flight rule making” new questions are coming up: “How to inform the pilot what the imaging sensor just sees?” Usually, a (quite expensive) Head Up Display (HUD) is required to show the output of the sensed image, which is presented in a raster scan overlay onto the existing stroke vector image. Is this “direct overlay method”, which “blocks” the transparency of the HUD, really {{the best way to do}} this, or are there other options to make-up enhanced visual aircraft guidance concepts and systems? The following contribution tries to give some hints for answering these questions and proposes a more transparent EVS display format. A new method for extracting the aircraft position relative to the runway in real-time from the on-board imaging sources is presented. Finally, some experimental results from flight trials during the US-American SE-Vision project, where the described method has been implemented and tested, are explained...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{airspace}} users {{have very little}} say in determining alternative routes {{in the case of}} airspace closure. Traffic managers have little understanding of how a re-route might affect {{airspace users}}. The decisions they make are based on safety, not on efficiency (especially from the user&# 039;s point of view). Some tools have been developed to aid traffic managers in decision making, but since authority with the current air traffic control system still lies with &# 039;ground-based&# 039; Air Traffic Control (ATC), regarding safety as the only goal to be achieved, none of them lead to a truly optimal solution for the &# 039;air-based&# 039; airspace users. This is where the combination of the concept of free flight and a re-routing tool can be a very powerful one in the future: moving authority and responsibility for re-routing from the ground to the air, thus yielding an optimal solution for all users involved. The main goal of this research project is to analyse optimal re-routing options of aircraft in a free flight environment in the case of airspace closure, develop software for re-routing aircraft around the closed airspace (including a module for conflict resolution on its rim) and demonstrate the software&# 039;s feasibility and potential for <b>installation</b> <b>on-board</b> future &# 039;free flight&# 039; aircraft...|$|R
40|$|New European {{regulations}} for reduction of car pollution {{set out the}} <b>installation</b> <b>on-board</b> of the EOBD (European On-Board Diagnostics) system, aiming to control the correct operation of engine components and functions having a direct effect on exhaust emissions. During car operation, the EOBD system processes several diagnostic indexes expressing the efficiency level of engine components and functions monitored by the system. If a diagnostic index exceeds its fixed threshold, the EOBD system detects a fault. The diagnostic indexes exhibit a random variability, which has to be studied by means of statistical methodolo-gies. This paper deals with the formulation of a statistical methodology that allows evaluating the optimum thresh-old for a diagnostic index, in terms of convenient balancing of false alarm and failure to detect risks. This method-ology {{has been applied to}} one of the lambda sensor diagnostic indexes, for a new car model prototype developed at Elasis research centre. Fusing statistical and technological knowledge, an experimental plan has been designed and executed. For each experimental setting two runs are performed: an on road test and a standard cycle test (NEDC). The experi-mental results allowed formulating a probabilistic model, describing the evolution of the polluting emissions and the diagnostic index as function of the lambda sensor deterioration level. Subsequently, by means of a three-step procedure, it has been possible to attain the required evaluation of the threshold to be assigned to the diagnostic index. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{logistics}} for production chemicals {{used on the}} offshore installations of the coast of Norway. Statoil provided the following problem description: There are {{an increasing number of}} fields on the Norwegian continental shelf that are going in to mature stage of its production. In this part of the field’s life cycle the need for production chemicals are increasing. The problem for the supply chain is that the tank capacity <b>on-board</b> the <b>installations</b> are limited and the procurement process is significant. The technology on the tanks on-board is old and manual readings of the tank level are needed. This could lead to the need for priority calls by the supply vessels, which are costly, or in the worst case stop in production. In {{the first part of the}} paper the offshore supply chain at Statoil is described, and a description of the importance of the production chemicals is given. A brief description of the theory related to the problem within the subject of Supply Chain Management is provided, and a chapter describing the field work at Statoil is also given. It was concluded that simulation modelling was to be used in the analysis part of the work. Discreet event simulation is a common method for analysing complex systems. This method allows the user to evaluate effect of changes on a system prior to making them. This is useful since introducing changes in the existing system could be very costly. The simulation case looks at the situation on three of Statoil’s installation on the Norwegian continental shelf. The values that are evaluated is the tank levels for the different chemicals, and how these values develop over time as changes are introduced to the case in different scenarios. There were developed four different scenarios: Scenario one: The systems were modelled with the existing tank capacities with four different demand settings. If no problems were found in this scenario it was assumed that the system functioned satisfactory: AS-IS demand based on the average demand over the last three years 10 % increase in this average demand 25 % increase of this average demand 50 % increase of this average demand Scenario two: Introducing increased capacity. This scenario was evaluated for the cases that had an inadequate result during the first scenario. In this scenario the tank capacities were increased to be able to last for 10 days with a demand given as the maximum possible in today’s situation. The simulation was conducted for the same demands as in scenario one. Scenario three: This report is also evaluating the effect of Integrated Operations, and one important topic in this field is sharing of real time data. Based on this the model was alternated so that the tank levels could be monitored in real time, automatic tank level reading, providing an "IO" improvement to the system. A simulation run with this setup was done for all the installations for the same demand values as in scenario one, and the tank utilization grade was compared to the case in scenario one. Scenario four: In this scenario the automatic tank reading setup was combined with the increased capacity of scenario two. This is assumed to be the most realistic of the improvements, as installation of new and larger tanks offshore most likely would feature this new technology as well. This simulation study can be seen as a "what-if" analysis. And the results are presented below: Scenario one: Satisfactory results for both installation A and B for all the demand levels, indicating a sufficient tank capacity at the given demand. Unsatisfactory results were found for the chemicals H 2 S remover and Nitrates at installation C Scenario two: Increasing the tanks at installation C for the chemicals mentioned above gave a very large improvement in the result, indicating that the capacity in the existing setup is insufficient for the demand situation. The result was also that there were no problems when the demand rose from the initial average to the 50 % increased level. Scenario Three: Allowing for continuous monitoring of the tank levels gave an improved utilization of the tanks at all the installations. The benefits of this alternation to the system was found to be largest in the situations that had the worst results in the original setup used in scenario one. Scenario four: This scenario gave a perfect result for all the demand values that was tested on the case of H 2 S remover and Nitrates for Installation C. The good results from the alterations in scenario two and three continued to improve when they were combined. Using simulation as a method for analysing the offshore supply chain provides a good overview of the situation and the possible problems. The two possible improvements, increasing the capacity and implementing automatic tank readings both gave good results. Since the possibility to do this evaluation on the real system would not be possible due to the fact that the cost of such alteration would be too large, it was found that simulation provides a good alternative to evaluating the supply chain. The simulation model does not give a recommended or optimal improvement for the cases where problems were discovered, but could be used to evaluate how the system would perform under different circumstances. As stated in the conclusion, no cost calculations have been conducted on the results from the simulation. The result of such an analysis could be that some, or all, the improvements used in scenario two-four are unfeasible. This would have to be evaluated before a recommended solution could be provided. </p...|$|R
40|$|During past years, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) {{have become}} very popular and, for this reason, my {{research}} activities were concentrated {{on the use of}} these systems as geomatic tools for measurements taken in monitoring and change-detection scenarios. The interest in these aerial platforms is due to their capability of performing aerial surveys in an easy and flexible way using low-cost sensors. The improvements in hardware and software frameworks allow for their use in different environmental fields and by non-expert users. In fact, the most significant difference between common aerial platforms and UAVs is that the latter have no pilot on-board. This issue allows for a reduction in the cost of the entire platform, but it is even more advantageous for safety reasons. UAVs can be big, like common manned platforms, or as small as insects. Obviously, also their uses can be very different: bigger systems are mainly used for military applications, while smaller systems are preferable for surveillance or games. In the civil field, the most investigated categories are mini and micro UAVs (payload < 30 Kg) both fixed wings and multi-rotor. The advantages are their easy use and also the possibility of easily transporting the systems to perform surveys in different areas. On the other hand, their small size requires specifically designed sensors that have to be both reliable and lightweight enough to respect the limits of the payload. For this reason, three fundamental topics related to the use of UAVs for monitoring application are investigated along this thesis: - evaluation of navigation sensors; - photogrammetric flight design and planning; - proposal of an automatic procedure for the usage of multi-temporal data. All the addressed issues used applications based on different geomatics techniques related to photogrammetry, positioning, navigation and topography. The first part of the thesis was devoted to the analyses of on-board and external (installable on-board) sensors to evaluate their accuracy in relation to well-known topographic measurements. The navigation platform of a UAV was analysed to investigate the reliability of the internal GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver and the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) platform. Then, an external GNSS receiver and a IMU were housed on-board and analysed to assess if it is possible to improve positioning and attitude information of the UAV through external sensors. In particular, strategies for their <b>installation</b> <b>on-board,</b> for the flight and for the data acquisition and processing were evaluated and tested to obtain a reliable solution. Performed tests showed that internal navigation sensors have metrical accuracy and, for this reason, another fundamental issue in the use of UAVs for data acquisition is the flight plan. UAVs can be programmed to fly along predefined trajectories, but in most cases, real flights are different to the planned ones due to the untrustworthiness of the navigation platform. For this reason, {{the second part of the}} thesis was related to the investigation of the flight planning for photogrammetric purposes. Different features of the flight (such as overlaps, cross and border stripes) were evaluated by analysing the final block orientation in relation to different parameter configurations. This was undertaken following a simulation approach which implemented the image orientation through collinearity equations in a Matlab code. The results were then evaluated through different real case studies (two of which were reported in the thesis) to assess if outcomes corresponded to reality. Finally, if we are able to calibrate different flight features to the expected final result, it is easily possible to repeat the same flight plan in different times. This is the case of monitoring scenarios where the availability of time-series information can be a useful instrument of investigation. In this context, the open issue was to relate (co-register) different 3 D models derived from this time information. Currently this problem is solved with the introduction of Ground Control Points (GCPs) whose use is time consuming, costly and sometimes not possible at all. For this reason, the last part of my thesis was related to the development of an automatic technique to co-register multi-temporal high-resolution image blocks from UAVs without the introduction of GCPs. The proposed strategy is instead based on the use of a reference epoch (considered fixed) and the registration of the others according to it. The methodology (developed in collaboration with the University of Twente, The Netherlands) was finally evaluated using two real cases, one for testing and the other for validation...|$|R
