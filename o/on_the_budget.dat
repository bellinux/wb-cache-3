5|$|The year given, in {{the table}} below, is the year the record first reached number one, rather than its {{original}} year of release. For instance: Elvis' 40 Greatest, released in 1974, a compilation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> Arcade label, was the fourth highest selling {{album of the year}} in the United Kingdom; at the time, the main British chart did not rank such compilations, relegating them to a chart for midpriced and TV-advertised albums, which Elvis' 40 Greatest topped for 15 weeks. The policy was altered in 1975, allowing the album to hit number one on the main chart in 1977, following Presley's death.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of politics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process within <b>the</b> fertiliser manufacturing industry in Indonesia. Prior budgeting studies have focused <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> following three theoretical frameworks - economic, psychological, and social. This study expands the research corpus by assessing the effect of politics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. <b>The</b> objectives of this study arc: (a) to investigate the effect of politics {{in the relationship between}} managerial roles and budgeting process – budgetary participation, budgetary communication, and budgetary control including budgetary monitoring and budgetary evaluation, and (b) {{to assess the impact of}} structural and individual power <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. <b>The</b> study uses a mixed research methodology survey method supplemented by interviews. The survey questionnaire is adapted from previous studies. The sample for this study consists of four fertiliser-manufacturing enterprises in the state owned sector of Indonesia. The respondents of the survey questionnaire were middle managers responsible for unit <b>budgets</b> in <b>the</b> sample companies. Respondents were asked to rate on a seven-point scale their agreement or disagreement with issues concerning <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, managerial roles and politics. Survey interviews, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire, were developed for a select group of respondents, consisting of middle and senior managers. The results of the study, both survey questionnaire and interviews, indicate that politics has significant influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. Further, it showed that the influence appeared different, depending whether structural or individual power is involved. The major implications of this study centre <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strong moderating effect of politics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process and managerial roles: this seems to be a relevant construct and should be developed further. Hopefully, the study will advance the thinking of scholars in this area and create interest in replicating this method of analysis and validating the findings. The conceptual model should also be applied to the role of politics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process in other industries to assess the external validity of the model...|$|R

5|$|After Young Frankenstein was written, {{the rights}} {{were to be}} sold to Columbia Pictures, but after having trouble agreeing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> Wilder, Brooks, and {{producer}} Michael Gruskoff went with 20th Century Fox, where both Brooks and Wilder had to sign five-year contracts. Young Frankenstein was a commercial success, with Wilder and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars, losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of The Godfather Part II. While filming Young Frankenstein, Wilder had an idea for a romantic musical comedy about a brother of Sherlock Holmes. Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn {{agreed to participate in the}} project, and Wilder began writing what became his directorial début, 1975's The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} {{arriving}} in Washington, D.C., Fletcher {{was selected as}} the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school districts to use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422—1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E
5|$|Connery and Salomon {{eventually}} dropped out, and in September 1995, Robert Rodriguez, {{fresh from}} the success of Desperado, signed to direct with Antonio Banderas, who had also starred in Desperado, playing the title role. TriStar and Amblin had been surprised by Rodriguez's low-budget filming techniques for his action films, El Mariachi and Desperado, and shifted away from their initial plans with Salomon to make a big-budget version of Zorro. Spielberg had hoped Rodriguez would start filming in January 1996 for a Christmas release date, but the start date was pushed back to July. The release date was later moved to Easter 1997. Rodriguez {{pulled out of the}} film' in June 1996 over difficulties coming to terms with TriStar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> The studio projected a range of $35 million, while Rodriguez wanted $45 million. They both attempted to compromise when Rodriguez lowered it to $42 million, but the studio refused and set $41 million as their highest mark. Banderas remained with the production, and Martin Campbell signed on later that month, turning down the chance to direct Tomorrow Never Dies. The finished screenplay would be written by John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, based on a story by Elliott, Rossio, and Randall Jahnson.|$|E

5|$|The {{dreadnought}} race {{stepped up}} in 1910 and 1911, with Germany laying down four capital ships {{each year and}} the United Kingdom five. Tension {{came to a head}} following the German Naval Law of 1912. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse for the United Kingdom, the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Navy was building four dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. The United Kingdom was faced with a choice of building more battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when social welfare provision was making calls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a huge loss of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the Mediterranean and shaking the stability of the British Empire. The only acceptable option, and the one recommended by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, was to break with the policies of the past and make an arrangement with France. The French would assume responsibility for checking Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean, while the British would protect the north coast of France. In spite of some opposition from British politicians, the Royal Navy organised itself on this basis in 1912.|$|E
