When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Barneveld–Remsen portion <b>of</b> <b>legislative</b> Route25 was bypassed by NY12, which was assigned to Route25's original, direct alignment between the two villages instead.

When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Owego–Interlaken and Ovid–Romulus segments <b>of</b> <b>legislative</b> Route36 became part of NY15, which continued northwest from Romulus to Rochester.

When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion <b>of</b> <b>legislative</b> Route18 north of Buffalo became the basis for NY34, which began at Main Street (NY5) in Buffalo and followed the path <b>of</b> <b>legislative</b> Route18 through Niagara Falls and along the Niagara River to Lake Ontario. NY18 was assigned at the same time; however, it initially went from the Pennsylvania state line at Limestone north to Buffalo along what is now US219, NY417, NY353 and US62.
