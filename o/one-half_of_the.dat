5|$|The port {{developed}} in the 11th century around {{the confluence of the}} Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to <b>one-half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E

A long-standing rivalry with nearby Exeter College reached a peak in 1979, with seven police vehicles and three fire engines involved in dealing with trouble in Turl Street.

5|$|The {{following}} week, on the May 1 {{episode of}} ECW, Burke announced a match between Thorn and Punk, which Thorn lost. After the match, Thorn quit the New Breed, as {{none of the}} other members interfered during the match to help him. That same night, Striker and Cor Von lost to the debuting tag team of The Major Brothers (Brian and Brett). Striker was pinned and as a result, Burke blamed Striker, berating him for the loss and creating tension between the two. The following week, Cor Von defeated Punk in a singles match following interference from Burke, and Burke defeated <b>one-half</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Major Brothers, Brian. Punk gained revenge at the Judgment Day pay-per-view in late May however, when he defeated Burke in a singles match. On the next episode of ECW, Striker defeated Brett Major while Burke and Cor Von lost to the team of Van Dam and Punk by disqualification when Cor Von attacked Punk despite not being the legal man in the match. After this, Van Dam was moved into a feud with Randy Orton and Punk joined forces with Dreamer and The Sandman to replace Sabu, who had left WWE in mid-May. At the One Night Stand pay-per-view in June, Burke, Cor Von, and Striker lost to Punk, Dreamer, and The Sandman in a tables match.|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet {{irradiation}} ofpolyoma virus inactivates different functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus genome. This inactivation {{is related}} to the radiation dose.

In the present experiments, ultraviolet irradiation has been applied in a similar manner in order to study the cell surface antigen. Quantitative analysis shows that the radiation target size for this antigen is <b>one-half</b> that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ability to form plaques (infectivity). The difference in responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell surface antigen and in the homograft rejection antigen observed after irradiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus can be due either to differences in sensitivities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> techniques used or to a difference in antigenicity.

5|$|The {{main event}} at Against All Odds {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Samoa Joe as Special Outside Enforcer between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Christian Cage. On January 6, 2008 at TNA's previous PPV event Final Resolution, Angle defeated Cage to retain the championship after Cage's alliance A.J. Styles attacked Cage, aligning with Angle and The Angle Alliance. On the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Cage, Joe, and Styles would compete in a Three Way match on the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!. Stipulations for the match were that the winner would get a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle to not have to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, thus becoming the number one contender. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match. Also connected to the storyline was the allegiance of former Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance member Tomko to either Cage or Angle. Heading up to the match, Tomko explained he was not on either's side, despite being <b>one-half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TNA World Tag Team Champions with Styles. On the January 31, 2008 episode of Impact!, Tomko defeated Angle after interference from Cage.

5|$|Besides Chris Candido {{suffering}} a leg injury during his tag team match, Abyss also suffered a dislocated shoulder during {{the main event}} against A.J. Styles. Abyss' injury was taken care of backstage after the event, but Candido {{was diagnosed with a}} dislocated ankle, broken tibia, and a broken fibula that required surgery. Candido had an operation on April 25 to have a plate, screws, and pins placed in his ankle to fix the problem. Candido was reported to be sidelined for 2 to 3 months. According to reports, Candido suffered the injury from taking a dropkick by Sonny Siaki and landing on his leg improperly. After the surgery, he hoped to be recovered in 6 to 8 weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed where he died a short time later. Cause of death was released by his brother Johnny afterwards as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior. TNA released a public statement on April29 regarding the subject. TNA paid tribute to Candido on the April29 episode of Impact! as well as at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event. The April29 episode of Impact! opened and ended with a memorial to Candido.
