5|$|The ISA has its {{constitutional}} basis in Article 149 of the Constitution, which sanctions preventive detention {{and allows for}} laws passed by the legislature against subversion to override the Articles protecting the personal liberties of the individual. Specifically, Article 149(1) declares such legislation to be valid notwithstanding any inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 9. Thus, detentions under the ISA cannot be challenged on the basis <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> of these rights.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical study <b>of</b> prison <b>deprivations</b> suffered by women, conducted at the Female Department of Correctional Facility in Požarevac within the scope of a wider study of women's prison system. It was supposed that female prisoners in this penal institution face similar prison experience and suffer the same or similar deprivations as women in other penal institutions do. The research sample included female prisoners sentenced to more than one year, staying in prison {{for more than a year}} (54 female prisoners, i. e. more than 50 % prisoners sentenced to long prison terms). Prisoners were interviewed employing a questionnaire measuring different types <b>of</b> <b>deprivations</b> using 26 indicators. Using the method of factor analysis - which was here used for the first time to study prison deprivations - six factors <b>of</b> women's prison <b>deprivations</b> were extracted: <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> maternity; <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> autonomy; <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> individuality; <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> human kindness and empathy; <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> a key role - a woman's role, and <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> friendship relations. The outcomes of this research, together with the findings of other researchers, affirm the assumption that these types <b>of</b> <b>deprivations</b> are realistic and dominant types <b>of</b> women's prison <b>deprivations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Elizabeth Bamber {{was born}} on 24September 1899 at 23 Zante Street, Liverpool, the eldest {{daughter}} of Hugh Bamber, a bookbinder, and his wife Mary, née Little. Mary had come to Liverpool as a child when her father, a well-to-do Edinburgh lawyer, abandoned his family after his descent into alcoholism and poverty. Liverpool in the late 19th century suffered extremes <b>of</b> <b>deprivation,</b> and had the highest infant mortality rate in the country. Mary became a trade union organiser and campaigner against deplorable social conditions, and established a reputation as an outstanding platform speaker. She was the dominant early influence on her daughter Elizabeth, who formed a lifelong determination to represent and fight for the disadvantaged.|$|E
5|$|Hemming's Cartulary is a {{manuscript}} cartulary, or collection of charters and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming {{around the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the British Library as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the Liber Wigorniensis, is a collection of Anglo-Saxon charters and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, Hemming's Cartulary proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> of property owned by the church of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E

5|$|John Thomas Perceval, {{the son of}} Spencer Perceval, {{spent about}} a year at Brislington House, from 1831 until February 1832, {{followed}} by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington House Perceval experienced, {{in spite of the}} expense, a regime <b>of</b> <b>deprivation,</b> brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time he was completely under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or tied down in bed. Treatment consisted of cold baths and an operation to sever his temporal artery. He was later {{one of the founders of}} the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and acted as their honorary secretary for about twenty years. Perceval's two books about his experience in asylums were republished by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson in 1962, and in recent years he has been hailed as a pioneer of the mental-health advocacy movement.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{supported}} by fishing is {{the mainstay of}} Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations <b>of</b> <b>deprivation,</b> unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. Older people who make increasing demands on the area's health and social care capacity have moved into the area. Demographic changes, Whitby's relative isolation from the region's main growth areas and decline in traditional employment sectors pose an economic challenge.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E

All of Upminster is contained within these wards, however they also cover the connected settlement of Cranham and the rural outlier of North Ockendon. In 2001 the population of Upminster ward was 12,674 and Cranham ward was 12,242, giving a total population of 25,098. 80.95% in Upminster and 81.73% in Cranham report their religion as Christian, compared to 76.13% for Havering, 58.23% in London and 71.74% in England. 10.08% in Upminster and 10.46% in Cranham report having no religion, compared to 13.18% in Havering, 15.76% in London and 14.59% in England. With a black and minority ethnic population of 3% in 2001, Cranham and Upminster wards have the lowest Simpson index for ethnic diversity in London. The level of home ownership is atypically high compared to the rest of London and England, with over 90% of housing tenure under owner-occupation in both wards. The Upminster ward has one of the lowest levels <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> in London.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times <b>of</b> <b>deprivation,</b> such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E
