5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{textbook}} {{was at once}} well received, being admired both by zoologists and naturalists {{and among}} allied soldiers. Many officers carried {{a copy of the}} book with them in the field. Since the war it has formed the basis for experimental investigation of camouflage, while its breadth <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> and accuracy have ensured that it remains frequently cited in scientific papers.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, the Internal Revenue Service {{ruled that}} the cost of {{covering}} only the individual employee would be considered in determining whether the cost <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> exceeded 9.5% of income. Family plans would not be considered even if the cost was above the 9.5% income threshold. This was estimated to leave 2–4 million Americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers’ plans and ineligible for subsidies.|$|E

40|$|Conference paperRecent studies <b>of</b> media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> {{biotechnology}} {{have suggested}} that such coverage was similar to <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> nuclear energy and other "emerging technologies. " To move beyond individual cases and towards a broader theory <b>of</b> media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> emerging technologies, this study looks at a new emerging technology – nanotechnology – and explicitly compares <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> it to <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> earlier emerging technologies. We present a preliminary content analysis <b>of</b> nanotechnology <b>coverage</b> in the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Associated Press for the period 1 January 1986 to 30 June 2004. Media attention to nanotechnology seems to parallel <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> biotechnology {{in its early stages}} of issue development—starting out low and rising sharply as it spreads from “elite” media outlets to more general outlets. As with biotechnology, <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> nanotechnology throughout this period is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on progress and potential economic benefits, and with little discussion of attendant risks. Nanotechnology coverage does, however, focus more on risks from the outset than biotechnology did, suggesting that issues of public accountability are growing more salient to journalists. We conclude with comments {{about the possibility of a}} theory <b>of</b> media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> emerging technologies...|$|R

5|$|Many program {{changes were}} made in Calgary to grow {{the appeal of the}} Winter Games for sponsors: the {{extension}} to 16 days from 12 added an extra weekend <b>of</b> <b>coverage,</b> while the additional programming time was filled by television friendly demonstration events popular in Canada. The exposure curling, freestyle skiing and short-track speed skating gained in Calgary influenced the growth in their popularity and led to all three becoming full medal sports by 1998.|$|E
5|$|Obama's most {{significant}} legacy {{is generally considered}} to be the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's {{most significant}} regulatory overhaul and expansion <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Project Chanology {{began its}} {{campaign}} by organizing and delivering {{a series of}} denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites and flooding Scientology centers with prank calls and black faxes. The group was successful in taking down local and global Scientology websites intermittently from January 18, 2008 until at least January 25, 2008. Anonymous had early success rendering major Scientology websites inaccessible and leaking documents allegedly stolen from Scientology computers. This resulted in a large amount <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> on social bookmarking websites.|$|E

Baresel et al. analyzed this relationship empirically, finding some correlation between the degree <b>of</b> model <b>coverage</b> and the resulting degree <b>of</b> code <b>coverage</b> [19]. Rajan et al. have shown for MCDC that the correlation of the degree <b>of</b> model <b>coverage</b> and the degree <b>of</b> code <b>coverage</b> depends on the code generation patterns [20].

5|$|The main {{rights to}} Olympic {{coverage}} in the United Kingdom are held by the BBC, under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events. An extensive range of broadcasting options was used to provide over 2,500 hours <b>of</b> <b>coverage.</b>|$|E
5|$|American {{broadcaster}} NBC Sports, {{who also}} owns the broadcast {{rights to the}} Olympics, has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing too little coverage of the Paralympics; the lack <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> from NBC in Athens was {{a cause for concern}} from senior IPC officials, especially given that the United States was bidding for the 2012 Games. In 2012 NBC only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from the Games, airing on the pay TV channel NBC Sports Network, and did not cover the ceremonies at all.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels <b>of</b> <b>coverage.</b> In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} opening ceremony, United States {{broadcaster}} NBC was criticised for its coverage, as omitting performers less-known in the US. John Clarke, writing for Forbes, said it was wrong not to air performances from Ray Davies and Muse, as well as delaying the performance from The Who by an hour to broadcast the pilot of the sitcom Animal Practice followed by the late local news. While in New Zealand, Prime TV were also criticised for delayed coverage, running 20 minutes behind Sky Sport. In the Philippines, TV5 was also criticised because it only aired the first hour <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> of the ceremony and highlights were incorporated into its morning news programme, Good Morning Club.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{suffered}} an outage during their broadcast of Game 1, {{resulting in a}} loss <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> for 15 minutes, followed by a 5-minute delay in-game while officials addressed the availability of video review due {{to the loss of}} Fox's feed; the teams agreed to allow the use of footage from the world feed of the game for video review. Fox temporarily switched to the MLB International feed of the game with Vasgersian and Smoltz to restore coverage. The video from the feed was then accompanied by Fox's commentators before the full Fox production was restored.|$|E
5|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> of her disappearance {{due to a}} shift in news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005.

Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba {{took advantage of the}} extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina to release the suspects, however the deadline for judicial review of Van der Sloot's detention was set long before Katrina.|$|E

5|$|In late 1992 Takanohana {{announced}} his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> {{to the royal}} wedding held that year. However the engagement was broken off the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role of {{the wife of a}} head coach in looking after the stable's recruits and liaising with supporter's groups is regarded as a full-time job.|$|E
5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction {{until such time}} as the jurisdiction may bail out <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long as the}} court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.|$|E

The Kalahari Meerkat Project noted that the film was not completely accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized as being too simplistic for adult viewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was determined not by how long a sensor would last in the field, but by the adequacy <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, {{only as good as}} the human analysts and operators at the ISC. The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E
5|$|AMI-tv has {{collaborated with}} other Canadian {{broadcasters}} to simulcast {{events on the}} network with open described video.
