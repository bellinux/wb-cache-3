The use of <b>oil</b> <b>quenching</b> and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker water quenching.

Firstly, the diffusion of carbon at elevated temperatures in the austenitic range is studied in a diffusion model. Secondly, the calculated carbon concentration distribution is used as an input for a model that couples the thermal, metallographic and mechanical effects during the quenching process and calculates the evolution of the temperature, phase composition and deformation history at any point in the gear. Two effects typical for <b>oil</b> <b>quenching</b> of large gears are incorporated in the model. The first is the influence of the gear’s own weight while hanging on chains before, during and after entering the quench bath. The second is the three-dimensional effect that it takes time between the moment the gear enters the <b>oil</b> <b>quenching</b> bath and the moment when the gear is fully immersed.
