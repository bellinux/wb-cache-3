500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} benefits to {{this form of}} custody arrangement. One main benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents are legal equals, which means that both parents influence important decisions in the child's upbringing, which leads to less animosity and negativity between the parents, along with encouraging both parents to be proactive in the child's upbringing. A second benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents exhibit a feeling of well being knowing they are working together in making decisions based on what their child's/children's needs are. This form of joint custody enables parents to focus solely on the children, {{with the emphasis on}} {{the health and well-being of}} the child/children. [...] By doing so, this has the potential to reverse some of the emotional effects on the children in the long-run.
