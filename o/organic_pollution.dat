A {{study of the}} groundwater quality of the principal aquifers of the United States conducted between 1991 and 2004, showed that 23% of domestic wells had contaminants at levels greater than human-health benchmarks. Another study suggested that the major groundwater pollution problems in Africa, considering the order of importance are: (1) nitrate pollution, (2) pathogenic agents, (3) <b>organic</b> <b>pollution,</b> (4) salinization, and (5) acid mine drainage.|$|E
25|$|Water quality remains good {{through the}} length of the river. Figures for the final section before it joins the River Idle show that the levels of ammonia and {{dissolved}} oxygen are those which would be expected in a natural ecosystem. Between 1991 and 2006, the BOD has been reduced by more than 50 percent, but there is still room for improvement. Levels of phosphates and nitrates, which are affected by agricultural activity, are quite high, but some improvements have occurred. Water quality is also measured by two biological indexes. These are NTAXA, which relates to the total number of invertebrate species found in samples of the water, and ASPT, (the Average Score Per Taxon), calculated from the numbers of specific invertebrates which are graded according to their sensitivity to <b>organic</b> <b>pollution.</b> The assessment for the years 2004 to 2006 rated the final section as grade A (very good) on the first index, and grade B (good) on the second. This indicates that the water is not far short from unpolluted.|$|E

25|$|The Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR), a {{tributary}} of the Río de la Plata (La Plata River), is the most contaminated river basin in Argentina and {{considered one of the most}} polluted water bodies in the world. Pollution levels in Buenos Aires’ rivers are so high that they have been considered “open sewers”, making pollution the greatest environmental risk for the metropolitan area. Pollution levels have increased steadily as urbanization and industrial growth have continuously increased in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. It is estimated that more than 4,000 industrial facilities are located in the lower and middle sections of the basin. Almost all of these industries discharge untreated effluents into the drainage system or directly into the MR River. In addition to high levels of <b>organic</b> <b>pollution,</b> these discharges contribute toxic contaminants such as heavy metals from petrochemical industries, tanneries, and meat processing facilities. More specifically, the Riacheuleo has levels of Lead, Zinc and Chrome 50 times higher than the legal limit in Argentina; 25% is from industrial sewage and waste, while the remaining 75% originates from domestic sources. The sudden onset of environmental and social degradation of the MR basin has resulted from limited investment in public infrastructure, poor environmental management, lack of adequate urban and industrial planning, and limited public infrastructure investment.|$|E
25|$|A {{biological}} {{survey was}} carried out in 1993, near Rother Valley Country Park, and only seven types of invertebrates were found, all of which were highly tolerant to pollution. It was recognised that the straight engineered channel where the river had been re-instated after coal mining was not well suited to the support of life, and so a stone weir was constructed, to help with natural aeration of the water, and to increase the flow velocity so that the gravel below the weir was scoured clean. A bay was constructed above the weir, where fish could escape when the river was affected by flooding or pollution incidents. A trial release of fish, funded by contributions from Rhone Poulenc, Coalite Chemicals and Yorkshire Water, was made in April 1994. Half of the total of 2,500 chub and 2,500 roach were released near the new weir, and the other half at Hall Road in Staveley. It soon became clear from anglers that the fish were spreading along the river, and a further 40,000 fish were released that winter. Another survey in September 1995 revealed good growth rates in the fish, and barbel were thriving. Brown trout, thought to have come from the River Hipper or the Barlow Brook, were also found in the Rother, and since these are much less tolerant to <b>organic</b> <b>pollution</b> and low oxygen levels, were a clear indicator that conditions were improving. The following year, chub and dace were released at Old Whittington, and clear evidence that the fish were breeding in the river was found. The river had become a self-sustaining fishery again, and organised angling began {{for the first time in}} over 100 years.|$|E

30|$|Recent years, {{energy crisis}} and {{environmental}} pollution have become two urgent challenges, which seriously inhibit {{the economic development}} and human health. Photocatalysis is considered {{as the answer to}} the both problems, as it has the ability to produce hydrogen and decompose organic pollutants. Since Fujishima and Honda discovered the photocatalytic splitting of water using TiO 2 as an electrode in 1972 [1], TiO 2 has been widely investigated in the degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>pollutions</b> in water. Since then, various semiconductor materials are studied to search for the most convenient photocatalyst with high efficiency, low cost, environmental friendliness, and direct utilization of sunlight.|$|R
30|$|The semiconductor-mediated {{photocatalytic}} {{decomposition of}} <b>organic</b> <b>pollutions</b> {{in the environment}} has attracted much attention [1] because of the abundant available solar resources and the minimum requirements of carbon footprint generated. Among the various semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO 2 is the most extensively employed photocatalyst, owing to its high photocatalytic activity, good chemical stability, non-toxicity, and low cost. However, TiO 2 absorbs only ultraviolet light, which accounts for only 4 % of the total sunlight. Since about 48 % of sunlight is visible light, it is strongly important to develop the photocatalysts which are active and effective under visible light.|$|R

2500|$|According to a 2002 {{report by}} staff from the Yemeni Environment Protection Agency, there were 10 {{wastewater}} treatment plants in Yemen {{at the time in}} Sana’a, Taiz, Ibb, Hajaa, Aden, Amran, Al Hodaida, Dammar, Yarem, and Radaa. Most of the plants use the stabilization pond technology, a low-cost technology particularly suitable for a hot climate. Some use Imhoff tanks or the activated sludge procedure commonly used in many developed countries. While data on the quality of treated effluent are limited, those data that are available show that the effluent of at least two plants complies with the relatively lenient national standard of 150mg/l of Biological oxygen demand, a measure of <b>organic</b> <b>pollution.</b> However, none of the four analyzed plants complied with the standard for fecal coliform, a measure of biological contamination.

40|$|Beijing, {{the capital}} of China, is a rapidly {{developing}} mega-city with a huge population in the world. Beijing has been experiencing severe air pollution problems since 1980 s due {{to more and more}} energy consumption. In the case of severe <b>organic</b> aerosol <b>pollution</b> in Beijing, a one-year-long observation on major organic compounds in PM 2. 5 was performed at an urban site to gain information of their ambient concentration levels and sources in Beijing. The compound classes identified by GC/MS included alkanes, PAHs, fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids, and hopanes, whose seasonal average concentrations during the year were 39 - 477, 9 - 283, 260 - 483, 16 - 42, and 2. 3 - 16 ng m - 3, respectively. Since the molecular distributions of particulate organic matter are indicative of different emission sources, their seasonal characteristics and variations were discussed in detail to explore the major contributing sources in Beijing. Conclusively, <b>organic</b> aerosol <b>pollution</b> in Beijing was found to be mostly associated with vehicle exhaust, coal combustion for residential heating, and cooking emissions, and the latter two sources are unique Chinese pollution sources.

The hepatic GSH content was significantly inhibited by organic pollutants, alone and in mixtures, while the TBARS content was significantly induced {{after three days of}} exposure.
