They would have loved to and were willing to pay for the tickets but the money for other necessities was just not there.

Using monospecific polyclonal antibodies, {{the distribution of}} p 29 was studied {{in a variety of}} tissues by light and electron microscopy and immunoblot analysis. Within the nervous system, p 29 was present in virtually all nerve terminals. It was selectively associated with small synaptic vesicles and a perinuclear region corresponding to the area of the Golgi complex. P 29 was not detected in any other subcellular organelles including large dense-core vesicles. The distribution of p 29 in various subcellular fractions from rat brain was very similar to that of synaptophysin and synaptobrevin. The highest enrichment occurred in purified small synaptic vesicles. <b>Outsid...</b>|$|E

Commercial-scale switch-grass production is projected to involve substantial increases in agricultural land acreage, with new acres coming from a combination of conservation reserve program (CRP) acreage, other cropland currently used as pasture, a reduction of winter fallow in production rotations, and displacement of existing crop production. The displacement of existing crop production reduces domestic crop supply and generates market impacts in the form of increased prices and reduced exports for existing crops, which creates the potential for signifi cant indirect land use impacts associated with changing commodity production patterns beyond the borders of the United States and <b>outsid...</b>|$|E
