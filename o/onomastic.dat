5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There {{have been few}} attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or <b>onomastic</b> folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
25|$|The <b>onomastic</b> {{differences}} between the South-Eastern and Central areas are not sufficient to show that two clearly differentiated dialects of Illyrian were in use in these areas. However, as Katičić has argued, the core <b>onomastic</b> area of Illyrian proper is to {{be located in the}} southeast of that Balkan region, traditionally associated with the Illyrians (centered in modern Albania).|$|E

25|$|Ligurian was {{spoken in}} the Northern Mediterranean Coast {{straddling}} the southeast French and northwest Italian coasts, including parts of Tuscany, Elba island and Corsica. Xavier Delamarre argues that Ligurian was a Celtic language, similar to, {{but not the}} same as Gaulish. The Ligurian-Celtic question is also discussed by Barruol (1999). Ancient Ligurian is either listed as Celtic (epigraphic), or Para-Celtic (<b>onomastic).</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern {{academics}} propose, {{based on}} much <b>onomastic</b> and archaeological evidence, that Anatolian populations moved south into Canaan {{as part of}} the waves of Sea Peoples who were migrating along the Mediterranean coastline {{at the time of the}} collapse of the Hittite Empire. Many kings of local city-states are shown to have had Hittite and Luwian names in the Late Bronze to Early Iron Age transition period. Indeed, even the name of Mount Zion may be Hittite in origin.|$|E
25|$|The tribal {{name has}} also been {{explained}} as being Celtic, *eburo- meaning 'yew(-tree)', which is also attested in personal names and place-names such as Eboracum (York), Ebora (Évora) and Eburobrittium. This etymological derivation would give Caesar's story in which King Catuvolcus committed suicide by taking in the poisonous juice from the yew-tree an extra layer of meaning. The etymology is rendered somewhat less certain by the existence of Germanic *ebura 'boar', although this element is not as well represented in the contemporary <b>onomastic</b> record.|$|E

The distinction between <b>onomastics</b> and nomenclature is not readily clear: <b>onomastics</b> is an unfamiliar discipline to most people {{and the use of}} nomenclature in an academic sense is also not commonly known.

25|$|Before Romans {{entered the}} {{territory}} of present-day Portugal, the native people identified themselves by a single name, or that name followed by a patronym. The names could be Celtic (Mantaus), Lusitanian (Casae), Iberian (Sunua) or Conii (Alainus). The names were clearly ethnic and some typical of a tribe or region. A slow adoption of the Roman <b>onomastic</b> occurred {{after the end of}} the first century AD, with the adoption of a Roman name or of the tria nomina: praenomen (given name), nomen (gentile) and cognomen.|$|E

Greeks from the Giresun (originally Choerades Κερασοῦς; later Kerasous) reportedly migrated in antiquity from Sinope, which was itself colonised by Ionians (from Miletus). Another ancient Ionian colony in north-west Anatolia, Lámpsakos (Lampsacus), had <b>onomastic</b> links to the Pityusic Islands (see above) – Lámpsakos was originally an Ionian colony known as Pityussa.|$|E
25|$|Hurrians are {{mentioned}} in the private Nuzi texts, in Ugarit, and the Hittite archives in Hattushsha (Boğazköy). Cuneiform texts from Mari mention rulers of city-states in upper Mesopotamia with both Amurru (Amorite) and Hurrian names. Rulers with Hurrian names are also attested for Urshum and Hashshum, and tablets from Alalakh (layer VII, from the later part of the old-Babylonian period) mention people with Hurrian names {{at the mouth of}} the Orontes. There is no evidence for any invasion from the North-east. Generally, these <b>onomastic</b> sources have been taken as evidence for a Hurrian expansion to the South and the West.|$|E

(One version depicts Goram as lazy and Vincent as keen and industrious.) The geographical point is to explain the narrow gorge of the Hazel Brook (a tributary of the river Trym) in Henbury and the dramatic Avon Gorge through which the Avon now flows. The <b>onomastic</b> point is {{to account for the}} name of the Avon Gorge, but this is a bit feeble since the river has had this name from time immemorial.|$|E
25|$|The Metrical Dindshenchas, or Lore of Places, is {{probably}} the major surviving monument of Irish bardic verse. It is a great <b>onomastic</b> anthology of naming legends of significant places in the Irish landscape and comprises about 176 poems in total. The earliest of these date from the 11th century, and were probably originally compiled on a provincial basis. As a national compilation, the Metrical Dindshenchas has come down to us in two different recensions. Knowledge of the real or putative history of local places formed {{an important part of}} the education of the elite in ancient Ireland, so the Dindshenchas was probably a kind of textbook in origin.|$|E
25|$|Further near-contemporary {{evidence}} {{comes only}} indirectly by inference from later kinsmen whose precise connectedness {{is impossible to}} specify. According to his first biographer, Dunstan was related to a certain Æthelflæd, a lady of royal rank who was herself a niece of King Æthelstan, to Bishop Ælfheah of Winchester, to Bishop Cynesige of Lichfield, and to various men at court (including his brother Wulfric). Dunstan's father Heorstan, who lived near the “royal island” of Glastonbury, cannot be shown {{to have been a}} prominent figure in the kingdom, although sources for Edward's reign are notoriously scanty. Since Æthelstan, Dunstan and Heorstan all share the rare <b>onomastic</b> element -stan, it has been tentatively suggested that they derived their kinship through Ecgwynn.|$|E

25|$|In his latter years, {{his wife}} Bertilla {{was charged with}} infidelity, a charge not {{uncommon}} against wives of declining kings of that period. She was poisoned. He had remarried to one named Anna by December 915. It has been suggested, largely for <b>onomastic</b> reasons, that Anna was a daughter of Louis of Provence and his wife Anna, the possible daughter of Leo VI the Wise, Byzantine Emperor. In that case, {{she would have been}} betrothed to Berengar while still a child and only become his consors and imperatrix in 923. Her marriage was an attempt by Louis to advance his children while he himself was being marginalised and by Berengar to legitimise his rule by relating himself by marriage to the house of Lothair I which had ruled Italy by hereditary right since 817.|$|E
25|$|The Balto-Slavic {{languages}} {{are most often}} divided into Baltic and Slavic groups. However, in the 1960's Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov made the following conclusions {{about the relationship between}} the Baltic and Slavic languages: a) Proto-Slavic language formed from the peripheral-type Baltic dialects; b) Slavic linguistic type formed later from the Baltic languages structural model; c) the Slavic structural model {{is a result of the}} Baltic languages structural model transformation. This model is supported by glottochronologic studies by V. V. Kromer, although both of the most recent computer-generated family trees have a Baltic node parallel to the Slavic node. <b>Onomastic</b> evidence shows that Baltic languages were once spoken in much wider territory than the one they cover today, all the way to Moscow, and were later replaced by Slavic.|$|E
25|$|However, the Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh, {{which was}} {{arranged}} onomastically, is undisputedly Stutchkoff’s main achievement. It remains even today {{the most extensive}} dictionary of the Yiddish language, containing approximately 90,000 single-word entries and 8,000 idioms (because of multiple designations it amounts to nearly 175,000 entries). The dictionary was meant to ‘store’ the Yiddish language, which {{was in danger of}} extinction after the Holocaust. Peter Mark Roget’s English thesaurus served as an example; nonetheless, Stutchkoff reduced Roget’s 1000 <b>onomastic</b> categories to 650. The dictionary received critical acclaim and 2000 copies were sold within the first year of its publication alone. It does not project purist language views; instead it includes 1500 Americanisms, 3000 Germanisms, 1000 Slavisms, 500 vulgarisms, 700 funny expressions, and 700 archaisms, dialectal words, slang words and Sovietisms. This inclusion of modern lexicon distinguished Stutchkoff’s dictionary from other publications put out by the Institute for Jewish Research YIVO (Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut). Stutchkoff’s decision to include those terms went against the advice of his publisher, Max Weinreich. However, some reviewers – among others Isaac Bashevis Singer – criticised the fact that Weinreich had designated certain terms as “not recommended”, while others regretted that the Oytser included many artificial terms invented by the YIVO that were not in use in other circles.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the recent flurry of activity on the subject, Ian Mladjov reevaluated the question and presented a completely novel solution. He dismissed each of the prior theories in turn as insufficiently grounded and incompatible given the historical record, and further argued {{that many of the}} proposed solutions would have meant that later documented marriages would have fallen within the prohibited degree of kinship, yet there is no record the issue of consanguinity was ever raised with regard to these marriages. He argued that the documentary testimony of Agatha's origins is tainted or late, and concurred with Humphreys' evaluation that the names of the children and grandchildren of Agatha, so central to prior reevaluations, may have had non-family origins (for example, Pope Alexander II, having {{played a critical role in}} the marriage of Malcolm and Margaret, may have inspired their use of that name). However, he then focused in on the name of Agatha as being critical to determining her origin. He concluded that of the few contemporaries named Agatha, only Agatha Chryselia, the wife of Samuel of Bulgaria could possibly have been an ancestor of Edward the Exile's spouse. Some of the other names associated with Agatha and used to corroborate theories based in onomastics were present within the Bulgarian ruling family at the time, including Mary and several Davids. Mladjov inferred that Agatha was granddaughter of Agatha Cryselia, daughter of Gavril Radomir, Tsar of Bulgaria by his short-lived first marriage to a Hungarian princess thought to have been the daughter of Duke Géza of Hungary. This hypothesis has Agatha born in Hungary after her parents divorced, her mother being pregnant when she left Bulgaria, yet would entail her mother naming her after the mother of the Bulgarian prince who had just rejected her. Traditional dates of this divorce would seem to preclude the suggested relationship, but the article re-examined some long-standing assumptions about the chronology of Gavril Radomir's marriage to the Hungarian princess, and concludes that its dating to the late 980s is unsupportable, and that its dissolution belongs in c. 1009-1014. The argument is based almost exclusively on the <b>onomastic</b> precedent but is said to vindicate the intimate connection between Agatha and Hungary attested in the Medieval sources. Mladjov speculates further that the medieval testimony could largely be harmonized were one to posit that Agatha's mother was the same Hungarian princess who married Samuel Aba of Hungary, his family fleeing to Kiev after his downfall, thereby allowing a Russian marriage for Agatha.|$|E
