500|$|The {{government}} decided {{to close a}} number of government libraries without consultation on the closings or the process involved. [...] The {{manner in which it}} was done received significant criticism because it has resulted in the remaining information being put into a disarray, rendering it inaccessible for research, and in a loss of information of a magnitude as of yet unknown. [...] This is because no significant effort was made to inventory the material, to determine what should be preserved, and no <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> what was discarded.

2500|$|Triplets are {{far less}} common than twins, {{according}} to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, {{just a little more}} than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.

2500|$|Except {{for the use}} of some {{substitute}} materials, {{the final}} batch of ten were nearly identical to the FEF-2. After World War II, coal supplies were affected by a series of strikes. In order to safeguard operations, UP converted the 800s to oil burning, and a [...] tank was fitted in the bunker space. Otherwise, few modifications were needed to insure years of mainline service. These were the last steam locomotives delivered for the UP. 844, the last of the FEF-3 class, is the longest continuously operating 4-8-4 engine in the world, and the only one never retired by a Class I railroad.

2500|$|The network's {{ability to}} {{exercise}} power is based partly on Bhumibol's popularity and strict control of Bhumibol's popular image. According to Jost Pachaly of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, Bhumibol [...] "plays {{an important role}} behind the scenes. But the role is difficult to assess because nothing is reported about it and no <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> anything specific", due to lese majeste laws forbidding discussion about Bhumibol's political activities. Bhumibol's popularity was demonstrated following the 2003 Phnom Penh riots in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by rumors that Cambodian rioters had stomped on photographs of Bhumibol, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok. Photographs of the stomping were not published in Thailand, but were available on the internet. The situation was resolved peacefully only when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had {{received a call from}} royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol's request for calm. The crowd dispersed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{previous}} year a perfume created for Hobson had been marketed as [...] "Great Expectations" [...] {{to coincide with}} her role as Estella Havisham in David Lean's film of that name, based on Charles Dickens' 1861 novel. In England, this attracted the custom of [...] then-Oxford University undergraduate Margaret Roberts, later British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who, a little daringly for the time, also shopped for [...] "push-up" [...] pink brassieres. In 1953, when Hobson starred in the musical The King and I in London, {{it was apparent that}} she had retained a Parisienne mix of chic and Boheminism. A Daily Mirror journalist described her [...] "pale, ladylike looks, her well-bred clothes ... she likes embroidery and painting", while a young Etonian who visited her dressing room recalled that [...] "it had been freshly painted pink and white for her, and was like entering a risqué French apartment". Ten years later, when Hobson's husband, the politician John Profumo, was involved in a sex scandal that threatened to destabilise the British government, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote that [...] "his [...] wife is very nice and sensible.

In January 2011, she told to OnTheRedCarpet.com that she has been working on her fifth album. Da Beat Kadetz formerly known as The TriGz may be working on the project, with Manny Streetz (from Da Beat Kadetz) as executive producer. Raven revealed to Billboard that she would like to work with Sean Garrett again and that it will be R with an [...] "alternative base for lyrics". In an interview with Broadway.com in March 2012, she confirmed that she has no plans to release a new album, saying that she [...] "couldn't quite get it together" [...] and that the music she had been working on [...] "wasn't going to be something sellable."

There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The March 1918 {{confrontation}} {{was triggered}} by an incident with the steamship Evelina. On 27 March 1918, fifty former Savage Division servicemen arrived in Baku on this ship to attend the funeral of their colleague Mamed Tagiyev, son of a famous Azerbaijani oil magnate and philanthropist, Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev. M. Tagiyev {{had been killed in}} a skirmish by Russian-Armenian forces in Lenkoran. Some sources state that when the soldiers got back on board the Evelina to sail out of Baku on 30 March 1918, the Soviet received information that the Muslim crew of the ship was armed and waiting for a signal to revolt against the Soviet. While the report lacked foundation, the Soviet acted on it, disarming the crew which tried to resist. Other sources claim that [...] Azerbaijanis were alarmed by the growing military strength of the Armenians in Baku, and called for the help of the Savage Division units in Lenkoran. Their arrival caused great concern among both Bolsheviks and Armenians, and when officials were sent down to the dockside to try to discover what their intentions were, they were driven back by gunfire, a number of them being killed. Eventually these newcomers were disarmed by a stronger Bolshevik force, but when more units of the Savage Division arrived on April 1, in MacDonell's words, [...] "the Baku cauldron boiled over". No <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> who fired the first shot, but very soon Baku became a battlefield, with trenches and barricades being hastily prepared throughout the city.|$|E

2500|$|More significantly, {{living and}} working {{conditions}} in East Germany were rapidly worsening under Communist rule. Tensions finally reached breaking point and a Workers’ Uprising took place on 17 June 1953, to be quickly and brutally crushed when Soviet tanks rolled in, {{and some of the}} worst violence occurred around Potsdamer Platz, where several people were killed by the Volkspolizei. No <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> how many people died during the uprising itself, or by the subsequent death sentences. There are 55 known victims, but other estimates state at least 125. West German estimates were much higher: in 1966 the West German Ministry for Inter-German Affairs claimed that 383 people died in the uprising, including 116 [...] "functionaries of the SED regime", with an additional 106 executed under martial law or later condemned to death, while 1,838 were injured and 5,100 arrested, 1,200 of these later being sentenced to a total of 6,000 years in penal camps. It was also claimed that 17 or 18 Soviet soldiers were executed for refusing to shoot demonstrating workers, but this remains unconfirmed by post-1990 research. Whatever the casualty figures, {{for the second time in}} eight years, the [...] "busiest and most famous square in Europe" [...] had been transformed into a bloody battleground. Columbushaus, with its H.O. store on the ground floor and military police station above, had been a prime target in the insurrection and been burnt out yet again, along with the Haus Vaterland and other premises. This time, they were not rehabilitated.|$|E

These are the real friends, the true friends, and they are worth more than all the others put together. Remember that if you are a true friend to any one, you will stand by him and help him, no matter what happens.

[...] I could but half follow it; enough, however, to be sure that, for all its {{humanity}} of irony, it wasn't so good as Molière. The acting was capital--broad, free and natural; the play of talk easier even than life itself; but, like all the Italian acting I have seen, it was wanting in finesse, that shade of the shade by which, and by which alone, <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> art.

60|$|It will, of course, be {{said that}} such a scheme as is set forth here is quite unpractical, and goes against human nature. This is {{perfectly}} true. It is unpractical, and it goes against human nature. This {{is why it is}} worth carrying out, and that is why one proposes it. For what is a practical scheme? A practical scheme is either a scheme that is already in existence, or a scheme that could be carried out under existing conditions. But it is exactly the existing conditions that one objects to; and any scheme that could accept these conditions is wrong and foolish. The conditions will be done away with, and human nature will change. The only thing that <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> about human nature is that it changes. Change is the one quality we can predicate of it. The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature, and not on its growth and development. The error of Louis XIV. was that he thought human nature would always be the same. The result of his error was the French Revolution. It was an admirable result.
