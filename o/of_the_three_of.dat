5|$|On December 8, 2011, it was {{reported}} that the show had begun casting Rachel's two fathers. It was not until January 17, 2012, that the actors playing Hiram and LeRoy Berry were identified as Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell, respectively. Two days later they were on the set, shooting their first scenes with Lea Michele, who tweeted a picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> them.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} {{design of the}} Class 87 was clearly derived {{from that of the}} Class 86; the only major detail differences were two front cab windows on the 87 instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the 86, and also the lack of headcode indicator boxes; by 1973, visual recognition of train reporting numbers by signallers was no longer necessary. The power and speed of the Class 87 was increased over that of the Class 86. Power output was increased to 5000hp to deal with the more demanding gradients on the northern half of the WCML such as Shap Fell and Beattock Summit, and the top speed was raised to 110mph (180km/h). The 87s were also fitted with multiple working equipment which enabled locomotives to work {{with other members of the}} class (and some Class 86s) while controlled by one driver.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time in his career, Rajamouli began casting after the script was {{completed}} because he felt the story required actors who were suitable for the roles. Nani, the protagonist, was the first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the main cast members to be chosen; he completed filming his scenes in 25 days. Samantha Ruth Prabhu, the second actor cast, was signed as the female lead. Rajamouli chose Sudeep to play the fly's human adversary after being impressed with the actor's performance in Rann (2010), and cast rapper Noel Sean as Nani's friend in the film. Sudeep drew inspiration for his role as the villain from the 1983 Kannada film Bhakta Prahlada; he was portraying a character he considered to be a [...] "bad guy" [...] with [...] "grey shades" [...] rather than an antagonist.|$|E
500|$|On August 7, 2005, {{just after}} 11:30p.m. EDT, Charles Gibson broke into local {{news in the}} eastern U.S. and regular {{programming}} on ABC's western affiliates to announce Jennings's death from lung cancer. He read a short statement from the family, and disclosed that Jennings had died in his New York apartment with his fourth wife, two children by his marriage to Kati Marton, and sister at his side. The anchor's ABC colleagues, including Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Ted Koppel, shared their thoughts on Jennings's death. The next morning, Brokaw and Rather fondly remembered their former rival on the morning news shows. [...] "Peter, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> us, was our prince," [...] said Brokaw on Today. [...] "He seemed so timeless. He had such élan and style." [...] Canada's television networks led off their morning news shows with the news of Jennings' death and had remembrances from their [...] "big three" [...] anchors, Peter Mansbridge at the CBC, Lloyd Robertson at CTV, and Kevin Newman (himself a former colleague of Jennings at ABC) at Global.|$|E

500|$|Although Barrowclough {{arrived in}} New Caledonia with his divisional {{headquarters}} in November 1942, {{the main body}} of his command was not in place until January 1943. Once on the island, his division began training in amphibious landings and jungle warfare to prepare it for forthcoming offensive operations while he set about dealing with the administrative and logistical problems of integrating the division into the American command structure. The 3rd Division was a division in name only, consisting of two infantry brigades [...] the 8th and 14th [...] instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> a conventional infantry division, and he unsuccessfully agitated for expansion. New Zealand could not supply enough manpower to have two full infantry divisions in the field, and the government's preference was to retain the 2nd New Zealand Division, still in North Africa, at full strength. Barrowclough was unhappy at this decision and his relationship with Army headquarters in Wellington and its Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Edward Puttick, became strained. The two brigade divisional structure also constrained how the 3rd Division could be employed in offensive operations, as it could not be used as a replacement for an American division due to its reduced number of personnel. Being the only unit in the South Pacific Area outside of the American supply chain also caused logistical problems as the division used British equipment.|$|E
2500|$|An {{estimated}} 12 {{million people}} fled or were {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union and non-German-speaking Central Europe, many of them being 'Volksdeutsche'. Most left the Soviet-occupied territories of Central and Eastern Europe; they comprised the largest migration of any European people in modern history. [...] The then three Allies had agreed to the expulsions during negotiations {{in the midst of}} war. The western powers hoped to avoid ethnic Germans being an issue again in Central and Eastern Europe. The three Allies at the Conference of Potsdam considered the [...] "transfer" [...] of [...] "German populations" [...] from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary an effort to be undertaken (see article 12 of the Potsdam Agreement), although they asked a halt because of the inflicted burden for the Allies to feed and house the destitute expellees and to share that burden among the Allies. France, which was not represented in Potsdam, rejected the decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> <b>of</b> Potsdam and did not absorb expellees in its zone of occupation. The three Allies had to accept the reality on the ground, since expulsions of Volksdeutsche and Central and Eastern European nationals of German or alleged German ethnicity who never had enrolled as Volksdeutsche, was going on already.|$|E
2500|$|Before Ellie died, {{she left}} a piece of advice for Peyton {{regarding}} Peyton's love life, telling her that it is {{never too late to}} pursue her romantic interest. Peyton decides to give love another try and dates Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy. Their relationship does not work out, since Pete is busy with touring. Peyton's father tells her to follow her heart and listen to it, so Peyton, considering Ellie's advice as well, decides to give Jake a visit in Savannah; she knows that she still loves him and feels that this will be enough for her to be happy. She renews her relationship with Jake and Jenny, and even goes far enough to propose marriage to Jake, who gladly accepts. This happiness fades once Jake overhears Peyton say, [...] "I love you, Lucas" [...] in her sleep. Peyton is then forced to confront Jake about the kiss she and Lucas shared {{on the day of the}} shooting. Jake figures that while Peyton loves him, she is in love with Lucas. He tells her to go back to Tree Hill, and to find out if Lucas is still in her heart. If he is not, Jake promises to still be there waiting. Peyton does as Jake has advised. In the finale, Brooke once again ends her friendship with Peyton after Peyton tells her that she still has romantic feelings for Lucas. Lucas later tells Brooke about the kiss in the library. At the end of the episode, Peyton burns pictures of herself with Brooke. She then picks up a picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> them (herself, Brooke and Lucas) and burns it.|$|E
