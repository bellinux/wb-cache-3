40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the impact of}} master scheduling models on student performance {{as reported by the}} AEIS database in the high schools of the SAISD. General student performance and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills were the primary measures for comparison. The SAISD made a transition from an A-B block schedule in 2002 to a traditional-seven period model in 2003. Conclusions have been made as to the degree of influence that traditional and block schedules have on student performance. The population of this study was the eight high schools of the SAISD. All students enrolled on these campuses were included in the data analysis. The population was 14, 418 students during the 2002 - 2003 school year and 13, 689 in 2003 - 2004. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were the measures utilized for the purposes of population comparisons and data review. Based on the findings of this study, the recommendations for practice indicate the following: 1. Attendance ratings did not return statistical significance <b>on</b> a <b>traditional</b> schedule. 2. Advanced Course participation and AP/IB testing results returned statistical significance <b>on</b> a <b>traditional</b> schedule. 3. SAT and ACT did not return statistical significance <b>on</b> a <b>traditional</b> schedule. 4. TAKS Campus Performance did not return statistical significance <b>on</b> a <b>traditional</b> schedule. 5. TAKS Reading/ELA, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies scores returned statistical significance <b>on</b> a <b>traditional</b> schedule. 6. African American, Hispanic and Special Education Performance returned statistical significance in TAKS Science and TAKS Social Studies <b>on</b> a <b>traditional</b> schedule. 7. White Performance returned statistical significance in TAKS Science <b>on</b> a <b>traditional</b> schedule. 8. Economically Disadvantaged Performance returned statistical significance in each area of the TAKS assessment <b>on</b> a <b>traditional</b> schedule. 9.

5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they had {{different}} views <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> culture. Some, such as Armijn and Alisjahbana, considered {{an understanding of}} Western culture and history key to development. Others, such Sanusi, emphasized the need for Eastern values, though they accepted some aspects of Western culture. Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share religious views. Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E

5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} by color schemes. He chose blue-green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still.

5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} traditional arts in his films, {{and two of}} them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos. This focus on aspects of traditional culture fell out of the mainstream after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the traditional styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E
5|$|Enomoto's fleet joined Sendai harbour on August 26. Although the Northern Coalition was numerous, it was poorly equipped, and relied <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> {{fighting}} methods. Modern armament was scarce, and last-minute {{efforts were}} made to build cannons made of wood and reinforced with roping, firing stone projectiles. Such cannons, installed on defensive structures, could only fire four or five projectiles before bursting. On the other hand, the daimyō of Nagaoka managed to procure two of the three Gatling guns in Japan and 2,000 modern French rifles from the German weapons dealer Henry Schnell.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Djajakusuma {{released}} his first film based <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> wayang stories, Lahirnja Gatotkatja; the traditional puppetry had fascinated {{him as a}} child, and he greatly enjoyed the character Gatotkaca. Shot in Yogyakarta, the film featured a cast of stars from Jakarta and local talent in backing roles. It was, however, controversial: dhalang and others versed in wayang argued that the director had ignored too many traditional aspects of the puppetry. That year Djajakusuma also served as production manager for Ismail's Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom) and directed Mak Tjomblang (Mrs. Tjomblang), a comedy adapted from Nikolai Gogol's 1842 drama Marriage.|$|E

5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir {{shows an}} {{affinity}} for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E
5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. Medicinal plant use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal remedies and so-called nutraceuticals, foods with supposed health benefits, is increasing quickly in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the war, veterans, the {{bereaved}} {{and the rest of}} society focused, to the point of obsession, with the problem of death. There was tremendous interest in creating war memorials that celebrated the themes of glory, heroism and loss. In part, there was a rupture or dislocation with the pre-war norms of how memorials should look and feel; communities sought to find new, radical ways to mourn the millions of dead, killed in an essentially modern conflict. In other ways, the building of memorials drew <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> forms and ideas, drawing on existing religious and architectural themes to explore loss and grief.|$|E

5|$|Mulan was {{originally}} conceived as an animated short in 1994, {{in which the}} heroine is depicted as a miserable Chinese girl who elopes to the West {{to be with a}} British prince. While developing a series of treatments based <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> stories and folk tales, children's book author Robert D. San Souci discovered the Ballad of Mulan, an ancient Chinese poem about Hua Mulan – a Chinese woman who replaces her ailing father in the army by disguising herself as a man. Fascinated by Hua Mulan's story, San Souci suggested the poem to Disney; the studio hired San Souci himself to write the film's treatment and story.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriters Jeb Stuart, Jeffrey Boam, Frank Darabont, and Jeff Nathanson wrote drafts before David Koepp's script {{satisfied}} the producers.

To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied <b>on</b> <b>traditional</b> stunt work instead of computer-generated stunt doubles, and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński studied Douglas Slocombe's style from the previous films.|$|E
