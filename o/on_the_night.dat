5|$|Schnaufer had to {{wait two}} months to achieve another victory, {{claiming}} the destruction of two Vickers Wellingtons and one Armstrong Whitworth Whitley within the space of 62 minutes {{in the early hours}} of 1 August. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer flew their first combat mission with the Lichtenstein radar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> 5/6 August 1942. Though they managed to make contact with an enemy aircraft they failed to shoot it down. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of the 24/25 August 1942, Schnaufer became an ace (his fifth aerial victory), when he filed a claim for another Wellington. This was the first time Rumpelhardt had guided him into contact using the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C UHF-band airborne radar. His next claim was made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 28/29 August. This was probably a No. 78 Squadron Halifax II W7809, piloted by Sergeant John A. B. Marshall of the Royal Australian Air Force, on a secondary attack against Saarbrücken. The primary attack force was targeting Nuremberg that night. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of the 21/22 December 1942, Schnaufer shot down an Avro Lancaster; his first victory against this type. It was Schnaufer's seventh victory. Schnaufer may also have been responsible for the destruction of another Lancaster that night. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer had attacked a Lancaster and observed it catching fire followed by the aircraft plunging earthwards. Hauptmann Wilhelm Herget from I./Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (I./NJG4—1st group of the 4th Night Fighter Wing) had also attacked a four-engined bomber in the same vicinity. The draw decided in favour of Herget who was given credit for the destruction of the Lancaster.|$|E
