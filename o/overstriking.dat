25|$|It is {{also common}} {{to trace the}} pitch of a phrase with a line above the phrase, {{adjacent}} to the phrase, or even through (<b>overstriking)</b> the phrase. Such usage is not supported by Unicode as of 2015, but the symbols have been submitted. The following example requires an SIL font such as Gentium Plus.|$|E
500|$|The European Commission also {{specified}} a euro logo with exact proportions and foreground {{and background}} colour tones. While the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape, font designers {{made it clear}} that they intended to design their own variants instead. Typewriters lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital 'C', backspacing and <b>overstriking</b> it with the equal ('=') sign. Placement of the currency sign relative to the numeric amount varies from nation to nation, but for texts in English the symbol (or the ISO-standard [...] "EUR") should precede the amount.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pinnacle}} {{of this kind}} of technology was the IBM Electronic Typewriter series. These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory. With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically backspacing and then <b>overstriking</b> the previous characters with minimal marring of the paper. White cover-up ribbons were used with fabric ink ribbons, [...] or an alternate premium design featured plastic lift-off correction ribbons which were used with carbon film typing ribbons. [...] This latter technology actually lifted the carbon film forming a typed letter, leaving nothing more than a flattened depression in the surface of the paper, with the advantage that no color matching of the paper was needed.|$|E
50|$|If a king <b>overstrikes</b> another king's coins, {{this is an}} {{important}} evidence to show that the overstriker reigned after the overstruck. <b>Overstrikes</b> may indicate that the two kings were enemies.|$|R
50|$|One <b>overstrike</b> is known, of a coin of Strato and Agathokleia over a coin of Diomedes. This <b>overstrike</b> could {{indicate}} that Diomedes fought over the central {{areas of the}} Indo-Greek territories with Strato and Agathokleia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overstrike</b> 9 {{is brought}} to Raven's {{underwater}} Triton Base, where it is revealed that Dalton's suspicions were correct, as Fable was in league with Raven. At the same time, Naya is reunited with her estranged father, Luther, who seeks aids their escape. <b>Overstrike</b> 9 then goes to the base's Fuse core and prepare to detonate it but first {{had to deal with}} Ivan Sovlenko, who purposely injects himself with Fuse to create illusions but they defeat him. <b>Overstrike</b> 9 then escapes the destruction of the base.|$|R
5000|$|Additional APL {{characters}} were available by <b>overstriking</b> one character with another. For example, the log symbol(⍟) {{was formed by}} <b>overstriking</b> [...] with [...] This extended the graphic capabilities of the earlier teleprinters, but made it more complicated to correct mistakes and editing program lines.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{typewriter}} substitutions made by <b>overstriking</b> a Latin {{letter with}} a virgule: ...|$|E

50|$|One <b>overstrike</b> is known, of Epander over Philoxenus.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Overstrike</b> 9 is next sent to Karakoram {{in search}} of Luther and Fable. But at the same time, Fable betrays Raven, {{revealing}} to be in league with a mysterious organization only known as [...] "the Order". He coerced half of Raven to defect and steal the corrupted Fuse. <b>Overstrike</b> 9 is unable to attempt pursuit. For their failure, the client that hired the team rescinded their contract. However, Naya convinces the team that her father {{might be able to}} help them locate the Fuse and reveals that she had located his safe house in Jodhpur. With Burgess' aid, <b>Overstrike</b> 9 storms Luther's compound at the same time Fable's loyalists assault it. Fighting their way through both way through both Raven factions, <b>Overstrike</b> 9 manages to locate Luther and enlist his aid against Fable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overstrike</b> {{was also}} used to {{simulate}} boldface letters with line printers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overstriking</b> of longer {{sections}} of text, {{such as in}} , can also be produced in many text processors as text markup as a special form of understriking.|$|E
50|$|An overline, overscore, or overbar, is a {{typographical}} {{feature of}} a horizontal line drawn immediately above the text. In mathematical notation, an overline {{has been used}} for a long time as a vinculum, a way of showing that certain symbols belong together. The original use in Ancient Greek was to indicate compositions of Greek letters as Greek numerals. In Latin it indicates Roman numerals multiplied by a thousand and it forms medieval abbreviations (sigla). Marking one or more words with a continuous line above the characters is sometimes called <b>overstriking,</b> though <b>overstriking</b> generally refers to printing one character on top of an already-printed character.|$|E
50|$|<b>Overstriking</b> {{can be used}} to make boldface text by {{printing}} {{the same}} line twice without advancing the paper. It can also be used to make underlined text by printing a line of underscore characters atop the text.|$|E
5000|$|The {{existence}} of numerous <b>overstrikes</b> helps locate {{the reign of}} Heliokles II {{in relation to other}} Indo-Greek kings. Heliokles overstruck coins of Agathokleia, Strato I, and Hermaeus. Conversely, Amyntas overstruck coins of Heliokles II. These <b>overstrikes</b> would suggest that Heliokles II reigned around 95 - 85 BCE, and was a contemporary of Amyntas and Hermaios ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Overstrike</b> 9 {{goes into}} space, where Fable was {{deploying}} satellites to fire Fuse-powered missiles {{to create an}} extinction event and force the world into ending conflict, framing Raven as a scapegoat. As a demonstration, Fable wipes out Munich. <b>Overstrike</b> 9 manages to prevent Fable from firing anymore by launched AI-controlled shuttles into destroying the satellites. They then arrive at the last vault of corrupted Fuse. They managed to destroy {{it at the same}} time Fable engages them in a powered exoskeleton. After a vigorous battle, <b>Overstrike</b> 9 is able to vaporize Fable before narrowly escaping the space station's destruction. Then suddenly, their shuttle collides with debris.|$|R

5000|$|Atlas Autocode's syntax {{was largely}} similar to Algol, {{though it was}} {{influenced}} by the output device which the author had available, a Friden Flexowriter. Consequently, it allowed symbols like [...] "½" [...] for [...] ".5" [...] and the superscript 2 for [...] "to the power of 2". The Flexowriter supported <b>overstriking</b> and therefore AA did as well — up to three characters could be overstruck as a single symbol. For example, the character set had no [...] "↑" [...] symbol, so exponentiation was an overstrike of [...] "|" [...] and [...] "*". The aforementioned underlining of keywords could also be done using <b>overstriking.</b> The language is described in detail in the Atlas Autocode Reference Manual.|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} {{set for the}} APL programming language includes several characters that were printed by <b>overstriking</b> other characters on printing terminals such as the IBM 2741, for example the functions ⌽ and ⊖ {{may be used to}} reverse the elements of an array.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after the}} Battle of Boyacá (7 August 1819), General Simón Bolívar {{authorized}} an emergency issue, which {{was produced by}} <b>overstriking</b> about 112 kg of royalist macuquinas. They were first put into circulation on 12 November 1819. Most of this coin was sent to Venezuela.|$|E

50|$|Overtype mode {{can also}} be {{referred}} to as over script mode, and is sometimes erroneously referred to as <b>overstrike</b> mode, which is a typography term.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overstrikes</b> of Nahapana's coins by the {{powerful}} Satavahana king Gautamiputra Satakarni {{have been found in}} a Southern Gujarat hoard at Jogalthambi. This suggests that Gautamiputra defeated Nahapana.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{scholarship}} has however largely accepted {{that what was}} originally {{supposed to be a}} [...] "joint issue" [...] was in fact a mule; in other words, a mistake occurred in the process of <b>overstriking</b> the original coin, and it was accidentally issued with both king's standards.|$|E
5000|$|In Microsoft Word, <b>overstriking</b> of text can be {{accomplished}} with the [...] field code. The field code [...] produces [...] and the field code [...] produces [...] (Doesn't work in Word 2010; {{it is necessary to}} insert MS Equation object).Windows: Alt+0773 (once before character, one more time after character).|$|E
5000|$|In Numismatics {{overstrike}} {{refers to}} the image on a coin which has been coined more than once. <b>Overstriking</b> is done deliberately when the first strike is unsatisfactory, or accidentally if the blank slips out of place or if the dies judder, resulting in a slight doubling of the design.|$|E

50|$|New <b>overstrikes</b> were {{introduced}} by vendors as they produced versions of APL tailored to specific hardware, system features, file systems, and so on. Further, printing terminals and early APL cathode-ray terminals {{were capable of}} displaying arbitrary <b>overstrikes,</b> but as personal computers rapidly replaced terminals as a data-entry device, APL character support was now provided as an APL Character Generator ROM or a soft character set rendered by the display device. With {{the advent of the}} modern PC, APL characters were defined in specific fonts, eliminating the distinction between overstruck characters and standard characters.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: O: head of river-god StrymonR: tridentThis coin {{was struck}} by Serdi tribe in 187-168 BC or later. It's an <b>overstrike</b> on {{official}} Macedonian coin and imitates another Macedonian type.|$|R
5000|$|In typography, {{overstrike}} is {{a method}} of printing characters that are missing from the printer's character set. The character was created by placing one character on another one — for example, <b>overstriking</b> [...] "L" [...] with [...] "-" [...] resulted in printing a [...] "Ł" [...] (L with stroke) character.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also common}} {{to trace the}} pitch of a phrase with a line above the phrase, {{adjacent}} to the phrase, or even through (<b>overstriking)</b> the phrase.

50|$|Some {{typewriters}} have non-spacing keys used as diacritical marks. After the typist pushes, say, acute accent ◌́ the caret {{does not}} move. This allows the typist to overstrike this mark by a spacing letter, say, e and obtain é, an accented letter. Due to geometrical restrictions of a monospaced font, {{the result could}} not always be perfect. For example, <b>overstriking</b> unlikely was a feasible method to produce uppercase accented letters, such as É.|$|E
50|$|The <b>overstrike</b> {{capability}} of the printer was used to generate {{a wide range of}} grey-scale equivalents. Many images were scanned, pixelated and could be reproduced on the 1403, most notably the Mona Lisa.|$|R
50|$|Sasan (45-50 CE) was an Indo-Scythian king, and {{the nephew}} of Aspavarma, whom he succeeded. As {{indicated}} by coins hoards and <b>overstrikes,</b> Sasan {{is thought to have}} been a contemporary of Kujula Kadphises and Mujatria.|$|R
