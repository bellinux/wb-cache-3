Fully aware of their daughter's occupation, Kim's parents remain completely supportive of her crime-fighting endeavors so long as she continues to obey curfew, but tend to be more-so concerned about the character's performance in school, as well as her love life. Lacking a secret identity, Kim is world famous and her profession, although accepted by her peers, is seldom acknowledged by her schoolmates <b>or</b> <b>teachers.</b> Captain of her high school's cheerleading squad, Kim Possible also explores the highs and lows of Kim's life as a high school student attempting to navigate dating, academics, homework, exams and eventually learning to drive, all the while striving to maintain a healthy work-life balance; fighting crime typically comes to Kim more naturally than the more standard components of adolescence.|$|E

25|$|This period saw {{the growth}} of Vashnavism Sampradayas (denominations or communities) under the {{influence}} of scholars such as Ramanujacharya, Vedantha Desikacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya and Vallabhacharya. Bhakti poets <b>or</b> <b>teachers</b> such as Manavala Mamunigal, Namdev, Ramananda, Surdas, Tulsidas, Eknath, Tyagaraja, and many others influenced the expansion of Vaishnavism. These Vaishnavism sampradaya founders challenged the then dominant Shankara's doctrines of Advaita Vedanta, particularly Ramanuja in the 11th century, Vedantha Desikacharya and Madhva in the 13th, building their theology on the devotional tradition of the Alvars (Shri Vaishnavas).|$|E

Hamilton’s municipal government, civic boosters and ordinary residents lured the university to the city with grants of land and money in 1930.

Reliability is not considered an intrinsic, unchanging property of tests because it could change when used under different conditions or {{in a different context}} than where it had been studied before.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} article, we {{will argue that}} a non-educational {{perspective}} needs to be adopted to understand work-related learning complexity because such learning typically occurs implicitly via work activities {{and not as a}} result of formally organized learning programs or events. From an educational point of view, the distinction between guided, experiential and selfdirected learning is an attractive one that is often used. These can be described as follows: For guided learning, a trainer <b>or</b> <b>teacher</b> makes all of the relevant decisions and the learner follows these. The trainer <b>or</b> <b>teacher</b> decides on the learning goals, the learning strategies, and how to measure learning outcomes. The trainer <b>or</b> <b>teacher</b> also provides evaluation, feedback, and rewards. The learner commits himself to the decisions made and follows the trainer <b>or</b> <b>teacher.</b> For experiential learning, {{it is not so much}} a <b>teacher</b> <b>or</b> trainer or even predetermined goals that control the learning, but circumstances, personal motives, the ideas of others, discoveries, experiments, and so forth. Learning is a side effect of the activities one undertakes, and an explicit set of learning goals simply does not exist. For self-directed learning, the learner plays an active and explicit role in th...|$|R

25|$|Violence in Portuguese schools {{became an}} {{educational}} {{issue for the}} first time during the 1990s, mainly through the persistence of parental associations and teacher claims. However, it must be said that {{this was not the first}} time that violence appeared in Portuguese schools as a significant situation. After the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974 the occurrence of violent situations reached the highest point. This was a politically socialized and framed violence, quite different from the kind of violence we can find today. That one had political programs, this one is quite anomic. Its origin is very diverse, from poverty to psychological problems. Theft, random or systematic physical aggression, bullying, destruction of school <b>or</b> <b>teachers</b> properties are realities which become current in many schools.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, all states and territories in Australia {{developed}} intended curriculum documents {{largely based on}} OBE for their primary and secondary schools. Criticism arose shortly after implementation. Critics argued that no evidence existed that OBE could be implemented successfully on a large scale, in either the United States or Australia. An evaluation of Australian schools found that implementing OBE was difficult. Teachers felt overwhelmed {{by the amount of}} expected achievement outcomes. Educators believed that the curriculum outcomes did not attend {{to the needs of the}} students <b>or</b> <b>teachers.</b> Critics felt that too many expected outcomes left students with shallow understanding of the material. Many of Australia’s current education policies have moved away from OBE and towards a focus on fully understanding the essential content, rather than learning more content with less understanding.|$|E
25|$|In 1864, Hubbard {{became an}} Anglican deaconess and became {{active in the}} deaconess {{movement}} after a friend introduced her to the society. The movement, which had been present in the Anglican church since 1850, focused on providing community life for women and training them work with the poor as nurses <b>or</b> <b>teachers.</b> She began serving with the society and organized a number of gatherings. In 1871, she published a pamphlet entitled Anglican Deaconesses; or Is There No Place for Women in the Parochial System? This work contained descriptions of meetings that she had with church leaders, including Harold Browne. She also met with potential donors {{to tell them about}} the movement. She also published a letter in John Bull detailing the aims of the movement. However, she later became discouraged by the slow pace of growth that came to characterise the movement.

25|$|A {{study of}} the longest spaceflight {{concluded}} that {{the first three weeks}} are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment. Skylab three crews remained one, two, and three months respectively, long term crews on Salyut6, Salyut7, and the ISS last about five to six months and Mir expeditions often lasted longer. The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language. First-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language; second and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages. The ISS is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into 'host' or 'guest' categories as with previous stations and spacecraft, and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way. Crew members with a military pilot background and those with an academic science background <b>or</b> <b>teachers</b> and politicians may have problems understanding each other's jargon and worldview.|$|E

500|$|Typically, {{children}} first master counting. When given {{a problem that}} requires that two items and three items be combined, young children model the situation with physical objects, often fingers or a drawing, and then count the total. As they gain experience, they learn or discover the strategy of [...] "counting-on": asked to find two plus three, children count three past two, saying [...] "three, four, five" [...] (usually ticking off fingers), and arriving at five. This strategy seems almost universal; children can easily pick it up from peers <b>or</b> <b>teachers.</b> Most discover it independently. With additional experience, children learn to add more quickly by exploiting the commutativity of addition by counting up from the larger number, in this case starting with three and counting [...] "four, five." [...] Eventually children begin to recall certain addition facts ("number bonds"), either through experience or rote memorization. Once some facts are committed to memory, children begin to derive unknown facts from known ones. For example, a child asked to add six and seven may know that [...] and then reason that [...] is one more, or 13. Such derived facts can be found very quickly and most elementary school students eventually rely on a mixture of memorized and derived facts to add fluently.|$|E
