40|$|Objective: The role of {{biomechanics}} {{during the}} <b>overhead</b> <b>lift</b> {{has not been}} widely investigated. This study aimed to evaluate any change in biomechanics between safe minimum and safe maximum <b>overhead</b> <b>lifts</b> during the WorkHab Functional Capacity Evaluation. Method: Thirty healthy participants (age range 18 – 22 years) were videotaped completing the <b>overhead</b> <b>lift.</b> Images at the beginning (0 / 3), one-third (1 / 3), two-thirds (2 / 3), and end of lift (3 / 3) were collected for the minimum and safe maximum lifts Measurement of joint angles of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and sagittal spine using Dartfish Prosuite software was completed. Paired t-tests were used to analyse the differences in joint angles between lifts. Results: Participants' biomechanics changed between the minimum and maximum lifts In comparison to minimum lifts, there was increased wrist ulnar deviation (10. 50, 95 % CI 4. 39, 16. 61, p= 0. 002), increased shoulder flexion (7. 26, 95 % CI 0. 50, 14. 01, p= 0. 036), increased thoracic extension (− 3. 40, 95 % CI − 5. 36, − 1. 45, p= 0. 001), increased lumbar extension (3. 75, 95 % CI 1. 39, 6. 12, p= 0. 003), and decreased elbow flexion (− 11. 28, 95 % CI − 18. 57, − 4. 00, p= 0. 004) in the maximum lifts. Conclusions: The {{results of this study}} provide insight into biomechanical changes during the <b>overhead</b> <b>lifting,</b> and support the clinical judgements made by the WorkHab assessor in determining safe maximal lift...|$|R

Sometimes modern cements, mastics and epoxy resins are used, usually on specialist {{applications such as}} stone cladding. Metal fixings, from simple dowels and cramps to specialised single application fixings, are also used. The precise tolerances necessary make this a highly skilled job.|$|R

50|$|At the 2004 Skate America, {{shortly after}} Tatiana Totmianina's accident, Obertas {{fell out of}} an <b>overhead</b> <b>lift,</b> a hand-to-hand lasso lift, but Slavnov managed to catch her to prevent her head hitting the ice. The pair won silver at the 2005 European Championships and were fifth at the World Championships. During the 2005-06 season, they were fourth at Europeans, and then {{finished}} eighth at both the Olympics and Worlds.|$|R
50|$|Olympic lifters also tape their wrists, {{preventing}} exaggerated {{and uncomfortable}} joint movement during lifts. For particularly heavy <b>overhead</b> <b>lifts,</b> a taped wrist enables the lifter to regulate wrist extension and delimit {{the translation of}} the radius and ulna distal heads. However, while taped wrists can prevent wrist and forearm injuries in the short-term, excessive use can lead to weakened connective tissue in the area, increasing the risk of pain and injury.|$|R

5000|$|Because of {{the size}} and weight of the engine {{assembly}} and the difficulties of removing and transporting them for repair, they are typically serviced on-site in stationary applications and in the ship or locomotive in transportation applications. Designing the engine for [...] "easy" [...] service is done out of necessity rather than the desire to increase engine serviceability. Power assemblies are large and heavy and <b>overhead</b> <b>lifting</b> equipment sufficient to lift the fixture and assembly are required.|$|R
50|$|Four skating is {{a figure}} skating and roller skating discipline. Fours teams consist of two ladies and two men. The sport {{is similar to}} pair skating, with {{elements}} including <b>overhead</b> <b>lifts,</b> twist lifts, death spirals, and throw jumps, {{as well as the}} elements of single skating in unison, pairs elements in unison and unique elements that involve all four skaters. Fours is not an Olympic event and is rarely competed. It was discontinued from the Canadian Figure Skating Championships following the 1996-1997 season.|$|R
50|$|A {{patient lift}} (patient hoist, jack hoist, {{hydraulic}} lift) may {{be either a}} sling lift or sit-to-stand lift. This is an assistive device that allows patients in hospitals and nursing homes and people receiving home health care to be transferred between a bed and a chair or other similar resting places, {{by the use of}} electrical or hydraulic power. Sling lifts are used for patients whose mobility is limited. Sling lifts are mobile (or floor) <b>lifts</b> or <b>overhead</b> <b>lifts</b> (suspended from ceiling, wall-mounted or overhead tracks).|$|R

50|$|Guillotine locks are {{relatively}} uncommon, {{but many are}} found on the waterways of East Anglia. The advantages over the more traditional design are that the lock occupies less space, does not require room to swing open, and is quicker to fabricate and install. It also acts as a tidal lock, able to hold back water whichever side is higher, and can function as a stop lock (for example, Lifford Lane stop lock near Kings Norton Junction). It is mechanically more complex, however, requiring {{the use of a}} gantry and <b>overhead</b> <b>lifting</b> gear.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{weightlifter}} he won {{the gold}} medal in the 82.5 kg division at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Between 1923 and 1926 he set eight official world records. In 1924, he became the first person to clean and jerk more than 400 pounds, using the non-revolving barbells of that time. In 1930, he became the first person to complete an <b>overhead</b> <b>lift</b> of the Apollon Railway Car Wheels, an awkwardly-shaped 166 kg (366 lb) barbell-shaped set of train wheels used by the stage strongman Louis Uni, and the predecessor of [...] "Apollon's Axle".|$|R
5000|$|Pair skating is {{a figure}} skating discipline. International Skating Union (ISU) {{regulations}} describe pair teams as consisting of [...] "one lady and one man." [...] The sport is distinguished from ice dancing and single skating by elements unique to pair skating, including <b>overhead</b> <b>lifts,</b> twist lifts, death spirals, and throw jumps. Pair teams also perform {{the elements of}} single skating in unison. The discipline requires similar technique and timing on all elements of the performance {{in order to create}} an impression of [...] "two skating as one". Serious skating accidents are most common in pairs.|$|R
