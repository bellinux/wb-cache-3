Without monitoring, agranulocytosis occurs in about 1% {{of people who}} take clozapine {{during the first few}} months of treatment; the risk of developing it is highest about three months into treatment, and decreases substantially thereafter, to less than 0.01% after one year.

Cole's intrepid voyager also may {{be read as a}} personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that unbridled westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and nature.|$|E

25|$|Chinanteca huipils are {{elaborate}} {{with the entire}} garment covered in woven and embroidered geometric designs in various colors, with the edges further decorated with ribbons. In Ojitlán, Oaxaca, Chinanteca women wear special huipils for their wedding, divided into three classes. The first is called “gala” or “red” {{which used to be}} the traditional wedding dress. However, because of its cost, few families can afford it. The second type is called “pavo” which is used for special occasions. It is similar to the first but with a less intense red and with smaller designs. The third type, called “pájaros y palomas” (birds and doves) is the most economical of the three and can be found fairly easily in markets. It is white with figures of birds and other animals in vivid and contrasting colors. This used to be reserved for women <b>of</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> or older but it has since been adopted by many.|$|E
25|$|In pre-Christian times, {{witchcraft}} was {{a common}} practice in the Cook Islands. The native name for a sorcerer was tangata purepure (a man who prays). The prayers offered by the ta'unga (priests) to the gods worshiped on national or tribal marae (temples) were termed karakia; those on minor occasions to the lesser gods were named pure. All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down {{from generation to generation}} with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men <b>of</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Peter Hames has {{summarized}} three {{themes of}} Loves of a Blonde {{that have been}} discussed repeatedly in critical writings on the film, themes that have {{been something of a}} constant throughout Forman's career: [...] "the impermanence of young love, the confusion and despair <b>of</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age,</b> and the gulf between the generations". [...] Another theme that is often identified involves the awkwardness and confusion surrounding sex in a repressed society. Most critics have also commented on the confluence of comedy and sadness in the film's depiction of everyday life in a totalitarian state, [...] although while some consider Loves of a Blonde Forman's most pointed critique of Czech society under communism, others point out that the grim conditions are not solely due to misguided public policy, but that individuals create their own isolation as well.|$|E

500|$|Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{remarked that}} Neighborhoods is [...] "a {{different}} beast {{than any of}} the cheerfully snotty early Blink-182 albums, as the band picks up the gloomy thread left hanging on its eponymous 2003 album ... yet it's far better to hear Blink-182 grapple with adolescent angst via the perspective <b>of</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> than vainly attempting to re-create their youth. Perhaps Blink could stand to sharpen their words but it's better that they concentrated on their music, creating a fairly ridiculous yet mildly compelling prog-punk spin on the suburbs here." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME remarked that it finds the band [...] "completely at ease with its past and confident enough to acknowledge their early work, with nods on the album to moments from their whole back catalogue." [...] British rock magazine Kerrang awarded Neighborhoods a [...] "good" [...] three out of five score in their review. Critic Mark Sutherland noted that while [...] "the finished product is inevitably disjointed, Blink emerge as a surprisingly serious rock proposition." [...] He went on to add that, [...] "While it occasionally sounds like Mark, Tom, and Travis are playing three different songs at once ('Kaleidoscope', 'After Midnight'), the band are still capable of producing genuine moments of magnificence." [...] Scott Heisel of Alternative Press attributed the album's flaws to the lack of an outside producer and the fact that only a few tracks were written and recorded as a group: [...] "Blink-182's members are still capable of writing good songs, but without a strong outside influence (i.e., a producer) and no real desire or effort to consistently work {{in the same room with}} one another, the amount of truly transcendent, classic material is minimal. Ultimately, Neighborhoods is a slightly awkward entry in the band's catalog that shows as much potential as it does flaws." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the new politics <b>of</b> the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> {{in an age}} of ‘global modernity’, a term coined by Arif Dirlik to describe the appearance of ‘alternative’ or ‘multiple’ modernities. The politics <b>of</b> the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> has been recognised by a number of medieval and postcolonial scholars who have understood the role that the category <b>of</b> the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> has played in the historic construction of Western modernity and Western imperialism. This political use <b>of</b> the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> in constructing Western imperialism and modernity was underpinned by the colonial discourse identified by Johannes Fabian as the ‘denial of coevalness’. Yet, {{in an age of}} multiple modernities, we need to understand the changing political frontiers of multiple medievalisms. This paper indicates the particular way in which radical Islamist movements, especially ISIL, use and relate to the Islamic past and calls for further analysis of the new politics <b>of</b> the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages.</b> This paper discusses the global turn and the shift in the politics <b>of</b> the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> from the denial of coevalness to contemporaneity, and signposts problems and future directions that this shift indicates for medieval history...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In this study, {{the effects}} of {{laughter}} therapy on a laughter index, cortisol and immunoglobulin <b>of</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> women were examined. Methods: A quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group pre/post-test design were used. The participants (n = 54) included 27 {{in the experimental group}} and 27 in the control group. The data were collected from February through March of 2013. The experimental group participated in laughter therapy for 40 minutes per session, five times a week for a period of 2 weeks. The tool was used to measure pre/post-test laughter index, cortisol and immunoglobulin <b>of</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> women. Results: The re-sults showed that laughter therapy was effective in increasing the laughter index (p <. 001), and immunoglobulin IgA (p <. 001), IgG (p <. 001), and IgM (p =. 010). Also, the stress hormone, cortisol <b>of</b> <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> women decreased but non-significantly (p =. 158).
