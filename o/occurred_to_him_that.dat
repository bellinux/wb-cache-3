25|$|The {{pioneer of}} {{lacrosse}} in Victoria (and Australia as a whole) was a Canadian, Lambton L. Mount. He {{came to the}} Victorian goldfields as a fourteen-year-old {{with his family in}} 1853 {{but it was not until}} 1875 that he was moved to revive his early boyhood memories of lacrosse. After watching the football final between Carlton and Melbourne in that year it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> lacrosse was a superior game.|$|E
25|$|Having seen Pietersen play at {{a school}} cricket festival, Clive Rice invited him to sign for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Pietersen {{accepted}} without hesitation, keen {{to make the most}} of top-class cricket under a coach for whom he had the utmost admiration. He did not at this stage contemplate forsaking his nation; nor had it yet <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the decision would eventually have to be taken.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{quit his}} job as a truck driver to enter the film {{industry}} after seeing Star Wars in 1977. When Cameron read Syd Field's book Screenplay, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a 10-minute science-fiction script with two friends, titled Xenogenesis. They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot {{trying to figure out how}} to get it running.|$|E

60|$|Maitland bowed again, and {{wondered}} more than ever. It did <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>that</b> the fewer people knew of so delicate a business {{the better for}} Margaret's sake.|$|R
60|$|It never <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> but {{for that}} picture or book, the artist would, in all probability, have been mouching about with a pipe in his mouth, getting into trouble.|$|R
25|$|In 2006 California {{attorney}} and Marshall Islands lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former {{administrator of the}} Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct for allegedly authorizing 36 payments of $9,000 vis a vis a pre-existing contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court, each written out to Hills, but funneled to Abramoff. Hills, trusting Sanchez as a court official at face value, assumed {{that this was a}} temporary circumstance and agreed to help facilitate transition for {{what he thought was a}} standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills received no compensation. Before indictments or investigations were initiated, Hills halted his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was potentially suspicious behavior to public officials when it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> something may be wrong. In 2007, superseding indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez, and in 2008 further related indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.|$|E
25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was {{at the other end of}} the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E
500|$|Because Scheyer's {{talent was}} obvious {{by the time}} he was set to start high school, many people {{encouraged}} his parents to move so he could attend a high school with a powerhouse basketball program. [...] The move was recommended so that he would have a greater chance of success. Scheyer shrugged off the suggestion, telling his parents: [...] "We'll just do it here. We'll build the success at Glenbrook North." [...] His father said: [...] "I get chills thinking about it. [...] That wasn't my vision. [...] It wasn't Laury's. It wasn't his coaches'. [...] That was Jon's vision, and it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> anything else would happen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Up the river--at the 'Blue Boar', sir," [...] {{said the}} instructor, quite innocently--for {{it did not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> this simple little bit of {{information}} was just so much incriminating evidence against Sheen.|$|R
60|$|It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> her {{position}} {{in his home}} would be rather a peculiar and difficult one. <b>To</b> <b>him</b> it seemed just as if one of his men friends {{were going to be}} introduced to his mother, only nicer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I dare say," [...] said Silverbridge, {{turning away}} into the path where he saw Miss Boncassen {{standing}} with some other ladies.

500|$|While it is {{possible}} to apply Locke's general principles of education to all children, and contemporaries such as Coste certainly did so, Locke himself, despite statements that may imply the contrary, believed that Some Thoughts applied only to the wealthy and the middle-class (or as they would have been referred to at the time, the [...] "middling sorts"). One of Locke's conclusions in Some Thoughts Concerning Education is that he [...] "think a Prince, a Nobleman, and an ordinary Gentleman's Son, should have different Ways of Breeding." [...] As Peter Gay writes, [...] "t never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> every child should be educated or that all those to be educated should be educated alike. Locke believed that until the school system was reformed, a gentleman ought to have his son trained at home by a tutor. As for the poor, they do not appear in Locke's little book at all." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the Bureau of Ordnance {{continued}} {{working on}} a larger barbette design, while the Bureau of Construction and Repair utilized the smaller barbettes in the final planning of the new battleships. As the bureaus were independent of one another, they {{did not realize that}} the two plans could not go together until November 1938, when the design was {{in the final stages of}} refinement. By this time, the ships could not use the larger barbette, as it would require extensive alterations to the design and would result in substantial weight penalties. The General Board was astounded; one member asked the head of the Bureau of Ordnance if it had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Construction and Repair would have wanted to know what turret his subordinates were working on [...] "as a matter of common sense". A complete scrapping of plans was avoided only when designers within the Bureau of Ordnance were able to design a new 50-caliber gun, the Mark 7, that was both lighter and smaller in outside diameter; this allowed it to be placed in a turret that would fit in the smaller barbette. The redesigned 3-gun turret, equipped as it was with the Mark 7 naval gun, provided an overall weight saving of nearly [...] to the overall design of the Iowa class.|$|E
2500|$|According to Adams, {{the idea}} for the title {{occurred}} to him while he lay drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe, and it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> [...] "somebody ought to write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". He later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{wondered}} why the men {{had gone into the}} jungle, nor did it ever <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> one could become lost in that maze of undergrowth which <b>to</b> <b>him</b> was as simple as is the main street of your own home town to you.|$|R
60|$|In thus {{sending her}} away, Sir Thomas perhaps {{might not be}} {{thinking}} merely of her health. It might <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Crawford had been sitting by her long enough, or he might mean to recommend her as a wife by shewing her persuadableness.|$|R
60|$|Waynefleet swung {{himself down}} stiffly and {{vanished}} into the snow. He was half frozen, {{and it did not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Nasmyth had only one hand with which to loose the harness. It is also possible that he would have made no protest if it had.|$|R
2500|$|In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Flitwick {{insists that}} Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem is lost, {{and he is}} {{described}} by Harry (along with Dumbledore) as having been a [...] "model student" [...] who supposedly never entered the Room of Hidden Things, and so it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the diadem could be hidden there. Before the Battle of Hogwarts, Flitwick helps to put protective charms around the castle to hinder Lord Voldemort and his oncoming Death Eaters, and later fights the intruders in the battle, battling Corban Yaxley and later defeating Dolohov.|$|E
2500|$|Laird {{recalled}} that {{the publication of}} the first issue of his and Eastman's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin's uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: [...] "if we hadn't gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, and who knows what might have happened differently {{as a result of that}} delay?" [...] It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> [...] "there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of" [...] a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his [...] "good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out" [...] (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those [...] "involved in charitable organizations").|$|E
2500|$|Grabovica was {{a village}} {{inhabited}} by Croats. It {{had been under}} ARBiH control since May 1993 {{and the relationship between}} the residents of Grabovica and the ARBiH soldiers who were stationed there was good and, as there was no other accommodation available for the arriving troops, {{they were supposed to be}} posted with the inhabitants of the village. The reputation of the arriving troops of the 9th and 10th Brigades was bad, because of [...] "criminal and uncontrolled" [...] elements within. According to ICTY, the evidence showed that members of both brigades not only demonstrated a lack of discipline, but also committed different forms of misappropriation (thefts etc.) The Trial Chamber noted in this respect the testimony of the 1st Corps Commander, Vahid Karavelić, who, while knowing of breaches of discipline and previous behaviour of members of these brigades, said that it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> they might commit atrocities against civilians in Grabovica.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certain," [...] assented Mr. Ball, eagerly, [...] "certain you do." [...] It did {{not seem}} <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> it was unfair <b>to</b> make <b>him</b> {{responsible}} for the scurvy ingratitude of his townsmen. He stepped gingerly down into the dust and climbed up on the tool box.|$|R
60|$|As his {{weakness}} grew {{his ambition}} fell away, {{and his heart}} turned back to nature and to the things he had known in his youth, to the kindly people of the olden time. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{the spirit of the}} country might have changed.|$|R
6000|$|Now Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, {{had been}} going to {{introduce}} the gallant sergeant through the channel of [...] "bad characters."

He tried another preamble.|$|R
2500|$|According to Schafer, {{he came up}} {{with the}} idea for Full Throttle while {{listening}} to a traveller's tales about time spent in an Alaskan biker bar. As he listened, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> [...] "bikers are kind of like pirates — like another culture that people don't have a window into most of the time, but [...] has its own rules", and might provide a neat alternative to a fantasy setting. So he began his research into biker culture, reading Hunter S. Thompson's [...] The game originally would have featured an interactive sequence where Ben undergoes a peyote-induced hallucinogenic trip. This was eventually cut from the game, because the developers couldn't get it to [...] "work out" [...] with the publisher. The concept eventually became the basis of Psychonauts. Schafer recalls the reaction from the management at LucasArts as being one of [...] "'We can't believe we paid you to write this.'" [...] "They hated it" [...] he stated. In an interview with Gamasutra, Shafer stated that the biker aesthetics of the game were an appeal to fantasy. He stated the team was depending [...] "on the [...] secret desire to be a biker: big, tough, cool. Riding a huge hog..." [...] On the game's setting he noted that often it was mistaken for a post apocalyptic world, however he clarified that the setting was simply an alternate world which was more desolate than our own. [...] "It was never meant to be post-war or anything like that." ...|$|E
60|$|It then {{suddenly}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> having spoken in English, {{she could not}} have understood him.|$|E

60|$|But the {{accusation}} was made <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{again and again}} till it wounded him, and he gave up that notion of a mutual joke with his kind friend at Desmond Court.

60|$|He {{turned away}} a trifle abruptly, and Leland felt a thrill of gratitude. He had many {{friends on the}} prairie, and knew the worth of them, though it did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he had done quite {{sufficient}} to warrant their good-will. Just then he was most clearly sensible that there was much against him.|$|R
60|$|Alton's hat was capacious, and he {{had worn}} it during the two years which had elapsed since his last visit to Vancouver, {{but it did not}} seem <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> it was in any way an unusual {{receptacle}} for sugar. His companion, however, laughed a little as he stirred the sticky mass round with his wet fingers.|$|R

60|$|And when {{he comes}} to the next inn, and snuggles in his well-warmed, bed, he thinks of the wild waste of heather where he might have had to spend the night alone beneath the stars; nor does it, I think, <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the broad road he treads all day was once a {{trackless}} heath itself.|$|R
60|$|Watching her he beheld {{the scarlet}} stain that overspread her face. He read in {{it at first}} confusion, until the gleam of her blue eyes {{announced}} its source to lie in anger.

60|$|Presently he halted, {{at a point}} {{close to}} one end of her walk, and {{crouched}} down. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he was trespassing upon her privacy. She was a stranger whom he loved because she was Lucy Blake, grown from child to woman. He was concerned with finding himself, {{so that when he}} faced her again he would know what to do, to say.|$|R
