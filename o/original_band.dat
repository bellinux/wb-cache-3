5|$|Artists {{who have}} contributed to Bush's own albums include Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Nigel Kennedy, Gary Brooker, Danny Thompson, and Prince. Bush {{provided}} backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled Wouldn't Change a Thing by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the <b>original</b> <b>band</b> that was later to become the KT Bush Band. The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, was released on Azulay's album Out of the Ashes.|$|E
5|$|An {{essential}} element for the band’s image is the Slipknot logo. The nonagram {{was created by}} the band’s members around the same time the band was founded. The nonagram is arguably the best-known sigil of Slipknot and it represents a 9 point star – a symbol of unity, loyalty, friendship and remembrance. The logo is composed of three equilateral triangles each rotated at 0, 40, and 80 degrees. Each star point was meant to stand for each of the nine members of the <b>original</b> <b>band.</b> Despite popular belief, the nonagram is not a Satanist symbol, nor does it reflect something perverted, evil, unclean or sadistic. On the contrary, just as the band has officially declared on various occasions, the nonagram marks the unbreakable bond between its members. Chris Fehn is one of the band’s members who has a nonagram tattoo.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, as Presley's fame was soaring, he {{received}} a draft notice from the Memphis Draft Board, but was given a deferment so he could finish his latest film production, King Creole. During Presley's two-year military service in Germany, RCA Victor and Paramount Pictures progressively released material he had completed prior to enlistment. During his last months in the Army, Presley experimented with new sounds and worked on further improving his performance. He also prepared material for his first session in Nashville, which was scheduled to take place upon his return. Presley returned to the United States on March 2, 1960. The singer reunited with his <b>original</b> <b>band</b> The Blue Moon Boys, excepting bassist Bill Black. The first session was held on March 20–21 and the second session was held on April 3–4, completing the album.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, CEO Robert California (James Spader) surprises Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{when he asks}} to {{join their}} band after he finds them having a jam session in the warehouse. Soon thereafter, California's friends, skilled musicians themselves, arrive to join in. Not having brought their own instruments, two of them take over Kevin's drums and Darryl's synthesizer, while Andy's {{acoustic}} guitar is {{drowned out by the}} newcomer's electric guitar. The three of them are thus relegated to playing percussion. Andy, Kevin and Darryl, with the help of warehouse worker Val, realize that they were ousted, and after a failed attempt to try getting their <b>original</b> <b>band</b> roles back, they instead satisfyingly jam outside by themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} {{subsequently}} focused on solo projects, and Ray and Dave released their own studio albums. Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio reunion of the <b>original</b> <b>band</b> members in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed {{much interest in}} playing together again. Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer Dave Clarke as the Kast Off Kinks. Gosling and Dalton retired in 2008 and were replaced in the band by former Kinks members Jim Rodford and Ian Gibbons. Ray Davies, Pete Quaife and Bob Henrit have occasionally made guest appearances with the group at Kinks fan club conventions.|$|E
5|$|Ray Davies {{released}} the solo album Storyteller, a companion piece to X-Ray, in 1998. Originally written {{two years earlier}} as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother. Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network VH1 launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled VH1 Storytellers. Dave Davies spoke favourably of a Kinks reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both of the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again. However, hopes for a reunion were dashed when in June 2004 Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily impairing his ability to speak and play guitar. Following Dave's recovery, the Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005, with {{all four of the}} <b>original</b> <b>band</b> members in attendance. The award was presented by The Who's guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, a longtime Kinks fan and friend of Ray Davies. The induction helped fuel sales for the group; in August 2007, a re-entry of The Ultimate Collection, a compilation of material spanning the band's career, reached number 32 on the UK Top 100 album chart and number one on the UK Indie album chart.|$|E

25|$|With the <b>original</b> <b>band</b> back {{together}} for the first time in five years, Bad Brains signed to the Maverick Records label for the 1995 release God of Love. In support of the album, Bad Brains opened for the Beastie Boys on the Ill Communication tour, and headlined a U.S. tour with then-unknown Deftones. However, the reunion did not last for long, because of H.R.'s erratic behavior while performing with the band, such as verbally attacking their manager, beating a skinhead and a security guard in separate incidents throughout the tour. These incidents prompted the Bad Brains to break up once again.|$|E
40|$|A serious {{vegetation}} and environment destruction {{caused by the}} 921 earthquake in central Taiwan, how to effectively and fast monitor the change of environmental restoration is important in recent years. Jou-Jou mountain landslide areas in Nantou County {{was chosen as the}} research site couples with the three phases of SPOT imagery taken on 3 / 12 / 2001, 6 / 11 / 2002, and 12 / 7 / 2004. Histogram matching method was applied to do the radiometric corrections of the analyzed imageries for the further interpretation of land use classification. Image classification using supervised back propagation neural network show that there is no significant difference to increase the overall accuracy of classification after the radiometric corrections. Besides the <b>original</b> <b>bands,</b> vegetation index such as: NDVI, CMFI, MSAVI and IPVI which derived from SPOT satellite imagery were added separately to study the effects of vegetation index on the classification accuracy of the imageries using supervised back propagation neural network. The results show that the best combination is <b>original</b> <b>bands</b> plus CMFI and the second one is <b>original</b> <b>bands</b> plus MSAVI in overall accuracy and/or Kappa index. The performance of classification derived from the <b>original</b> <b>bands</b> plus CMFI for the three phases of imagery were 86. 00 ％, 83. 60 ％, and 87. 20 ％ in overall accuracy and/or 0. 7782, 0. 7520, and 0. 7887 in Kappa index, respectively. The image interpretations for the treatment of CMFI and/or MSAVI added were better than that of the <b>original</b> <b>bands</b> only in 2001. The treatment of CMFI added was better than that of the <b>original</b> <b>bands</b> only existing in 2002 and 2004. The variations of accuracy for the image classification at different stages were strongly affected by the terrain and/or spectral resolution of imagery. 九二一地震造成台灣中部大面積植生及環境破壞，如何有效快速的監測環境變遷為近年來研究重點。本研究以九九峰為研究試區，利用 2001 年 12 月 3 日、 2002 年 11 月 6 日及 2004 年 7 月 12 日所拍攝的 SPOT 衛星影像，以波段值域分布最廣的 2004 年衛星影像為基準，使用直方圖匹配法對其它二期衛星影像做輻射校正，影像再進行原始波段土地利用分類的判釋。以倒傳遞類神經網路進行分析，並比較校正前後衛星影像分類準確度，結果顯示輻射校正在提升分類準確度上並無顯著差異。為提高分類準確度，本研究再分別將原始波段加入NDVI、CMFI、MSAVI及IPVI等四種植生指標，並利用監督式倒傳遞類神經網路進行影像分類，探討植生指標於影像分類上使用差異及對分類準確度的提升。結果顯示三個時期之整體準確度皆以CMFI較高，其次為MSAVI；供試之三期影像其CMFI整體準確度分別為 86. 00 ％ 、 83. 60 ％ 及 87. 20 ％ ；Kappa值分為 0. 7782 、 0. 7520 及 0. 7887 ，其中 2001 年以CMFI及MSAVI的判釋結果優於原始波段， 2002 年及 2004 年僅以CMFI的判釋結果優於原始波段。衛星影像灰度值會因季節不同及地面引起的陰影等而有不同的波譜特性，九九峰地形複雜陰影較多且受限於衛星影像空間解析度，以致在三期影像中有不同的分類成果。摘 要	I ABSTRACT	II 目 錄	III 表 次	V 圖 次	VI 一、前言	 1 二、前人研究	 2 （一）遙感探測	 2 1. 定義	 2 2. 原理	 2 3. 感測器種類	 4 4. 影像種類	 5 （二）法國SPOT衛星影像	 6 （三）遙測影像分類法	 12 1. 傳統型衛星影像分類法	 12 2. 非傳統型衛星影像分類法	 16 （四）倒傳遞類神經網路	 20 （五）植生指標	 23 三、材料與方法	 25 （一）試區概述	 25 （二）研究流程	 27 （三）研究材料	 29 （四）分析方法	 30 1. 影像輻射校正	 30 2. 植生指標	 32 3. 倒傳遞類神經網路	 34 4. 準確度評估	 35 5. 誤差矩陣	 37 四、結果與討論	 39 （一）直方圖輻射校正	 39 （二）植生指標輔助效果之探討	 47 1. 2001 年分類成果	 47 2. 2002 年分類成果	 51 3. 2004 年分類成果	 55 4. 綜合討論	 59 五、結論	 61 引用文獻	 6...|$|R
