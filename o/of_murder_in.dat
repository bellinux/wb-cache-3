5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused <b>of</b> <b>murder.</b> <b>In</b> one case, he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution.
