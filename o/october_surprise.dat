50|$|Two {{studies by}} The Lancet on {{mortality}} in Iraq {{before and after}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq have been described as <b>October</b> <b>surprises</b> for the 2004 and 2006 elections.

Eyewitnesses claimed they saw pieces falling from the plane just moments after it took off. Rumours have continued to fuel conspiracy theories that the crash was in fact an assassination, but no firm evidence has come to light. There were even different theories as to whom would have been the target of such an assassination, as Francisco de Sá Carneiro was travelling with the Defence Minister, Adelino Amaro da Costa, who had said he had documents relating to the <b>October</b> <b>surprise</b> conspiracy theory and was planning on taking them to the United Nations General Assembly.|$|E
