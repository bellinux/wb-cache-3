5|$|The program {{initially}} {{focused on}} boys aged 11 to 18, {{but as the}} movement grew, the need became apparent for leader training and programs for younger boys, <b>older</b> <b>boys,</b> and girls. The first Cub Scout and Rover Scout programs were {{in place by the}} late 1910s. They operated independently until they obtained official recognition from their home country's Scouting organization. In the United States, attempts at Cub programs began as early as 1911, but official recognition was not obtained until 1930.|$|E
5|$|Totti {{was born}} in Rome to parents Lorenzo and Fiorella Totti. He {{was raised in the}} Porta Metronia neighbourhood. As a youngster he idolised ex-Roma captain Giuseppe Giannini, and {{regularly}} played football with <b>older</b> <b>boys.</b> Totti began to play youth team football at the age of 8, with Fortitudo, later joining Smit Trastevere and Lodigiani. After he {{came to the attention of}} scouts, his mother refused a lucrative offer from Milan in order to keep him in his home town. Although his youth club initially had come to an agreement to sell Totti to the Lazio youth side, one of Roma's youth coaches, Gildo Giannini, persuaded his parents to let him join the Roma youth squad in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann {{attended}} the Kaiser Franz Joseph Staatsoberrealschule (state secondary school) in Linz, {{the same high}} school Adolf Hitler had attended some 17 years before. He played the violin and participated in sports and clubs, including a Wandervogel woodcraft and scouting group that included some <b>older</b> <b>boys</b> {{who were members of}} various right-wing militias. His poor school performance resulted in his father withdrawing him from the Realschule and enrolling him in the Höhere Bundeslehranstalt für Elektrotechnik, Maschinenbau und Hochbau vocational college. He left without attaining a degree and joined his father's new enterprise, the Untersberg Mining Company, where he worked for several months. From 1925 to 1927 he worked as a sales clerk for the Oberösterreichische Elektrobau AG radio company. Next, between 1927 and early 1933, Eichmann worked in Upper Austria and Salzburg as district agent for the Vacuum Oil Company AG.|$|E
5|$|Run by the Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Church {{until its}} closure, the orphanage housed males from {{the ages of}} 5 to 16 initially. Its {{capacity}} {{was intended to be}} 100 children, but this peaked to more than 200 during the Second World War. By the 1970s, the orphanage began taking in female orphans from St. Joseph's because of declining numbers of males. Until its closure, the orphanage took in more than 2,500 individuals for various reasons. Only four per cent of those who stayed there were actually orphans. The orphanage's residents were given a religious education, and were trained in agriculture. Accounts by former residents state that they suffered severe beatings and punishments, and that they were issued a single set of clothing that was rarely washed. Another claims that some residents endured sexual abuse and rape, not only by the staff, but by <b>older</b> <b>boys,</b> and the caretaker. However, others state that the nuns were tough but fair and remained in contact with them.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer {{also became}} {{active in the}} Sunday school movement, {{founding}} the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She {{and two of the}} ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighborhood. Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil. The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for <b>older</b> <b>boys,</b> one for younger boys and one for girls. While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately. The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—"a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them". Trimmer's schools became so well known and admired that Raikes, Trimmer's initial inspiration, recommended those who needed assistance organizing a Sunday school to turn to Trimmer; even Queen Charlotte asked Trimmer's advice on founding a Sunday school at Windsor.|$|E

Masters (teachers) still dressed in suits, with gowns and mortar boards, and used corporal punishment, sometimes publicly after lessons. There was a strict dress code, and sixth formers could wear boaters on summer days. Lockers did not need locks. <b>Older</b> <b>boys</b> expected respect and obedience from younger boys, although not fagging. Praeposters and monitors could administer punishment. They also had their own rooms, and later {{the use of the}} Pavilion, off limits to masters and the lower forms.

25|$|The {{period during}} which {{adolescents}} were judged as desirable extended from puberty until {{the appearance of a}} beard, the hairlessness of youth being an object of marked taste among the Greeks.

25|$|The group {{begins to}} {{investigate}} the victims, hoping to understand {{the mind of the}} murderer by understanding his victims.

Georgio eventually left home and lived on the streets as a male-for-male prostitute. They also read the emerging science of psychology, such as the works of William James. Another body is discovered, and the evidence suggests that the victim knew his attacker. The team also deduces that the killer's agility on rooftops suggests that he is familiar with mountain- or rock-climbing.|$|E
