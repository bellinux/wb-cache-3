5|$|Originally {{called the}} Long Range Patrol (LRP), the unit {{was founded in}} Egypt in June 1940 by Major Ralph A. Bagnold, acting under the {{direction}} of General Archibald Wavell. Bagnold was assisted by Captain Patrick Clayton and Captain William Shaw. At first the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> from New Zealand, but they were soon joined by Southern Rhodesian and British volunteers, whereupon new sub-units were formed and the name was changed to the better-known Long Range Desert Group (LRDG). The LRDG never numbered more than 350 men, all of whom were volunteers.|$|E

Scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted to obliterate their SS blood group tattoo. Hampel escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Fallingbostel.|$|E

5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented {{the evidence against}} the defendants. He later stated {{in an interview that}} he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion that the party was banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. Several months after the elections, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} year, 736, Asad's forces cleared the {{mountains}} of Upper Tokharistan from the remnants of Harith's supporters. The fortress of Tabushkhan, where many of Harith's followers and relatives had found refuge, was besieged by Juday' al-Kirmani. After they surrendered, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> executed, while the rest were sold into slavery. Harith himself {{on the other hand}} continued to escape capture. In 737, Asad led his troops again north of the Oxus in a retaliatory campaign against Khuttal, whose ruler had allied himself with both Harith and the Turgesh. While the Arab troops were dispersed ravaging the countryside, the Turgesh khagan Suluk, responding to the pleas for help by the Khuttalan king, launched an attack that precipitated a headlong flight back by Asad's army across the Oxus. The Turgesh followed after them and attacked and captured the Arab baggage train on 1 October, before both sides settled for winter quarters. Harith now emerged from hiding and joined the khagan.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1941, No. 6 Commando, {{along with}} a {{detachment}} from No. 12 Commando and some Norwegian soldiers, took part in Operation Kitbag, a raid on the town of Florø in Norway. Embarking on the HMS Prince Charles, an infantry landing ship, they set out from Scapa Flow. During the voyage an incident occurred while some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> priming grenades for the raid which resulted in six men being killed and another 11 seriously wounded. Nevertheless, {{the decision was made}} to continue with the raid, although it was eventually called off when the naval commander was unable to locate the fjord upon which Florø was located due to navigational difficulties.|$|E

5|$|Texians began {{crossing}} {{the river at}} about 7pm. Less than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> mounted, slowing their progress as they tracked the Mexican soldiers. A thick fog rolled in around midnight, further delaying them. At around 3 am, Texians reached the new Mexican camp. A dog barked at their approach, alerting the Mexican soldiers, who began to fire. The noise caused one of the Texian horses to panic and throw his rider, who suffered a bloody nose. Moore and his men hid in the thick trees until dawn. As they waited, some of the Texians raided a nearby field and snacked on watermelon.|$|E
5|$|The battle exacted a heavy {{toll on the}} 1st Airborne Division {{from which}} it would never recover. Three {{quarters}} of the formation were missing when it returned to England, including {{two of the three}} brigade commanders, eight of the nine battalion commanders and 26 of the 30 infantry company commanders. Some 500 men were still in hiding north of the Rhine, and over the coming months many of these were able to escape: initially in Operation Pegasus. New recruits, escapees and repatriated POWs joined the division over the coming months, but the division was still so much weakened that the 4th Parachute Brigade had to be merged into the 1st Parachute Brigade, and the division as a whole could barely produce two brigades of infantry. Between May and August 1945, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> sent to Denmark and Norway to oversee the German surrenders there but on their return the division was disbanded.|$|E

5|$|The next year, 736, Asad's forces {{cleared the}} {{mountains}} of Upper Tokharistan from the remnants of Harith's supporters. Many of the latter, including some of Harith's relatives, were blockaded in the fortress of Tabushkhan by Asad's commander Juday' al-Kirmani with 6,000 men, until they surrendered. According to al-Tabari, 400 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> executed, and the other defenders, including women and children, were sold into slavery. The same year, Asad moved the capital of Khurasan to Balkh. This decision was influenced by several factors: Balkh was the traditional, pre-Islamic capital and remained so {{in the eyes of}} the local population; it lay closer to Tokharistan, where Asad concentrated his military activities; and it was settled by reliable Syrians, removed from the factional politics of the Khurasani Arabs of Marw. At this time, Asad also captured and executed one of the leaders of the Khurasani Hashimiyya movement, Ammar ibn Yazid, known as Khidash, by crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of Magaw's outer lines {{to the south and}} east of the fort, the general American retreat towards the perceived safety of the fort took place. To the south, the third defensive line had never been completed so Cadwalader had nowhere left to retreat to except the fort. To the north, the riflemen under Rawlings still held, but barely, as there were fewer riflemen than before and because the increased amount of firing had jammed some of the men's weapons, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> forced to push boulders down the hill at the attacking Hessians. The American battery at Fort Washington was silenced by Pearl. By this time, the riflemen's fire had almost ceased, and the Hessians slowly advanced up the hill and engaged the Americans in hand-to-hand fighting. Overpowering the Americans, the Hessians {{reached the top of the}} hill and swarmed into the redoubt with a bayonet charge, capturing it quickly.|$|E
5|$|In response, unions {{across the}} United States {{prepared}} {{a general strike}} {{in support of the}} event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed {{as a result of the}} Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.|$|E

5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E
5|$|While the {{division}} was never deployed overseas, its headquarters staff was deployed to Norway and briefly {{fought in the}} Norwegian Campaign. Afterwards, {{the division}} was deployed to Northern Ireland for almost three years {{as a result of}} rumours of a German intention to invade. In Northern Ireland, the division manned static defences, conducted internal security, and trained for future operations. Returning to England, the division participated in numerous military exercises and was scheduled to join the 21st Army Group for the Operation Overlord; the Allied invasion of German-occupied France. By late 1943, this role had been taken away from the division and it was assigned to train replacements for combat units. Throughout 1944, the division aided Overlord in various deception formats while most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> posted to combat formations within 21st Army Group. In late 1945, the division was re-organized as a light division and was going to be deployed to the Far East to fight Imperial Japan. The Japanese surrender resulted in the move not being made, and in November the division was disbanded.|$|E
