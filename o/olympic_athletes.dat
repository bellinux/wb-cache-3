5|$|Mortimer {{appeared}} at the Olympic Heroes Parade in Toronto. For the event, Paralympic athletes were given rooms at a hotel {{on the outskirts of}} Toronto while <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes</b> were housed downtown and received gifts; at a dinner, the Paralympians were relegated to a different dining room. A Canadian Paralympic Committee spokesperson told The Spectator that the committee scrambled during the Paralympics to have their athletes included, and with their limited funding they could not afford the perks received by the <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes.</b>|$|E

However, the Žirmūnai section of this street was renamed Olimpiečių ("Olympians") in 2000 to commemorate the achievements of Lithuanian <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes</b> in the Sydney Olympics.|$|E

5|$|More than 50 <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes</b> have {{attended}} UH, bringing home 33 medals, including 19 gold. Former Olympian and UH alumnus Leroy Burrell returned as the men's {{track and field}} head coach in 1998. In April 2014, Kelvin Sampson was named the eighth men's basketball head coach. Ronald Hughey is the current women's basketball coach. On December 9, 2016, Major Applewhite was named Head Coach of the Cougar Football team.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Games in London {{increased}} {{this record}} to 206 nations, even though only 204 NOCs were represented.

One athlete from South Sudan also competed as an independent athlete, since the nation had not yet formed a National Olympic Committee after its independence in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Paralympics {{has grown}} from a small {{gathering}} of British World War II veterans in 1948 {{to become one of the}} largest international sporting events by the early 21st century. The Paralympics {{has grown from}} 400 athletes with a disability from 23 countries in 1960 to thousands of competitors from over 100 countries in the London 2012 Games. Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes,</b> but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, many <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes</b> began using drugs {{to improve their}} {{athletic}} abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach. The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry {{found that he was}} under the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is {{the first}} such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia {{ratified}} the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics, while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics. This led the media to highlight {{the contrast between the}} achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes.</b> The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.|$|E

5|$|Calgary and Canmore {{became the}} heart of winter sport in Canada as CODA (now known as Winsport Canada) {{established}} itself as the nation's leader in developing elite athletes; in 2006, one-quarter of Canada's <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes</b> were from the Calgary region and three-quarters of its medalists were from or trained in Alberta. Canada was not a winter sport power in 1988; the nation's five medals in Calgary was its second best total at a Winter Olympics behind the seven it won at the 1932 Lake Placid Games. After 1988, Canada won {{an increasing number of}} medals at each successive Olympics, culminating in a 26-medal performance in 2010 that included a Winter Olympic record of 14 gold medals, one more than the previous record holders Soviet Union (1976) and Norway (2002).|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Village {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, the parking lot was being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over Lake Shore Drive. This location was meant to enable 88% of the <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes</b> to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E
5|$|The record-breaking {{performance}} {{brought him}} an invite from the Berlin IAAF Golden League meet, although organising group Euromeetings condemned the move. Revelations in Chambers' autobiography Race Against Me brought further controversy {{as the book}} had in-depth accounts of his past drug abuse and claimed drug use remained rife in athletics, estimating that half the American <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes</b> in Beijing had used illegal substances. Chambers signed a statement with UK Sport, verifying that he believed the information to be true, which brought a close to the organisation's inquiries into his drug use. An IAAF investigation concluded that the book demanded no further action on their part. Olympic gold medallist and anti-drugs campaigner Ed Moses gave his support, saying that Chambers admissions provided a useful insight, but that athletes and administrators remained in denial about {{the high levels of}} doping in athletics.|$|E
5|$|The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) is an {{international}} multi-sport event organized by the International Olympic Committee. The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18. The idea of such an event was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998. On 6 July 2007, International Olympic Committee (IOC) members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved {{the creation of a}} youth version of the Olympic Games, with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city, whereas the traveling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC. These Games will also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet <b>Olympic</b> <b>athletes.</b>|$|E
