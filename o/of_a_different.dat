The theoretical part is mainly focused on describing the best practices of integration and inclusion <b>of</b> pupils with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mother tongue. In the empirical part are processed data from observations of lessons, interviews with teachers, educational consultant, school principals and interviews and published case studies <b>of</b> students with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mother tongue. Research case study approach is the inclusion <b>of</b> pupils with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mother tongue and the questionnaire.

5|$|Of {{the species}} of Marginatae {{associated}} with willow, five (I.salicis-herbaceae, I.substellata, I.praetervisa, I.salicis and I.mixtilis) {{can be readily}} distinguished from I.saliceticola as their spores feature distinct, strongly protruding excrescences. In addition, they are found in vastly different habitats: I.mixtilis and I.praetervisa favour willow only in montane habitats, while I.salicis-herbaceae and I.substellata grow exclusively in montane habitats. I.salicis is rare in Nordic countries, and is typically collected from dunes. Of the other two listed by Vauras and Kokkonen, the spores of I.dunensis are distinctly larger and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> shape to those of I.saliceticola, and the cystidia are shorter. While the species is typically found on the beach, it grows on fine sand, {{and has not been}} recorded in Finland. I.obtusiuscula also has larger spores <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> shape, and they are a darker colour, owing to their thick cell walls. Phylogenetic analysis of the respective internal transcribed spacer sequences has confirmed that I.obtusiuscula and I.saliceticola are separate species.|$|E

Sophocles influenced the development of drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot.
