Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle.

500|$|Films noir tend {{to revolve}} around heroes {{who are more}} flawed and morally {{questionable}} than the norm, often fall guys {{of one sort or}} another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as [...] "alienated"; in the words of Silver and Ward, [...] "filled with existential bitterness". Certain archetypal characters appear in many films noir—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant. From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Past,</b> and Kiss Me Deadly. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: Laura, The Killers, The Naked City, and Touch of Evil.|$|E

500|$|Thematically, films noir {{were most}} {{exceptional}} for the relative {{frequency with which}} they centered on women of questionable virtue—a focus that had become rare in Hollywood films after the mid-1930s {{and the end of}} the pre-Code era. The signal film in this vein was Double Indemnity, directed by Billy Wilder; setting the mold was Barbara Stanwyck's unforgettable femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson—an apparent nod to Marlene Dietrich, who had built her extraordinary career playing such characters for Sternberg. An A-level feature all the way, the film's commercial success and seven Oscar nominations made it probably the most influential of the early noirs. A slew of now-renowned noir [...] "bad girls" [...] followed, such as those played by Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), Ava Gardner in The Killers (1946), and Jane Greer in <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Past</b> (1947). The iconic noir counterpart to the femme fatale, the private eye, came to the fore in films such as The Maltese Falcon (1941), with Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade, and Murder, My Sweet (1944), with Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe. Other seminal noir sleuths served larger institutions, such as Dana Andrews' police detective in Laura (1944), Edmond O'Brien's insurance investigator in The Killers, and Edward G. Robinson's government agent in The Stranger (1946).|$|E
500|$|Film noir, {{to which}} lower budgets lent themselves, became {{something}} of a house style at the studio, indeed, the RKO B Stranger on the Third Floor (1940) is widely seen as initiating noir's classic period. Its cinematographer, Nicholas Musuraca, who began at FBO in the 1920s and stayed with RKO through 1954, is a central figure in creating the look of classic noir. Design chief Albert D'Agostino—another long-termer, who succeeded Van Nest Polglase in 1941—and art director Walter Keller, along {{with others in the}} department, such as art directors Carroll Clark and Jack Okey and set decorator Darrell Silvera, are similarly credited. The studio's 1940s list of contract players was filled with noir regulars: Robert Mitchum (who graduated to major star status) and Robert Ryan each made no fewer than ten film noirs for RKO. Gloria Grahame, Jane Greer, and Lawrence Tierney were also notable studio players in the field. Freelancer George Raft starred in two noir hits: Johnny Angel (1945) and Nocturne (1946). Tourneur, Musuraca, Mitchum, and Greer, along with D'Agostino's design group, joined to make the A-budgeted <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Past</b> (1947), now considered one of the greatest of all film noirs. Nicholas Ray began his directing career with the noir They Live by Night (1948), the first of a number of well-received films he made for RKO. [...] A big money maker were the dark and moody Dick Tracy detective film series; [...] Dick Tracy, Detective [...] (1945), Dick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946) (as [...] "Filthy Flora", character actress Esther Howard chewed up the scenery in this one), Dick Tracy's Dilemma (1947), and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome (1947), (RKO wanted to title this feature [...] "Dick Tracy vs Karloff", but Boris Karloff nixed that idea, even though he did play the part of Gruesome).|$|E
500|$|Most of the Hollywood films {{considered}} to be classic noirs, fall {{into the category of}} the [...] "B movie". Some were Bs in the most precise sense, produced to run on the bottom of double bills by a low-budget unit of one of the major studios or by one of the smaller Poverty Row outfits, from the relatively well-off Monogram to shakier ventures such as Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC). Jacques Tourneur had made over thirty Hollywood Bs (a few now highly regarded, most forgotten) before directing the A-level <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Past,</b> described by scholar Robert Ottoson as [...] "the ne plus ultra of forties film noir". Movies with budgets a step up the ladder, known as [...] "intermediates" [...] by the industry, might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances. Monogram created Allied Artists in the late 1940s to focus on this sort of production. Such films have long been colloquially known as B movies. Robert Wise (Born to Kill , The Set-Up [...] ) and Anthony Mann (T-Men [...] and Raw Deal [...] ) each made a series of impressive intermediates, many of them noirs, before graduating to steady work on big-budget productions. Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer John Alton, a specialist in what James Naremore called [...] "hypnotic moments of light-in-darkness". He Walked by Night (1948), shot by Alton and though credited solely to Alfred Werker, directed in large part by Mann, demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of [...] "police procedural" [...] crime dramas. It was released, like other Mann-Alton noirs, by the small Eagle-Lion company, it was the inspiration for the Dragnet series, which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951.|$|E

Early in his Hollywood career, he demonstrated his independent streak and broke his studio contracts to gain total control over his projects, forming his own movie company, Bryna Productions, named after his mother. In 1947 Douglas made <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Past</b> (UK: Build My Gallows High). He starred in this film with Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer.

2500|$|Double Indemnity {{has been}} {{compared}} with Wilder's other acclaimed film noir, Sunset Boulevard.

Besides Double Indemnity and Detour, voice-over is a key aspect of Mildred Pierce, Gilda, The Lady from Shanghai, and <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Past...</b> as well as many others." [...] Wendy Lesser notes that the narrator of Sunset Boulevard is dead before he begins narrating, but in Double Indemnity, [...] "the voice-over has a different meaning.

He was also undefeated in the his first 10 Tests as captain, the only one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 4 captains to do so. However, late in 2016, he accumulated consecutive Test series losses, which prompted a reshuffle of the selector's panel. He is also known for being reluctant to use spinners as he no longer bowls on a regular basis, and is very defensive when he does. Since the reshuffle, however, he has used Lyon and Steve O'Keefe in tandem more, which could be due to necessity in India's spin-friendly pitches.|$|E
