5|$|Forti {{produced}} a new chassis, the FG03, {{for the next}} race {{of the season in}} Imola. It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the <b>old</b> <b>car,</b> with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the <b>old</b> <b>car.</b> Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy's Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.|$|E
25|$|In Jordan, {{customs and}} sales tax reduced for all hybrid {{vehicles}} from 55% to 25% {{of the vehicle}} list price, 12.5% customs fees and sales tax, if the new hybrid is a replacement for an <b>old</b> <b>car</b> (more than 10 years age).|$|E
25|$|Drivers {{tested the}} CoT {{concurrently}} with the <b>old</b> <b>car</b> at some NASCAR tests and at special NASCAR-authorized sessions. Other testing sessions {{occurred at the}} half-mile Greenville-Pickens Speedway, Caraway Speedway in Asheboro, NC, and the one-mile North Carolina Speedway (now Rockingham Speedway), none of which were Sprint Cup tracks at the time (North Carolina Speedway was a regular venue until 2005), and therefore did not fall under NASCAR's restrictions.|$|E

30|$|Meanwhile, we can {{see that}} when the {{lifetime}} of passenger cars is extended, many <b>older</b> <b>cars</b> of relatively early model years remain (Fig.  3). When the lifetime is extended by 5  years, <b>older</b> <b>cars</b> manufactured and sold during 1993 – 2006 account for {{more than one-third of the}} total number of vehicles owned. Extending the lifetime reduces the demand for new <b>cars</b> and <b>older</b> <b>cars</b> of relatively recent model years.|$|R

25|$|For 1971, Williams {{purchased}} a year-old March 701, and ran Frenchman Henri Pescarolo. The team later upgraded {{to a new}} March 711, but results were difficult to come by. The <b>old</b> <b>car</b> was also entered for Max Jean at the French Grand Prix. After the success of 1969, Williams was now low on funds, living a hand-to-mouth existence from race to race. Pescarolo did, however, keep the outfit ticking over with fourth place at the British Grand Prix and sixth in Austria.|$|E

25|$|The ongoing {{saga of the}} Maxwell was {{initially}} interrupted after just five years, when on the October 18, 1942 broadcast Jack brought his car to a local junkyard and contributed it to the World War II junk salvage drive, receiving $7.50 in war stamps in exchange. However much of the radio audience may have remained unaware that the Maxwell was ever gone, because before long Jack was heard traveling around in a decrepit <b>old</b> <b>car</b> again, {{and by the end}} of the 1940s his car would once more be specifically identified as a Maxwell.|$|E
25|$|Although Shastri {{had been}} a cabinet {{minister}} {{for many years in}} the 1950s, he was poor when he died. All he owned at the end was an <b>old</b> <b>car,</b> which he had bought in instalments from the government and for which he still owed money. He was a member of Servants of India society (which included Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhle) which asked all its members to shun accumulation of private property and remain in public life as servants of people. He was the first railway minister who resigned from office following a major train accident as he felt moral responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Kart racing or karting is {{a variant}} of an open-wheel motor sport with simple, small four-wheeled {{vehicles}} called karts, go-karts, or gearbox karts depending on the design. Karts vary widely in speed and some can reach speeds exceeding 160mph, while go-karts intended {{for the general public}} in amusement parks may be limited to speeds of no more than 15mph. In the summer of 1956, hot rod veteran Art Ingels built the first go-kart out of <b>old</b> <b>car</b> frame tubing, welding beads, and a lawnmower motor, not realizing that he had invented a new sport and form of auto racing.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1981, Nilsen's {{landlord}} {{decided to}} renovate 195 Melrose Avenue, and asked Nilsen to vacate the property. Nilsen was initially {{resistant to the}} proposal, but accepted an offer of £1,000 from his landlord to vacate his Melrose Avenue address in order that the property could be renovated. He moved into an attic flat at 23D Cranley Gardens in the Muswell Hill district of north London on 5 October 1981. The day before he vacated the property, Nilsen burned the dissected bodies {{of the last five}} victims he had killed at this address upon a third and final bonfire he constructed in the garden behind his flat. Again, Nilsen ensured the bonfire was crowned with an <b>old</b> <b>car</b> tyre to disguise the smell of burning flesh (Nilsen had already dissected the bodies of four of these victims in January and August, and only needed to complete the dissection of Barlow for this third bonfire).|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that {{went out of business}} in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's <b>old</b> <b>car</b> was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more miles out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car’s clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.|$|E
500|$|Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) autopsy of the {{skeleton}} {{finds that the}} victim died in 1975, suggesting that Roche's killing spree started much earlier than the FBI had previously thought.

Mulder and Scully subsequently visit Roche in prison, hoping to learn {{the identities of the}} remaining two victims. Roche, however, tries to play mind games with Mulder. That night Mulder dreams of the night of Samantha's abduction, seemingly showing that his sister was abducted by Roche rather than aliens.|$|E
50|$|Joyriding was a {{major problem}} in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and {{accelerated}} in the 1990s, but has eased off since the year 2000 largely due to improved security standards on newer cars and the number of <b>old</b> <b>cars</b> with more basic security diminishing. Many surviving <b>older</b> <b>cars</b> have had modern security features fitted {{in order to reduce the}} risk of theft.|$|R

The car, a [...] "Paragon Panther", was the sole production of the Paragon motor-car company before it went bankrupt. [...] It is a four-seat touring car with an enormous bonnet, or hood. [...] After the restoration is complete, the car is named for the noises made by its starter motor and the characteristic two loud backfires it makes when it starts.|$|E
500|$|Hamming {{remained}} at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a {{post at the}} [...] Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs's <b>old</b> <b>car.</b> When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming. Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a [...] "computer janitor", he saw computer simulations of experiments {{that would have been}} impossible to perform in a laboratory.

Consequence of Sound's Sasha Geffen described the song as [...] "a counterintuitive gem" [...] and [...] "the sort of thing that rings beautifully from <b>old</b> <b>car</b> windows on hot summer evenings," [...] while Marissa G.

500|$|Two music videos, both {{directed}} by David LaChapelle, were shot {{for the song}} and its accompanying remix. The videos introduced a less demure image of Carey, one that received negative backlash from critics. She appears in the video with a lighter hair color than she had sported in the past, and wearing a series of revealing ensembles. Reviewers disregarded Carey's newer image, primarily her double-handkerchief bra, and likened her to younger pop singers such as Britney Spears, which they felt cheapened the singer. The video begins with Cameo driving all over a racetrack, while Carey, dressed in revealing clothing, is shown singing in various [...] "car girl" [...] positions at the track {{on a hot summer}} day. She flags down cars as the [...] "flag girl" [...] and dances as a [...] "tire girl" [...] in a kaleidoscope-inspired sequence, before jumping out of a pop out cake to the roars of the crowd below. [...] Several other scenes of Carey in a pink jumpsuit while riding on top of a race-car are shown, during which Cameo continues the race. A video was also made for the remix and retains most of the shots of the original. In it, Ludacris and Shawnna can be seen rapping together as they ride in an <b>old</b> <b>car,</b> while Da Brat and Twenty II rap together in a more modern car without a hood.|$|E
