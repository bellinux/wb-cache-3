5|$|The {{resulting}} skyscrapers reflected these debates: the Railway Exchange, the Peoples Gas and the Illinois Continental and Commercial Bank Buildings {{were each}} substantial, quarter-block wide palazzo cubes of common height, their facades divided into a classical tripartite design, and sporting classical columns and other features. Despite the apparent uniformity of design, individual buildings varied considerably in the detail <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> in effort {{to express their}} particular identities, the Peoples Gas Building using texture and the Railway Exchange Building white terracotta, for example.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of memorials produced {{a lot of}} business in all the countries involved in the war. In Britain and Australia, stone masons provided large quantities of mass-produced design, often advertising through catalogues, while professional architects acquired the bulk of the specialised commissions for war memorials, making use of their professional organisations. Professional sculptors argued that their work was superior and more appropriate than that of architects, but they received far fewer commissions. British stone masons provided cheap products through catalogues. In France, funeral directors played a large part in the business of producing designs, producing catalogues <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> for local communities to choose from. In the US, there was sufficient interest that a specialist magazine, Monumental News, was created to support the trade in war memorials.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E

The centre often outsourced the construction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> and the first two Canguros were built by the Aeronautica Lombarda, with the first flight in 1941 or 1942. Most of the later aircraft were built by Società d'Aeronautica Italiana Ambrosini, with the result that the type is sometimes referred to as the Ambrosini CVV-6 Canguro.|$|E
25|$|In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used {{engraving}} {{to decorate}} and inscribe metalwork. It {{is thought that}} they began to print impressions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as old master prints in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as Martin Schongauer, Albrecht Dürer, and Lucas van Leiden.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks took much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> {{from outer}} origins, such as Asia, when Alexander the Great conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European {{influences}} {{can also be}} detected. When Roman rule came to Greece, no change in jewellery designs was detected. However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. That {{is not to say}} that indigenous design did not thrive. Numerous polychrome butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near Olbia, with only one example ever found anywhere else.|$|E

25|$|In 1941, {{seeking to}} further improve the {{performance}} of the C.202 fighter, the Regia Aeronautica decided to license-build the German DB 605 1,100kW (1,475hp) liquid-cooled supercharged inverted V-12 engine in Italy, which Fiat produced as the RA.1050 R.C.58 Tifone (Typhoon). Fighter manufacturers were invited to enter versions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> using this engine as the caccia della serie 5 ("series-5 fighter") and were provided with imported DB 605s for prototype use. All of the designs used the number 5 in the name, with the Macchi becoming the C.205 (instead of C.202bis or C.203).|$|E
25|$|The four chosen {{systems were}} the Bendix Dashaveyor, the Ford ACT, TTI Hovair (a {{spin-off}} of General Motors) and the Rohr ROMAG, represented by its former rubber-wheeled prototype, the Monocab. Boeing and Vought also showed cars from their larger systems, Boeing's {{version of the}} Alden staRRcar being installed in Morgantown, and the Vought Airtrans being installed at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Ford would later install a small ACT deployment at a shopping mall in Dearborn, and Dashaveyor would win a contest for the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride, but further sales were not forthcoming. Several European companies also presented models <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs.</b> The plans to use Transpo {{as a way to}} excite mayors into buying the AGT systems failed, a disappointment to both the UMTA and Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 {{a meeting}} of fusion {{researchers}} took place in Novosibirsk, where, to everyone's astonishment, the Soviet hosts introduced their work on their tokamak designs which had performance numbers that no other experiment was even close to matching. The latest <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs,</b> the T-3, was producing electron energies of 1000eV, compared to about 10eV in ZETA. This corresponded to a plasma temperature of about 10 million K. Although the Soviet team was highly respected, the results were so good that there was serious concern their indirect temperature measurements might be unreliable and they had fallen prey to a measurement problem {{like the one that}} had occurred with ZETA. Spitzer, once again, expressed his scepticism rather strongly, sparking off an acrimonious debate with Artsimovitch.|$|E

25|$|Galleys were {{introduced}} to the Baltic Sea in the 16th century but the details <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> are lacking due to the absence of records. They might have been built in a more regional style, but the only known depiction from the time shows a typical Mediterranean vessel. There is conclusive evidence that Denmark became the first Baltic power to build classic Mediterranean-style galleys in the 1660s, though they proved to be generally too large to be useful in the shallow waters of the Baltic archipelagos. Sweden and especially Russia began to launch galleys and various rowed vessels in great numbers during the Great Northern War in the first two decades of the 18th century. Sweden was late in the game when it came to building an effective oared fighting fleet, while the Russian galley forces under Tsar Peter I developed into a supporting arm for the sailing navy and a well-functioning auxiliary of the army which infiltrated and conducted numerous raids on the eastern Swedish coast in the 1710s.|$|E
500|$|The title [...] "Fly vs. Fly" [...] is a {{reference}} to the Mad magazine comic strip [...] "Spy vs. Spy", while the segment itself is based on the film The Fly. In [...] "Easy-Bake Coven", the animators referenced the film The Crucible for many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs,</b> and Edna Krabappel is wearing a Scarlet A, which is {{a reference}} to the novel The Scarlet Letter.|$|E
500|$|Due to time constraints, {{a lot of}} {{the initial}} ideas were dropped from {{the final version of the}} game, such as {{atmospheric}} battles, and new weapons types like a [...] "subspace missile artillery strike". The team made major improvements to the same FreeSpace engine from the first game. By revamping the core of the graphical engine, and adding 32-bit support, they sped up the interface screens and graphic processing. Hardware acceleration for the graphics was also decided to be a requirement to target the high-end machines of 1999. This allowed for a greater number of ships visibly active on the battlefield, satisfying the team's penchant of having great numbers of fighters and capitals ships duking it out in a big battlefield, instead of [...] "multiple small-ass" [...] battles. The shifting of their target focus to higher end machines also fulfilled their top priority of having capital ships many times larger than fighter crafts. The team also followed real world concepts for some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs.</b> The Pegasus stealth fighter was modeled on the stealth technology of the 1990s for people to relate to it easily. The game was restrained from becoming too realistic by the team's recognition that most gamers only want believable worlds to have a blast flying around in and blowing things up.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the main}} {{characters}} were designed by Fujisaka, the character Legna, previously known as the [...] "Black Dragon", was designed by Taro Hasegawa, who was also monster designer for both Drakengard and Drakengard 2. In addition to designing the characters, Fujisaka drew the character portraits used for character dialogue boxes during in-game cutscenes, a feature he initially objected to. Nowe, {{in contrast to the}} other protagonists of the Drakengard series, was designed around the concept of a stereotypical hero. Nowe was one of Fujisaka's favorite characters to design, although Shiba was less enthusiastic. Manah's redesign in Drakengard 2 reflected both her evolved personality and her more traditional depiction as a fantasy heroine. Elements <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> were taken from Caim and Furiae, representing [...] "passing the torch" [...] between characters. Because of Legna's different roles in Drakengard and Drakengard 2, his design and movements were altered for his second incarnation. Eris's design was inspired by Casca, a character from Berserk: while he tried not to copy any parts of Casca's design, Fujisaka tried to convey it using aspects of her personality. He also tried to balance this part of her depiction with a tender and more feminine side. Another idea he had in mind was the image of an honors student. Her dance-like fighting style was generally suggested by the game's staff. Caim's redesign was meant to represent his status as a wanderer.|$|E
