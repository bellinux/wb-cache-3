500|$|The team {{attempted}} to develop characters {{that offer a}} unique experience to the game.

500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was something that she created with Judd.|$|E

[...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was my job to try and stop him, but he definitely got the better <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> day.

[...] The Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance is a Creative Arts and not handed out during the primetime telecast and, prior to 2009, was a juried award without nominations. However, Smith says [...] "if I had {{to be associated with}} one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson." [...] The show's creator Matt Groening has called Smith very similar to Lisa: [...] "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that. Writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute", as able [...] "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E

500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Love {{has been}} candid about her diverse musical influences, the {{earliest}} being Patti Smith and The Pretenders, whom she discovered while in juvenile hall. As a teenager, she named Flipper, Kate Bush, Soft Cell, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, Lou Reed, and Dead Kennedys among her favorite artists, {{as well as}} several new wave and post-punk bands, such as Echo and the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Television, Bauhaus, and Joy Division. While in Ireland at age fifteen, she saw Virgin Prunes perform live in Dublin, an event she credited as being a pivotal influence. Her varying genre interests were illustrated in a 1991 interview with Flipside, in which she stated: [...] "There's a part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> wants to have a grindcore band and another that wants to have a Raspberries-type pop band." [...] Love also embraced the influence of experimental artists and punk rock groups, including Sonic Youth, Swans, Big Black, Diamanda Galás, the Germs, and The Stooges. While writing Celebrity Skin, Love was mainly influenced by Neil Young and My Bloody Valentine. She also cited her contemporary PJ Harvey as an influence, saying, [...] "The one rock star that makes me know I'm shit is Polly Harvey. I'm nothing next to the purity that she experiences." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Part of Me" [...] is a dance-pop {{and power}} pop song set {{to a house}} beat. It is {{composed}} in the key of D minor and set in a 4/4 time signature at a tempo of 130 beats per minute. The melody spans the tonal range of D4 to D5, while the music follows the chord progression of Dm–F–Bb-C. Production was done by Perry's frequent collaborator, Dr. Luke. The song begins with Perry's somber and emotional delivery of the line, [...] "Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade." [...] At the bridge, the beat amplifies and Perry's lyrics become more aggressive as she commands [...] "Now Look at Me!", signalling to her ex that she is still strong, regardless of what he tries to do to bring her down. The beat reaches a peak at the chorus, and Perry's tone and the song's lyrics become more aggressive and prominent as she sings, [...] "This is the Part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you're never gonna ever take away from me." [...] As the song continues, Perry's lyrics become strong and empowered: [...] "So {{you can keep the}} diamond ring/ It don't mean nothing anyway/ In fact you can keep everything Yeah/ Yeah Except for me". Perry repeats the ending chorus as the beat fades.|$|E
5000|$|The song evokes {{images of}} {{homecoming}} back to Ireland and includes the words: [...] "I'm going back/going back/To my own ones/Back to talk/talk awhile/With my own ones".

500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the fame}} of Lisa Simpson, Smith is rarely {{recognized}} in public, {{as it is}} Lisa who appears on screen. However, Smith does not mind. She said, [...] "it's wonderful {{to be in the}} midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice." [...] In a 2009 interview with The Guardian she commented that [...] "It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom The Simpsons has bought me in my life." [...] Although Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992, she considers it unimportant, saying [...] "there's part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> feels it wasn't even a real Emmy." [...] The award is a Creative Arts prize not awarded during the primetime telecast and, at the time, a juried award without nominations. Still, Smith considers her work on the show a success. [...] "If I had to be associated with one character in fiction," [...] she said, [...] "I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson."

500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.
