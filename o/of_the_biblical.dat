5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} is a far more oblique and less literal utilisation of the iconography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> scene, but a more direct invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.|$|E
5|$|Mythological hybrids {{appear in}} human culture in forms {{as diverse as}} the Minotaur, blends of animals, humans and mythical beasts such as centaurs and sphinxes, and the Nephilim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> apocrypha {{described}} as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Another {{genre of}} history writing {{produced}} during the Era of the Princes was the terse Ethiopian annal known as ya'alam tarik. These works attempted to list major world events {{from the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> Genesis until their present time in a universal history. For instance, the translated work of John of Nikiû explaining human history until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography. There are also chronological and genealogical lists of rulers and Orthodox Church patriarchs that include some elements of historical narrative.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{a library}} clerk {{was forced to}} resign for {{promoting}} the idea that baptism is essential for salvation, considered a violation of the Statement of Faith. Further, in March 2006, five of the college's sixteen faculty members—Erik Root, Robert Stacey, Kevin Culberson, Todd Bates, and David Noe—resigned in protest, claiming that the President's interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> Worldview Policy restricted academic freedom.|$|E
5|$|Isaac was {{the only}} patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God {{told him not to}} do so. Rabbinic {{tradition}} gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the Land of Israel. Isaac was the oldest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> patriarchs {{at the time of his}} death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed.|$|E
5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{noted in}} 1922 {{that the work}} of intense {{expression}} was singular in the sacred music of its period, with a convincing musical interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> text and its manifold shades of emotion. Paul Hindemith wrote a trimmed adaption which probably helped to keep the work in the repertory, and François Callebout wrote an organ version, making the work accessible for smaller choirs. It was first performed in Wiesbaden, where the composer studied, in 2003. The celebration of the Reger Year 2016 led to several performances.|$|E

5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{wrote in}} 1922 {{that the work}} was not only {{singular}} in the composer's work, but in the sacred music of its period, with a rare intense power of expression ("intensive Ausdruckskraft") and a convincing musical exegesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> text and also its turns and manifold shades of emotion ("überzeugende musikalische Auslegung des biblischen Textes, wie auch seiner Wendungen und mannigfaltigen Gefühlsschattierungen").|$|E
5|$|Zorobabela Kaʻauwai (/1806 – August 8, 1856) was {{an early}} {{politician}} and judge in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Beginning {{as an assistant to}} the Hoapili, Governor of Maui, he served many political posts including Assistant Judge of the first Supreme Court of Hawaii, an original member of the Board of Commissioners to Quiet Land Titles, a multiple-term representative in the Hawaiian legislature and circuit judge for Maui. An early convert to Christianity and devout adherent of the Protestant faith, his first name is a Hawaiian form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> name Zerubbabel.|$|E
5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for the Feast of the Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative {{the words of}} the Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition as he had done with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents the events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which {{make it difficult to}} determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' {{understanding}} of the Arab peoples is informed by his reading of the Bible and {{his knowledge of the}} history of imperial Rome. He {{does not appear to have}} personally known any Arabs. In his Chronicon, all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to Ishmael—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era. To Eusebius, the Saracens of the 4th century are direct-line descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> Ishmaelites, descendants of the handmaid, Hagar, and the patriarch, Abraham. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's Covenant with the favored son of Abraham, Isaac. The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and latrones, raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the Arab nation an unhappy color. He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.|$|E

5|$|This passage {{has often}} been {{interpreted}} as {{a reference to the}} benign policy instituted by Cyrus of allowing exiled peoples, such as the Jews, to return to their original homelands. The Cylinder's inscription has been linked with the reproduction in the Book of Ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by Cyrus concerning the repatriation of the Jews and the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. The two edicts (one in Hebrew and one in Aramaic) are substantially different in content and tone, leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a post hoc fabrication. The question of their authenticity remains unresolved, though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of Persian royal policy, albeit perhaps not one that was couched in the terms given in the text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> edicts.|$|E
5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{has been}} practiced {{all over the}} world since ancient times. There is considerable written and archaeological evidence of the practice. Mummified bodies with pierced ears have been discovered, including the oldest mummified body discovered to date, the 5,300-year-old Ötzi the Iceman, which was found in a glacier in Italy. This mummy had an ear piercing 7–11mm diameter. The oldest earrings found in a grave date to 2500 BCE. These were located in the Sumerian city of Ur, home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> patriarch Abraham. Earrings are mentioned in the Bible. In Genesis 35:4, Jacob buries the earrings worn by members of his household along with their idols. In Exodus 32, Aaron makes the golden calf from melted earrings. Deuteronomy 15:12–17 dictates ear piercing for a slave who chooses not to be freed. Earrings are also referenced in connection to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in the Vedas. Earrings for pierced ears were found in a grave in the Ukok region between Russia and China dated between 400 and 300 BCE.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E
