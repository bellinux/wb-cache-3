40|$|In-situ gamma-ray {{spectrometry}} (GRS) {{measurements were}} conducted at 35 sites in Hong Kong where volcanic rocks with varying extent <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> were exposed. Elemental analyses using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry {{were carried out}} on samples collected from these 35 plus 22 other locations to assess the feasibility of using the GRS method to quantify the extent <b>of</b> <b>weathering.</b> The Parker weathering index, varying within a range of 0. 0 - 0. 8 for the samples studied, {{was used as a}} geochemically based reference scheme for correlating the gamma-ray spectrometric results with the extent <b>of</b> <b>weathering.</b> For the former 35 sites, the concentrations of the three major radioelements, K. U. and Th, determined by in-situ GRS were compared to laboratory-determined values from the samples. The study revelas that no significant change occurs to the contents of the three radioelements during the initial state <b>of</b> <b>weathering.</b> But once the rocks become highly <b>weathered,</b> further progression <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> is accompanied by a systematic removal of K and an increased dispersion of U and Th. The results show that K content, which is indicative of the extent <b>of</b> <b>weathering,</b> can be retrieved reliably with the gamma-ray spectrometry technique. The study has given support to the potential use of the downhole spectral gamma method for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> grade and the detection of subsurface clay-rich levels.
