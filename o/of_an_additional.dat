A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.|$|E

It {{has been reported that}} this plan may require the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> 10–12 M1A1 Abrams and six M88A2 Hercules ARVs in order to allow the formation of three tank squadrons. Obstacle breaching and bridgelaying variants may also be acquired at a later date.

5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} {{the economic impact of}} growth in the air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E
5|$|Despite England {{going into}} the series as the favourites, West Indies won the series 1–0 after winning the first match at Sabina Park. The {{remaining}} matches all ended in draws. The series was originally intended as a four Test series; however the abandonment of the Second Test due to {{the conditions of the}} field at the SVR Stadium in Antigua led to the rapid inclusion <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> game staged at the Antigua Recreation Ground, resulting in a five, rather than four match Test series.|$|E

5|$|Fingleton {{was dropped}} after this Test, and was {{controversially}} overlooked for the 1934 tour of England despite strong performances for New South Wales. His omission {{was thought to}} be influenced by the belief that he was responsible for leaking Woodfull's comments as well as Bradman's criticism of his performance. Other factors speculated to have contributed to his omission included a dispute that Fingleton had with Woodfull during a Sheffield Shield match, and interstate rivalries between New South Wales and Victoria causing Fingleton's omission at the expense <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> Victorian.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{read this}} Ultra {{intelligence}} {{in the office of}} the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. The prospect <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E

5|$|Seismologists {{reported}} that the earthquakes {{were part of a}} prolonged aftershock sequence associated with the major magnitude 7.1 earthquake of September 2010, which includes the February 2011 event. They were succeeded by multiple lighter aftershocks; the strongest, a moderate magnitude 5.1 ML struck a minute after the event. Another tremor 5.0 ML struck the region two days later. Despite significant energy release, the earthquakes were believed to have increased the risk <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> aftershock of similar magnitude; calculations from GNS Science indicated a 23 percent probability of a magnitude 6.0–6.9 ML earthquake occurring in the Canterbury aftershock zone within the 12 months following the event. Weeks later, a magnitude 5.4 ML tremor jolted Christchurch overnight on 22 June, causing additional damage and prompting evacuations.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} reanalysis project {{also indicated}} {{but could not}} confirm the presence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> tropical storm in October1901, instead listing the cyclone as a tropical depression. However, the reanalysis added a previously undetected hurricane in late August to the Atlantic hurricane database(HURDAT). The seventh tropical cyclone that year was the strongest by maximum sustained winds, peaking at 105mph (165km/h), equivalent to a Category2 hurricane. However, the fourth hurricane had a lower barometric pressure and was thus the most intense storm of the season.|$|E

5|$|Three {{specimens}} {{have been}} assigned to Sinosauropteryx prima: the holotype GMV2123 (and its counter slab , NIGP127586), NIGP127587, and D2141.

The assignment <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> larger specimen to S. prima, GMV2124, was later found to be in error. All of the fossils were found in the Jianshangou or Dawangzhangzi Beds of the Yixian Formation in the Beipiao and Lingyuan regions of Liaoning, China. These fossil beds have been dated to 124.6–122million years ago, during the late Barremian to early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
