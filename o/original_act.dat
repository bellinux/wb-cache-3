5|$|The {{proposed}} Trent and Mersey Canal {{was seen}} as a threat by the Trustees of the Navigation, for it ran parallel to the River Weaver for some distance near Anderton. However, the commissioners pressed on with upgrading the river, completing new locks at Barnton in 1771 and at Acton Bridge in 1778. They also set about repaying their debts, which were liquidated in July 1775, resulting in some of the profits being given to the County of Cheshire, as stated in the <b>original</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the <b>original</b> <b>act</b> had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the services on the line in 1955, a Chailey resident, Margery Bessemer, forced its re-opening in 1956 for a short period when she discovered that the <b>original</b> <b>Acts</b> of Parliament which authorised the line's construction imposed a statutory obligation on British Railways to continue running services. British Railways responded by running the most meagre timetable possible, the so-called [...] "Sulky Service". Parliament did eventually repeal the <b>original</b> <b>Acts</b> and the line closed in 1958.|$|R
50|$|Reznicek's first {{sketches}} {{date from}} the autumn of 1915. Eulenberg revised the text of his play {{in consultation with the}} composer, reducing the number of acts to three (the <b>original</b> <b>acts</b> one and two, and the <b>original</b> <b>acts</b> four and five were both condensed to one act). Several cuts were made, and a few minor scenes were eliminated. This resulted in the story becoming much more focused on the psychology and pathological character of the title figure. Reznicek composed the music during 1917-18. The score was published by Universal Edition Vienna.|$|R
5|$|In some areas, {{systematic}} {{attacks against}} tribespeople {{in or near}} mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers.Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their mining activities. Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that {{there were times when}} miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day. Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations, at times tribes or villages not involved in the <b>original</b> <b>act.</b> During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Lithuanian {{businessman}} Darius Mockus {{offered a}} 1-million-Euro reward {{to anyone who}} could find the original document {{and give it to}} the State of Lithuania. The offer's deadline was set to 16 February 2018, when Lithuania will commemorate the 100th anniversary of its declaration of independence. On 29 March 2017, Vytautas Magnus University professor Liudas Mažylis announced he had found the original document in the Federal Foreign Office Political Archive in Berlin, Germany, hand-written in the Lithuanian language and signed by the twenty. He also announced that he had found the German-language version of the 16 February 1918 document and the Act of 11 December 1917. The latter displays nineteen signatures (without that of Pranas Dovydaitis). Germany confirmed the documents' authenticity on the following day and they were displayed publicly by two officials — Michael Roth, the German Minister of State for Europe, and Deividas Matulionis, Lithuania ambassador in Germany. On October 5, 2017, Lithuania Minister of Foreign Affairs Linas Linkevičius and Germany Minister of Foreign Affairs Sigmar Gabriel signed an agreement that the <b>original</b> <b>Act</b> of Independence will be displayed for five years in the House of the Signatories where it was originally signed, making it the main symbol of the Lithuania's Centenary of the Restoration of the State celebrations.|$|E

25|$|The {{system was}} {{operated}} {{as a commercial}} enterprise until 1925, after which the business and its assets reverted to the City of Melbourne, as specified by the <b>original</b> <b>act.</b> One of the early improvements made by the City Council was to consolidate the system. The steam pumps were replaced by new electric pumps, located in the Spencer Street power station, which thus supplied both electric power and hydraulic power to the city. The hydraulic system continued to operate under municipal ownership until December 1967.|$|E

Homer manages to negotiate that he {{perform at the}} zoo through a new contract with a new act. After Kidkill refuses his <b>original</b> <b>act</b> (which was simply Homer prancing around in a monkey suit), he goes to his second plan; an act where he rides a tricycle with Butch Patrick on his shoulders, both of them dressed as Eddie Munster, on a stage as both are being attacked by cobras (some real, some merely animatronic snakes packed with venom). Inspired by Homer's example, Apu and Manjula resolve that they {{can take care of}} their kids, while Homer is mercilessly attacked by several of the snakes and a mongoose put in to contain them.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Junction's <b>original</b> <b>act</b> in 1793 {{authorised}} {{branches to}} Daventry, the River Nene at Northampton, to the turnpike road at Old Stratford (north-west {{of the modern}} Milton Keynes), and to Watford in Hertfordshire: those to Daventry and Watford were not built. The branch to Old Stratford was amended before it was built (see below). The branch to Northampton was delayed as the plans of the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal to reach Northampton and thus join with the Grand Junction came to nothing. The link to Northampton was made by a tramroad transferred from Blisworth Tunnel, with the 5-mile (8-kilometre) canal from Gayton being opened in 1815. The link to Leicester was eventually achieved by {{the opening of the}} Grand Union Canal, which took a more direct route from Foxton in Leicestershire to the Grand Junction at Norton Junction.|$|E
50|$|In 1974 {{a change}} of musical policy at Bradleys (now under ex-Mojo Stuart Slater) {{resulted}} in the label parting with all three of its <b>original</b> <b>acts</b> in a successful quest for hit singles. With no record label and finding the economics of keeping on the road increasingly difficult the band decided to split.|$|R
50|$|At the time, San Pedro {{was more}} {{receptive}} to classic rock cover bands than to <b>original</b> <b>acts,</b> and the nearby Los Angeles' punk scene was not yet prepared to take a band from San Pedro seriously.

25|$|The canal was {{relatively}} successful {{prior to the}} arrival of railways. Traffic figures are scarce, but in 1798, 28,571 tons of coal were recorded, of which 40 per cent came from the Little Eaton gangway. By 1803 this had risen to 50,374 tons, with 55 per cent from the gangway. Rather than it just supplying Derby, the company encouraged through trade on the canal, and this contributed to its profitability. Regular dividends were paid to shareholders from 1811, although some had been paid in previous years. Initially, they were close to the 5 per cent promised by the <b>original</b> <b>Act,</b> but reached 12 per cent in 1839. Although this exceeded the amount specified by the Act, it was justified as covering years where the 5 per cent had not been made. Traffic figures for February and March 1839 indicate that the Little Eaton line carried 13,332 tons, the Sandiacre line carried 15,725 tons, and 9,773 tons were carried on the Swarkestone line. This would suggest that the total for the year was around 200,000 tons.|$|E
25|$|The Commissioners {{considered}} {{applying for}} a new Act of Parliament in 1760, {{to create a new}} cut linking the river at Setchey to the Great Ouse by the shortest route. Tolls for the half year ending in March 1761 amounted to £59 and yielded a profit of £26. The tolls were increased to the maximum allowed by the <b>original</b> <b>act,</b> and the clerk was asked to look at letting the tolls out, so {{that they did not have}} to finance their collection. At this point, the Commissioners appear to lose interest, and no further meetings were recorded. The Revd Henry Spelman purchased the interest in the navigation some time before 1770, and became the sole representative of the proprietors and subscribers. He stated that the commissioners had borrowed £3,500, and that with interest, the debt due to him had risen to £4,718. The navigation was unusable in parts, and believed that the commissioners had failed in their duties. He obtained a second Act of Parliament, under which £800 would be spent on improvements. He loaned the navigation £1,345 to cover the cost of the work and of obtaining the act, to be added to his existing debt, all of which would accrue interest at five per cent.|$|E

500|$|The {{height of}} {{buildings}} in Washington {{is limited by}} the Height of Buildings Act. The <b>original</b> <b>Act</b> was passed by Congress in 1899 in response to the 1894 construction of the Cairo Hotel, which is much taller than the majority of buildings in the city. The <b>original</b> <b>act</b> restricted the heights of any type of building in the United States capital city of Washington, D.C., to be no higher than , [...] for residential buildings. In 1910, the 61st United States Congress enacted a new law which raised the overall building height limit to , but restricted building heights to the width of the adjacent street or avenue plus thus, a building facing a -wide street could be only [...] tall. However, building heights are measured from the sidewalk or curb {{to the edge of the}} roof. Architectural embellishments, mechanical rooms, and common rooftop structures may be exempted from the overall height limit, provided they are set back from the roof line. The heights of buildings listed here may therefore exceed the general height limit as measured for the purpose of the city's zoning laws.|$|E
500|$|The <b>original</b> <b>Act</b> of 1796 had envisaged {{the canal}} joining the River Tone at Taunton, and made {{provision}} {{for the improvement}} of some [...] of the river, which would then be granted to the canal company and effectively become part of the canal. They could build warehouses and wharves on this section. By late 1830, there was considerable hostility between the Conservators of the River Tone and the new Bridgewater and Taunton Canal company, who had constructed a connection into the river at Firepool, so that barges could reach Taunton Bridge. The Conservators had retaliated by reducing the water supply to the canal. Litigation followed, and the Grand Western Canal company, having decided that a direct connection to the Brigewater and Taunton Canal was a better option, had succeeded in purchasing the land required by agreement with landowners.|$|E
500|$|Section 9A(3)(d) {{allows the}} court to {{consider}} [...] "any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament". Under this provision, material relating to the <b>original</b> <b>Act</b> may be looked at in interpreting an amendment. However, {{it would not be}} wise to set a precedent for the unregulated use of original material in construing a subsequent amendment. After all, it is not a rule that Parliament must legislate consistently with past legislation. On the contrary, subsequent legislation must, where inconsistent with its predecessor, prevail over it. The objective of the court is not to construe all legislation as if Parliament was in some way bound by its intentions when it first passed the Act. It is to construe why Parliament has seen fit to amend that Act {{in the light of the}} inadequacies that the passage of time has revealed or new needs carried by the tide of progress.|$|E
