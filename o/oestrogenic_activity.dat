It has also been studied to investigate the effects of these waste materials on the aquatic life. [...] Natural and synthetic oestrogens, such as oestradiol and oestrone, are present in sewage treatment works effluents. In male fathead minnows, exposure to these steroidal compounds leads to an increase in plasma vitellogenin levels exceeding that of even mature female fathead minnows. Vitellogenin blood plasma levels are an indicator for determining if chemicals have an <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> to fish. This is also accompanied by an inhibition of testicular growth, even if the exposure is in low concentrations or {{for a short period of}} time. These studies showed that the presence of natural oestrogens, likely originating from humans, represents a new ecotoxicological issue.|$|E
40|$|AimsTo assess serum {{oestrogen}} {{levels and}} <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes {{compared with a}} healthy control group. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study that evaluated adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (n = 38) and healthy adolescents (control group; n = 32). Serum oestrogens, urinary oestrogen metabolites and serum <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> were assessed. <b>Oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> was evaluated in an in vitro cell proliferation assay using a modified E-screen assay with MCF- 7 /BUS cells. ResultsAdolescents with Type 1 diabetes had lower <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> levels in both phases of the menstrual cycle compared with the control group (follicular phase: 76 vs 94 %; luteal phase: 97 vs 131 %; P < 0. 01), even after adjusting for BMI, oestradiol and oestrone levels. Postmenarcheal adolescents with Type 1 diabetes had lower oestradiol levels compared with control subjects in the follicular phase (63. 3 pmol/l vs 89. 4 pmol/l; P < 0. 01) and higher oestrone levels compared with controls in the luteal phase (196 vs 151. 9 pmol/l; P < 0. 05). ConclusionsAdolescents with Type 1 diabetes had lower levels of serum <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity,</b> and these were lower than expected based on their serum oestradiol levels. We postulate that changes in the serum milieu of oestrogens in patients with Type 1 diabetes may explain their decreased <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> and {{may play a role}} in their adverse metabolic profile...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether p-hydroxybenzoic acid, the common metabolite of parabens, possesses <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> in human breast cancer cell lines. The alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (parabens) are used widely as preservatives in consumer products to which the human population is exposed and have been shown previously to possess <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> and to be present in human breast tumour tissue, which is an oestrogen-responsive tissue. Recent work has shown p-hydroxybenzoic acid to give an oestrogenic response in the rodent uterotrophic assay. We report here that p-hydroxybenzoic acid possesses <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> in a panel of assays in human breast cancer cell lines. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was able to displace [H- 3]oestradiol from cytosolic oestrogen receptor of MCF 7 human breast cancer cells by 54 % at 5 x 10 (6) -fold molar excess and by 99 % at 10 (7) -fold molar excess. It was able to increase the expression of a stably integrated oestrogen responsive reporter gene (ERE-CAT) at a concentration of 5 x 10 (- 4) M in MCF 7 cells after 24 h and 7 days, which could be inhibited by the anti-oestrogen ICI 182 780 (Faslodex, fulvestrant). Proliferation of two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF 7, ZR- 75 - 1) could be increased by 10 (- 5) M p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Following on from previous studies showing a decrease in <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of parabens with shortening of the linear alkyl chain length, this study has compared the <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of p-hydroxybenzoic acid where the alkyl grouping is no longer present with methylparaben, which has the shortest alkyl group. Intrinsic <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of p-hydroxybenzoic acid was similar to that of methylparaben in terms of relative binding to the oestrogen receptor but its <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> on gene expression and cell proliferation was lower than that of methylparaben. It can be concluded that removal of the ester group from parabens does not abrogate its <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> and that p-hydroxybenzoic acid can give oestrogenic responses in human breast cancer cells.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the British {{biochemist}} Edward Charles Dodds tested BPA as an artificial estrogen, but {{found it to}} be 37,000 times less effective than estradiol. Dodds eventually developed a structurally similar compound, diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was used as a synthetic estrogen drug in women and animals until it was banned due to its risk of causing cancer; the ban on use of DES in humans came in 1971 and in animals, in 1979. [...] BPA was never used as a drug. [...] BPA's ability to mimic the effects of natural estrogen derive from the similarity of phenol groups on both BPA and estradiol, which enable this synthetic molecule to trigger estrogenic pathways in the body.

40|$|Various {{derivatives}} of triphenylchloroethylene and triphenylbromoethylene {{have been}} examined for <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> during the past decade, notably those compounds substituted with p-alkoxy groups. In general, they are not very potent oestrogens, but combine long duration of action with sufficient <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> to make them of laboratory and clinical interest.

40|$|Alkylphenolic {{compounds}} {{derived from}} microbial degradation of non-ionic surfactants {{became a major}} focus of environmental research in the early 1980 s. More toxic than the parent compounds and weakly oestrogenic, certain metabolites of nonylphenol polyethoxylate (NPnEO) surfactants, especially nonylphenol (NP), raised sustained concern over the risk they pose to the environment and triggered legal measures as well as partly voluntary actions by the manufacturing industry. Continuous progress in the development of analytical techniques is crucial to understand how these alkylphenolic compounds behave in wastewater treatment, the aquatic environment and in laboratory experiments. Measured concentrations and mass flows of phenolic endocrine disruptors, particularly nonylphenolic compounds, bisphenol A and parabens in municipal wastewater effluents and in the Glatt River, Switzerland, show that rain events leading to discharges of untreated wastewater into rivers have a great impact on the riverine mass flows of contaminants. Biotransformation experiments in our laboratory with nonylphenoxyacetic acid and individual NP isomers enabled the elucidation of degradation pathways of these compounds. The finding that nonylphenoxyacetic acid is metabolized via NP further underscores the role of NP as the most relevant metabolite in the degradation of NPnEO. Several Sphingomonadaceae bacterial strains were found to degrade α-quaternary 4 -NP isomers by an ipso-substitution mechanism, and to use only the aromatic part of the molecule. These reactions turned out to be isomer specific, meaning that rate and extent of transformation depend on constitution, and possibly also on the absolute configuration of the alkyl side chain of a specific isomer. The observation that NP isomers with distinct <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activities</b> are differentially degraded has significant implications for risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 9221 There is {{a direct}} link between the {{increased}} risk of cardiovascular disease and the menopause and this {{is thought to be}} due to the progressive lack of endogenous oestrogen in post-menopausal women. Observational studies have provided evidence that hormone therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease but more recent randomised controlled clinical trials have contradicted these results. These trials have shown increases in venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and other coronary events in women receiving estradiol in the form of hormone therapy versus placebo. Due to these publications many women chose to use herbal remedies for relief of menopausal symptoms, many of these include phytoestrogens supplements. Phytoestrogens are a group of naturally occurring substances produced from plants with weak <b>oestrogenic</b> and anti-oestrogenic <b>activity</b> and are the main constiuents of soy.

40|$|Abstract Background Phytochemical {{flavonoids}} {{are widely}} {{distributed in the}} environment and are derived from many anthropogenic activities. The isoflavone genistein is a naturally occurring compound found in soya products that are habitual constituents of the aquafeeds. This isoflavone possesses <b>oestrogenic</b> biological <b>activity</b> and also apoptotic properties. The present study has been performed {{to determine the effects}} of the genistein in the early life stages of the flatfish Senegalese sole during the first month of larval life, and it is focused especially at the metamorphosis, analysing the expression transcript levels and the immunohistochemical protein patterns implicated in the cell proliferation and apoptosis pathways (proliferation cellular/PCNA, anti-apoptosis Survivin/BIRC- 5, death receptors/Fas, and Caspases). Results The isoflavone genistein induced some temporal disrupting effects in several pro-apoptotic signalling pathways (Fas, CASP- 6) at both genistein doses (3  mg/L and 10  mg/L), with increased Fas transcripts and also decreasing CASP- 6 mRNA expression levels during metamorphic and post-metamorphic stages of the Senegalese sole. On the other hand, the anti-apoptotic BIRC- 5 expression levels were weakly down-regulated with both the highest and lowest doses, but all of these imbalances were stabilised to the baseline levels. In early life stages of the controls, the constitutive basal transcript levels were temporarily and differentially expressed, reaching the highest levels at the pre-metamorphosis phase, as especially in endotrophic larvae (i. e. BIRC- 5  mRNA), as well as in the metamorphic (i. e. CASP- 6  mRNA) and post-metamorphic stages (i. e. Fas mRNA). In general, through development, continuous and progressive increases in the protein patterns of cell proliferation-PCNA (e. g. mitotic nuclei), anti-apoptotic Survivin (e. g. haematopoietic system, brain, digestive system, gills) and CASP- 2 and - 6 (e. g. brain, gills, kidney, digestive system, vascular systems, among others) have been immunohistochemically detected. Besides, both the controls and genistein exposed larvae displayed parallel immunostaining protein patterns in the different organ-systems and tissues. Conclusions The transcriptional imbalances observed in the studied genes (BIRC- 5, CASP- 6, Fas) were only temporarily induced, and apparently no changes in the immunohistochemical protein patterns were detected. Thus, the isoflavone genistein caused not harmful effects in the development and metamorphosis of the Senegalese sole exposed to chronic environmentally relevant concentrations (3 and 10  mg/L) ...|$|R

Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate in vitro effects of aqueous hop extract on thoracic vascular reactivity in Sprague Dawley male and female rats. Endothelium-intact thoracic arterial rings from male rats (MALE, n= 8), sham-ovariectomized (Sham OVX) female (n= 8) and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats (n= 8) were used. We assessed the relaxation induced by aqueous hop extract (10 (- 9), 10 (- 2) g/l) in aortic rings precontracted with norepinephrine (10 (- 7) M), in the absence or in the presence of l-NAME (10 (- 4) M), indomethacin (10 (- 5) M), thapsigargin (10 (- 4) M), iberiotoxin (3. 10 (- 8) M), apamin (3. 10 (- 8) M) and TEA (3. 10 (- 4) M). Aqueous hop extract induced relaxation of endothelium-intact thoracic arterial rings in MALE and Sham OVX rats, whereas a weak effect was observed in OVX rats. This vasorelaxation was strongly inhibited in presence of l-NAME, indomethacin and thapsigargin.

For this reason, much re-mains to be done to optimize Gn-RH analogue utilization. In the case of endometriosis, there seem to be three main areas for future researcht pain, infertility and the possibility of rnodifying its natura& history.

In the treatment of abroga, analogues can be utilized as pre-treatment be-fere conservative or dentolitive surgery, or as an alternative to hysterectomy.

Todate no single sequential therapeutic regimen has been identifled which is capable of prolonging the benefichial effects of agonists without their well known negative consequences. Temporary results can be obtained interrupting analogue therapy and substituting it with the administration of a progestogen. Finally analogue administration can be prolonged by assoclating an oestrogen-progestogen sequential coniblmttion as in HRT.

40|$|A {{general picture}} of {{toxicological}} approach and practical aspects of cosmetic safety {{is described in}} this thesis. Such considerations are the basis for introducing negative and positive lists of cosmetic ingredients into cosmetic legislation. The first Dutch Cosmetic Act of 1968 already has several of these lists, but no analytical methods were given to control these lists. Therefore a study has been started with the aim to make analytical market surveys of several classes of potentially risk-bearing compounds. The analytical experience gained in the study {{can be used for}} the developments of official methods for the Dutch Cosmetic Act. The results of these market surveys can moreover be used as information on the actual use of risk-bearing compounds and will therefore contribute to the establishment of sound and significant cosmetic legislation in the Netherlands. Eye make-up colours were identified by a set of characteristic reactions. Lipstick colours were identified by wellknown chromategraphic methods. Colour intermediates for the oxidative hair colouring were identified by two-dimensional thin- layer chromatography. The aromatic amines were confirmed by direct gaschromatographic analysis which permitted quantitative determination. A separation of phenolic intermediates by means of gaschromatography is also described. Suntan preparations were analysed for the presence of UV-absorbers, browning agents and local anesthesics. A simple aerosol sampling method, prior to gaschromatographic analysis was developed, thus permitting a total analysis of propellants and solvents in single-phase aerosols within an hour. Hormonal substances were detected in selected samples by chromatographic methods. These chemical findings supported the results of the biological assay for the detection of <b>oestrogenic</b> and androgenic <b>activity</b> of cosmetic products. Finally antimicrobial compounds were analysed in many kinds of cosmetic products, in which they were used for preservation or for its deodorizing, antidandruff or antiseptic actions. The diversity in chemical structure did not allow the development of universal methods, but most of the compounds could be identified and determined by chromatographic methods. Formaldehyde was determined by fluorometry. A study of the stability of formaldehyde releasing substances is presented. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The oral <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of AY- 11483 {{has been}} com-pared {{to that of}} {{oestriol}} and mestranol. The compound shows significant activity in the vaginal cornification test in rats and mice; however, it has a relatively weak effect in the uterotrophic assay in rats, mice and rabbits. Furthermore, like oestriol, it exerts a weak effect on the endome-trium in rabbits. Based on our findings, AY- 11483 should be classified as an impeded oestrogen with possible clinical application...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{hormonal}} activity in rivers {{have focused on}} inputs from sewage treatment works (STW), and their consequences for endocrine disruption in fish. It is possible that livestock is contributing to this hormonal activity in rivers. This study represents a search for evidence of steroid hormone contamination in streams associated with livestock farms. The majority of the 10 sites selected were streams running through dairy farms, although some examples of beef, sheep and pigs were included. Passive water samplers (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers – POCIS) were deployed up- (control) and down-stream of the farms for 3 to 10 weeks (mean = 39 days) during the period November 2004 to January 2005. At one site, water samples were also taken automatically during rainfall events. All samples were solvent-extracted. Total <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> in concentrates of the extracts was analysed using the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) calibrated against 17 β-oestradiol (E 2), while oestrone (E 1), E 2 and 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) were analysed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Stream water from the entirety of only one rainfall event was sampled directly, but this revealed background activity (E 2 equivalents) of 0 – 0. 3 ng/l, rising to a transient peak of 9. 4 ng/l. Average <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> at this site as estimated from the POCIS samplers was 1. 8 – 2. 7 ng E 2 equiv. /l. Estimated average <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> across all sites (with one exception) lay in the range 0 – 26. 5 ng E 2 equiv. /l (mean = 2. 0 ng/l; S. D. = 5. 1), based on the POCIS samples. The outlier was 292 ng/l, and this could not be specifically linked with livestock rearing. 92 % of monitoring stations (at least one on each farm) contained some <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity,</b> and activity was higher at downstream sites in 50 % of cases. Although no EE 2 was detected analytically in any stream, E 1 and E 2 were almost ubiquitous, with E 2 equivalents ranging from 0. 04 to 3. 6 ng/l across all sites. Furthermore, steroid concentrations downstream of livestock were higher than upstream in 60 % of cases, more markedly so than for the YES data. In several cases, activity upstream was greater than downstream, and this tended {{to be associated with}} higher activity than could be accounted for by the hormone analyses. Both the YES and chemical analytical data suggest that fish in headwater streams on or near some livestock farms may be at risk of endocrine disruptio...|$|E

On Day 9 of the test implantation sites were counted. In most cases the antifertility activity was correlated with <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> Several tetrahydropyranyl ethers derived from oestradiol and synthetic steroids lacking a 3, or a 17 oxygen function showed a separa-tion on these two parameters; this may indicate a relatively effective antifertility agent with low oestrogenicity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{environmental}} compounds with <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> are measurable in {{the human}} breast and oestrogen is a known factor in breast cancer development. Exposure to environmental oestrogens occurs through diet, household products and cosmetics, but concentrations of single compounds in breast tissue are generally lower than needed for assayable oestrogenic responses. Results presented here and elsewhere demonstrate that in combination, chemicals can give oestrogenic responses at lower concentrations, which suggests that in the breast, low doses of many compounds could sum to give a significant oestrogenic stimulus. Updated incidence figures show a continued disproportionate incidence of breast cancer in Britain in the upper outer quadrant of the breast {{which is also the}} region to which multiple cosmetic chemicals are applied...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{man-made}} chemicals {{are present in the}} environment as pollutants and are capable of disrupting the endocrine system of animals and humans. Small-sized industry is an area where such chemicals are used and produced in abundance. There is no legislation governing the use, production and disposal of such chemicals, which studies have shown are posing a hazard to workers themselves and the surrounding communities. Run off water from seven sites in an area in Pretoria West, with significant numbers of small-sized industries, was screened for oestrogenicity, using the Recombinant Yeast Cell Bioassay (RCBA). Chemical analyses were done for the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EOCs), including p-nonylphenol (p-NP), bisphenol A (BPA), phthalate esters, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and various organochlorine pesticides, including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). The p-NP, PCBs and organochlorine pesticides were detected using a South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) in-house method: AM 178 and the time of flight spectrometer, while the BPA and phthalates were detected using the CSIR Biochemtek Laboratory in-house GC-MS method: AM 186 based on the US EPA 8260 and the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The water tested positive for <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> at all the sample sites and a significant amount of lindane, an organochlorine pesticide, was detected at one site. p-NP as well as phthalate esters were identified at different sites. No pattern or relationship could be established between the <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> and the subsequent endocrine disrupting chemicals tested for. These EOCs in the water could pose a health risk for humans and animals. Further specific studies are needed to establish the possible sources of these contaminants, from industry and households.

40|$|The current {{tolerable}} {{daily intake}} (TDI) for zearalenone (ZEN) of 0. 25 μg/kg body weight (bw) per day established by the EFSA Panel for Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) in 2011 is based on oestrogenicity in pigs. No new studies were identified to change this TDI. The modified forms of ZEN identified are phase I and phase II metabolites. Phase I metabolites are mainly formed through reduction. Phase II metabolites are formed by conjugation of ZEN and its phase I metabolites with glucose or sulfate, and in animals glucuronic acid. The few data on the occurrence of modified forms of ZEN indicated that cereal-based foods are the main source, containing amounts varying from a few up to 100 % of ZEN. Most of the phase I metabolites have <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity</b> and {{it is assumed that}} their combined action will be additive. The CONTAM Panel found it appropriate to set a group TDI of 0. 25 μg/kg bw per day expressed as ZEN equivalents for ZEN and its modified forms (phase I and phase II metabolites). To account for differences in in vivo oestrogenic potency, each phase I metabolite was assigned a potency factor relative to ZEN to be applied to exposure estimates of the respective ZEN metabolites. It was assumed that conjugates (phase II metabolites) of ZEN and its phase I metabolites, which per se have no <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>activity,</b> will be cleaved releasing ZEN and its phase I metabolites. These conjugates were assigned the same relative potency factors as their aglycones. The overall uncertainty associated with the present assessment is considered as high. It would rather overestimate than underestimate any risk of modified ZEN. Several aspects of the uncertainty could be reduced provided more data are made available on oestrogenicity of modified ZEN, in particular α-zearalenol, in pigs. <br/...|$|E
