5|$|The Hudsucker Proxy is a 1994 comedy film co-written, produced, and {{directed}} by Joel and Ethan Coen. Sam Raimi co-wrote the script and served as second unit director. The film stars Tim Robbins as a naïve business-school graduate who is installed as president of a manufacturing company, Jennifer Jason Leigh as a newspaper reporter, and Paul Newman as a company director who hires the young man as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> scam.|$|E

Later she {{received a letter from}} Sudermann in which he thanked her for performing his work. Her career as a manager and director began around 1900 when Jacob J. Shubert offered her the management <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> company in Rochester. This company, the Lyceum stock company, based at Rochester's Lyceum Theater, included some prominent actors and future stars, such as Orrin Johnson, Margaret Wycherly and Charles Hutchison.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock,</b> or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E

These stock plates themselves are not directly used in experiments; instead, separate assay plates are created as needed. An assay plate is simply a copy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> plate, created by pipetting a small amount of liquid (often measured in nanoliters) from the wells <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> plate to the corresponding wells of a completely empty plate.|$|E

5000|$|Market capitalization: <b>A</b> <b>stock’s</b> {{weight in}} the index is {{determined}} by the float-adjusted market capitalization of the <b>stock.</b> This is <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> current index shares, the latest available stock price and the Investable weight factor (IWF). The IWF represents the float-adjusted portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock’s</b> equity capital. Therefore, any strategic holdings that are classified as either corporate, private or government holdings reduce the IWF which, in turn, results in a reduction in the float-adjusted market capital. Shares owned by founders, directors of the company, trusts, venture capitalists and other companies are also excluded. These are also deemed strategic holders, and are considered long-term holders <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock’s</b> equity. Any strategic shareholdings that are greater than 5% of total issued shares are excluded from the relevant float.|$|R

50|$|Stock {{market is}} the act of trying to {{determine}} the future value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> company <b>stock</b> or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock's</b> future price could yield significant profit. The efficient-market hypothesis suggests that stock prices reflect all currently available information and any price changes that are not based on newly revealed information thus are inherently unpredictable.

To determine the impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stocking</b> rate restriction on <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> New Zealand dairy farms, a whole-farm model was optimised with and without <b>a</b> maximum <b>stocking</b> rate <b>of</b> 2. 5 cows per hectare. Three farm systems, which differ by their level of feed-related capital, were examined for the changes to the optimal stocking rate and optimal level of animal milk production genetics when utility was maximised. The whole-farm model was optimised through the use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> evolutionary algorithm called differential evolution. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stocking</b> rate restriction would have a very large impact on the optimally organised high feed-related capital farm systems, reducing their certainty equivalent by almost half.

A stock trader also conducts extensive research and observation of how financial markets perform. This is accomplished through economic and microeconomic study; consequently, more advanced stock traders will delve into macroeconomics and industry specific technical analysis to track asset or corporate performance. Other duties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> trader include comparison of financial analysis to current and future regulation {{of his or her}} occupation.|$|E

Both statues sport priestly vestments that frame their bodies realistically. They stand life-size and alone and are fully sculpted in the round as if {{intended}} to be viewed from any angle. Mujaku is depicted as a thin man manipulating some sort of holy, cloth-wrapped object. He appears reserved and reflective. Seshin, in contrast, is depicted in mid conversation, gesturing and speaking, an extroverted counterweight to the solemn Mujaku. The men are shown as specific people, not simply members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> type.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, {{economic}} reforms were introduced.

Later this expanded to include a gradual liberalization of price controls; fiscal decentralization; massive privatization of state enterprises, thereby allowing a wide variety of private enterprises in the services and light manufacturing; the foundation of a diversified banking system (but with large amounts of state control); the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> market; and the opening of the economy to increased foreign trade and foreign investment.|$|E

25|$|Cash {{settlement}} − a {{cash payment}} is made {{based on the}} underlying reference rate, such as a short-term interest rate index such as 90 Day T-Bills, or the closing value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> market index. The parties settle by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash when the contract expires. Cash settled futures are those that, as a practical matter, could not be settled by delivery of the referenced item—for example, {{it would be impossible}} to deliver an index. A futures contract might also opt to settle against an index based on trade in a related spot market. ICE Brent futures use this method.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark Kritzman who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> index fund, a bond index fund, and ten hypothetical hedge funds. The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of performance fees. To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees. The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.|$|E
