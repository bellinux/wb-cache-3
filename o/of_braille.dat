25|$|A braille {{embosser}} is, simply put, {{a printer}} for braille. Instead {{of a standard}} printer adding ink onto a page, the braille embosser imprints the raised dots <b>of</b> <b>braille</b> onto a page. Some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch.|$|E
25|$|Novel systems <b>of</b> <b>braille</b> mapping include Korean, which adopts {{separate}} syllable-initial and syllable-final {{forms for}} its consonants, explicitly grouping braille cells into syllabic {{groups in the}} same way as hangul. Japanese, meanwhile, combines independent vowel dot patterns and modifier consonant dot patterns into a single braille cell – an abugida representation of each Japanese mora.|$|E

50|$|Many {{documents}} are printed inter-point, meaning they are double-sided. As such, the depressions <b>of</b> the <b>braille</b> <b>of</b> one side appear interlaid with the protruding <b>braille</b> <b>of</b> the other side.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{in other}} alphabets braille {{characters}} {{were assigned to}} print letters according to frequency, so that the simplest letters {{would be the most}} frequent, making the writing <b>of</b> <b>braille</b> significantly more efficient. However, the letter frequencies of German were very different from those of English, so that frequency-based German braille alphabets were utterly alien to readers of frequency-based American Braille, as well as to numerically based German, English, and French Braille.|$|E
25|$|MVMs debuted on January 25, 1999 and are {{now found}} in two models, both of which allow {{customers}} to purchase any type of MetroCard through a touchscreen. The machines also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, through use <b>of</b> <b>Braille</b> and a headset jack: audible commands for each menu item are provided once a headset is connected and the proper sequence is keyed through the keypad; all non-visual commands are then entered via the keypad instead of the touchscreen.|$|E
25|$|Although blind {{students}} {{have benefited from}} talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills {{that can never be}} replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students. Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and Nemeth code (a type <b>of</b> <b>braille</b> code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives {{blind and visually impaired students}} a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.|$|E

25|$|The goal <b>of</b> <b>braille</b> {{uniformity}} is {{to unify}} the braille alphabets {{of the world as}} much as possible, so that literacy in one braille alphabet readily transfers to another. Unification was first achieved by a convention of the International Congress on Work for the Blind in 1878, where it was decided to replace the mutually incompatible national conventions of the time with the French values of the basic Latin alphabet, both for languages which use Latin-based alphabets and, through their Latin equivalents, for languages which use other scripts. However, the unification did not address letters beyond these 26, leaving French and German Braille partially incompatible, and as braille spread to new languages with new needs, national conventions again became disparate. A second round of unification was undertaken under the auspices of UNESCO in 1951, setting the foundation for international braille usage today.|$|E
25|$|Critics, {{such as the}} American Council of the Blind, {{note that}} U.S. bills are {{relatively}} hard to tell apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint secondary color was added), {{and they are all}} the same size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value and/or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use <b>of</b> <b>Braille</b> codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because (1) these markings would only be useful to people who know how to read Braille, and (2) one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is rubbed off. Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in their wallets, they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-reading machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still have to trust sighted people or machines each time they receive US banknotes.|$|E

500|$|Through the {{overwhelming}} insistence {{of the blind}} pupils, Braille's system was finally adopted by the Institute in 1854, two years after his death. The system spread throughout the French-speaking world, but was slower to expand in other places. However, {{by the time of}} the first all-European conference of teachers of the blind in 1873, the cause <b>of</b> <b>braille</b> was championed by Dr. Thomas Rhodes Armitage and thereafter its international use increased rapidly. By 1882, Dr. Armitage was able to report that [...] "There is now probably no institution in the civilized world where braille is not used except in some of those in North America." [...] Eventually even these holdouts relented: braille was officially adopted by schools for the blind in the United States in 1916, and a universal braille code for English was formalized in 1932.|$|E
