5|$|Breyer has {{consistently}} {{voted in favor}} <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>rights,</b> {{one of the most}} controversial areas of the Supreme Court's docket. He has also defended the Supreme Court's use of foreign law and international law as persuasive (but not binding) authority in its decisions. However, Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Supreme Court's First Amendment rulings. Breyer has also demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Supreme Court justice since 1994.|$|E

25|$|In Practical Ethics, Singer {{argues in}} favour <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> {{on the grounds}} that fetuses are neither {{rational}} nor self-aware, and can therefore hold no preferences. As a result, he argues that the preference of a mother to have an abortion automatically takes precedence. In sum, Singer argues that a fetus lacks personhood.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this opinion}} and {{eugenics}} remains controversial, {{the decision in}} this case still stands. Buck v.

Although Ginsburg has consistently supported abortion rights and joined in the Court's opinion striking down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law in Stenberg v. Carhart , on the fortieth anniversary of the Court's ruling in Roe v.

40|$|This Article {{supports}} the court 2 ̆ 7 s position {{that there is}} no state constitutional right to state funding <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> It focuses on three areas often neglected by appellate courts. First, this article will look at the legal environment in which the Constitution of 1868 was adopted. As of 1868, the law of North Carolina would have been hostile to a claim <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> to <b>abortion</b> or a <b>right</b> to state funding <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> <b>Abortion</b> <b>rights</b> litigants offer several state cases as precedent for their position. Next, this article will demonstrate that many of these cases are not persuasive or are distinguishable. Those few decided on state constitutional grounds include persuasive dissents or are based on logical fallacies. By focusing on state court decisions in favor <b>of</b> their position, <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> litigants misdirect the courts {{from the fact that the}} great majority of American states do not pay for state funded abortions, except to the very limited extent required by federal law, and have not suffered a known legal challenge on state constitutional grounds. And finally, the history of North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 s State Abortion Fund will be examined along with the term 2 ̆ 2 medically necessary, 2 ̆ 2 often used by courts, in the context <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> funding...|$|R

2500|$|Drinan {{continued}} to be a vocal supporter <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>rights,</b> much to the ire of some of the Catholic hierarchy, and notably spoke out in support of President Bill Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 1996. In his weekly column for the Catholic New York, Cardinal John O'Connor sharply denounced Drinan.

2500|$|After the {{judicial}} appointments by President George W. Bush, Kennedy again became the needed fifth vote {{to strike down}} abortion restrictions. Since Kennedy's conception <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> is narrower than O'Connor's, {{this led to a}} Court slightly more supportive of abortion restrictions after 2006. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in 2007's Gonzales v. Carhart, which held that a federal law criminalizing partial-birth abortion did not violate Casey because it did not impose an [...] "undue burden". The decision did not expressly overrule Stenberg, although many commentators saw it as having that effect.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout Drinan's {{political}} career, his overt support <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>rights</b> drew significant {{opposition from}} Church leaders.

2500|$|Daniel C.

[...] This general trend among [...] "mainline" [...] Protestant denominations has been resisted by Christian Fundamentalists who are generally opposed to abortion.

2500|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} upheld Congress's ban {{and held}} {{that it did}} not impose an undue burden on the due process right of women to obtain an abortion, [...] "under precedents we here assume to be controlling," [...] such as the Court's prior decisions in Roe v.

However, Gonzales was widely interpreted as signaling a shift in Supreme Court jurisprudence toward a restriction <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>rights,</b> occasioned in part by the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor and her replacement by Samuel Alito.|$|E
