40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} key {{theoretical}} and empirical findings {{of the literature on}} non-Keynesian effects of fiscal policy, or “expansionary fiscal consolidations. ” Specifically, it seeks to identify why the empirical evidence is rather ambiguous about the effects that fiscal contractions have on private consumption, investment, national saving and output. The empirical evidence surveyed in this paper is found to provide no clear support for the existence of expansionary fiscal consolidations. The safest conclusion seems to be that fiscal policy has lost some of its ability to stabilize the economy over the recent past. Austria's fiscal consolidation of 1995 — 1997, identified as expansionary by the European Commission, is found to have relied significantly on <b>one-off</b> <b>measures.</b> <b>Fiscal</b> Policy...|$|R

It has also emphasized the intent to adopt fiscal and taxation systems that are conducive to “scientific” development, and compensate for use of resources and damage to the ecological environment. This policy note titled Energy Conservation in the People’s Republic China: <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Measures</b> was prepared by the Energy Division of East Asian Department, Asian Development Bank (ADB). The policy note provides broad discussions on major issues relevant to introduction of <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures</b> to improve energy efficiency, and suggests how ADB can help the Government achieve its energy conservation goal by using sound <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures.</b> References of lessons from international experience are included for further research. This executive summary succinctly presents the salient points of the policy note, which consists of four chapters. Chapter I briefly highlights the importance of energy conservation in the PRC. Chapter II provides analyses on policies and practices for using <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures</b> to promote energy conservation, based on international experience. Chapter III prioritizes the <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures</b> that could best suit with the PRC’s current circumstances. Chapter IV suggests possible areas for further ADB assistance to promote energy conservation in the PRC.

40|$|The paper {{tests the}} effects on the Italian economy of a <b>fiscal</b> <b>measure</b> aimed at {{lowering}} the VAT rate from 10 % to 5 % in the Italian 'Hotels and Restaurants' sector. The analysis focuses first on the impacts in terms of tourism consumption, investments of the sector and public budget. Thereafter, {{by means of a}} multiregional-multisectoral input-output model, the increase on the total employment levels by sector and by region has been estimated. Based on a tourism demand elasticity of - 1. 06 and a supply elasticity of 2. 0, tourist nights would increase by a maximum of 3. 15 % and total tourism consumption by 4. 4 %, while gross fixed investments by the sector would increase by 2. 17 %. As for the budget constraint, we have calculated the final 'cost' of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>measure</b> for the Treasury. Concerning the macroeconomic effects in terms of employment, the <b>fiscal</b> <b>measure</b> would produce a total increase of almost 100, 000 jobs (expressed in fulltime equivalents).

40|$|The <b>fiscal</b> {{consolidation}} <b>measures</b> {{adopted in}} many euro area countries over 2010 - 13 reduced excessive domestic fiscal imbalances, but {{came at the}} cost of short-term output losses. This simultaneous tightening of fiscal policy raised concerns that such output losses might be exacerbated by negative spillovers from other countries. This paper presents some model-based simulations for the euro area with a view to gauge the cross-country impact of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures</b> adopted over 2010 - 13. The paper finds that the output effects of the fiscal consolidation were heterogeneous across countries, reflecting the different amounts and composition of <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures</b> adopted. We find that the trade channel is able to generate sizeable cross-border fiscal spillovers in the euro area. However, once the analysis takes into account the remaining channels (e. g. monetary policy reaction, exchange rate, and risk premium) total spillovers are estimated to be relatively small. In general, when compared to the growth fallout of domestic fiscal policies, negative fiscal spillovers do not seem to have added much to the economic growth woes of vulnerable countries...|$|R

30|$|The {{strategy}} of the voluntary agreement was three-pillared. Next to the main supply-side measures to reduce car CO 2 emissions, an additional 10 % emission reduction was to be achieved through a labelling scheme and car-related <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures</b> to influence consumer demand[107]. When the voluntary agreement was verbalized, ACEA President Pischetsrieder initially called for ‘no negative measures against diesel-fuelled cars’ (interview, in[98]). The Commission finally agreed {{to include in the}} text a vague reference to ‘unhampered diffusion’ of CO 2 -efficient technologies in order to cater for ACEA's concerns regarding <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures.</b> As Kågeson[108] asserts, this wording served to replace ACEA's condition in an earlier outline proposal that ‘no negative measures against diesel-fuelled cars’ should be taken. Moreover, the Commission bowed to ACEA pressure and agreed to review the commitment ‘under certain circumstances’ should <b>fiscal</b> <b>measures</b> interfere with the particular fuel-efficient technologies which the manufacturers were trying to promote ([95] in[98]). Just a couple months after the voluntary agreement was signed, Pischetsrieder referred to this matter and made clear that ‘although we do not question the right of the Community and its Member States to exercise their prerogatives in the field of fiscal policy’, changing the structure of vehicle taxation ‘could have serious consequences for the competitiveness of the industry and the employment in the sector’[109].|$|R
