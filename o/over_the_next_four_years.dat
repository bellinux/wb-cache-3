In 1792 Rotheram was made first lieutenant of HMS Culloden and was still in this position when the French Revolutionary War broke out a year later.

5|$|In 1986, {{the annual}} Teamsters {{convention}} {{was held at}} Caesars with a $650,000 party. The lavish feast included caviar, crab claws, roast beef {{and a range of}} 15 different desserts. In 1991, Sheila King won a $250,000 jackpot in the casino at Caesars Palace on a $500 machine, and won $50,000 twice soon afterwards. Over three years she won $200 million on the machines but kept pumping the money back into the machines. Despite her luck, in 1994 her winnings fell to $500,000, and she spent much of her time <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> in the law courts claiming that the casino operators had tampered with her machines and deceived her to keep her winning.|$|E

5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> {{all three}} of the regiment's {{operational}} squadrons eventually served in Vietnam, providing invaluable close support to the infantry, particularly during the clearance of Viet Cong bunker systems. Although their value in Vietnam was originally questioned by some, they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence, and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties. The Centurions were able to move through the countryside more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield. The tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968.|$|E
5|$|Since the War of the Third Coalition, the French had {{maintained}} client kingdoms in Italy and Naples that controlled the western {{shores of the}} Adriatic. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> strategically important islands and territories had been seized in the treaties of Tilsit and Schönbrunn, giving Napoleon direct command of the eastern shore. With these treaties, France had seized not only several important fortress islands, most notably Corfu, but also many important shipyards and harbours. Maintaining control of the Adriatic was however even harder than seizing it had been, the threat of attack by Austrian, Russian or Ottoman armies and the mountainous terrain of the Balkans forcing the development of garrisons that could be effectively resupplied only by sea.|$|E
5|$|Stalinist {{officials}} allocated no {{funding for}} the design competition nor for the memorial, and the committee disbanded in 1948; by then many survivors had left the country. In 1949, the town of Sokołów Podlaski protected the camp with a new fence and gate. A work crew with no archaeological experience was sent in to landscape the grounds. In 1958, {{after the end of}} Stalinism in Poland, the Warsaw provincial council declared Treblinka to be a place of martyrology. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> 127 hectares (318 acres) of land that had formed part of the camp was purchased from 192 farmers in the villages of Prostyń, Grądy, Wólka Okrąglik and Nowa Maliszewa.|$|E

5|$|The 1955–56 title win {{proved to}} be the {{original}} Panthers' last. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> Nottingham alternated between bottom and second place in the league standings. After finishing runner-up in 1959–60, the Panthers took part in the first British Championship final in thirty years where they faced the Brighton Tigers. Nottingham were defeated 3–2 in the first leg but won the second in regulation time by the same scoreline forcing overtime. The Tigers clinched the tie 6–5 after six minutes and 32 seconds of the extra session. During the close season of 1960 the British National League collapsed and the Nottingham Panthers were disbanded. Ice hockey would not return to Nottingham for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 the New York Tribune sent Fuller to Europe, {{specifically}} England and Italy, as {{its first}} female foreign correspondent. She traveled from Boston to Liverpool in August on the Cambria, a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen hours. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> she provided the Tribune with thirty-seven reports. She interviewed many prominent writers including George Sand and Thomas Carlylewhom she found disappointing because of his reactionary politics, among other things. George Sand had previously been an idol of hers, but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not {{to run for the}} French National Assembly, saying that women were not ready to vote or to hold political office. Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to Elizabeth Barrett by Cornelius Mathews, but did not meet her at that time, because Barrett had just eloped with Robert Browning.|$|E

In the 1909–10 season, Moran joined the Montreal All-Stars from the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and as the league folded, he then joined the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA). In his only season with the Comets, Moran posted a 3–8 record over 11games, letting in 79goals.|$|E

5|$|Nidhogg is a side-scrolling two-player {{fighting}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Messhof. Players duel with swords in a pixelated environment. The game was commissioned for the New York University Game Center's annual multiplayer show, and was revised and demoed at private events <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> before its final release. It won Indiecade 2013's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo award. It was released for Microsoft Windows on January 13, 2014, and later ported to OS X, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. Critics praised {{the feel of the}} gameplay and its balance, but considered its single-player mode unsatisfying. Messhof released a sequel in 2017 with a higher resolution art style and additional weapons and arenas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> neither Henry nor the barons {{were able}} to restore {{stability}} in England, and power swung {{back and forth between}} the different factions. One of the priorities for the new regime was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a peace treaty with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government. Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the ICC Intercontinental Cup in 2004, Ireland had a chance to play first-class on a regular basis. After failing to progress beyond the group stages in the 2004 competition, Ireland won their first Cup title in October 2005 with a six-wicket win over Kenya. The 2005 ICC Trophy, which was hosted in Ireland– the group stages in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the final stages in Dublin, Republic of Ireland– saw the Irish make the final, which they lost to Scotland. Though Ireland were runners-up, they had secured their place at the 2007 World Cup as well as an extra $500,000 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> from the ICC to encourage development of Irish cricket. They also gained official ODI.|$|E
