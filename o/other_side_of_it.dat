500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is really not that fun. I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which I think is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I never had that with the record industry. Now that I'm on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E

2500|$|By Morrison's own account, {{this was}} the first album that was {{completely}} produced under his complete control. [...] The recording sessions even took place in a recording studio he had built next door to his home in Fairfax, California. [...] He remarked on the album: [...] "As a concept for the album, I was just trying to establish how hard it was [...] to do what I do. [...] Plus there were some lighter things [...] on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> One side has a kind of hard feeling while the other is soft." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of [...] (2009), the Hub is {{destroyed}} and Torchwood relocate to London as fugitives. Torchwood itself is later destroyed {{by the end of}} the serial. Fans were left asking the fate of, among other things, the Rift. The [...] of Torchwood relocates primarily to the United States. When asked in an interview with SFX magazine, Davies stated [...] "I like to think that when [...] Steven Moffat so thoughtfully closed all those cracks in the universe, the Rift in Cardiff closed up at the same time. I used to wonder what the hell happened to that Rift and now it's all solved. When I watched those cracks seal up I was like, 'Oh, thank you.'" [...] This refers to the events of the 2010 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Big Bang", which was written by Steven Moffat. However, Torchwood media in 2011 since provided a direct explanation for the Rift. In the radio drama [...] "The House of the Dead", Jack visits a haunted location where the Rift allows ghosts, including the deceased Ianto Jones, to enter into the living world. To close the Rift forever and seal an ancient evil on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Jack creates a device designed to seal the Rift. The device will also provide Jack an end to his cycle of resurrections. However, Ianto's spirit tricks Jack into leaving, and detonates the device himself, closing the Rift [...] "forever" [...] and with it the barrier between the living and the dead.|$|E
