5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction. The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss <b>of</b> <b>sensation.</b> Neuropathic pain, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain {{in the absence of}} any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and interferes with sex.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{has three}} sections. The first {{introduces}} Brentano’s view <b>of</b> <b>sensations</b> by presenting the intentional features <b>of</b> <b>sensations</b> irreducible to {{features of the}} sensory objects. The second presents Brentano’s view of sensory objects —which include sensory qualities— and the features <b>of</b> <b>sensations</b> that such objects allow to explain, such as their intensity. The third section presents Brentano’s approach to sensory pleasures and pains, which combines both appeal to specific modes of reference and to specific sensory qualities...|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes an {{analysis}} of the Bretanian conception of the objects <b>of</b> <b>sensations</b> and a review of the neo-Brentanian literature on this theme. Starting from the Brentanian thesis that all mental phenomena are intentional, it intends to analyze if the objects <b>of</b> <b>sensations</b> would have the same intentional property. This is also an issue on the meaning and the home of the objects <b>of</b> <b>sensations.</b> From the analysis of the Brentanian thesis, in parallel, the paper seeks to identify the extent and the limit of a representationalist perspective in Philosophy of Mind. Finally, it indicates a form of adverbialism as a possible alternative to a representationalist view on the objects <b>of</b> <b>sensations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, emotion and drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by our senses. This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into educational psychology, addressing the question of general versus specific training in terms teachers could understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological concepts {{to figure out how}} to avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to coexist peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to coexist in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle, in {{contrast}} to earlier philosophers, but {{in accordance with the}} Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.

There must consequently be some other external source of the inexhaustible diversity <b>of</b> <b>sensations.</b> The source <b>of</b> our <b>sensations,</b> Berkeley concluded, could only be God; He gave them to man, who had to see in them signs and symbols that carried God's word.|$|R

40|$|Acupuncture uses needles {{to stimulate}} {{certain parts of}} the body, {{inducing}} a specific sensation, termed DeQi, which many regard as essential for acupuncture's therapeutic effect. Here, we used the newly developed tool, bodily sensation mapping, to investigate the spatial configuration <b>of</b> acupuncture-induced <b>sensations</b> throughout the body. Twenty-five participants randomly received acupuncture stimulation or tactile stimulation using a von Frey filament at four different acuoints (HT 7, PC 6, ST 36, and SP 10) {{on the left side of}} the body. Subjects evaluated the characteristics <b>of</b> DeQi <b>sensations</b> and marked the areas <b>of</b> induced <b>sensations</b> on a body outline. We compared the psychophysical responses <b>of</b> DeQi <b>sensations</b> and visualized the spatial patterns <b>of</b> these <b>sensations</b> using statistical parametric mapping. We found greater intensity <b>of</b> DeQi <b>sensations</b> following acupuncture stimulation compared with tactile stimulation, with relatively small differences among the four acupoints. The sensation maps exhibited similar spatial patterns for acupuncture and tactile stimulation in the areas close to the stimulated sites. However, acupuncture was associated with additional sensations in areas remote from the stimulated sites. This study demonstrates that acupuncture stimulation produces greater DeQi sensations than tactile stimulation and results in the spreading <b>of</b> <b>sensations</b> to areas remote from the stimulus sites. Investigating the spatial patterns <b>of</b> acupuncture-induced <b>sensations</b> may be crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture...|$|R
