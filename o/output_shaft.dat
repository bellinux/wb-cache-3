25|$|The Nimbus is a {{turboshaft}} engine comprising a gas generator section, {{which consists of}} a three-stage compressor, (two axial stages and one centrifugal stage), driven by a two-stage turbine in conjunction with an annular combustion chamber, and a power output section consisting of a single-stage free turbine driving an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> via a two-stage reduction gearbox.|$|E
25|$|The Wankel {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. In contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs, the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity, smoothness, compactness, high revolutions per minute, and a high power-to-weight ratio primarily {{due to the fact that}} it produces three power pulses per rotor revolution compared to one per revolution in a two-stroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a four-stroke piston engine (although at the actual <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> there is only one power pulse per revolution, since the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does, as can be seen in the animation below, making it roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of the same displacement; this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor, since only one face is working for each <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> revolution). The engine is commonly referred to as a rotary engine, although this name also applies to other completely different designs, primarily aircraft engines with their cylinders arranged in a circular fashion around the crankshaft. All parts rotate consistently in one direction, as opposed to the common reciprocating piston engine, which has pistons violently changing direction. The four-stage cycle of intake, compression, ignition, and exhaust occur each revolution at each of the three rotor tips moving inside the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing, enabling the three power pulses per rotor revolution. The rotor is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with sides that are somewhat flatter.|$|E
25|$|In a Wankel engine, the {{fuel-air}} mixture {{cannot be}} pre-stored {{because there are}} consecutive intake cycles. The engine has a 50% longer stroke duration than a reciprocating piston engine. The four Otto cycles last 1080° for a Wankel engine (three revolutions of the <b>output</b> <b>shaft)</b> versus 720° for a four-stroke reciprocating engine, but the four strokes are still the same proportion of the total.|$|E
40|$|A {{planetary}} (epicyclic) {{gear set}} {{is provided with}} a reversible rotating input <b>shaft</b> and individual <b>outputs</b> <b>shafts</b> actuated, respectively, by the ring gear and planet gear carrier. Latch means is positioned to selectively and automatically stop the ring gear or carrier member while releasing the other to provide the desired sequential output operation. The <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> are reversed in sequence and direction of rotation by reversing rotational direction of the input shaft...|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} AC {{induction}} and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An AC motor has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC {{to produce a}} rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> that is given a torque by the rotating field.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{engines are}} {{considerably}} lighter and simpler, containing far fewer moving parts than piston engines of equivalent power output. Valves or complex valve trains are eliminated by using simple ports {{cut into the}} walls of the rotor housing. Since the rotor rides directly on a large bearing on the <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> there are no connecting rods and no crankshaft. The elimination of reciprocating mass, and the elimination of the most highly stressed and failure prone parts of piston engines, gives the Wankel engine high reliability, a smoother flow of power, and a high power-to-weight ratio.|$|E
25|$|The United States Air Force's (USAF) {{competition}} for a helicopter {{to be used}} for support on missile bases included a specific requirement to mandate the use of the General Electric T58 turboshaft as a powerplant. The Air Force had a large inventory of these engines on hand for its fleet of HH-3 Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopters and using the same engine for both helicopters would save costs. In response, Bell proposed an upgraded version of the 204B with the T58 engine. Because the T58 <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is at the rear, and was thus mounted in front of the transmission on the HH-3, it had to have a separate offset gearbox (SDG or speed decreaser gearbox) at the rear, and shafting to couple to the UH-1 transmission.|$|E

25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's counter gear shaft. The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the California Motor Company {{was formed}} in 1901 to sell {{complete}} gasoline-engine motorbikes in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. The company began with a 200cc single-cylinder, 1.5-horsepower, four-stroke engine designed by R.C. Marks. Mounted to a standard bicycle frame, the California could reach speeds of approximately 25mph (40km/h). The California weighed around 75-80 pounds, and featured a leading-link front fork, a leather spring saddle, a front Duck roller brake, and an Atherton rear coaster brake. A leathern belt-drive directly connected the engine <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to the rear wheel. During the summer of 1903, George A. Wyman rode a 200cc, 1.5-horsepower California from San Francisco to New York City, becoming {{the first person to}} cross the North American continent aboard a motor vehicle.|$|E
25|$|An {{improvement}} in form {{came at the}} Italian Grand Prix where the cars ran without wings and Goodyear brought their new G9 specification tyre. McLaren qualified on the front row and led to begin with until he slowed {{at the scene of}} an accident and was caught by Stewart, Hulme and Jo Siffert in a Lotus. A slipstreaming battle ensued; McLaren retired with an oil leak at mid-distance but Hulme went on to win. From the Canadian Grand Prix onwards, a third M7A was driven by Dan Gurney whose Anglo American Racers team – for whom Bruce McLaren had driven for three races in 1967 – had run out of funding for their own Eagle cars. Gurney retired with overheating in Canada, but Hulme and McLaren continued their success by finishing first and second respectively, albeit after their strongest challengers had all retired. Hulme was then jointly in the lead of the drivers' championship with two races to go. He ran competitively towards the beginning of the United States Grand Prix but ultimately retired via a spin, pit stops to repair damaged brake lines and a gearbox <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> failure which spun him again, this time into a crash. McLaren was sixth, Gurney fourth. Going into the final race in Mexico, Hulme retained a chance of defending his title. McLaren finished second there, but Hulme crashed out because of a broken suspension damper allowing Hill to win the drivers' championship.|$|E
30|$|The pulse period {{sequences}} Si(n) and So(n) of {{the input}} and <b>output</b> <b>shafts,</b> respectively, are measured synchronously; then, the respective instantaneous revolution speeds Vi(n) and Vo(n) are calculated using Eq. (4).|$|R
50|$|The constant-velocity {{relationship}} between input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> {{joined by a}} Schmidt coupling is unaffected by changes in radial displacement. This relationship is similarly unaffected by initial radial reaction forces which could otherwise imbalance the system.|$|R

500|$|Expressing the {{behaviour}} of {{a mechanical}} component as a two-port or multi-port with a transfer matrix {{is a useful}} thing to do because, like electrical circuits, the component can often be operated in reverse and its behaviour {{is dependent on the}} loads at the inputs and outputs. [...] For instance, a gear train is often characterised simply by its gear ratio, a SISO transfer function. [...] However, the gearbox <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> can be driven round to turn the input shaft requiring a MIMO analysis. [...] In this example the effort and flow variables are torque [...] and angular velocity [...] respectively. [...] The transfer matrix in terms of z-parameters will look like, ...|$|E
2500|$|A hybrid between piston and rotary {{configuration}} is {{a double}} acting engine. This design rotates the displacers {{on either side of}} the power piston. In addition to giving great design variability in the heat transfer area, this layout eliminates all but one external seal on the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and one internal seal on the piston. Also, both sides can be highly pressurized as they balance against each other.|$|E
50|$|Other {{advantages}} {{shared with}} similar CVT designs include that the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> may be either in-line, offset, or in a U configuration (input and output both coaxial and coplanar), making the transmission simple, small, light {{and easy to}} package.|$|R
25|$|Many {{differentials}} {{have no way}} {{of limiting}} the amount of engine power that gets sent to its attached <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> As a result, if a tire loses traction on acceleration, either because of a low-traction situation (e.g., - driving on gravel or ice) or the engine power overcomes available traction, the tire that is not slipping receives little or no power from the engine. In very low traction situations, this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all. To overcome this, there are several designs of differentials that can either limit the amount of slip (these are called 'limited-slip' differentials) or temporarily lock the two <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally.|$|R
5000|$|The Thompson {{constant}} velocity joint (TCVJ), {{also known as a}} Thompson coupling, assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain {{constant velocity}} for the control yoke that aligns the cardan joints, the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> is needed to reduce control yoke wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the [...] "disallowed" [...] angles.|$|R
2500|$|The RS6 {{was only}} {{available}} with Audi's Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive, utilising the Torsen T-2 dynamic 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential (diff), a modified unit which {{was being used}} in the 6.0-litre W12-powered Audi D2 A8. [...] The torque from the engine is first routed from the gearbox <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to the Torsen centre diff, and then automatically divided and apportioned between the front and rear axles.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} engines were fitted. A standard {{engine was}} a 450hp (300kW) Napier Lion water-cooled W-12. An alternative was the 360hp (270kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle IX water-cooled V-12 engine. [...] Both drove a four blade propeller. [...] The two engines had similar metal cowlings, differing externally {{only in the}} number and position of the exhaust pipes (3×4 on the Lion, 2×6 on the Eagle) and the lower <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of the Eagle.|$|E
2500|$|... had {{a rather}} abrupt, {{dome-shaped}} nose housing the [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled V-8 engine and its [...] turbo-supercharger. The engine was mounted with its <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> low down in the nose and drove a two-blade propeller. [...] Though this was of the wooden, fixed-pitch type, it was intended {{that it would be}} replaced by a variable-pitch Lavasseur airscrew later. A single, roughly cylindrical Lamblin radiator was suspended below the engine, between the undercarriage legs.|$|E
50|$|Automotive limited-slip {{differentials}} all {{contain a}} few basic elements. First, all have a gear train that, like an open differential, allows the <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> to spin at different speeds while holding the sum of their speeds proportional {{to that of the}} input shaft.|$|R
30|$|Based on the timer/counter-based method, the {{instantaneous}} rotational {{speeds of}} the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> {{can be obtained}} synchronously from the optical encoder. Meanwhile, the differential signal of instantaneous speed can reduce the effect of external excitations and enhance the extraction ability of the localized fault feature.|$|R
50|$|A {{steering}} transmission combines the two functions {{needed for a}} tracked vehicle transmission: a transmission to couple the relatively constant engine speed to varying road speeds and a steering gearbox to drive the two <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> (and so the tracks) at different speeds, thus steering the vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the gearbox <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> To make a gear change, both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. [...] The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. [...] After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for shunting locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{powered by}} a Pobjoy R seven-cylinder radial engine; the two-blade {{propeller}} was driven via spur gears that reduced its speed and placed the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> above the engine centre, an unusual arrangement for a radial. [...] The cabin was under the wing with a deep starboard-side access door and multi-panel glazing. The fuselage tapered aft, with the tailplane set halfway up it, and its fin and rudder together were almost triangular apart from a rounded tip. The Multipro's conventional undercarriage was fixed, with the mainwheels on V-struts attached to the lower longerons and stabilized laterally by an inverted V-strut jointed at the fuselage central underside.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rear wheels}} were {{driven by a}} {{traditional}} Lamborghini V12 engine mounted longitudinally with a mid-engined configuration. This contrasted with the Miura with its centrally mounted, transversely-installed engine. [...] For better weight distribution, the engine is pointed [...] "backwards"; the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is at the front, and the gearbox {{is in front of}} the engine, the driveshaft running back through the engine's sump to a differential at the rear. Although originally planned as a [...] powerplant, the first production cars used the Lamborghini Miura's 4-liter engine. Later advances increased the displacement to 4754cc and then (in the [...] "Quattrovalvole" [...] model) 5167cc with four valves per cylinder.|$|E
50|$|An Oldham {{coupling}} {{has three}} discs, one coupled to the input, one coupled to the output, and a middle disc that is joined {{to the first}} two by tongue and groove. The tongue and groove on one side is perpendicular to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center {{at the same speed}} as the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> Often springs are used to reduce backlash of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for John Oldham who invented it in Ireland, in 1821, to solve a problem in a paddle steamer design.|$|R
50|$|A related {{device is}} the Geislinger damper. This is broadly the same coupling, but both input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> are {{connected}} to the same central hub. The massive outer casing is connected to this through similar leaf spring packs, but is free to move torsionally, with damping. It is used as a harmonic damper to control vibrations in shafts.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees {{using the}} NV247 {{transfer}} case, in [...] "4-All Time" [...] mode torque {{is applied to}} only the rear wheels under normal driving conditions. A gerotor pump is connected between {{the front and rear}} <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> and senses any speed difference between them. When the shafts are turning at different speeds (wheel slippage), the pump supplies oil under pressure to a wet clutch pack. The clutch pack applies progressive 0 to 100% locking between the front and rear <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> For example, if the rear axle starts rotating at a significantly higher rate than the front axle, the gerotor pump causes the clutch pack to progressively lock, transferring torque to the front axle until both axles are driven at the same speed. The apply pressure in the clutch pack bleeds off slowly, which progressively unlocks the clutch pack and biases torque output towards [...] "rear only" [...] unless the rear wheels are still slipping. There is no center differential, so on dry pavement the front and rear <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> cannot be locked without causing driveline binding. The [...] "N" [...] or neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In [...] "4-Lo" [...] mode, the input shaft drives through a 2.72:1 reduction planetary gear set and the front and rear axles are locked together through the clutch pack. This same NV247 transfer case is the foundation for the Quadra-Drive system described below.|$|R
