Spawned by the American dissatisfaction with the political system, grassroots organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve ballot access following his announcement.

500|$|Donald Trump's presidential {{campaign}} of 2000 {{for the nomination}} of the Reform Party began when real estate magnate Donald Trump of New York announced {{the creation of a}} presidential exploratory committee on the October 7, 1999 edition <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> <b>Live.</b> Though Trump had never held elected office, he was well known for his frequent comments on public affairs and business exploits as head of The Trump Organization. He had previously considered a presidential run in 1988 as a Republican, but chose not to run. For 2000, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura persuaded Trump to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party, which was fracturing despite achieving ballot access and qualifying for matching funds {{as a result of the}} 1996 {{presidential campaign}} of businessman Ross Perot. [...] Trump's entrance into the Reform Party race coincided with that of paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan, whom Trump attacked throughout the campaign as a [...] "Hitler-lover." ...|$|E

During an interrogation, Mike Logan sarcastically refers to Reggie as James Dean, the famous actor and American cultural icon. Captain Danny Ross refers to the episode's shooting as [...] "cyber-Rashomon. Reggie says Holden shot Todd, Holden says Reggie did it and Willow doesn't even believe anyone's dead." [...] This references the 1950 Japanese film Rashomon, in which multiple characters describe vastly different interpretations of the same murder. A poster for Grand Illusion, the 1932 Jean Renoir war film, hangs in Holden's apartment.

Las Vegas Gladiators owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason why a renewed deal with NBC failed was because ESPN refused to show highlights of the games or even mention a product being broadcast on NBC.|$|R
500|$|Ross Perot {{appeared}} on the February 20 edition <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> <b>Live</b> on CNN, his fourth appearance on the show since 1991. After a lively interview concerning political issues, King directly asked Perot if there was [...] "any scenario in which [...] would run for president." [...] Perot firmly stated {{that he did not}} want to run, but spontaneously affirmed that he would begin a campaign if [...] "ordinary people" [...] signed petitions and helped him achieve ballot access in all 50 states. He set up a phone bank at his office on March 12, staffed with volunteers to inform interested voters and supporters on how they could assist Perot's potential campaign. Supporters viewed the candidate as an [...] "action man... who can get things done... takes care of his people". They were angry at President Bush for reneging on [...] The New York Times speculated that Perot's [...] "iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners persona and anti-politics politics" [...] would appeal to the [...] "angry frustrated electorate". But Republican consultant Karl Rove characterized Perot as an [...] "untested wild man". He rejected any financial donations for more than $5, and stated that he would personally fund a potential campaign. Perot spent $400,000 of his own money in the first month, however, he largely spread this message via television, capped by a March 18 National Press Club speech, which aired on C-SPAN.|$|E
