5|$|Colony Ross, {{known as}} Fort Ross today, {{was built in}} California just north of San Francisco Bay. It was the RAC's southernmost outpost and {{operated}} from 1812 to 1841, and was established as an agricultural base for supplying the northern settlements with food {{as well as for}} conducting trade with Alta California. The Ross Colony included a number of settlements spread out over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay. The administrative center was Port Rumianstev at Bodega Harbor, off Bodega Bay. An artel hunting camp was located on the Farallon Islands. Three ranches were established: the Kostromitinov Ranch on the Russian River near the mouth of Willow Creek, the Khlebnikov Ranch in the Salmon Creek valley about a mile (1.6km) north of the present day Bodega, and the Chernykh Ranch near present-day Graton. Fort Ross employed native Alaskans to hunt seals and sea otters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>California</b> coast. By 1840 California's sea otter population had been severely depleted.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the ratio}} of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a {{television}} station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require {{that there must be}} eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>California</b> side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television).|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>California</b> court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

5|$|Neither of {{the early}} designations— Highway 25 and Route 1 - was marked (signs posted by the California State Automobile Association used the Redwood Highway name), but in 1926 it became U.S. Route 199, a branch of US 99 from Grants Pass to US 101 in Crescent City. Oregon moved the Pacific Highway No. 1 from present OR 99 to I-5, which {{bypassed}} Grants Pass, in 1959, and the Redwood Highway No. 25 was extended north through downtown Grants Pass to I-5. A proposed branch on M Street to I-5 east of downtown was also included in Highway 25, but this {{was moved to the}} E and F Streets one-way pair in 1961. (I-5 here was built in the early 1960s, but US 99 remained on the old alignment.) <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>California</b> side of the state line, US 199 was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 and the State Scenic Highway System in 1963; in the 1964 renumbering the Route 1 designation was dropped, making Route 199 the legislative number. Although US 299 and US 399 became state routes in 1964, the shorter US 199, which crossed a state line, remained. US 99 has since become Oregon Route 99 through Grants Pass, and US 199 now ends at I-5. The spur east from downtown Grants Pass to I-5 was built {{at the same time as}} I-5, and in 1991 it was moved from E and F Streets to bypass downtown on the new Grants Pass Parkway.|$|E
