Some stigmatics marked themselves in attempt to suffer with Christ as a form of piety. Others marked themselves accidentally and their marks were noted as stigmata by witnesses.

After DC's The New 52 initiative that relaunched the company's comics continuity in 2011, the character of Superboy was revamped as a clone derived from three DNA sources and designed by Project N.O.W.H.E.R.E. as a recreation of Jon Lane Kent, the biological son of Superman and Lois Lane from a potential future timeline. After the character's death in the Superboy series, Kon-El was replaced by Jon Lane Kent in subsequent stories. After the events of Superboy #34 Kon-El returns as Superboy again.|$|E
25|$|Diernhofer {{first used}} the name Streptococcus dysgalactiae in 1932, {{describing}} a streptococcus of veterinary origin. Subsequently, Frost reported {{the discovery of}} the human pathogen Streptococcus equisimilis in 1936. Contemporarily, though, Rebecca Lancefield devised a classification of streptococci based on their carbohydrate-antigens, and successively described streptococci belonging to group C (1933) and group G (1935). The correlation of group carbohydrate specificity with the proposed species S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis, however, were not explored in detail. The Lancefield classification soon became the preferred laboratory identification method for streptococci, and the names S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis fell into disuse. In 1980, they were even removed from the List of Approved Bacterial species. Three years later, though, DNA hybridization studies revealed extensive similarities between the entities Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equisimilis, large-colony-forming group C and group G streptococcus <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>origin,</b> and certain large-colony-forming group C, G and L streptococci of animal origin. Accordingly, they were fused to one species, Streptococcus dysgalactiae. However, subsequent molecular investigations indicated heterogeneity within this new species, and in 1996 it was divided into S.dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis and S.dysgalactiae subspecies dysgalactiae.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{different}} typing {{systems for}} Streptococcus dysgalactiae have been used, the majority originally devised for the {{closely related species}} Streptococcus pyogenes. The most widely employed method is emm-typing. The emm-gene encodes the M-protein, a major virulence factor in both S.pyogenes and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. It is ubiquitous in SDSE <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>origin,</b> and its hypervariability in the 5’-terminal region forms the basis for categorization into separate emm-types. To date, more than 100 SDSE emm-types have been described (...) [...] The prevailing emm-types vary in different geographical regions, and clonal outbreaks have been reported. Unlike for S.pyogenes, a correlation between emm-type and disease manifestation or severity has not been established for S. dysgalactiae. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) has historically been employed for the exploration of clonal relationships among S.dysgalactiae, but with the increased availability and reduced costs of sequencing, {{it is likely to}} be replaced by MLST and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism-analysis (SNP).|$|E

[...] Following the Great Disappointment most Millerites simply gave up their beliefs. Some did not and viewpoints and explanations proliferated.

2500|$|In {{the first}} {{systematic}} genetic analysis of 30 hair samples that were suspected {{to be from}} bigfoot, yeti, sasquatch, almasty or other anomalous primates, only one {{was found to be}} primate in origin, and that was identified as human. A joint study by the University of Oxford and Lausanne's Cantonal Museum of Zoology and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2014, the team used a previously published cleaning method to remove all surface contamination and the ribosomal mitochondrial DNA 12S fragment of the sample was sequenced and then compared to GenBank to identify the species origin. The samples submitted were from different parts of the world, including the United States, Russia, the Himalayas, and Sumatra. Other than one sample <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>origin,</b> all but two are from common animals. Black and brown bear accounted for most of the samples, other animals include cow, horse, dog/wolf/coyote, sheep, goat, raccoon, porcupine, deer and tapir. The last two samples were thought to match a fossilized genetic sample of a 40,000 year old polar bear of the Pleistocene epoch; however, a later study disputes this finding. [...] In the second paper, tests identified the hairs as being from a rare type of brown bear.|$|E

2500|$|U.S. Federal laws {{governing}} recovery of treasure {{are governed by}} the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, [...] Under ARPA, [...] "archaeological resources" [...] {{more than one hundred}} years old on public lands belongs to the government. [...] The term [...] "archaeological resource" [...] means any material remains of past human life or activities which are [...] "of archaeological interest", as determined by federal regulations. Such regulations include, but are not limited to: pottery, basketry, bottles, weapons, weapon projectiles, tools, structures or portions of structures, pit houses, rock paintings, rock carvings, intaglios, graves, human skeletal materials, or any portion or piece of any of the foregoing items. [...] The definition of [...] "archaeological resource" [...] and [...] "archaeological interest" [...] has been broadly interpreted under U.S. agency regulations in recent years to include nearly anything <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>origin</b> more than 100 years old, while permits to allow recovery of such items have been largely restricted to digs by credentialed archaeologists. [...] The effect of ARPA as currently defined by federal regulations outlaws virtually all treasure hunting of items more than 100 years old, even treasure troves of gold and silver coin or scrip, under penalty of total forfeiture. [...] Furthermore, the Federal policy against spoliation and removal of [...] "archaeological resources" [...] of any type from federal or Indian lands, even coins and scrip less than 100 years old, means it is unlikely that a finder of gold or silver coinage on Federal lands will prevail with an argument that the find constitutes a treasure trove of coinage, but rather [...] "embedded property" [...] that belongs to the property owner, i.e. the government. [...] The broad use of ARPA to target not only archaeological looting but also to prohibit all treasure hunting on federal or Indian lands has been criticized on the grounds that total prohibition and forfeiture simply encourages concealment or misrepresentation of the age of the found coinage or treasure trove, thus hampering archaeological research, as archaeologists cannot study items that when found will never be reported.|$|E
