5|$|Cannon sounds have {{sometimes}} {{been used in}} classical pieces with a military theme. One {{of the best known}} examples of such a piece is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1812 <b>Overture.</b> The <b>overture</b> is to be performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels high enough that musicians are required to wear ear protection. The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the Battle of Borodino, a critical battle in Napoleon's invasion of Russia, whose defeat the piece celebrates. When the <b>overture</b> was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor. However, the <b>overture</b> was not recorded with real cannon fire until Mercury Records and conductor Antal Doráti's 1958 recording of the Minnesota Orchestra. Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the 1812 on the American Independence Day, a tradition started by Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{wrote the}} concert Hebrides <b>Overture</b> (Fingal's Cave) in 1830, {{inspired}} by visits to Scotland {{around the end}} of the 1820s. He visited Fingal's Cave, on the Hebridean isle of Staffa, as part of his Grand Tour of Europe, and was so impressed that he scribbled the opening theme of the <b>overture</b> on the spot, including it in a letter he wrote home the same evening.|$|E
5|$|As with Nero, it is {{possible}} that music from Florindo or Daphne was recycled by Handel for use in later works. The <b>overture</b> to the opera Rodrigo consists of eight French-style dances, which Cudworth believes might have begun life as ballet music in one or other of the lost Hamburg operas. In 1709–10 Handel composed the cantata Apollo e Dafne, which has common ground with the earlier operas. Harris makes the point that when writing the cantata, Handel would have recalled his earlier setting, and perhaps borrowed from it. Dean and Knapp provide further example of works in which the Florinda and Daphne music may have re-emerged: the oratorio Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno (1707); the opera Radamisto (1720); and the <b>overture</b> in B flat, HWV336, which Baselt conjectures might have been written as the <b>overture</b> to Florindo. This last-named has been combined with HWV352–354 and HWV356 to form the Suite from the operas Florindo and Daphne, which in 2012 was adapted and recorded by The Parley of Instruments under Peter Holman.|$|E

50|$|INR looked pessimistically at Khánh, {{who claimed}} that Minh had been making <b>overtures</b> to Hanoi for a neutralist settlement. It was the {{contemporary}} assessment of INR that Minh had been making no such <b>overtures,</b> although this is contradicted by Secretary McNamara's 1999 book.|$|R
5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work which showed the full {{power of his}} genius. This Octet and his <b>Overture</b> to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1842, he also wrote {{incidental}} music for the play, including the famous Wedding March.) The <b>Overture</b> is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn wrote symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano {{music and}} chamber music. His best-known works include his <b>Overture</b> and {{incidental}} music for A Midsummer Night's Dream, the Italian Symphony, the Scottish Symphony, the <b>overture</b> The Hebrides, his mature Violin Concerto, and his String Octet. His Songs Without Words are {{his most famous}} solo piano compositions. After {{a long period of}} relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and antisemitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his creative originality has now been recognised and re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era.|$|E
5|$|Most of the overtures are {{in three}} sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a {{concluding}} allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself {{did not always}} follow this pattern. The <b>overture</b> to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The <b>overture</b> to Utopia Limited is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six {{movements and}} scored it for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboes, strings and continuo.

5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still {{found time to}} write his Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13).

Another symphony, K.96/111b, in C major, is sometimes allocated to this visit to Milan, {{but it is not}} certain when (or indeed whether) Wolfgang actually wrote it.|$|E

5|$|During its TGS 2014 presentation, the {{real-time}} demonstration footage {{was dubbed}} Final Fantasy XV: The <b>Overture,</b> which demonstrated the graphic capabilities in Luminous Studio {{and the effect}} of environmental changes on gameplay. While it was intended as a one-off presentation, the team said they were considering creating a second demo for release in Japan based on The <b>Overture.</b> A demo featuring the battle against the Astral Titan was featured at E3 2016: while drawing on a part of the game, the fight was tailored for the demo so it could be completed within a ten-minute window, with the full version having different victory requirements. A Japan-exclusive commercial demo dubbed Judgement Disc was released on November 11. Spanning the game's events up {{to the middle of the}} first chapter, it was designed to allow players to judge the game's merits.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{run at the}} Queen's Theatre the {{publisher}} John Walsh printed Songs in the Opera of Rinaldo, in mainly short score form. Apart from the <b>overture,</b> instrumental numbers were omitted, as were the recitatives. In June 1711 Walsh published a fuller version, which included instrumental parts; he continued to publish versions of individual numbers, {{with a variety of}} orchestrations, until the 1730s. In 1717 William Babell issued an arrangement for harpsichord of the <b>overture</b> and seven of the arias. Friedrich Chrysander published editions of the whole opera in 1874 and in 1894, based on a study of the existing published and manuscript material. In 1993 David Kimbell, for the Hallische Händel-Ausgabe (HHA), produced a full score of the 1711 version, together with rejected draft material and the additional numbers introduced in revivals up to 1717. HHA has also produced a complete score of the 1731 version.|$|E

His other {{compositions}} inspired by Goethe include the <b>overture</b> Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage, (Op. 27, 1828) and the cantata Die erste Walpurgisnacht (The First Walpurgis Night, Op. 60, 1832).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years Mendelssohn {{travelled}} widely, including making his first visit to England in 1829, and also visiting amongst other places Vienna, Florence, Milan, Rome and Naples, in all of which he met with local and visiting musicians and artists. These years proved the germination for some of his most famous works, including the Hebrides <b>Overture</b> and the Scottish and Italian symphonies.|$|E
