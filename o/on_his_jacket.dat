25|$|His costume was {{unveiled}} on July 27, 2005. He generally wears either a dark brown (with blue pinstripes) or a blue (with rust red pinstripes) four-buttoned suit, {{a shirt and}} a tie, a light brown faux-suede overcoat (which he claims was {{given to him by}} Janis Joplin), and different coloured pairs of Converse All-Star sneakers, depending on his suit. According to an interview on Parkinson, David Tennant and Russell T Davies got the idea for the Tenth Doctor's costume from an outfit Jamie Oliver had worn on Parkinson just after Tennant had taken the role. David Tennant has commented that he would vary the combination of the buttons he fastened <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> in different episodes. Tennant thought the look was very geek chic.|$|E
500|$|During a pre-credits sequence, Walter (Bryan Cranston) {{purchases}} a Ruger LCR [...]38 snubnosed revolver from a {{black market}} gun dealer (Jim Beaver). Secretly, Walter {{plans to use the}} concealable gun to kill his employer, drug kingpin Gus (Giancarlo Esposito). Since falling out of favor with Gus, Walter believes Gus will kill him if he does not act first; when the gun dealer asks why Walter needs the gun, he insists it is strictly for self-defense. Later, Walter practices drawing the weapon. Elsewhere, Gus' henchman Mike (Jonathan Banks) drinks coffee at a bar and discovers dried blood <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> sleeve belonging to Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui), a former colleague whom Gus previously murdered. Although Mike is silent, he appears to harbor conflicted feelings about what happened to Victor. Meanwhile, Jesse (Aaron Paul) has purchased expensive gadgets, like a sophisticated sound system and the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner, but remains miserable after having murdered Gale (David Costabile) to save Walter and himself. After his friends Badger (Matt L. Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker) visit, Jesse has them arrange a wild party with dozens of people dancing, drinking and doing drugs to further distract himself.|$|E
500|$|Players {{may choose}} to act in either a good or evil way. Examples {{including}} healing civilians, doing drug busts, and stopping suspect brutality for good, or killing innocent civilians and killing instead of apprehending enemies. [...] Several times throughout the story, Delsin finds himself in a scenario where he must make a good or evil choice, such as whether to encourage Conduit vigilante Abigail [...] "Fetch" [...] Walker to stop slaying drug dealers, or to train her to become a more prolific killer. Player choices influence outcomes in some later missions. In combat, Delsin may use his abilities to incapacitate foes or obliterate them with headshots. He {{may choose to}} open fire on innocent civilians. Delsin's choices manifest in a logo displayed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and the HUD, which features a blue (good) and red (evil) bird. Performing actions that are villainous gradually change the logo so that the red bird dominates the other, with the opposite happening with heroism. This is a visual representation of Delsin's Karma level, that increases as good or evil depending on his choices. As his Karma level increases, Delsin can acquire new powers that correspond to his play-style (e.g. very destructive powers {{with high levels of}} evil Karma) and his jacket also changes. If you have good karma, the jacket completely changes white whereas if evil the jacket turns red. A continual streak of either good or evil actions fills up a bar in the HUD, which then lets Delsin perform a powerful finishing move called a Karma Bomb.|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately, his {{national}} service stint had effectively ended his pop career, and Normie {{was never able}} to recover the momentum and mass popularity he lost because of being enlisted. In his absence, Ronnie Burns and Johnny Farnham had taken over and Farnham was now the new [...] The strong anti-war sentiment of the period affected him, and like many Vietnam vets, Normie suffered considerably because of his service, and regrettably, many people took out their anger about the war on veterans. Normie himself has said that he was treated like a pariah by the very people who had been buying his records and screaming at his concerts only a couple of years before. One of the people Normie remembers fondly from this period, who stuck by him and gave him encouragement in tough times, was Meteors drummer Stewie Speer.

2500|$|Austin confessed {{he had a}} major rift with Triple H's role in {{the company}} upon his return in 2002, but insisted as of 2003 they {{resolved}} their issues. In addition, he claimed a brief dispute with The Rock was resolved quickly upon his return, and that none of his disputes with the talent roster continued or played the major part in his departure. In February, Austin returned at No Way Out by defeating Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania in another short match against Bischoff on Raw, but was then defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania XIX, who returned {{about the same time}} as a smug, [...] "sell out" [...] villain, which, ultimately, became Austin's last official match in WWE. It was also revealed in the documentary The Mania of Wrestlemania (based around the WrestleMania XIX event) that the letters [...] "OMR", meaning [...] "One More Round", were put <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> for his match against The Rock. The night after on Raw, Bischoff [...] "fired" [...] Austin on medical grounds. The next morning, Austin gave an interview on WWE.com announcing his retirement from wrestling, although he stated that he and Vince McMahon had reached an agreement seeing him only appear in non-wrestling roles on a weekly basis. In reference to Bischoff firing him on Raw that week, he said that although firing was for storyline purposes, he admitted the medical problems read out on Raw were real and mainly related back to his injury sustained at SummerSlam in a match with Owen Hart in August 1997, and had begun to seriously plague him since late 2001. He confessed wrestling against the advice of his doctors up to his departure in 2002, which forced him to quit wrestling, and cited this as the sole reason as to why he suddenly departed, with doctors advising an awkward or violent move performed on him could have resulted in Austin being permanently disabled or resulting in death.|$|E
