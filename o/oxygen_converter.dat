40|$|Rail steel {{production}} in <b>oxygen</b> <b>converters</b> {{is of particular}} interest nowadays. High requirements are imposed upon rail steel quality. The current work deals {{with one of the most}} important factors influencing the formation of manganese sulfide in converter rail steel. The thermodynamic calculations of rail steel crystallization at the cooling rate of 100 K/min. are given in the work. Computer simulation results are presented as graphs showing the separation of components, as well as curves showing the process of nonmetallic inclusions formation. It has been determined that chemical composition is the most important factor in the formation of non-metallic inclusions. Materials used for the rail {{steel production}} must meet the highest requirements as to the properties of materials, shape and durability. Non-metallic inclusions are one of the factors negatively influencing the strength of rail steel. The manganese sulfide precipitates during steel solidification as a result of segregation processes on the solidification front. One of the factors influencing the strength parameters of rail steel is sulphur, i. e. the main component of MnS. Sulphur is commonly considered to be a negative element in steel, except for the situation when it is purposefully added to improve its machinability. Computer simulation and theoretical analysis methods were used in this work. Computer simulation with the use of non-commercial software was used for the calculation of manganese and sulfur segregation in liquid steel during solidificatio...|$|R

Piccard developed a frost-free window, that was used on this flight and later by the Navy and Air Force in the B-24 Liberator or B-26 Marauder. He used blasting caps and TNT for releasing the balloon at launch and for remote release of external ballast from inside the sealed cabin. This was the first use of pyrotechnics for remote-controlled actuating devices in aircraft, an unpopular, revolutionary idea at the time. Later his student Robert R.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the problem of the reduced {{efficiency}} of management in complex production - transport systems {{due to the lack of}} co-ordination in the operation of industrial enterprises and transport carrying out their maintenance. The existing transport service schedules for auxiliary departments do not take into account possible changes in operating conditions, the probability of malfunctions and the amount of reserves, which leads to an increase in general production costs. To solve this problem, we propose to use the interval regulation of production and transport processes in all departments of the complex production and transport systems. Also, such regulation involves the determination of traffic service priority. This will allow passing on from the regulated control of production and transport processes to the situational one, adapted to specific conditions, and reducing losses from untimely transport servicing, which will lead to a stores reduction and efficiency increase of the enterprise circulating facilities use. Testing the effectiveness of interval regulation was performed on the system and dynamics simulation model of liquid iron transportation in the <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> shop of the metallurgical enterprise. It was established that the use of interval regulation processes in iron production and its transportation will allow decreasing non-productive downtime by 21 % and the amount of the liquid iron in anticipation of recasting in the <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> shop – by 33 %. Economical effect of reducing the liquid iron downtime during transportation to the <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> shop will be about 30 million rubles per year...|$|E

40|$|Stainless steel alloys {{are widely}} used in many {{important}} applications but their production presents difficulties because they contain expensive chromium, which can be extensively oxidised during decarburisation to the very low carbon levels required. Modern stainless steelmaking largely avoids this problem by having two distinct stages and is therefore described as duplex practice. Molten high carbon stainless steel is produced in an electric arc furnace and then the melt is decarburised in an argon¿oxygen converter or a vacuum <b>oxygen</b> decarburising <b>converter.</b> In this work, computational thermodynamics {{has been used to}} examine the major reactions occurring in the electric arc furnace and to show the effect of various process variables on chromium recovery. It was shown that significant oxidation of the scrap must occur during melting, and that subsequent carbon/oxygen injection initially oxidises some chromium, but then mostly oxidises the added carbon. Chromium was predicted to exist in the slag as CrO and CrO 1 ? 5 in almost equal proportions. Increasing the temperature should improve chromium recovery but results in less benefit than expected due to the decreasing activity coefficients of CrO and CrO 1 ? 5 and the increasing oxygen partial pressure. Ferrosilicon additions reduce chromium oxides from the slag, but much of the silicon simply dissolves into the steel. Computational thermodynamics is seen to be a very effective educational tool for gaining an understanding of smelting processes...|$|R
