5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury to repair the lesion, <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> usually good; the long-term <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> good for over 90% of people who have TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook is good, with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E
5|$|In {{children}} with CVST {{the risk of}} death is high. Poor <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> more likely if a child with CVST develops seizures or has evidence of venous infarction on imaging.|$|E
5|$|Once {{kidney failure}} has {{developed}} in dogs and cats, the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> poor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Outcome</b> {{reporting}} bias <b>is</b> related to publication bias and selection bias, in which multiple <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> measured {{but only the}} significant <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> reported, while insignificant or unfavorable <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> ignored.|$|R
30|$|Functional <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> {{assessed}} {{in terms of}} mortality and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for neurologic disability [10]. Good <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> defined as mRS from 0 to 3, while poor <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> defined as mRS from 4 to 6. Radiological <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> assessed by comparing the midline shift in the preoperative CT and 24 to 96  h postoperatively.|$|R

5|$|Although some {{scholars}} mention {{a possibility of}} future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> that English will continue {{to function as a}} koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world. English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world. Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.|$|E
5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> {{seen as a}} victory, if a {{very costly}} one, for the Polish and Soviet troops. As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet {{frontline}} was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Outcome</b> <b>is</b> {{related to}} the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on {{the central nervous system}} are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
5000|$|Contingent <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely}} to {{reinforce}} behavior than non-contingent responses. Contingent <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> those directly linked to a causal behavior, such a light turning on being contingent on flipping a switch. Note that contingent <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> not necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} W-Beijing {{genotype}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis on treatment <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> evaluated in 249 newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients. No {{significant difference in}} the treatment <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> found between the W-Beijing and non-W-Beijing groups. However, a poor <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> more common in the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) infected with the W-Beijing strain...|$|R
5|$|The exact <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> unknown, {{since it}} has two {{versions}} which differ depending on the source. In the first version Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, {{and in the second}} version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. Suleiman, having been delayed nearly four weeks, withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and did not continue towards Vienna as he had intended, but turned homeward.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{treatment}} {{option for}} endometrial cancer is abdominal hysterectomy (the total removal by surgery of the uterus), together with {{removal of the}} fallopian tubes and ovaries on both sides, called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In more advanced cases, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy may also be recommended. If the disease is diagnosed at an early stage, the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> favorable, and the overall five-year survival rate in the United States is greater than 80%.|$|E
5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia {{can be called}} by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by the constitution {{to call for a}} referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E
5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder of a popular local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> never in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E
30|$|The primary <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> the A-aDO 2 72 {{hours after}} CPB. Our {{secondary}} clinical <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> 24 -, 48 -, and 72 -hour fluid balance, weight, vasoactive inotrope score (Gaies et al. 2010), and urinary output, duration of mechanical ventilation and PICU {{length of stay}} (LOS). Secondary biochemical <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> plasma interleukin 6 and 8 (IL- 6 and IL- 8), and reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) ratio.|$|R
30|$|Our primary <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> {{cardiovascular}} mortality. Secondary <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> total mortality, myocardial infarction, CABG and PCI procedures. All <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> {{assessed for}} the time period beginning with randomisation {{until the end of}} last reported follow-up, thereby including events which occurred before, during and after the exercise intervention period for all trials. We chose not to use a combined endpoint for analysis, as although it may have increased the statistical power required to detect treatment effects, it can also be problematic in interpretation and generate misleading conclusions, particularly about the strength of reductions in mortality [20, 21]. For this reason, the results of each <b>outcome</b> <b>are</b> presented separately.|$|R
40|$|Factors {{predictive}} of <b>outcome</b> <b>were</b> sought {{from the data}} from a controlled study of the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Four different indices of <b>outcome</b> <b>were</b> used, and <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> assessed at four points during a 12 -month, treatment-free follow-up period. It {{was found that the}} pre-treatment level of self-esteem was a consistent predictor of outcome with those patients having low self-esteem responding least well to treatment. There were no other consistent predictors of outcome...|$|R
5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> the number of seizures {{that occur in the}} first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E
5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
30|$|In 23 {{emergency}} physicians, {{a prospective}} randomized crossover {{study was conducted}} to examine the three intubation techniques using two kinds of endotracheal tube. Primary <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> the intubation time. Secondary <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> the cumulative success rate for intubation.|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} an event that is both collectively {{exhaustive}} and mutually exclusive is tossing a coin. The <b>outcome</b> must <b>be</b> either heads or tails, or p (heads or tails) = 1, so the <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> collectively exhaustive. When heads occurs, tails can't occur, or p (heads and tails) = 0, so the <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> also mutually exclusive.|$|R
30|$|The primary <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> {{the change}} in the {{position}} of point Pogonion to the Nasion perpendicular (Pg to Nperp). Secondary <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> considered: (1) occlusal improvement of class II molar relationship and (2) treatment effects on a vertical dimension.|$|R
5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> unknown. No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications {{used to treat}} MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy can help with people's ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, {{despite a lack of}} evidence. The long-term <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.|$|E
