5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding {{what could be a}} sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as glaucoma. Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E

25|$|Suzuki {{was invited}} by Soyen Shaku {{to visit the}} United States in the 1890s, and Suzuki acted as English-language {{translator}} for a book written by him (1906).

25|$|In October 1843, Heine's distant {{relative}} and German revolutionary, Karl Marx, and {{his wife}} Jenny von Westphalen arrived in Paris after the Prussian government had suppressed Marx's radical newspaper. The Marx family settled in Rue Vaneau. Marx was an admirer of Heine and his early writings show Heine's influence. In December Heine met the Marxes and got on well with them. He published several poems, including Die schlesischen Weber, in Marx's new journal Vorwärts ("Forwards"). Ultimately Heine's ideas of revolution through sensual emancipation and Marx's scientific socialism were incompatible, but both writers shared the same negativity and lack <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bourgeoisie.|$|E

25|$|Parents {{commonly}} cite {{two main}} motivations for homeschooling their children: {{dissatisfaction with the}} local schools and the interest in increased involvement with their children's learning and development. Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, and lack <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school's ability to cater to their children's special needs. Some parents homeschool {{in order to have}} greater control over what and how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific religious or moral position, and {{to take advantage of the}} efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning. Many parents are also influenced by alternative educational philosophies advocated by the likes of Susan Sutherland Isaacs, Charlotte Mason, John Holt, and Kenneth Robinson.|$|E
25|$|The first Huguenots {{to leave}} France sought freedom from {{persecution}} in Switzerland and the Netherlands. A group of Huguenots {{was part of}} the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found France Antarctique. A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day Rio de Janeiro, and settled in a small island. A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence. This document, the Guanabara Confession of Faith, became the first Protestant confession <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole of the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1942 {{and into}} early 1943, a complex series of {{overlapping}} crises placed enormous, widespread stress on Bengal's economy, particularly on its more vulnerable segments. Distressing {{military and political}} events and subsequent government and market responses created escalating price shocks that overlapped with supply shocks caused by natural disasters and plant disease later in the year. As Bengal's food needs rose from increased military presence and an influx of refugees from Burma, its ability to obtain rice and other foodgrains from outside the province was restricted by interprovincial trade barriers. The outlook of the typical Bengali, particularly in the countryside, deteriorated into a general belief in the inevitability of famine and devastating inflation, a lack <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government's ability to overcome the crises, and a mood of isolation and panic. In nearly every sector of the population, the overriding concerns were the lack of food and personal safety, though a small number secured record profits amidst the havoc.|$|E

25|$|Qutb's written {{works are}} still widely {{available}} {{and have been}} translated into many Western languages. His best known work is Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones), {{but the majority of}} Qutb's theory can be found in his Qur'anic commentary Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In the Shade of the Quran). This 30-volume work is noteworthy for its innovative method of interpretation, borrowing heavily from the literary analysis of Amin al-Khuli, while retaining some structural features of classical commentaries (for example, the practice of progressing from the first sura to the last). For Qutb, the Qur'an was seen as the final arbiter in all matters relating to faith, while his main goal in writing the book, In the Shade of the Qur’an, was to restore the centrality <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> consciousness and imagination of Muslims, and to kindle a cognitive revolution that would bring about a political and social process that will lead to the renewal of the Islamic tradition.|$|E
25|$|D.T. Suzuki, another Japanese {{associate}} of Shaku's, {{had a great}} literary impact. At the World Parliament of Religions in 1893, Paul Carus befriended Shaku and requested his help in translating and publishing Oriental spiritual literature in the West. Shaku instead recommended Suzuki, then a young scholar and his former disciple. Starting in 1897, Suzuki worked from Carus' home in Illinois; his first projects were translations of the Tao Te Ching and Asvaghosa's Awakening <b>of</b> <b>Faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mahayana. At the same time, Suzuki began writing Outlines of Mahayana Buddhism, {{which was published in}} 1907. Suzuki returned to Japan in 1909 and married Beatrice Erskine Lane, an American Theosophist and Radcliffe graduate, in 1911. Through English language essays and books, such as Essays in Zen Buddhism (1927), he became a visible expositor of Zen Buddhism and its unofficial ambassador to Western readers until his death in 1966. His 1949 book, An Introduction to Zen Buddhism, featured a thirty-page introduction by Carl Jung, an emblem of the deepening relationship between Buddhism and major Western thinkers.|$|E
25|$|When paper bank {{notes were}} first {{introduced}} in England in the 1790s, they {{resulted in a}} dramatic rise in counterfeiting. The attempts by the Bank of England and the Royal Mint to stamp out currency crime led to new policing strategies, including {{the increased use of}} entrapment. The ease with which paper money can be created, by both legitimate authorities and counterfeiters, has led both to a temptation in times of crisis such as war or revolution to produce paper money which was not supported by precious metal or other goods, thus leading to Hyperinflation and a loss <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of paper money, e.g. the Continental Currency produced by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution, the Assignats produced during the French Revolution, the paper currency produced by the Confederate States of America and the individual states of the Confederate States of America, the financing of World War I by the Central Powers (by 1922 1 gold Austro-Hungarian krone of 1914 was worth 14,400 paper Kronen), the devaluation of the Yugoslav Dinar in the 1990s, etc. Banknotes may also be overprinted to reflect political changes that occur faster than new currency can be printed.|$|E
