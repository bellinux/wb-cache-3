Kenya. The methodology was descriptive research; a case study of Orongo Widows and <b>Orphans</b> <b>Project</b> International. Kenya. Volunteers were mainly middle aged widows or married women living below the poverty line and doubling up as the main breadwinners for their families. Their biggest challenges were work demands and high expectations while group income generation was found to be highly popular. Volunteers felt that IGAs would both improve teamwork amongst them and enhance their performance. They felt that Group IGAs should be initiated for them either by government agencies or the not-for-profit sector. It is the recommendation of this study that further research is needed to determine the most appropriate ways of establishing these group income generating activities...|$|R

5000|$|According to Raymond, Tann made {{adoption}} socially acceptable. Previously, {{when the}} first U.S. state adoption law was passed in 1851, adoption was [...] "not immediately popular". Early in the 20th century, adoption was [...] "rare". Low-income birth parents from whom children were taken were generally considered genetically inferior, and the children, considered adoptable, were considered therefore genetically tainted. Before Tann's work, indenture was applied to some children with the duties to educate the children and {{to provide them with}} land scarcely enforced, and the <b>Orphan</b> Train <b>Project</b> gathered children and transported them for resettlement under farmers needing labor, using a procedure akin to a slave auction. Some children's custody was changed [...] "through secretive means" [...] between sets of parents, some willing and some unaware. Baby farms, where many children were murdered, sold children for up to $100 each. Tann, apparently disagreeing with the prevailing view, argued (against her own belief) that children were [...] "blank slates", thus free of the sin and genetic defects attributable to their parents, thus making adoption appealing, thus providing a way for children who might otherwise have been dead to survive and receive care, her waiting lists including much of the U.S., Canada, and South America. One person adopted through the Tennessee Children's Home Society was wrestler Ric Flair.|$|R

40|$|The Epidemic Projection Package (EPP) {{recently}} {{developed by the}} UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Models and Projections and the Spectrum model program developed by the Futures Group were used to model the South African HIV epidemic, project future trends in HIV/AIDS and estimate the demographic impact of AIDS. The national HIV prevalence surveys among pregnant women from 1990 – 2001 and the first national, population-based HIV survey in 2002 served as the data sets used to calibrate the input HIV prevalence values for the model. The scenario created by the model showed that a dramatic rise in HIV prevalence during the 1990 s has peaked in 2002 with 4. 69 million infected people and it is projected that the epidemic in South Africa has now begun to level off. Adult (15 – 49 years) inci-dence rates have decreased substantially {{in the past five}} years since 1997 (4. 2 %) and are expected to reach a level of 1. 7 % in 2003. The annual number of deaths due to AIDS is projected to peak with 487 320 AIDS deaths in the year 2008. By 2020, the total popu-lation of South Africa is expected to be 23 % smaller than it would be without AIDS, however, a negative population growth rate is not expected during the projection period. Life expectancy at birth is expected to hit a low of 45. 6 years in the time period 2005 – 2010, which is 22 years less than it would have been in the absence of AIDS. Ten years from now over 2. 5 million AIDS <b>orphans</b> are <b>projected</b> for South Africa. Models play an important role in estimating HIV variables that are difficult to measure.

40|$|What {{is known}} and Objective: Variations in market uptake of an orphan drug have {{important}} implications with respect to access to care and inequality of treatment. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to quantify both the sales and volume uptake of orphan drugs in Europe and to assess whether a countrys gross domestic product (GDP) and/or health technology assessment (HTA) influences the orphan drugs market uptake. Methods: We analysed the numbers of orphan drugs launched and the sales and volume uptake for 17 orphan drugs in 23 European countries from 2001 until the beginning of 2010 using the IMS Health database. Countries were clustered based on GDP and the availability of a formal HTA-organization. Results and Discussion: The uptake of orphan drugs varied across European countries. The highest volumes and contributions of orphan drugs in the first year occurred in countries with a high GDP (and implicitly, a higher budget for healthcare), independently of the existence of an HTA-organization. In contrast, in countries with a low GDP, orphan drugs were less available when there was a formal HTA-organization. There, budgetary restrictions can cause the exclusion of less cost-effective orphan drugs. What is new and Conclusion: We observed substantial variation in the market uptake of orphan drugs. Such variation may {{have important implications}} with respect to access to care and inequality of treatment. The uptake of orphan drugs could be promoted through the clinical added value of <b>orphan</b> drugs (CAVOD) <b>project</b> and various conditional pricing and reimbursement mechanisms...|$|R

In this survey, inadequacy of financial resources and essential facilities stood out as critical challenges for the centre and the entire organization. In response to those challenges, I M A G E project was designed with different initiatives endeavored to develop the necessary capacity for the centre to play its service delivery role smoothly. These initiatives were planned in form of social enterprises and resource mobilization initiatives integrated in a diversified way to tap every possible source of income and resources from within and outside of the organization. The social enterprises were designed {{in a way that they}} did not infringe the purpose of the organization. They operated on cost recovery basis and the organization recognized earnings from the cost savings and surplus generated. The project was implemented and had brought significant contribution toward the development of the centre and service delivery to the needy children.

40|$|We use recent SEGUE {{spectroscopy}} and SDSS and SEGUE imaging data {{to measure}} the sky position, distance, and radial velocities of stars in the tidal debris stream that is {{commonly referred to as}} the "Orphan Stream. " We fit orbital parameters to the data, and find a prograde orbit with an apogalacticon, perigalacticon, and eccentricity of 90 kpc, 16. 4 kpc and 0. 7, respectively. Neither the dwarf galaxy UMa II nor the Complex A gas cloud have velocities consistent with a kinematic association with the Orphan Stream. It is possible that Segue- 1 is associated with the Orphan Stream, but no other known Galactic clusters or dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way lie along its orbit. The detected portion of the stream ranges from 19 to 47 kpc from the Sun and is an indicator of the mass interior to these distances. There is a marked increase in the density of Orphan Stream stars near (l,b) =(253, 49) deg., which could indicate the presence of the progenitor {{at the edge of the}} SDSS data. If this is the progenitor, then the detected portion of the Orphan Stream is a leading tidal tail. We find blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars and F turnoff stars associated with the Orphan Stream. The turnoff color is (g-r) _ 0 = 0. 22. The BHB stars have a low metallicity of [Fe/H]=- 2. 1. The orbit is best fit to a halo potential with a halo plus disk mass of about 2. 6 x 10 ^ 11 Solar masses, integrated to 60 kpc from the Galactic center. Our best fit is found with a logarithmic halo speed of v_halo= 73 +/- 24 km/s, a disk+bulge mass of M(R< 60 kpc) = 1. 3 x 10 ^ 11 Solar masses, and a halo mass of M(R< 60 kpc) = 1. 4 x 10 ^ 11 Solar masses.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Recreation Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. HIV/AIDS is {{a growing}} {{pandemic}} -not only in South Africa, but also globally. Worldwide there are currently more than 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2006 : 8). The increasing number of HIV-infections also leads {{to an increase in}} the number of deaths related to HIV/AIDS. A result of the mortality rate is the increasing number of children who are <b>orphaned.</b> It is <b>projected</b> by Dorrington et al. (2006 : 25) that, in South Africa, nearly 2. 2 million children will be orphaned as a result of AIDS by 2015. The death of a parent, especially due to AIDS, is a very traumatic and stressful event. Exposure to such an event is a main factor leading to risk behaviour (Anon, 2002 : 2). AIDS is endangering the future of youth in South Africa. Recreation programmes can playa changing role in managing the effects the AIDS pandemic has on AIDS orphans (Brown & Lourie, 2000 : 86). Recreation programmes can help improve the health of these youths and assist in solving the emotional, social and psychological problems they face. Numerous research findings supported this notion that recreation participation can be beneficial on a personal, social, environmental and economic level (Tesnear, 2004 : 78; Bloemhoff, 2006 : 1 - 11; Meyer, 2007 : 97; Louw, 2008 : 138). The purpose of this study was firstly, to determine the necessity for recreation programmes for AIDS orphans based on the perspectives of the staff working with these youths and those of the youths themselves. Secondly, to determine the benefits associated with recreation participation for AIDS orphans according to the perspectives of the staff working with these youths and the youths themselves. A qualitative research design was used for the collection of the data in this study. Thanda After-School Programme was use as a case study. The participants were recruited purposively to form a non-probability sample. The sample size (n= 17) was determined through data saturation. The sample was divided into two groups, staff at Thanda ASP (n= 9) and students at Thanda ASP (n= 8). Data gathering was done by means of a semi-structure interview with each of the participants as well as analysis of personal documents written by the participants. Data analysis was done by means of the following steps: planning for recording data; data collection and preliminary analysis; organising the data; reading and writing memos; generating categories, themes and patterns; coding the data; testing; and representing. Through the process of data analysis two main categories were identified, namely the necessity for recreation programmes for AIDS orphans and the benefits of recreation programmes for AIDS orphans. The necessity was accentuated by both the staff and the students of Thanda ASP. Both highlighted this through their responses to the question as to why they are involved in Thanda ASP as well as the reason for the students' risk behaviour before their involvement in the programme. Health, emotional, social and psychological improvement were the key themes that emerged with regard to the benefits to ADIS orphans as a result of recreation participation. These benefits were stated by the majority of staff members as well as students at Thanda ASP and it was also echoed in the journals written by the students. The participants, staff and students alike, strongly emphasised the improvement of the youths' future perspectives and improvement of life skills. The results from this study compare positively with what is stated in the literature and with previous research. Based on these results, recreation programmes for AIDS orphans can be regarded as beneficial to and thus essential for the improvement of quality of life. Master...|$|R
