5|$|As Chapter 66 of his On the Reckoning of Time, in 725 Bede {{wrote the}} Greater Chronicle (chronica maiora), which {{sometimes}} circulated {{as a separate}} work. For recent events the Chronicle, like his Ecclesiastical History, relied upon Gildas, upon {{a version of the}} Liber pontificalis current at least to the papacy of Pope Sergius I (687–701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on Eusebius's Chronikoi Kanones. The dating <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chronicle is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the anno mundi.|$|E
5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Eadbald died in 640, and {{according}} to most versions of the Kentish Royal Legend was succeeded solely by his son Eorcenberht. However, an early text (Caligula A.xiv) refers to Eormenred as 'king', suggesting either he was a junior king under Eorcenberht, or had a shared kingship. One suggestion is that the some other version <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 'legend', which give him no title, {{may have been an}} attempt to discredit royal claimants from Eormenred's line.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPedestrian {{accident}} can {{be derived}} {{as a process of}} a combination from several elementary events. However, the understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pedestrian accident process is still less clear. It acquires <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pedestrian crossing scenario at signalised intersections as an operational event that may lead to pedestrian accident. Thus, this paper gives an insight view of translating the sequence <b>of</b> <b>event</b> to model pedestrian crossing scenarios using Petri Nets approach. Qualitative data from site observation was extracted to draw the flow <b>of</b> <b>events</b> for the pedestrian crossing scenario. The developed model gives an understanding of the risky situation when pedestrian and vehicle are interacted at signalised intersections. Further analysis of this model is expected to give a potential risk value of pedestrian crossing...|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the completion of Astronomia Nova, most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (though neither would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the dating <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> life of Jesus, and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe {{such as those of}} Helisaeus Roeslin.|$|E

5|$|Æthelstan {{followed}} up his {{advances in the}} north by securing {{the recognition of the}} Welsh kings.

This absence of record means that Æthelstan's reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, a {{few people}} have {{questioned}} this version <b>of</b> <b>events.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only {{that there had been}} a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing. Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.|$|E

Changes in the adaptation include the sequence <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prologue (in the books it is Gared and not Will who survives and is beheaded by Eddard afterwards, and Arya's material is set before the arrival of the royal family), new scenes showing the Lannister twins' perspective, and Daenerys's wedding night showing Drogo not waiting for her to consent to sex.|$|E

5|$|Sea {{fishing is}} an {{important}} industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly from a series <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{second half of the}} twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access to rich North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common Fisheries Policy put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{participants}} in a LARP physically portray characters in a fictional setting, improvising their characters' speech and movements somewhat like actors in improvisational theatre. This is distinct from tabletop role-playing games, where character actions are described verbally. LARPs may be played in a public or private area and may last for hours or days. There is usually no audience. Players may dress as their character and carry appropriate equipment, and the environment is sometimes decorated to resemble the setting. LARPs can be one-off events or a series <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same setting, and events can vary in size {{from a handful of}} players to several thousand.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{movement}} of the 20th Division to Madang was revised in the light <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bismarck Sea. The operation was postponed for two days, and the destination was altered from Madang to Hansa Bay further west. To reduce the Allied air threat, the Allied airfield at Wau was bombed on 9 March, and that at Dobodura on 11 March. Three Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 {{was lost in the}} air, but the Allied fighters claimed to have shot down nine Japanese planes. The transports reached Hansa Bay unscathed on 12 March, and the troops made their way down to Madang on foot or in barges. The 20th Division then became involved in an attempt to construct a road from Madang to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys. It toiled on the road for the next few months, but its efforts were ultimately frustrated by New Guinea's weather and the rugged terrain of the Finisterre Range.|$|E

5|$|Pool of Radiance {{is based}} on the same game {{mechanics}} as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set. As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each player character in Pool of Radiance has a character race and a character class, determined {{at the beginning of the}} game. Six races are offered, including elves and halflings, as well as four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief). Non-human characters have the option to become multi-classed, which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class, but advance in levels more slowly. During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes. The player also chooses each character's alignment, or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character's actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions. The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character's combat icon. Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated party to be used for introductory play. These characters are combined into a party of six or less, with two slots open for NPCs. Players create their own save-game files, assuring character continuation regardless <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. On an MS-DOS computer, the game can be copied to the hard-disk drive. Other computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, require a separate save-game disk.|$|E

This activity can further be correlated with Alpine tectonic <b>events</b> <b>in</b> central Iberia recorded in Permian to Cainozoic sedimentary basins.
