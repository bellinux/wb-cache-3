5|$|Furry {{conventions}} sometimes {{start out}} as furmeets, where groups of local fans meet at a regular location, often on a scheduled basis. As the local community grows, these groups may put on events which attract dealer attention <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> fan activity and which become recognized as fully-fledged conventions. Other conventions spring up {{in the wake of}} discontinued events; for example, Califur was founded in 2004 following the final ConFurence in 2003, in order to keep a furry convention in the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E
5|$|Inigo moved ashore on Australia as a weak {{tropical}} cyclone, though several locations reported {{winds of}} near gale force. The storm dropped light to moderate precipitation near where it made landfall which peaked at 226mm (8.90inches), of which 128mm (5.04in) of rain fell in 80minutes. No casualties <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> damage {{was reported in}} the country.|$|E

5|$|The Chino Hills {{earthquake}} caused no deaths <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> damage due to {{the physical}} location of its epicenter. Most of the infrastructure in the Chino Hills area is relatively new and well suited to withstand a large quake. Unlike previous earthquakes in the region—such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which caused serious structural damage and fatalities—this quake caused only minor damage. However, the high volume of telephone use following the shock overloaded provider capacity and disrupted service into the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{portion of}} all genetic {{variation}} is functionally neutral, producing no phenotypic effect <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> difference in fitness. Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution by genetic drift proposes that this variation {{accounts for a}} large fraction of observed genetic diversity. Neutral events can radically reduce genetic variation through population bottlenecks. which among other things can cause the founder effect in initially small new populations. When genetic variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the genetic variation at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness. However, after a period with no new mutations, the genetic variation at these sites is eliminated due to genetic drift. Natural selection reduces genetic variation by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation–selection balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on {{the rate at which}} new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.|$|E

5|$|Although not a {{director}} <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> shareholder {{of the new}} company, Pearson continued to promote the project {{over the next few}} years and use his influence to help the company raise the £1 million of capital needed for the construction of the line. He issued a pamphlet, A twenty minutes letter to the citizens of London, in favour of the Metropolitan Railway and City Station, encouraging investment and he even persuaded the City of London to invest on the basis that the railway would alleviate the City's congestion problems. Once the railway was in operation, the City sold its shares at a profit. By 1860, the funds had been collected and the final route decided. Work on the railway started; taking less than three years to excavate through some of the worst slums of Victorian London and under some of the busiest streets.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{gradually}} {{losing its}} tropical characteristics, Gustav brought heavy rain, storm and hurricane-force winds, and storm surges to areas of Atlantic Canada for several days. Strong winds knocked down trees and damaged docks in Nova Scotia, and a wind gust of 75mph (122km/h) was reported on Sable Island. Gusts to over 60mph (100km/h) {{were reported in}} Newfoundland for several days after the center of Gustav {{moved out of the}} area. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 0.3–2.7inches (10–70mm), with a maximum of 4inches (102mm) in Ashdale, Nova Scotia. Several locations set new daily rainfall records. Localized flooding was reported in areas of Prince Edward Island, and 4,000people in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island were left without power. Despite the heavy rain and wind, there were no reports of deaths <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> damage in Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E

5|$|Sailing from Malacca on 20 November, Pellew's {{squadron}} {{passed along}} the Javan coast for 15 days, reaching Panka Point on 5 December and sending a boat under a {{flag of truce}} into Griessie with instructions for the Dutch commander to surrender his ships. Captain Cowell refused, and ordered the boat party to be arrested. He then sent a Dutch officer aboard Culloden to inform Pellew of his actions. In response, Pellew determined to attack the port and ordered that Culloden and Powerful be lightened by the removal of unnecessary stores {{to enable them to}} sail into the shallow straits. On 6 December, the British squadron moved steadily towards Griessie through the Madura Strait, coming under fire from heated cannonballs from a battery of nine cannon situated at Sambelangan on Madura Island. Returning fire with his full squadron, Pellew rapidly silenced the battery without loss <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> damage to his ships and as the squadron approached Griessie, a message from the civilian governor in Sourabaya reached Pellew, reversing Cowell's orders, releasing the captured boat party and unconditionally surrendering the ships in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene {{was a rare}} {{off-season}} {{tropical cyclone}} that hit Cuba and the Bahamas in May1981. Its formation was unusual, originating from a tropical disturbance that crossed from the eastern Pacific Ocean into the Caribbean Sea; few Atlantic hurricanes develop in this manner. On May6, a tropical depression developed, {{and the next day}} it became Tropical Storm Arlene near the Cayman Islands, three weeks {{before the start of the}} hurricane season. This marked the first Atlantic tropical storm in May since 1970's Hurricane Alma. Arlene moved northeastward throughout its life, bringing rainfall and locally gusty winds as it crossed Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas. On May9, the storm dissipated when a large non-tropical storm absorbed Arlene. There were no reports of deaths <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Lester was a weak {{tropical}} storm that paralleled the Mexican coastline in October 2004. The 16th tropical cyclone and 12th named storm of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, Lester originated {{from an area}} of disturbed weather that persisted southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. After organizing, the system was designated as a tropical depression on October 11. The depression was upgraded to a {{tropical storm}} the next day, and moved northwestward, just off the Mexican coastline. Due to the interaction with land among other factors, the storm degenerated on October 13. The storm dropped locally heavy rainfall, which caused minor flooding and mudslides. No fatalities <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> damage were reported.|$|E

5|$|Within the Australian {{region in}} the Southern Hemisphere between 90°E– 160°E, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Indonesian Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 90°E and 141°E, while Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 141°E and 160°E. Outside of these areas, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology names systems that develop into tropical cyclones. If a name is assigned to a tropical cyclone that causes loss of life <b>or</b> <b>significant</b> damage and disruption to {{the way of life}} of a community, then the name assigned to that storm is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.|$|E
5|$|Within the Southern Pacific basin in the Southern Hemisphere between 160°E– 120°W, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis {{indicate that a}} system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue.
