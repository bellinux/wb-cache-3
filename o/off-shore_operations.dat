At that time, Allied naval forces in South Vietnam were at peak strength. The U.S. Navy's Coastal Surveillance Force operated 81 Swift boats, 26 Coast Guard Point-class cutters, and 39 other vessels. The River Patrol Force deployed 258 patrol and minesweeping boats; the 3,700-man Riverine Assault Force counted 184 monitors, transports, and other armored craft. Helicopter Attack Squadron Light (HAL) 3 flew 25 armed helicopters. This air component was soon augmented by the 15 fixed-wing OV-10 Bronco aircraft of Attack Squadron Light (VAL) 4, activated in April 1969. The lethal Bronco flown by the [...] "Black Ponies" [...] of VAL-4 carried 8 to 16 5- inch Zuni rockets, 19 2.75-inch rockets, 4 M-60 machine guns, and a 20-millimeter cannon. In addition, five SEAL platoons supported operations in the delta. In total, Sealords employed 586 American vessels of the Coastal Surveillance Force (Task Force 115), the River Patrol Force (TF116), and the Mobile Riverine Assault Force (TF 117). Complementing the American naval contingent were the Vietnamese Navy's 655 ships, assault craft, patrol boats, and other vessels. To focus the allied effort on the Sealords campaign, COMNAVFORV appointed his deputy, Rear Admiral William Hiram House, USN, the operational commander, or [...] "First Sealord," [...] of the newly activated Task Force 194 in December 1968. Although continuing to function, the Game Warden, Market Time, and Riverine Assault Force operations were scaled down and their personnel and material resources increasingly devoted to Sealords. PCF's, because of their shallow drafts and limited capacity for <b>off-shore</b> <b>operations</b> were tasked for incursions up rivers and canals, while the Coast Guard's Point-class cutters were assigned coastal areas previously assigned to the PCFs. Task Force 115 PCFs mounted lightning raids into enemy-held coastal waterways and took over patrol responsibility for the delta's larger rivers. This freed the PBRs for operations along the previously uncontested smaller rivers and canals. These incursions into former Viet Cong bastions were possible only with the on-call support of naval aircraft and the heavily armed riverine assault craft.|$|E

5000|$|... "Mud engineer" [...] is {{the name}} given to an oil field service company {{individual}} who is charged with maintaining a drilling fluid or completion fluid system on an oil and/or gas drilling rig. This individual typically works for the company selling the chemicals for the job and is specifically trained with those products, though independent mud engineers are still common. The role of the mud engineer or more properly Drilling Fluids Engineer is very critical to the entire drilling operation because even small problems with mud can stop the whole operations on rig. The internationally accepted shift pattern at <b>off-shore</b> drilling <b>operations</b> is personnel (including mud engineers) work on a 28-day shift pattern, where they work for 28 continuous days and rest the following 28 days.

40|$|In many Indo-Pacific {{countries}} the coastal fisheries employ a labour force which is greatly {{in excess of}} that merited by the increasingly over-exploited resources. As a result, both productivity and incomes are declining. Population growth is projected to remain high but further intensification of fishing effort will lead to continuing depletion of already threatened fish stocks. There is thus an urgent need to identify or generate alternative employment opportunities for rural fishermen. The paper reviews the various options available within the fishery sector in this respect, for example, the transfer of coastal fishermen to <b>off-shore</b> <b>operations,</b> aquaculture, post harvest enterprises and recreational fisheries. It also discusses full and part time possibilities of employment outside the fishery sector, {{within the context of}} rural industrialization and development, including opportunities arising in cottage industries, agriculture, land development schemes and manufacturing. Both policy issues and practical factors in the overall promotion of rural enterprises are considered. Emphasis is placed upon the importance of creating self-help organizations such as cooperatives. The role of fishermen's cooperatives and their relative lack of success is critically examined and a fundamental re-thinking of cooperative policies and programmes is counselled. The author concludes by offering a number of recommendations designed to promote the success of rural enterprise developments and underlines the valuable contribution that could be made in that respect by cooperatives which pursue a diversity of activities. 1...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Firms compete using {{a variety}} of strategies. Typically they aim to provide {{something}} different, to be better, or simply cheaper. In the construction industry, the performance characteristics, quality and cost of the final delivered project will be the outcome of the interplay of capabilities of all the firms involved in the project. Consequently, in order to improve competitiveness, firms must pay attention to not only their own competitive advantage but to those of the firms, both up-stream and down-stream, on whom they depend in delivering their projects. For foreign constructors in China, those competitive considerations will be informed by circumstances different from home. How then do foreign constructors adapt themselves to the problem of sourcing competitively when located within a China-based supply chain? The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – In this study 60 foreign enterprises operating within the Chinese construction sector were investigated by using a comparative case study approach. Findings – Four generic procurement strategies were identified. First, firms adapt themselves in the search for optimal supply sources by replicating home-based suppliers, controlling local suppliers, or by remaining agile and non-aligned. Second, firms develop niche supply monopolies through market dominance, uniquely differentiated offerings, or by integration with down-stream providers. Third, firms find opportunities to bring in off-shore technology intensive procurements, where that technology is either protected, improved upon, or sold. Finally, firms also seek to transit to China as a procurement base in order to reduce local supply cost, service world-wide operations, or as part of a total strategy of China relocation. Originality/value – The identification of this rich range of procurement approaches will be of interest to internationalization strategists, as well as to industry practitioners looking to find appropriate business models for <b>off-shore</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{drilling}} fluids have replaced {{much of the}} mineral oil previously used in mud systems for <b>off-shore</b> drilling <b>operations.</b> The chemicals are entered into the North Sea environment attached to bore hole cuttings, which are deposited on the seabed {{not far from the}} discharge sites. After deposition, erosion may occur by biodegradation, bioturbation, resuspension and release to the watermass of dissolved chemicals or metabolites. In the present investigation, aliquots of control sediment and three types of cuttings were deposited in duplicate benthic chambers. During an experimental period of 161 days, the loss of {{drilling fluids}} from the sediments as well as the change of the ratio between drilling fluid and barium was measured. The mineralisation of drilling fluid carbon to CO 2 and water was calculated from oxygen consumption measurements and effects on sediment pH and redox potentials were determined at various time intervals. The results showed that Novasol II polyalfaolefins and Aquamul ethers degraded more slowly than Petrofree esters. However, as shown by strong redox potential deviations, the availability of the esters to sulphate reducing bacteria will most likely reduce the diversity of benthic communities during the degradation period.

40|$|The New Zealand export meat {{industry}} has been through {{a considerable number of}} changes in the 1980 s. The deregulation of export slaughter facilities, Supplementary Minimum Prices, Producer Board intervention, declining livestock numbers and domestic cost pressures have all affected the performance of the domestically based processing sector. Major changes in market access and demand have influenced <b>off-shore</b> marketing <b>operations,</b> particularly for sheepmeats. Additionally, there has been a change in the type of meat exported with a greater proportion of further processed product shipped in recent years. As an example of the impact of these developments on livestock producers, the producer share of the United Kingdom wholesale market return for a representative prime lamb carcase has fallen from 40 per cent in 1978 to 25 per cent in 1988. In this article the pattern of intervention in the New Zealand pastoral meat industries from the mid- 1960 s is detailed, emphasising the different environments of the beef and sheepmeat enterprises. Then the principal factors influencing domestic processing margins for these products are empirically examined. Alternative model specifications and alternative estimation techniques are compared and contrasted. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of the historical patterns of assistance and structural change, and in terms of current rationalisation pressures on the meat processing sector.

40|$|Discharge of {{chemicals}} from <b>off-shore</b> drilling <b>operations</b> represent {{a matter of}} concern for the oil industry and pollution control authorities world-wide. As the industry expands towards higher latitudes and greater depths, mud chemicals attached to bore hole cuttings may become deposited on sediments with ambient temperatures below 0 grader C. In order to assess the fate of the most recently developed ester- and olefin-based chemicals under such conditions, a comperative study was performed in the soft-bottom laboratory at Marine Research Station Solbergstrand on sediment communities transferred from Arctic and temperate deep fjord locations. The sediments were initially treated with four levels of cuttings (zero, low, medium and high dose) and maintained at simulated seabed conditions at - 0. 5 and 7 grader C, respectively. Biodegradation and effects on the sediment environment were assessed from observations of concentration change of organic phase and barium in the sediment, oxygen concumption rates, redox potentials and the macrobenthic community structure. During the three months experimental period, increasing rates of oxygen consumption in the Artic communities showed adaptation to degradation of the chemicals at rates no less than those observed in the Oslofjord communities. The Artic communities appeared, however, more sensitive to sulphide toxicity produced in high dose ester treatments, and no evidence was found to support the hypothesis that better availability to anoxic degraders would yield shorter sea-bed remediation times of areas contaminated with esters as compared to areas contaminated with C 14 -C 18 olefins.

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{systematically}} document drivers {{of change and}} the implications they will have on international supply chain management in the coming two decades. Design/methodology/approach - This study was commissioned by the World Customs Organization (WCO) {{at the end of}} June 2006. Because of increased trade volumes, emerging complex supply networks and heightened security concerns, the WCO saw the need to assess future trends and drivers in supply chain management. The Delphi method was applied to identify a set of foreseeable drivers of change and to assess their predicted impact on global supply chain management in the coming ten to 20 years. Based on a literature review of 150 recent publications and interviews among 33 industry, academic and customs experts, a survey was designed and conducted to collect current and potential change drivers in global supply chains. These drivers were compiled and prioritized by an eclectic team of 12 specialists. Findings - The main results of the study are strongly connected to strategic and operational supply chain planning for the next ten to 20 years. They are related to increased <b>off-shoring</b> of <b>operations</b> through truly global manufacturing, characterized by its intercontinental supply of materials; increased product complexity with shorter product life cycles; increased importance of business-to-governmert networking for operational and security efficiency; introduction of new supply chain services integrating financial, physical and information flows leading to further consolidation in the logistics markets; and the overall increase in risks and vulnerabilities in international supply chains.

Strategic horizontal alliances have become increasingly important for manufacturers seeking to counter retailer dominance, yet have received little attention in the agri-food literature. The two alliances examined in this paper illustrate the profound importance of prevailing societal and institutional environments in which production networks ‘touch-down’, and their influence on firm-level dynamics of trust, motivation, corporate values, and strategic objectives.

40|$|Oil {{production}} is shifting from ''shallow'' wells (0 - 650 ft water depth) to <b>off-shore,</b> deep-water <b>operations</b> (> 2, 600 ft.). Production from these operations is now approaching 20 %. By 2007, it is projected {{that as much}} as 70 % of the U. S. oil production will be from deep-water operations. The crude oil from these deep wells is more polar, thus increasing the amount of dissolved hydrocarbons in the produced water. Early data from Gulf of Mexico (GOM) wells indicate that the problem with soluble organics will increase significantly as deep-water production increases. Existing physical/chemical treatment technologies used to remove dispersed oil from produced water will not remove dissolved organics. GOM operations are rapidly moving toward design of high-capacity platforms that will require compact, low-cost, efficient treatment processes to comply with current and future water quality regulations. This project is an extension of previous research to improve the applicability of ozonation and will help address the petroleum industry-wide problem of treating water containing soluble organics. The goal of this project is to maximize oxidation of water-soluble organics during a single-pass operation. The project investigates: (1) oxidant production by electrochemical and sonochemical methods, (2) increasing the mass transfer rate in the reactor by forming microbubbles during ozone injection into the produced water, and (3) using ultraviolet irradiation to enhance the reaction if needed. Industrial collaborators include Chevron, Shell, Phillips, BP Amoco, Statoil, and Marathon Oil through a joint project with the Petroleum Environmental Research Forum (PERF). The research and demonstration program consists of three phases: (1) Laboratory testing in batch reactors to compare effectiveness of organics destruction using corona discharge ozone generation methods with hydrogen peroxide generated sonochemically and to evaluate the enhancement of destruction by UV light and micro-bubble spraying. (2) Continuous-flow studies to determine the efficacy of various contactors, the dependency of organics destruction on process variables, and scale-up issues.

This information can then {{be used to improve}} numerical models in order to monitor the operating and structural conditions of the system. This is a critical aspect both for condition monitoring and maintenance of large wind turbines, particularly in the <b>off-shore</b> sector where <b>operation</b> and maintenance represent a high percentage of total costs. The availability of commercial numerical aeroelastic simulation codes simulating the response of wind turbines in operation {{can be used as a}} virtual design and verification tool. Effects of design modifications and variations in the environmental and structural conditions can all be simulated using these tools. However, experimental test campaigns should be able to provide accurate and reliable data with which the model can be updated and be more representative of the real response. Thus, the improvement of these simulation models is strongly related to the improvement of the current Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) modal parameter estimation techniques. The main issue for these methods is that, due to blade rotation, force periodicity and the presence of control surfaces which modify continuously the system configuration, most of the applicability assumptions of OMA are violated. In this paper, some preliminary assessments on how to combine numerical and experimental techniques for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of wind turbines are investigated...|$|R

In particular, they learn how a change in one position on the line affects the manpower, methods, and machines of the entire line. The quantitative as well as qualitative problems of batch processing, work-in-progress inventory, misutilization of labor, and even elements of product liability become “live concepts ” instead of dry exercises from a book. Students in an MBA program with no real-life experiences against which to reflect what they are learning in their classes are able to experience a working fabrication line in all its complexities. They are challenged by having to design their own products and the jigs and fixtures to make them—even when they have no engineering or specialized knowledge. One group, for example, manages to design a production jig for a folding step that other groups have been doing by hand; the jig enables a 57 % improvement in production per labor minute. The exercises also demonstrate the costs of idle time: When a batch process is mishandled, worker idle time jumps to 19 % of the total time needed to run the batch. This exercise prepares students for future job decisions involving production problems of in-house manufacturing or service <b>operations,</b> <b>off-shore</b> procurement, and quality control.
