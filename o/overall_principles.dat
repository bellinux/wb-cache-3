5000|$|Leon Battista Alberti was {{a famous}} {{mathematician}} and architect who had a connection with Leonollo d’Este {{through the development of}} the text the De Re Aedificatoria. The book detailed the concerns regarding materials, construction, <b>overall</b> <b>principles</b> and foundation of the overall design, and the ideas behind public and private buildings. It also spoke about the different types of building façades and discussed ways to fix construction errors. When Leonello was younger and his father was still in power, he would associate himself with people of great intellectual capacity; Alberti was one of his favourites. In 1441, Leonello invited Alberti to judge a competition to find an artist to create a sculpture of his father. It was thought that this particular treatise would be dedicated to Leonello since {{he was the one that}} prompted the writing of the De Re Aedificatoria to Alberti. However, due to Leonello’s death in 1450, the treatise went to Pope Nicholas V for papal use in the construction of new buildings, since Rome was in a period of immense construction projects. Leonello’s friendship and overall prompting to Alberti allowed for the architectural treatise to become a reality, as well as gave Alberti the opportunity to reintroduce the ideas of Vitruvius to the common person in the 15th century. [...] Through his influence as Marquis and the family name of Este, Leonello was able to develop the De Re Aedificatoria under his reign.|$|E

We suggest that sequence learning is not predetermined with respect to one particular type of information but, rather, develops according to an <b>overall</b> <b>principle</b> of activation contingent on task characteristics.
