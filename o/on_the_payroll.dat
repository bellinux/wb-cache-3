5|$|In 1943, Ramsey was {{approached}} by Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Bacher, who asked him to join the Manhattan Project. Ramsey agreed to do so, but {{the intervention of the}} Project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was necessary in order to prise him away from the Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project. In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the Los Alamos Laboratory with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design and delivery of the nuclear weapons being built by the laboratory.|$|E

Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games, and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game. Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events and put employees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams.|$|E
5|$|Scientific Atlanta's first {{business}} {{focus was}} antennas for military and industrial use. Finances were tight at the fledgling firm. When {{they could not}} afford an automatic antenna pattern recorder, of which there was only one such machine on the market, Robinson decided to build his own. When word in the industry spread companies began contacting Scientific Atlanta. Within six months of the development of the device, Robinson sold units to Western Electric, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Convair, American Machine and Foundry, and many other large corporations of the era. Within eight years of operating, the firm had captured 60% of the global market share of electronic instruments for testing and designing antennas, had broken ground on a 25 acre facility in Northeast Atlanta, and had 240 employees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> including 40 engineers.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{spent much}} of early 1953 in enacting the remainder of its legislative program. St. Laurent {{did not wish to}} call an election until after Queen Elizabeth's Coronation on 2 June and eventually scheduled it for 10 August. Drew made large numbers of promises to the voters, and attempted to exploit a Defence Ministry scandal which had broken earlier in the year (at the Petawawa, Ontario army base, an investigation had found frauds which included placing horses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payroll),</b> but the Liberals were not seriously challenged. The Liberals lost 20 seats from their 1949 high-water mark, but still constituted almost two-thirds of the House of Commons, and no minister was defeated. Howe was again easily elected for Port Arthur.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added surplus going towards the debt. In the audited financial statements released in January 2013, the surplus for the 2011-2012 was $882.8 million, with the overall debt falling to $7.8 billion.|$|E

And, a Democrat former legislative colleague, Jerry Thomasson of Arkadelphia, who switched parties to run twice for attorney general, had placed his own wife <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state <b>payroll.</b> Prior to <b>the</b> disclosure of <b>the</b> Crank children <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state <b>payroll,</b> a poll had shown Crank leading Rockefeller, three-to-two. And morale in the Rockefeller camp had declined with the organization of a [...] "Republicans-for-Crank" [...] organization, which solicited the support of Henry M. Britt of Hot Springs, the 1960 Republican gubernatorial who had lost every county to Faubus. Britt and former Republican state party chairman William L. Spicer of Fort Smith had formerly quarreled with Rockefeller, but Britt had been reconciled for the 1968 race.|$|R

Anna was mentioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payrolls</b> of <b>the</b> Neapolitan court again in 1476, twice more in the 1480s, and finally in 1499 when she was paid 150 ducats for her services.

25|$|The 1930s were {{a time of}} rampant {{corruption}} in Tampa, with many accusations of stolen elections and mayors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payrolls</b> of rival organized crime factions.

25|$|In 1998, as {{the plant}} was no longer {{economically}} competitive with other manufacturing facilities, it was permanently closed, resulting {{in the loss of}} jobs for the 900 people who had been producing seat adjusters, moldings and painted exterior components.

25|$|NHI {{is mainly}} financed through premiums, {{which are based}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> tax, and is {{supplemented}} with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding.

25|$|In 1779, Casanova found Francesca, an uneducated seamstress, {{who became}} his live-in lover and housekeeper, and who loved him devotedly.

Other publishing and theater ventures failed, primarily from lack of capital. In a downward spiral, Casanova was expelled again from Venice in 1783, after writing a vicious satire poking fun at Venetian nobility. In it he made his only public statement that Grimani was his true father.|$|E
