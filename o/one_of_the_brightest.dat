5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp (formally {{designated}} C/1995O1) is a comet {{that was}} perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> seen for many decades.|$|E
5|$|Messier 87 (also {{known as}} Virgo A or NGC 4486, and {{generally}} abbreviated to M87) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy {{in the constellation}} Virgo. One of the most massive galaxies in the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clusters—M87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150–200 orbiting the Milky Way—and its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> radio sources in the sky, and is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the λ ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986. In this geometry the ring became the brightest feature of the Uranian ring system, outshining the ε ring. This observation, together with the wavelength dependence of the optical depth, indicates that the λ ring contains significant amount of micrometer-sized dust. The normal optical depth of this dust is 10−4–10−3. Observations in 2007 by the Keck telescope during the ring plane-crossing event confirmed this conclusion, because the λ ring became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> features in the Uranian ring system.|$|E

25|$|Other {{variable}} stars are U Camelopardalis, VZ Camelopardalis, and Mira variables T Camelopardalis, X Camelopardalis, and R Camelopardalis. RU Camelopardalis is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> Type II Cepheids {{visible in the}} night sky.|$|R
5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star {{to the south}} celestial pole. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus {{have been found to}} have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} named after Spica, a binary star system in the {{constellation}} Virgo and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> stars in the nighttime sky. It appears as one star because of the relatively low center-to-center distance between the two component stars, estimated {{at an average of}} 11 million miles (17.7 million km). Astronomical observations also suggest that there may be additional stars in the Spica system. In the story, Asumi mentions Spica's distance to Earth as 350 light-years. This figure is also cited by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; however, other sources indicate a distance of approximately 260 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Tucana {{is not a}} {{prominent}} constellation as all of its stars are third magnitude or fainter; the brightest is Alpha Tucanae with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.87. Beta Tucanae is a star system with six member stars, while Kappa is a quadruple system. Five star systems {{have been found to}} have exoplanets to date. The constellation contains 47 Tucanae, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> globular clusters in the sky, and most of the Small Magellanic Cloud.|$|E

5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Alpha Andromedae, is {{a binary}} star that {{has also been}} counted {{as a part of}} Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} naked-eye double stars in Grus. Forming a {{triangle}} with Alnair and Beta, Delta Gruis is an optical double whose components—Delta1 and Delta2—are separated by 45 arcseconds. Delta1 is a yellow giant of spectral type G7III and magnitude 4.0, 309 light-years from Earth, {{and may have}} its own magnitude 12 orange dwarf companion. Delta2 is a red giant of spectral type M4.5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.2, located 325 light-years from Earth. It has around 3 times the mass and 135 times the diameter of our sun. Mu Gruis, composed of Mu1 and Mu2, is also an optical double—both stars are yellow giants of spectral type G8III around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun with surface temperatures of around 4900 K. Mu1 is the brighter of the two at magnitude 4.8 located around 275 light-years from Earth, while Mu2 the dimmer at magnitude 5.11 lies 265 light-years distant from Earth. Pi Gruis, an optical double with a variable component, is composed of Pi1 Gruis and Pi2. Pi1 is a semi-regular red giant of spectral type S5, ranging from magnitude 5.31 to 7.01 {{over a period of}} 191 days, and is around 532 light-years from Earth. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> S-class stars to Earth viewers, it has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10.9 with sunlike properties, being a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. The pair make up a likely binary system. Pi2 is a giant star of spectral type F3III-IV located around 130 light-years from Earth, and is often brighter than its companion at magnitude 5.6. Marking the right wing is Theta Gruis, yet another double star, lying 5 degrees east of Delta1 and Delta2.|$|E

50|$|M92 is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> {{globular}} clusters {{in the northern}} hemisphere, but it is often overlooked by amateur astronomers because of its proximity to the even more spectacular Messier 13. It is {{visible to the naked}} eye under very good conditions.|$|R
5|$|The series {{marked the}} first time that an NHL team with a captain from Europe had made the Finals, as Senators captain Alfredsson hails from Sweden. (Previously, only Americans or Canadians had captained teams in the Finals.) Alfredsson would be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> lights for <b>the</b> Senators in the series, as he had been in all the playoff series. But he would be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few <b>bright</b> lights as Anaheim won the series in five games bolstered by strong {{defensive}} play and opportunistic scoring.|$|R
50|$|Epsilon Geminorum (ε Geminorum, {{abbreviated}} Epsilon Gem, ε Gem), {{also named}} Mebsuta, {{is a star}} in <b>the</b> constellation <b>of</b> Gemini and {{is located on the}} outstretched right 'leg' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twin Castor.
