The film was {{generally}} well received by critics, but the faults of story for the sake <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> lesson was noted. Adrift, like all other American silents of the day, had no musical accompaniment, but a letter written into a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{originally}} place {{heavy emphasis on}} ethical issues, it did see the family as the cornerstone of society. By 1994, it had become more conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put in the context <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics, but {{contained within the}} reviews were often criticism on {{the execution of the}} story and plot. A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the acting to be satisfactory. Walton of the The Moving Picture News criticized the type of film as invoking sudden and unnatural changes in character for the sake <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> lesson. The child's influence and ability to bring sense to her father was seen as cheap theatrics, but ended with the assertion that the film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her father was not believable because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|Alms are {{the fruits}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> {{notion of the}} gift and of fortune on the one hand, and {{of a notion of}} sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of {{happiness}} and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.|$|E
25|$|Satanic ritual abuse (SRA, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} ritual abuse, ritualistic abuse, organised abuse, sadistic ritual abuse, and other variants) {{was the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> panic that originated in the United States in the 1980s, spreading {{throughout the country and}} eventually to {{many parts of the world}} by the late 1990s. Allegations of SRA involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. In its most extreme form, SRA involves a worldwide organisation including the wealthy and powerful of the world elite in which children are abducted or bred for sacrifices, pornography and prostitution.|$|E
25|$|John was {{famed for}} his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign. He is an {{exceptional}} example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> ruler, {{at a time}} when cruelty was the norm. He is reputed never to have condemned anyone to death or mutilation. Charity was dispensed lavishly. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. By the example of his personal purity and piety he effected a notable improvement in the manners of his age. Descriptions of him and his actions indicate that he had great self-control and personal courage, was an excellent strategist and an expert imperator in the field, and through his many campaigns he devoted himself to the preservation of his empire.|$|E

25|$|In essence, Kant’s {{remarks in}} the preface prepare the reader for {{the thrust of the}} ideas he goes on to develop in the Groundwork. The purpose of the Groundwork is to prepare a {{foundation}} for moral theory. Because Kant believes that any fact which is grounded in empirical knowledge must be contingent, he can only derive the necessity that the moral law requires from a priori reasoning. It is with this significance of necessity in mind that the Groundwork attempts to establish a pure (a priori) ethics. Such an ethics explains the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> law and locates what Kant calls the “supreme principle of morality.” The aim of the following sections of the Groundwork is to explain what the moral law would have to be like if it existed and to show that, in fact, it exists and is authoritative for us.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the ban, some commentators, health {{professionals}} {{and community members}} expressed concerns about {{the long-term effects of}} the use of khat by Somalis in the UK, suggesting that excessive use has a negative social and health impact on the community. One review of studies of the effects of khat use by Somalis and other immigrants on their mental health suggested that there was a need for better research on khat-chewing and its possible link with psychiatric disorders; it also suggested that public discourse on the issue displayed elements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> panic. Some Somali community organisations also campaigned for khat to be banned. As a result of these concerns, the Home Office commissioned successive research studies to look into the matter, and in 2005, presented the question of khat's legal status before the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. After a careful review of the evidence, the expert committee recommended in January 2006 that the status of khat as a legal substance should remain for the time being.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of Islamic {{religious}} expression existed in Egypt during the early Mamluk era, namely Sunni Islam and its major madhabs (schools of thought) and various Sufi orders, but also small communities of Ismai'li Shia Muslims, particularly in Upper Egypt. In addition, {{there was a significant}} minority of Coptic Christians. Under Sultan Saladin, the Ayyubids embarked on a program of reviving and strengthening Sunni Islam in Egypt to counter Christianity, which had been reviving under the religiously benign rule of the Fatimids, and Ismailism, the branch of Islam of the Fatimid state. Under the Bahri sultans, the promotion of Sunni Islam was pursued more vigorously than under the Ayyubids. The Mamluks were motivated in this regard by personal piety or political expediency for Islam was both an assimilating and unifying factor between the Mamluks and the majority of their subjects; the early mamluks had been brought up as Sunni Muslims and the Muslim faith was the only aspect of life shared between the Mamluk ruling elite and its subjects. While the precedent set by the Ayyubids highly influenced the Mamluk state's embrace of Sunni Islam, the circumstances in the Muslim Middle East {{in the aftermath of the}} Crusader and Mongol invasions also left Mamluk Egypt as the last major Islamic power able to confront the Crusaders and the Mongols. Thus, the early Mamluk embrace of Sunni Islam also stemmed from the pursuit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> unity within their realm based on the majority views of its subjects.|$|E

25|$|Paine was an {{enthusiastic}} {{supporter of the}} French Revolution, and was granted honorary French citizenship alongside prominent contemporaries such as Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and others. Paine's honorary citizenship was {{in recognition of the}} publishing of his Rights of Man, Part II and the sensation it created within France. Despite his inability to speak French, {{he was elected to the}} National Convention, representing the district of Pas-de-Calais. A few weeks after being elected to the National Convention, Paine was selected as one of nine deputies to be part of the Convention's Constitutional Committee, who were charged to draft a suitable constitution for the French Republic. He subsequentially participated in the Constitutional Committee in drafting the Girondin constitutional project. He voted for the French Republic; but argued against the execution of Louis XVI, saying that he should instead be exiled to the United States: firstly, because of the way royalist France had come to the aid of the American Revolution; and secondly because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> objection to capital punishment in general and to revenge killings in particular. However, Paine’s speech in defense of Louis XVI was interrupted by Jean-Paul Marat, who claimed that as a Quaker, Paine’s religious beliefs ran counter to inflicting capital punishment, and thus he should be ineligible to vote. Marat interrupted a second time, stating that the translator was deceiving the convention by distorting the meanings of Paine’s words, prompting Paine to provide a copy of the speech as proof that he was being correctly translated.|$|E
