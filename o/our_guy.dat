5000|$|Because of {{his ability}} to move weight classes, Pacquiao has been under {{suspicion}} of illegal steroid/PED use. Because of a psychological fear of blood drainage, especially close to a bout, this allegation began when he turned down a random blood and urine drug test in 2010 when in negotiations for a Mayweather bout. During this time Pacquiao had gained both weight and power without losing speed and had moved through multiple weight classes. The consideration that is generally put forward in counter argument is that Pacquiao has settled as a natural 140 pound fighter and became a pro at an exceptionally young age (16) and in extreme poverty, so that fact combined with how men generally gain weight as they age, particularly between the ages of 18-25-29, make the allegations far from definitive. Allegations by Mayweather ended in a lawsuit from Pacquiao that was settled with penalties by Mayweather out of court. In spite of multiple knockdowns and near stoppages, since the allegations Pacquiao has yet to score a knockout inside the ring. Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach has had suspicion of Pacquiao's former strength and conditioning coach Alex Ariza. Roach stated that Ariza had been giving Pacquiao [...] "special drinks" [...] without his permission. Roach also stated [...] "One of the reasons I don't work with him Ariza anymore is he's a little shady. He used to give Manny a drink before workouts, and I asked him what was in the drink and he would never tell me. I told him I need to know what was in the drinks because you're giving it to my fighter." [...] Well respected boxing aficionado Teddy Atlas has been of the belief that Pacquiao has been on steroids in the past based on what he Atlas sees with his eyes. saying the power is the last thing to go in a fighter, and Manny doesn't have his anymore. Atlas also mentioned on ESPN according to some sources he was told on during negotiations between a fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao on the topic of the drug test refusal that the Pacquiao camp sent emails to the Mayweather camp asking [...] "What would the penalty be if <b>our</b> <b>guy</b> tested positive?" [...] the second email said [...] "If he did test positive could we keep this a secret for the benefit of boxing?" [...] Other boxers such as Paulie Malignaggi and Bernard Hopkins have also been outspoken on this topic. However, there is no definitive proof on this subject, only speculation.|$|E
