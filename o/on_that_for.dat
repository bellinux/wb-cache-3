5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{developed}} by Grasshopper Manufacture. The game was conceived by studio founder Goichi Suda, beginning development in 1999 after completion of the studio's debut title The Silver Case. The staff number for The Silver Case was under ten people and thus they had to adjust their development goals based <b>on</b> <b>that.</b> <b>For</b> Flower, Sun, and Rain five or six more people were involved and thus the scope was increased, such as including exploration and action elements. According to Suda, Flower, Sun, and Rain {{was part of the}} studio's transition towards more action-oriented titles. While The Silver Case was published on the original PlayStation, that console was nearing the end of its viable life cycle, so Flower, Sun, and Rain {{was developed}} for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Flower, Sun, and Rain moved away from the purely text-driven structure of The Silver Case, but it still carried over many of the previous game's themes and concepts. As with The Silver Case, Suda wanted to include puzzles, but felt that he had gone too far with the variety and challenge of puzzles within The Silver Case. Instead, Suda created a single puzzle system revolving around numerical combinations, which both simplified puzzles and tied in with Mondo's character.|$|E

500|$|With the slowing of {{the global}} economy due to the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2010, the company experienced a downside of focusing so much on this demographic group. The high unemployment of the recession, coupled with healthier eating habits, drove many customers away from fast food towards the fast-casual segment or forced them to stop eating out. Analysts have stated that by focusing its marketing and advertising programs on men, BK alienated women and children. Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass stated, [...] "Maybe catering to the super fan was the correct strategy to kick-start the business, but maybe they relied <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> too long..." ...|$|E

500|$|The third pod of {{the season}} [...] "ties {{together}} [...] thematically", taking the characters into the virtual world of the Framework, where their lives {{are different from the}} real world. This explores [...] "what if" [...] scenarios for many of the characters by showing who they may have been if a major regret of their life was changed, hence the pod's title, Agents of Hydra. This continues the season's focus on the nature of identity and reality, having [...] "payoff to all the reflection on the past" [...] such as Mack's tragic loss of his daughter and Fitz's troubled relationship with his father. Bennet called the pod [...] "very relevant. It's definitely a theme that I think has been kind of hopping around in pop culture at the moment. But it's kind of like a fun Marvel take <b>on</b> <b>that.</b> <b>For</b> all those people who wished to see these characters in a different light, {{this is going to be}} the time for that to happen." [...] Whedon felt that this storyline would not be interesting early in a series, but is rewarding after spending [...] "80-plus episodes with these characters".|$|E
2500|$|I {{think the}} sounds {{that a lot}} of people come to expect from us are based on the idea of large walls of very thick guitars.

But we didn't rely <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> this album, it actually doesn't have any of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the Class 50 lie in an {{invitation}} from the British Transport Commission (BTC) to manufacturers to produce [...] a design for a Diesel locomotive with a gross power output of at least 2500hp. In order to produce a prototype quickly, English Electric based their design <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> their Deltic locomotives which were then in production. Other parts related to another current design, the Class 37s were also used. The result was DP2, a 2700hp Diesel-electric locomotive weighing 107 tons and with {{a top speed of}} 100mph. The prototype was delivered to British Rail in May 1962 ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{commission}} from Catherine, Germain Pilon carved {{the marble}} sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. The Florentine Domenico del Barbiere, {{who had worked}} at Fontainebleau, carved the base. Pilon's fluid style echoes Primaticcio's stucco work at Fontainebleau. The piece {{may also have been}} influenced by Pierre Bontemps's monument for the heart of Francis I. Pilon set the bronze urn on the heads of the Three Graces, who are poised back to back, as if to dance. He may have based the design <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> an incense burner for Francis I, engraved by Marcantonio. Pilon's figures, however, with their long necks and small heads, are more like nymphs. A poem by Ronsard is engraved {{at the foot of the}} sculpture. It asks the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast. Henri Zerner has called the monument, which can be seen at the Louvre, [...] "one of the summits of our sculpture".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with a What's on TV journalist, Morey said viewers relate to Sonya because she is [...] "pretty normal". The actress noted that Sonya is not glamorous and there is [...] "something quite humbling about her." [...] Morey {{went on to say that}} Sonya's heart is usually in the right place and she always tries to do the right thing for the right reasons. Of her character's development, Morey explained [...] "She has become a lot more self-assured and she has learnt to trust herself again. I think when we first met her, she was quite closed off and didn't want to let anyone in fear of hurting them." [...] Sonya decides to give up her job as a guide dog trainer to buy and turn the community garden into a garden nursery. Morey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life. She explained [...] "She made a lot of mistakes when she was younger. Now she just wants to plant beautiful things and watch them grow. She's very focused <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> now." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, INXS made a brief {{stopover}} in Japan {{to play a}} {{small number}} of shows and festivals in Tokyo and Yokohama, before flying on to Australia on October 14 to begin the first segment of the Calling All Nations tour. By the time the Kick tour had reached Australia, INXS were global superstars, especially Hutchence, who was now seen as a world-class live performer. Since the culmination of the Kick tour in November 1988, INXS agreed to a one-year respite, allowing the member's time off to spend with their families and to work on side projects. Bass guitarist Garry Gary Beers recalls, [...] "By the end off that tour we were completely exhausted and burnt out. I mean we'd done Listen Like Thieves, toured <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> ages, recorded Kick straight away and then toured for 16months". During 1989, Hutchence collaborated with Ian 'Ollie' Olsen on a side project, Max Q, the two had previously worked together on Lowenstein's film Dogs in Space. The rest of the band also took a break to work on side projects, but returned to the studio to record their follow-up album X (1990).|$|E

2500|$|Ullman {{contends that}} her impersonations are played with great admiration and affection. [...] "I hope {{they take it}} in the right spirit!" [...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> a second or two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant. [...] "But I get into trouble now if I go into a shop with a bag over my arm [...] A man {{came up to me}} in M the other day and said to me, 'I've got my eye on you'." ...|$|E
