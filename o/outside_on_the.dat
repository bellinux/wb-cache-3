5|$|After {{all the men}} {{had left}} ringside, {{it was time for}} the WWF Women's Championship match between Wendi Richter, managed by singer Cyndi Lauper (with her manager David Wolfe), and Leilani Kai, managed by former {{champion}} The Fabulous Moolah. Shortly after the match began, Moolah grabbed Richter as she was <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, but Lauper saved her from an attack. Kai then performed a flying crossbody from the top rope, but Richter used Kai's momentum to roll-up Kai in a pinning position. With this pin, Richter became the new Women's Champion.|$|E
5|$|At a {{memorial}} service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including PK van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E

5|$|Street Dance Kemp Europe (SDK Europe) is a {{competition}} and dance convention founded in 2004 in Jedovnice, Czech Republic. There is a hip-hop crew battle and solo battles for house, krumping, locking, hip-hop male, and hip-hop female dancers. SDK Europe begins {{every year in}} the summer and lasts seven days. Daytime hours are reserved primarily for dance workshops and classes taught by an international pool of instructors; competitive events are held at night. All of the classes, workshops, and competitive events are held outside and—although hotels or cottages are an option—many participants stay in tents and camp <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> SDK event grounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard on the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E
5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E

25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} {{can provide}} very high efficiencies, making {{them a good}} match for very low-powered amplifiers, such as single-ended triode amps or other tube amplifiers. After WWII, some early hi-fi fans {{went so far as}} to build low frequency horns whose mouths took up much of a wall of the listening room. The throats were sometimes <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lawn, or in the basement. With the coming of stereo in the 1960s, this approach was rarely seen. Many loudspeaker buyers and do-it-yourself loudspeaker fans sought smaller designs for aesthetic reasons.|$|E

25|$|One story often told, both {{in respect}} of a full size {{carriage}} {{and one of his}} models, is that one night Murdoch decided to test his carriage <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open road and it soon outpaced him, leaving him to chase after it. Whilst chasing it he encountered a local clergyman in a state of considerable distress who had mistaken his carriage, with its billowing smoke and fire burning under the boiler, for the devil. This story may be accurate; however, is more likely to relate to a model than to a full-size steam carriage.|$|E

The building's foundation and brickwork were thoroughly reset. Inside, the entire space was stripped from the bottom up. The 19th-century wooden fixtures, silver stage curtain and French-made red velvet banquettes were removed for repair in specialist workshops. <b>Outside,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the façade, the double-headed eagle of the original Russian coat of arms was installed in the place where the Soviet hammer and sickle had been mounted for decades.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} Jews in Lviv {{date back to}} the 10th century. The oldest {{remaining}} Jewish tombstone dates back to 1348. Apart from the Rabbanite Jews there were many Karaites who had settled in the city after coming from the East and from Byzantium. After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate Jewish quarters, one within the city walls and one <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of the city. Each had its separate synagogue, although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the Crimean Karaite community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 5 saw the {{completion}} of the first spacewalk by Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson. The pair released the new ammonia tank assembly for transfer to station for installation on a later spacewalk. They also removed an experiment from <b>outside</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kibo Exposed Facility, replaced a Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA) and performed several get-ahead tasks. The spacewalking pair was assisted by the SSRMS which was operated by pilot Jim Dutton and mission specialist Stephanie Wilson. While the spacewalk was going on, Naoko Yamazaki was assisted by commander Alan Poindexter, and the Expedition 23 crew to move several of the large science racks from the MPLM Leonardo to their new location on the ISS.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil, P. exigua nests {{can become}} infested by phorid flies, which cause colonies to flee and abandon their nests. Megaselia picta females emerge from P. exigua nests and proceed to {{lay their eggs}} <b>outside,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{uppermost}} envelope. This outer part of the nest contains meconial wastes and is where larvae reach the basal parts of the cells. Once the eggs hatch, the emerging larvae crawl towards the wasp’s nest and scavenge for food. Megaselia picta larvae will eat wasp meconia, eggs, larvae, and pupae. Megaselia attack quickly, with erratic-jerking movements and systematic oviposition behavior. Their distinct motions enable them to fly proficiently and walk rapidly. Aerial raids further enhance {{the success of their}} attacks, thus making these parasites a serious enemy to P. exigua. Megaselia scalaris have also been observed to cause P. exigua to frequently decamp.|$|E
