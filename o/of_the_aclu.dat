5|$|As the Watergate saga unfolded, the ACLU {{became the}} first {{national}} organization to call for Nixon's impeachment. This, following the resolution opposing the Vietnam war, was a second major decision that caused critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU,</b> particularly conservatives, {{to claim that the}} ACLU had evolved into a liberal political organization.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} debate {{regarding}} the proper balance {{of civil liberties}} and security, the membership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> increased by 20%, bringing the group's total enrollment to 330,000. The growth continued, and by August 2008 ACLU membership was greater than 500,000. It remained at that level through 2011.|$|E
50|$|From 1929 to 1959, {{he shared}} <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> general counsel at <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> with Arthur Garfield Hays. He became vice {{chairman}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> board in 1955.|$|R
2500|$|According to Jamil Dakwar, <b>the</b> {{director}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> Human Rights Program, {{an observer}} at Zahir's April 5 hearing, the military commission system [...] "...is a deficient system rife with legal and procedural problems..." ...|$|R
5|$|During <b>the</b> 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> {{primary focus}} was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor {{movement}} particularly. Because most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> efforts {{were associated with the}} labor movement, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the American Legion, the National Civic Federation, and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies.|$|R
5|$|It is {{the policy}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{to support the}} civil liberties of {{defendants}} regardless of their ideological stance. The ACLU takes pride in defending individuals with unpopular viewpoints, such as George Wallace, George Lincoln Rockwell, and KKK members. The ACLU has defended American Nazis many times, and their actions often brought protests, particularly from American Jews.|$|E
5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU,</b> Baldwin {{continued}} as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, {{but it was not}} particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the Garland Fund.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1968, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> held an {{internal}} symposium to discuss its dual roles: providing [...] "direct" [...] legal support (defense for accused in their initial trial, benefiting only the individual defendant), and appellate support (providing amicus briefs during the appeal process, to establish widespread legal precedent). Historically, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{was known for}} its appellate work which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions, but by 1968, 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> legal activities involved direct representation. The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for <b>the</b> <b>ACLU.</b>|$|R
500|$|<b>ACLU</b> {{affiliates}} are <b>the</b> {{basic unit}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> organization {{and engage in}} litigation, lobbying, and public education. For example, in a twenty-month period beginning January 2004, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> New Jersey chapter was involved in fifty-one cases according to their annual reportâ€”thirty-five cases in state courts, and sixteen in federal court. They provided legal representation in thirty-three of those cases, and served as amicus in the remaining eighteen. They listed forty-four volunteer attorneys who assisted them in those cases.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{is led by}} a {{president}} and an executive director, Susan N. Herman and Anthony Romero, respectively, in 2015. The president acts as chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> board <b>of</b> directors, leads fundraising, and facilitates policy-setting. The executive director manages <b>the</b> day-to-day operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization. <b>The</b> board <b>of</b> directors consists of 80 persons, including representatives from each state affiliate, as well as at-large delegates. The organization has its headquarters in 125 Broad Street, a 40-story skyscraper located in Lower Manhattan, New York City.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policy positions {{that have been}} established by its board of directors. Current positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> include: opposing the death penalty; supporting same-sex marriage {{and the right of}} LGBT people to adopt; supporting birth control and abortion rights; eliminating discrimination against women, minorities, and LGBT people; supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture; and opposing government preference for religion over non-religion, or for particular faiths over others.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Trump's order, the ACLU {{raised more than}} $24 million from more than 350,000 individual online donations in a two-day period. This amounted to six times what the ACLU normally receives in online donations in a year. Celebrities donating included Chris Sacca (who offered to match other people's donations and ultimately gave $150,000), Rosie O'Donnell, Judd Apatow, Sia, John Legend, and Adele. The number of members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> doubled in the time from the election to end of January to 1 million.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU is {{supported}} by a variety of persons and organizations. There were over 1,000,000 members in 2017, and the ACLU annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations. Allies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> in legal actions have included the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Jewish Congress, People For the American Way, the National Rifle Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the National Organization for Women.|$|E
25|$|This {{provision}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act {{was challenged}} by <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> on behalf <b>of</b> an unknown party against the U.S. {{government on the}} grounds that NSLs violate the First and Fourth Amendments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Constitution because {{there is no way to}} legally oppose an NSL subpoena in court, and that it was unconstitutional not to allow a client to inform their Attorney as to <b>the</b> order because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gag provision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letters. The court's judgement found in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> case, and they declared the law unconstitutional.|$|R
5|$|The NAACP was {{responsible}} for managing most sit-in related cases that {{made it to the}} Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision. But it fell to <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestorswhite and blackwho were arrested while protesting in <b>the</b> South. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protesters. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> provided <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funding for the LCDC.|$|R
50|$|Amidst 9/11 related concerns, ACLU membership, {{which had}} hovered around 300,000 for decades, {{increased}} to 573,000 following {{the terror attacks}} and subsequent legislation established during the Bush Administration. Total donations to <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> doubled to {{more than twice the}} 2001 budget, increasing to about $28 million per year in the years following. Upon Romero's arrival, he increased <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>ACLU</b> staff from 186 to 379 in 2001 alone. He also raised <b>the</b> salaries <b>of</b> staff members to be more in line with industry standards, in some cases increasing salaries by as much as 86 percent. In each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> national affiliate offices, Romero hired and placed at least one staff attorney.|$|R
5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU.</b> The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E
5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} {{proposed the}} New Deal {{to combat the}} depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti-trust legislation. Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Scopes {{trial was}} a phenomenal public {{relations}} {{success for the}} ACLU. The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> by a major U.S. newspaper. The ACLU continued {{to fight for the}} separation of church and state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case McLean v. Arkansas and the 2005 case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{was founded}} in 1920 by Helen Keller, Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Walter Nelles, Morris Ernst, Albert DeSilver, Arthur Garfield Hays, Jane Addams, Felix Frankfurter, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and its focus was on freedom of speech, {{primarily}} for anti-war protesters. During <b>the</b> 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, {{and working with the}} National Association for <b>the</b> Advancement <b>of</b> Colored People (NAACP) to decrease racism and discrimination. During <b>the</b> 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> started to engage in work combating police misconduct and supporting Native American rights. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> cases involved <b>the</b> defense <b>of</b> Communist party members and Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1940, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps. During the Cold War, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party.|$|R
5|$|The decade from 1954 to 1964 was {{the most}} {{successful}} period in <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> history. Membership rose from 30,000 to 80,000, and by 1965 it had affiliates in seventeen states. During <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> bi-annual conference in Colorado in 1964, the Supreme Court issued rulings on eight cases in which <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> was involved; <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> prevailed on seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eight. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{played a role in}} Supreme Court decisions reducing censorship of literature and arts, protecting freedom of association, prohibiting racial segregation, excluding religion from public schools, and providing due process protection to criminal suspects. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU's</b> success arose from changing public attitudes; the American populace was more educated, more tolerant, and more willing to accept unorthodox behavior.|$|R
50|$|By spring 2010, {{however, the}} LaRouche legal team, {{including}} Ben DiMuro, Nina Ginsberg, and Edward McMahonâ€”the latter two, Ginsberg and McMahon, having been members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> John Adams Projectâ€”had succeeded in disqualifying Markham {{because of his}} role as a former prosecutor. For a while Mrs. Kronberg was represented by local counsel John Bond, who bowed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case in <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> 2010 citing ill health. The case was dismissed without prejudice, and refiled by Mrs. Kronberg's third counsel, Jim DelSordo.|$|R
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against censorship {{of art and}} literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E
5|$|Leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E
5|$|When 1925 arrived â€“ {{five years}} after the ACLU was formed â€“ the {{organization}} had virtually no success to show for its efforts. That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded John T. Scopes to defy Tennessee's anti-evolution law in The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes. Clarence Darrow, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by William Jennings Bryan, contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching creationism in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{opened up}} a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, {{dedicated}} to serving Southern issues. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> progress in <b>the</b> South was due to Charles Morgan, Jr., <b>the</b> charismatic leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries (Whitus v. Georgia), desegregating prisons (Lee v. Washington), and reforming election laws. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU's</b> southern office also defended African-American congressman Julian Bond in Bond v. Floyd, when the Georgia congress refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature. Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, {{who was convicted of}} refusing to train Green Berets. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 (1974).|$|R
5|$|Voting rights â€“ <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{believes}} that impediments to voting should be eliminated, {{particularly if they}} disproportionately impact minority or poor citizens. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{believes that}} misdemeanor convictions should {{not lead to a}} loss <b>of</b> voting rights. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU's</b> Voting Rights Project leads this effort.|$|R
5|$|Birth {{control and}} {{abortion}} â€“ <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> supports <b>the</b> right to abortion, as {{established in the}} Roe v. Wade decision. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> believes that everyone should have affordable access to <b>the</b> full range <b>of</b> contraceptive options. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU's</b> Reproductive Freedom Project manages efforts related to reproductive rights.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand {{to protect the rights}} of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} ending March 31, 2014, the ACLU and the ACLU Foundation had a {{combined}} income from support and revenue of $100.4million, originating from grants (50.0%), membership donations (25.4%), donated legal services (7.6%), bequests (16.2%), and revenue (0.9%). Membership dues {{are treated as}} donations; members choose the amount they pay annually, averaging approximately $50 per member per year. In the year ending March 31, 2014, the combined expenses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> and ACLU Foundation were $133.4million, spent on programs (86.2%), management (7.4%), and fundraising (8.2%). (After factoring in other changes in net assets of +$30.9 million, from sources such as investment income, the organization had an overall decrease in net assets of $2.1 million.) Over the period from 2011 to 2014 the ACLU Foundation, on the average, has accounted for roughly 70% of the combined budget, and the ACLU roughly 30%.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed {{in a string of}} cases {{limiting}} the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home. The Gideon v. Wainwright decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in Escobedo v. Illinois, to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning. And, in 1966, Miranda v. Arizona federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to juveniles in the following year's in re Gault (1967) federal ruling. Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACLU.</b> For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers. In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, the {{department}} purchased a 14-ton armored breaching vehicle, used to smash quickly through <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> houses <b>of</b> suspects. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> questioned <b>the</b> constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. Ultimately, the California Appellate Court {{ruled that the}} vehicle was unconstitutional, violating lawful search and seizure.|$|R
