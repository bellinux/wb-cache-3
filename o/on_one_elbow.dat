5|$|St Andrew's Church {{dates from}} the 12th century with a large 15th century pinnacled {{sandstone}} tower, a Norman font and a rood screen that is the full width of the church. In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of Sutton Court together with a wooden effigy of a Knight cross-legged and leaning <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>elbow,</b> in 15th century armour, thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished.|$|E
2500|$|John Gregory Bourke's {{memoir of}} his {{service in the}} Indian wars, On the Border with Crook, {{describes}} a different account of Crazy Horse's death. He based his account on an interview with Crazy Horse's rival, Little Big Man, who was present at Crazy Horse's arrest and wounding. The interview took place over a year after Crazy Horse's death. [...] Little Big Man said that, as Crazy Horse was being escorted to the guardhouse, he suddenly pulled two knives from under his blanket and held one in each hand. One knife was reportedly fashioned from an army bayonet. Little Big Man, standing behind him, seized Crazy Horse by both elbows, pulling his arms up behind him. As Crazy Horse struggled, Little Big Man lost his grip <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>elbow,</b> and Crazy Horse drove his own knife deep into his own lower back. The guard stabbed Crazy Horse with his bayonet in the back. The chief fell and surrendered to the guards.|$|E
2500|$|Early Roman art was {{influenced}} by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring Etruscans, themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in terracotta, usually lying on top of a sarcophagus lid propped up <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>elbow</b> in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding Roman Republic began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the Parthian far east, official and patrician sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period. By the 2nd century BCE, [...] "most of the sculptors working at Rome" [...] were Greek, often enslaved in conquests such as that of Corinth (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.|$|E
30|$|We {{suggest a}} new device {{supporting}} standing-up motion using the posture of leaning <b>on</b> <b>one’s</b> <b>elbow,</b> which is familiar {{in our daily}} life. Y. Takahashi et al. [10] reported {{the development of a}} Handrail which can propel the center of gravity of Parkinson subjects forward to assist standing-up motion. The components of their system are similar to our suggested device, but they implemented inducement of the movement of standing-up motion, on the other hand, we tried to support a part of user’s weight with his <b>one</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bursitis {{normally}} develops as {{a result}} either of a single injury to the elbow (for example, a hard blow {{to the tip of}} the elbow), or perhaps more commonly due to repeated minor injuries, such as repeated leaning on the point of the elbow on a hard surface. The chance of developing bursitis is higher if one's job or hobby involves a repetitive movement (for example, tennis, golf, or even repetitive computer work involving leaning <b>on</b> <b>one's</b> <b>elbow).</b> The likelihood of developing the condition is increased as one gets older.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was known}} for {{submitting}} prisoners to punishment {{in the form of}} physical exercises, known as [...] "sport" [...] in the camp. Prisoners in quarantine were also made to do these exercises. On demand, a group of prisoners were expected to undertake any action, such as walking, singing, running, crawling <b>on</b> <b>one's</b> <b>elbows</b> and tips of the toes, roll around on the ground covered with gravel and crushed bricks, etc. Plagge was a specialist in the invention of these exercises, which were to be performed very quickly without any regard to the age and health of the prisoners. He would make prisoners run for hours while carrying his pipe between his teeth, and hit those who fell, forcing them to carry on. Prisoners nicknamed him das Pfeifchen (the little pipe).|$|R

60|$|At last, one morning, {{after more}} days had passed than Granville could {{possibly}} count, {{all of a}} sudden, in a wild whirl, he came to himself again at once, with that instant revulsion of complete awakening which often occurs {{at the end of}} long fits of delirium in malarious fever. A light burst in upon him with a flash. In a moment, his brain seemed to clear all at once, and everything to grow plain as day before him. He raised himself <b>on</b> <b>one</b> wasted <b>elbow</b> and gazed around him with profound awe. He saw it all now; he remembered everything, everything.|$|R

50|$|Coco is a fifteen DOF (degrees of freedom) quadruped with gorilla-like proportions. DOF is {{the number}} of {{independent}} conditions that define Coco's arrangement. The DOF are located all throughout the robot.
