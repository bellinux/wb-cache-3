5|$|Aboriginal {{people are}} thought to have {{inhabited}} the Riverina for at least 40,000 years. The Wiradjuri people were the original inhabitants of much of south western New South Wales including much of the Riverina region along the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan rivers. <b>Other</b> <b>groups</b> living along the Murrumbidgee included the Nari-Nari on the western plains where the town of Hay, the Muthi-Muthi along the Lowbidgee, Gurendji and the Yida-Yida of Oxley. Along both sides of the Murray River lived the Yorta Yorta people inhabiting the area of the Riverina as far east as the present day city of Albury and as far north as the Finley and Deniliquin districts. The Murray was also home to <b>other</b> <b>groups</b> such as the Bangerang, Baraba-Baraba, Wemba-Wemba, Wadi-Wadi, Dadi-Dadi and Paarkantji communities.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between group members&# 8223; session evaluations and post-session affects and group members&# 8223; attendance in interpersonal growth groups using the session evaluation questionnaire (SEQ; Stiles, 1980). To test the effect of the SEQ scores on attendance in the following session, the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) was used (Kashy & Kenny, 2000). Results from the APIM analysis were used {{to examine the effects of}} session evaluation and post-session mood data on attendance. Group member&# 8223;s positivity was related to group member&# 8223;s attendance, and <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members&# 8223; smoothness and arousal were related to <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members&# 8223; attendance. There were no significant relationships between group member&# 8223;s mood or evaluation and <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members&# 8223; attendance. <b>Other</b> <b>group</b> members&# 8223; depth, smoothness, and arousal were related to group member&# 8223;s attendance.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{research}} examining how the proportion of women and men in a group effects both the group member’s perception of group climate and the aggregated perceptions of group climate for the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. We adapted the group actor–partner interdependence model (GAPIM; Kenny & Garcia, 2012) to examine how the perception of the group’s climate by a group member and by the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members are related to the group member’s sex and the sex of the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. In addition, we examined how similar the group member’s sex was to the sex of the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members by analyzing the interaction between the two sex variables. A total of 110 Italian graduate students (96 women, 87 %; 14 men, 13 %) were studied in six 10 -session training groups. Group members filled out the Group Climate Questionnaire–Short Form after the fifth group session. Contrary to hypotheses derived from Kanter’s (Kanter, 2006) theory about the experience of tokens in groups, male group members did not perceive a more therapeutic group climate (i. e., higher engagement and lower conflict) as the proportion of women in a group decreased. There were, however, consistent and large effects for the sex composition of the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. Specifically, as the proportion of women in the group increased, both the group member and the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members perceived the group climate as more engaging and as having less conflict. In addition, a group member’s perception of group climate was positively related to the aggregated climate perceptions of the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. Additionally, group size was related to less engagement and more conflict, as rated by the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members, and less engagement, as rated by the group member. The findings suggest that the GAPIM is a useful approach for examining group composition...|$|R
