The {{paper offers}} a {{comparative}} analysis <b>of</b> dominant <b>mainstreaming</b> and gender analysis frameworks {{to consider the}} nature of the relationship between these equality initiatives and neoliberalism. We challenge the portrayal <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> as necessarily resistant to neoliberalism, and show how dominant forms <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> illustrate characteristics congruent with neoliberal premises and policy agendas. Our particular concern is the extent to which some forms <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> and gender analysis are unable to put in question neoliberal premises because of their ex post character. For this reason we describe the relationship as contested. Our goal is to identify ways to strengthen the potential <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> initiatives to step outside of and critique neoliberalism’s strategic norms. To advance this objective we offer some first steps towards producing gender analysis as an ex ante intervention. Significantly, we suggest that effective implementation requires a focus on policy’s creative (active) role in constructing “problems” and in shaping gender relations.

5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as rock and roll, a reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles were not part <b>of</b> <b>mainstream</b> music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} of instruments {{of cooperation and}} coordination is a classic policy response to rationalise public policy. We argue that <b>mainstreaming</b> is one <b>of</b> those policy instruments. Indeed, considering recent negotiations on the EU's budget, mainstreaming {{has emerged as a}} policy instrument dedicated to the rationalisation of European finances and policies. In that sense, mainstreaming can be considered as an innovative instrument, whose introduction and diffusion in different policy sectors took place when other stronger mechanisms of coordination have failed. Based on a longitudinal and a comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming,</b> its diffusion across several EU policy domains (environment, gender and urban), and its restructuring, we assume that this policy instrument has contributed to shaping this process of rationalisation. The diffusion <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> between the UN and the EU - or the international and the European arenas - is a pendulum process with back and forth movements. The policy instrument approach therefore contributes to understanding how diffusion processes progressively led to the emergence <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> at EU level as a meta-instrument and as such, as a major driving force behind the rationalisation of European finances and policies. The paper firstly starts by an analysis <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> as a policy instrument, its origins, characteristics, and instrumentation in EU policy making. On the EU side, two main sequences can be distinguished in this diffusion process towards the EU: a first moment <b>of</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming,</b> during which the actors of the development policy community play a prominent role; a second moment of systematisation and diffusion of the instrument in new policy sectors, during which the link with "new governance" is central. Secondly, taking mainstreaming as the independent variable, we look at its effect in three policy sectors. The paper shows that policy mainstreaming has been introduced by the Commission as a meta instrument in the sense of Hood (i. e. definition) to rationalise a policy domain, leading to the marginalisation of the policy domain, not to enhance the political priority hence our analysis <b>of</b> policy <b>mainstreaming</b> as a hero of lost cause...|$|R

He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E

5|$|A style more melodic {{and more}} akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally {{represented}} during the NWOBHM.

After {{the peak of the}} movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that <b>of</b> <b>mainstream</b> American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{established}} parliamentary contexts highlight institutional barriers to <b>mainstreaming</b> equality <b>of</b> opportunity in public policy-making.

It assesses progress in applying the participative-democratic model <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> to policy-making. The findings – based upon analysis of legislative proceedings and equality and human rights organisations' accounts – reveal that ‘system openness’ has afforded opportunities to engage in – and influence – policy work. Yet, problems and shortcomings are also identified – signifying a ‘disconnect’ between the rhetoric and reality <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> at the meso-level – and continuity with the pre-existing policy style in UK governance. The wider significance of this is that potential gains afforded by the adoption <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> in legislative settings purposively designed to foster the engagement of exogenous interests can be negated by leadership issues and government failure to secure the full range of pre-requisites prescribed by mainstreaming theory...|$|R

Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part <b>of</b> <b>mainstream</b> psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible.

5|$|Morris became {{increasingly}} {{fascinated with the}} idyllic Medievalist depictions of rural life {{which appeared in the}} paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites, and spent large sums of money purchasing such artworks. Burne-Jones shared this interest, but took it further by becoming an apprentice to one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters, Dante Gabriel Rossetti; the three soon became close friends. Through Rossetti, Morris came to associate with poet Robert Browning, and the artists Arthur Hughes, Thomas Woolner, and Ford Madox Brown. Tired of architecture, Morris abandoned his apprenticeship, with Rossetti persuading him to take up painting instead, which he chose to do in the Pre-Raphaelite style. Morris aided Rossetti and Burne-Jones in painting the Arthurian murals at Oxford Union, although his contributions were widely deemed inferior and unskilled compared to those of the others. At Rossetti's recommendation, Morris and Burne-Jones moved in together to the flat at Bloomsbury's No. 17 Red Lion Square by November 1856. Morris designed and commissioned furniture for the flat in a Medieval style, much of which he painted with Arthurian scenes in a direct rejection <b>of</b> <b>mainstream</b> artistic tastes.|$|E

Firstly, secondary research examines issues such as history, development, advantages and challenges <b>of</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> <b>of</b> FT.
