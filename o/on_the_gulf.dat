In mainland Mexico, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for coastal areas of Sonora between Cabo Lobos and Puerto Penasco.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico from {{southern}} Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane watches and warnings for the Gulf Coast of the United States beginning at 13:00 UTC on August 24.

The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city.

In a night attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth's port <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day.
