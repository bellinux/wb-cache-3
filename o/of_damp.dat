5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments <b>of</b> <b>damp,</b> ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} dynamic {{studies of}} oak scantlings and glued-up panels. The scheme of sawing of scantlings in a log is presented and their coefficient <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> is determined. Distribution regularities of the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> in a log, estimated along {{and across the}} grain, are provided. It was found, that the highest coefficient <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> along the grain is in the buttlog (0. 0265 – 0. 0266), while the lowest – in the top end (about 0. 0263). The regularity <b>of</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> variation across the grain is different – the highest is {{at the ends of}} a log (0. 0306 – 0. 0330), while in the centre – the lowest (0. 0304 – 0. 0315). The influence <b>of</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> <b>of</b> scantlings on panel coefficient <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> was estimated.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the study <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> as a {{possible}} measure for mitigating fatigue. It involves the experimental characterisation of thin aluminium alloy cantilever beams as representatives of flexible structures. The beams are treated with Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) to produce dense, polycrystalline alumina coatings on the surface. These coated beams are then subjected to dynamic testing to assess the level <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> introduced by the coatings. This measurement <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> sheds light {{on the role of}} the microstructure of the coating in damping and how to optimize damping from the PEO process. Higher level <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> is desirable as it attenuates the level of stress in the substrate, leading to higher fatigue life. Simple numerical and experimental method shows that PEO coatings can be a viable method <b>of</b> <b>damping.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{apparent}} that the dynamic response of a building depends on its energy dissipation capacity, hence damping ratio. The damping value experienced by a building during an earthquake differs significantly from the value specified in the design step. This introduces uncertainties in the design process of the building.

In this paper, the effects of uncertainties in the estimation <b>of</b> <b>damping</b> ratio ξ, on the use <b>of</b> <b>Damping</b> Reduction Factors (DRF) for the evaluation <b>of</b> high <b>damping</b> response spectra, are examined.

25|$|Moisture may ascend into a {{building}} from {{the foundation of a}} wall or gain ingress into {{a building}} from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a solid wall. The manifest result of this process is called damp. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low courses of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method <b>of</b> <b>damp</b> proofing appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. The efficacy of this means of keeping out damp is more limited by the permeability of the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks, than by that of the bricks themselves.|$|E
25|$|The horrea of Rome and its port, Ostia, stood two or {{more stories}} high. They were built with ramps, rather than staircases, to provide {{easy access to the}} upper floors.

Many horrea appear to have served as great trading areas with rows of small shops (tabernae) off a central courtyard; some may have been fairly elaborate, perhaps serving as the equivalent of modern shopping arcades. Others, such as those in Ostia, dispensed with the courtyard and instead had rows of tabernae standing back-to-back. In the Middle East, horrea took a very different design with a single row of very deep tabernae, all opening onto the same side; this reflected an architectural style that was widely followed in the region's palaces and temple complexes, well before the arrival of the Romans.|$|E
