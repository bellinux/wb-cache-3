5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E

5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen and ink and <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> canvas. His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
5|$|Look Mickey (also {{known as}} Look Mickey!) is a 1961 <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> canvas {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein.

The painting was bequeathed to the Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art upon Lichtenstein's death.|$|E

5|$|The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} Drawing Room. It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> attackers.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{cutaway model}} of Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna. The model is at {{a scale of}} 1:25 and has a total length of 6 metres. It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight {{craftsmen}} of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. The model is true to the original in structure, layout, and engine system. It is accurate to the point that, for instance, the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly replicates the original not only in subject {{but also in the}} painting technique (<b>oil</b> <b>on</b> canvas).|$|E

5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard {{stated in}} his eighteen-page after-action {{report that he}} had {{intended}} to force the submarine to surface {{so that it could}} be attacked by the surface vessels' guns. He reported that his vessel had seen <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> the surface, though the PC-815 took no samples, and asserted that the blimps had seen air bubbles, oil and a periscope, though the blimps' own reports did not corroborate this. No wreckage was seen, despite the heavy depth-charging. The PC-815 sustained some minor damage and three crew were injured during the incident when the ship's radio antenna was accidentally hit by gunfire. At midnight on 21 May, with depth charges exhausted and the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by any other ship, PC-815 was ordered back to Astoria.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Walter Skinner tells agent Dana Scully {{that the}} FBI's {{investigation}} into her sister's murder {{has been made}} inactive, despite the evidence that had been recovered. Fox Mulder tells Scully about the Piper Maru, which had laid anchor at the same coordinates as another ship believed to have salvaged a UFO; when the Piper Maru came to port in San Diego, her crew was found suffering from radiation burns. Aboard the ship, the agents find traces of the black <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> Gauthier's diving suit. Upon viewing a video of the dive, Scully identifies the sunken plane as a P-51 Mustang. Meanwhile, Gauthier returns home and searches for something. When his wife Joan arrives, the black oil passes itself along to her.|$|E
