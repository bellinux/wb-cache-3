5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biology.|$|E

40|$|Economists {{long have}} {{employed}} evolutionary language and metaphors to characterize economic change, but until recently have largely eschewed the expression <b>of</b> explicit <b>evolutionary</b> theories. Over the last decade, however, a number <b>of</b> explicit <b>evolutionary</b> theories {{have been developed}} by economists, and other social scientists. This essay discusses the general analytic art form, and summarizes and discusses {{a number of the}} particular models. In the light of those examples, it evaluates the strengths and weaknesses <b>of</b> explicit <b>evolutionary</b> theorizing as an approach to understanding economic change. ...|$|R
50|$|Phylogenetics is {{the study}} <b>of</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> {{relatedness}} <b>of</b> organisms. Laboratory phylogenetics {{is the study}} <b>of</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> relatedness <b>of</b> laboratory-evolved organisms. An advantage of laboratory phylogenetics is the exact <b>evolutionary</b> history <b>of</b> an organism is known, rather than estimated {{as is the case}} for most organisms.|$|R
5|$|In 1950, the German {{paleontologist}} Otto Schindewolf {{argued that}} variation tends {{to move in}} a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.|$|E

5|$|This {{synthesis}} cemented {{natural selection}} {{as the foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> theory, where it remains today. A second synthesis was brought about {{at the end of}} the 20th century by advances in molecular genetics, creating the field <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> developmental biology ("evo-devo"), which seeks to explain the evolution of form in terms of the genetic regulatory programs which control the development of the embryo at molecular level. Natural selection is here understood to act on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.|$|E
5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standardsâ€”that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with the very nature <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E
5|$|A {{major step}} forward {{in the study of}} {{bacteria}} came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> descent from bacteria. This new phylogenetic taxonomy depended on the sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA, and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the three-domain system.|$|E

5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to}} communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E
5|$|Attempts at {{crossing}} species, whether from different sections or {{within the same}} section, of Erythranthe are not always successful.

5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication occurs when a gene undergoes duplication to form a tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{philosophers}} {{of biology}} have debated the status <b>of</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> process: is it deterministic or indeterministic?

In other words, I maintain that the appropriate stand to take towards the question of the determinism <b>of</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> process is agnosticism. I then suggest that an examination of the phenomenon of developmental noise might yield a solution to the problem...|$|R
5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution do not address the findings <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biology (see straw man argument). This also means that advocates of creationism and evolutionary biologists often simply speak past each other.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena <b>of</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
