5|$|As Duckworth {{gathered}} his squadron, Northumberlands mainmast collapsed across the deck, causing severe {{damage to the}} ship's fittings. Although Cochrane's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: Superbs men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas was out <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> Donegal had lost one of her topmasts. Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet, with Northumberland and Spencer suffering the worst and Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.|$|E

5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration {{as he crossed}} the finish line. The car went out <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers to race on race day even if they do not use the same car.|$|E
5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But {{in other}} respects, {{they were a}} dismal failure. They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn out <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in {{anything more than a}} flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E

5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Rom√©o Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with an appearance <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> confidence. Lewis MacKenzie {{compared to a}} 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning logic that all sides were, at least, partly responsible for the conflict. Louise Arbour is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT-like arrests.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the morning}} of August 9 General Vandegrift advised Admiral Turner that he needed more {{supplies}} unloaded from the transports before they withdrew. Therefore, Turner postponed the withdrawal of his ships until mid-afternoon. In the meantime, Astorias crew tried to save their sinking ship. Astorias fires, however, eventually became completely out <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> the ship sank at 12:15.|$|E

Due {{to the nature of}} Madagascar's geology and soil, tavy also depletes the fertility of the soil, accelerating the crop rotation rate and necessitating expansion into primary forests.|$|E

5|$|Obsidian is an action-adventure {{computer}} {{game for the}} Amstrad CPC personal computer published by Artic Computing in 1986. The game is set on the titular space station located within the centre of an asteroid, which is out <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> drifting towards a black hole. The player must guide an astronaut with a jet pack around the station and re-activate its engine shields to prevent the Obsidian's destruction. This involves collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, while avoiding the Obsidian's reactivated security systems.|$|E

Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but {{from that point on}} he was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move. In fact, during his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Comet's {{avionics}} {{systems were}} new to civil aviation. One such feature was irreversible powered flight controls, which increased the pilot's ease <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> {{the safety of}} the aircraft by preventing aerodynamic forces from changing the directed positions and placement of the aircraft's control surfaces. Additionally, a large number of the control surfaces, such as the elevators, were equipped with a complex gearing system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges.|$|E

5|$|South Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2014 {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Obsidian Entertainment {{in collaboration with}} South Park Digital Studios and published by Ubisoft. Based on the American adult animated television series South Park, the game follows the New Kid, who has moved to the eponymous town and becomes involved in an epic role-play fantasy war involving humans, wizards, and elves, who are fighting {{for control of the}} all-powerful Stick of Truth. Their game quickly escalates out <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> brings them into conflict with aliens, Nazi zombies, and gnomes, threatening the entire town with destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} caused by a hunter's illegal fire that got out <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> it was named for its {{proximity}} to the Rim of the World vista point, a scenic overlook on Highway 120 leading up to Yosemite. A total of eleven residences, three commercial structures, and 98 outbuildings were destroyed in the fire. A total of ten injuries from the wildfire were also reported, but no firefighters were killed during the suppression efforts which cost more than $127 million (2013 USD).|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} medias res with Walker, Adams, and Lugo flying in a {{helicopter}} past the skyscrapers of Dubai, shooting down several pursuing helicopters until a sudden sandstorm forms, causing one of the pursuers to spin out <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> crash into the trio. The story then jumps back to the start, with Delta traversing the storm wall {{to the outskirts of}} a mostly buried Dubai, being taunted on broadcasts by the Radioman (Jake Busey), a DJ and former journalist speaking for the 33rd. After coming across refugees being rounded up by the 33rd and engaging in a firefight, Walker elects to disobey orders and find Konrad.|$|E

5|$|The {{search and}} rescue response, crash {{recovery}} operation, and investigation by the Government of Canada took over four years and cost CAD 57 million (at that time approximately US$38 million).
