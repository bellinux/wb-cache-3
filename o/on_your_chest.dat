6000|$|You once--only once--gave {{the world}} {{assurance}} of a waistcoat. You wore it, sir, I think, in [...] "Money." [...] It {{was a remarkable}} and precious waistcoat, wherein certain broad stripes of blue or purple disported themselves as {{by a combination of}} extraordinary circumstances, too happy to occur again. I have seen it <b>on</b> <b>your</b> manly <b>chest</b> in private life. I saw it, sir, I think, the other day in the cold light of morning--with feelings easier to be imagined than described. Mr. Macready, sir, are you a father? If so, lend me that waistcoat for five minutes. I am bidden to a wedding (where fathers are made), and my artist cannot, I find (how should he?), imagine such a waistcoat. Let me show it to him as a sample of my tastes and wishes; and--ha, ha, ha, ha!--eclipse the bridegroom! ...|$|R

60|$|There {{you dream}} that an {{elephant}} has suddenly sat down <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> {{and that the}} volcano has exploded and thrown you {{down to the bottom}} of the sea—the elephant still sleeping peacefully on your bosom.

Your first impression is that the end of the world has come; and then you think that this cannot be, and that it is thieves and murderers, or else fire, and this opinion you express in the usual method. No help comes, however, and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you, and you are being smothered.|$|E

A flash, a roar--a mad reeling of the senses, and crimson clouds flitting before your eyes--a horrible pain in your ears, a sense of oppression <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> and the knowledge that you are not on your feet--a whispering of voices blending with the concert in your ears--a darkness before your eyes--and you feel yourself plump up against the padding, whither you have been thrown by the violence of the concussion.|$|E
