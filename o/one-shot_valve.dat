The plunger is {{released by the}} electrical melting of a fuse link and pierces the valve seal. The valve lowers fluid pressure in a container without losing the contained fluid...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{introduce}} two novel concepts for fluid handling in microfluidic systems and show their realization in micromachined test structures: a one-shot micropump and a normally open <b>one-shot</b> <b>valve.</b> Both principles use Expancel ® microspheres, which are small spherical plastic particles that, when heated, increase their volume {{by a factor of}} about 60. The expansion is irreversible, i. e. when cooled again, the expandable microspheres do not shrink...|$|E
40|$|International audienceValving is {{essential}} to microflow circuits and networks in microsystem technology. Many different types of valves have been designed and fabricated. Membranes of sacrificial material have already been designed for <b>one-shot</b> <b>valving.</b> However, the new design proposed here, based on sacrificial micro-membranes with embedded electrodes, has the advantages of being efficient, easily controllable and requiring very low energy levels. We have shown that a 100 µm × 100 µm × 500 nm Si 3 N 4 membrane with a platinum electrode can be actuated to break up with an energy input of only 6 µJ, during an actuation time of 200 µs. At rest, {{in the absence of}} actuation, such membranes can withstand a pressure of 1 bar. The goal of the development of such membranes is to hydrodynamically connect, one by one, a series of initially isolated micro-chambers implemented in a silicon chip...|$|R

This review analyzes possible scenarios that trigger such hazards before proceeding to discuss safety mechanisms such as pressure release <b>valves,</b> <b>one-shot</b> fuses, reversible and irreversible positive temperature coefficient elements, shutdown separators, chemical shuttles, non-flammable electrolytes and coatings...|$|R
40|$|Imagine if {{you could}} combine the power and {{capabilities}} ofan entire laboratory {{in the palm of}} your hand. Advances inmicrofluidic chip technology promise to integrate andminiaturize multiple lab processes into a single palm-sizeddevice. The advantages of these lab-on-a-chip devices,sometimes also referred to as micro total analysis systems(µTAS), compared with conventional bench-scale systems arenumerous and wide ranging and include: less reagentconsumption, low manufacturing costs, increased performance,faster analysis, high sample throughput, integration andautomation possibilities, and disposability. However,microfluidic devices also present challenges such as theinterfacing to the macro world and detection limits. In this thesis the focus has been to develop novel discretemicrofluidic components for biotechnology and organic chemicalapplications with the goal to integrate them to formlab-on-chips. A flow-through filter-chamber device has beendesigned, manufactured and evaluated for chemical analysis onbeads. Passive liquid handling has been integrated on the chipin the form of hydrophobic valves at the inlet channels. Anarray format has also been developed to allow parallel analysisof multiple samples. The filter-chamber functions well forsingle nucleotide analysis using pyrosequencing. Initialevaluations on catalyst screening in the filter-chamber devicehas been performed. The suitability of valve-less micropumps for biochemicalapplications is presented. Fluids encountered in variousbiochemical methods, including living cells, that areproblematic for other micropumps have been pumped with goodperformance. This thesis also introduces expandablemicrospheres as a novel component in microfluidics includingapplications such as <b>one-shot</b> <b>valves,</b> micropositioning andsurface enlargement. A novel technique for bead immobilization in microfluidicdevices based on surface chemistry is presented in this thesis. Beads for both biochemical assays and organic chemistry havebeen self-sorted and self-assembled in line patterns as narrowas 5 µm on both structured and unstructured substrates. This method will greatly facilitate the generation of screeningplatforms, for example. To develop a microfluidic device for catalysis-on-chip,ligands for asymmetric catalysis have successfully beenimmobilized in silicon channels by consecutive microcontactprinting, which is a novel technique presented in thisthesis.
