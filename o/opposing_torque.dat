The purpose of such analysis is threefold: first, when considering a rectangular container, to determine the relationship between the angle at which it balances and the amount of fluid in the container; second, to consider a massless analogue to a standard twelve-ounce aluminum can which balances at a fixed angle and observe the interplay between the various parameters of that container 2 ̆ 7 s geometry and balance; and finally, to revisit the aluminum can model, this time considering its mass relative to the fluid 2 ̆ 7 s, and recover the familiar behavior observed when balancing real-world beverages in aluminum cans...|$|R
5000|$|The pointer shaft is held toward zero by a fine torsion spring. The torque on the cup {{increases}} {{with the speed}} of rotation of the magnet. Thus an increase in the speed of the car will twist the cup and speedometer pointer against the spring. The cup and pointer will turn until the torque of the eddy currents on the cup is balanced by the <b>opposing</b> <b>torque</b> of the spring, and then stop. Given the torque on the cup is proportional to the car's speed, and the spring's deflection is proportional to the torque, the angle of the pointer is also proportional to the speed, so that equally spaced markers on the dial can be used for gaps in speed. At a given speed the pointer will remain motionless and pointing to the appropriate number on the speedometer's dial.|$|E
5000|$|... {{muscles are}} simply the muscles that produce an {{opposing}} joint torque to the agonist muscles. [...] This torque can aid in controlling a motion. The <b>opposing</b> <b>torque</b> can slow movement down - {{especially if it}} was a ballistic movement. For example, during a very rapid (ballistic) discrete movement of the elbow, such as throwing a dart, the triceps muscles will be activated very briefly and strongly (in a [...] "burst") to rapidly accelerate the extension movement at the elbow, followed almost immediately by a [...] "burst" [...] of activation to the elbow flexor muscles that decelerates the elbow movement to arrive at a quick stop. To use an automotive analogy, this is like pressing your gas pedal rapidly and then immediately pressing the brake. Antagonism is not an intrinsic property of a particular muscle or muscle group; it is a role that a muscle plays depending on which muscle is currently the agonist. During slower joint actions that involve gravity, just as with the agonist muscle (mentioned above), the antagonist muscle can shorten AND lengthen. Using the example above of the triceps brachii during a push-up, the elbow flexor muscles are the antagonists at the elbow during both the up phase and down phase of the movement. And, during the dumbbell curl the elbow extensors are the antagonists for both the lifting and lowering phases.|$|E

40|$|The {{improvement}} of the helicopter torque control system is discussed. At low to medium forward speeds helicopter performance {{is limited by the}} effectiveness of the means for counteracting main rotor torque and controlling sideslip airloads. These problems may be overcome by mounting strakes on the aft fuselage section. For single rotor helicopters whose main rotor rotates counter-clockwise as viewed from above, one of the strakes would be mounted in the upper lefthand quadrant and the second in the lower left hand quadrant. The strakes alter the air flow around the fuselage by separating the flow so as to produce lateral airloads on the tail boom which <b>oppose</b> main-rotor <b>torque.</b> The upper strake operates in a right crosswind to <b>oppose</b> main rotor <b>torque,</b> and the lower strake has effect in left crosswinds.

40|$|Synchronous binary asteroids {{may exist}} in a {{long-term}} stable equilibrium, where the <b>opposing</b> <b>torques</b> from mutual body tides and the binary YORP (BYORP) effect cancel. Interior of this equilibrium, mutual body tides are stronger than the BYORP effect and the mutual orbit semi-major axis expands to the equilibrium; outside of the equilibrium, the BYORP effect dominates the evolution and the system semi-major axis will contract to the equilibrium. If the observed population of small (0. 1 - 10 km diameter) synchronous binaries are in static configurations that are no longer evolving, then this would be confirmed by a null result in the observational tests for the BYORP effect. The confirmed existence of this equilibrium combined with a shape model of the secondary of the system enables the direct study of asteroid geophysics through the tidal theory. The observed synchronous asteroid population cannot exist in this equilibrium if described by the canonical "monolithic" geophysical model. The "rubble pile" geophysical model proposed by Goldreich 2009 is sufficient, however it predicts a tidal Love number directly proportional to the radius of the asteroid, while the best fit to the data predicts a tidal Love number inversely proportional to the radius. This deviation from the canonical and Goldreich 2009 models motivates future study of asteroid geophysics. Ongoing BYORP detection campaigns will determine whether these systems are in an equilibrium, and future determination of secondary shapes will allow direct determination of asteroid geophysical parameters.

40|$|FO-ATP synthase (FO) is a {{rotary motor}} that {{converts}} potential energy from ions, usually protons, moving from high- to low-potential {{sides of a}} membrane into torque and rotary motion. Here we propose a mechanism whereby electric fields emanating from the proton entry and exit channels act on asymmetric charge distributions in the c-ring, due to protonated and deprotonated sites, and drive it to rotate. The model predicts a scaling between time-averaged torque and proton motive force, which can be hindered by mutations that adversely affect the channels. The torque created by the c-ring of FO drives the c-subunit to rotate within the ATP-producing complex (F 1) overcoming, {{with the aid of}} thermal fluctuations, an <b>opposing</b> <b>torque</b> that rises and falls with angular position.

We demonstrate how the developed theory is able to explain the large rolling forces and particle-size dependence observed experimentally. Good agreement with experimental results is achieved for adhesion hysteresis values of (Δγ/γ) sime 3 for polystyrene, and (Δγ/γ) sime 0. 5 for silicates, at crack propagation rates of 0. 1 µm s− 1 and 1 - 10 µm s− 1, respectively...|$|E

The velocity field across the turbine has been obtained at λ= 0 and λ= 0. 4 and has highlighted the presence of a jet flow passing through the central core of the turbine as it exits the rotor assembly.

40|$|Background: It is {{estimated}} that nearly 6 % of youth baseball participants seek medical attention for injuries sustained during play. Most injuries are overuse injuries, and 26 % are to the shoulder or upper arm. By quantifying youth pitching biomechanics, knowledge can be gained concerning {{the manner in which}} these injuries are sustained during play. Methods: Sixteen healthy right hand-dominant baseball pitchers participated in this study. After digitization of 21 bony landmarks, kinematic calculations were conducted using the 3 -dimensional coordinates from each video frame. Data were time normalized, forcing major temporal components of the movement to occur at specific intervals. Segment-based reference frames were established, and resultant joint kinetics were projected onto each reference frame. Kinetic data were normalized and calculated along or about the anterior/posterior, medial/lateral, and proximal/distal axes. Results: Maximum trunk rotation and external shoulder rotation were observed during arm cocking. Each of the remaining kinematic parameters peaked after ball release. All maximum values for joint kinetics were measured during arm cocking with the exception of compressive forces experienced at the shoulder and elbow, which peaked after the instant of ball release. Conclusions: Data produced in this study indicate that youth pitchers initiate trunk rotation early in the movement, which can lead to shoulder hyperangulation. <b>Opposing</b> <b>torques</b> {{at each end of the}} humerus also produce a large net torque about the longitudinal axis of the humerus during late arm cocking and may increase humeral retrotorsion in youth pitchers. Underdeveloped musculature in the rotator cuff may lead to difficulty controlling throwing-arm deceleration, causing an increase in horizontal adduction across the torso. Clinical Relevance: An improved understanding of youth pitching mechanics is gained from the data collected, analyzed, and discussed in this study. Through increases in the knowledge pertaining specifically to the mechanics of youth pitchers, the opportunity to develop pitching mechanics specifically designed for preventing injuries in little league pitchers arises.

50|$|The two {{sections}} of chain carrying the single pulley exert <b>opposing</b> and unequal <b>torques</b> on the connected pulleys, such {{that only the}} difference of these torques has to be compensated manually by pulling the loose part of the chain.This leads to a mechanical advantage: the force needed to lift a load is {{only a fraction of}} the load's weight. At the same time, the distance the load is lifted is smaller than the length of chain pulled by the same factor. This factor (the mechanical advantage MA) depends on the relative difference of the radii r and R of the connected pulleys:The effect on the forces and distances (see figure) is quantitatively:The difference in radii can be made very small, making the mechanical advantage of this pulley system very large.In the extreme case of zero difference in radii, MA becomes infinite, thus no force (besides friction) is needed to move the chain, but moving the chain will no longer lift the load.|$|R
40|$|When a chiral dopant is {{dissolved}} in an achiral liquid crystal medium, the whole sample organizes into a helical structure with a characteristic length-scale {{of the order}} of microns. The relation between chirality at these quite different length-scales can be rationalized by a relatively simple model, which retains the relevant factors coming into play: the molecular shape of the chiral dopant, which controls the chirality of short range intermolecular interactions, and the elastic properties of the nematic environment, which control the restoring <b>torques</b> <b>opposing</b> distortion of the director. In this tutorial review the relation between molecular and phase chirality will be reviewed and several applications of the chiral doping of nematic LCs will be discussed. These range from the exploitation of the amplified molecular chirality for stereochemical purposes (e. g., the determination of the absolute configuration or the enantiomeric excess), to newer applications in physico–chemical fields. The latter take advantage of the periodicity of the chiral field, with length-scales ranging from hundreds to thousands of nanometres, which characterise the cholesteric phase...|$|R
40|$|Viscous {{shear stress}} of {{a ring of}} {{particles}} in orbit about a planet due to the radial gradient of orbital velocity is discussed. This stress tends to spread the ring with time. At low optical depth (t) and at high t, the shear stress is an increasing function of t. In the intermediate range stress may decrease with increasing t, leading to a diffusive instability which tends to break an initially uniform ring into ringlets {{of high and low}} optical depths. According to the shepherd satellite model of narrow ring confinement, the viscous shear stress is <b>opposed</b> by tidal <b>torques</b> from neighboring shepherds, so that radial spreading does not occur. By requiring that the gradient of the viscous shear stress (i. e., angular momentum deposited) be equal to the shepherd satellite torque density at all radii in the rings, equilibrium radial density profiles of a confined ring were constructed. The most noteworthy feature of these profiles is a narrow, high density ringlet surrounded by a low optical density halo of greater width...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{symbols in}} the above Abstract field do not display correctly. Please see the attached 'Skinner Thesis Abstract. docx' for the full abstractThis thesis describes the control of magnetisation dynamics using electricity. Direct electrical control of magnetisation is desirable {{for the development of}} efficient scalable magnetic memories. In materials with broken inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling, electrical current can exert a torque on a local magnetisation. In the studies presented here, a microwave current-induced ferromagnetic resonance (spin-orbit FMR) technique is used to characterise the dynamical magnetic properties and to determine the symmetries of the spin-orbit torques of ferromagnetic layers with broken inversion symmetry. Ultra-thin ferromagnetic/heavy metal bilayers have recently become an important area of study in spintronics. Magnetic torques originating from the spin-Hall effect and a Rashba spin-orbit field have both been reported in these materials. These spin-orbit torques may allow commercialisation of magnetic random access memories with higher efficiency than previous technologies. However, the exact origin of the torques is still not well understood. In the first study of this thesis, dynamic pumping of spin current induced by an external waveguide is used to investigate the dependence of the inverse spin-Hall effect in Co/Pt on the magnet thickness. An enhancement of the inverse-spin Hall effect is seen in devices with the thinnest cobalt layers which can not be explained by a conventional understanding of the spin-Hall effect. In the second study, spin-orbit FMR is used to identify the symmetries of the current-induced torques in the same Co/Pt layers. Anti-damping and field-like torque symmetries are identified, consistent in thicker cobalt layers with origins from the spin-Hall effect and an Oersted field respectively. In thinner cobalt layers, an additional field-like <b>torque</b> <b>opposing</b> the Oersted <b>torque</b> appears, consistent with a Rashba origin. (Ga,Mn) As is a dilute magnetic semiconductor with a record highest Curie temperature of around 180 K. At low temperatures, large spin-orbit torques with a Dresselhaus symmetry are known to exist in the material. In the final study of the thesis, spin-orbit FMR measurements demonstrate that the broken symmetry of unannealed Ga(0. 03) Mn(0. 97) As can generate torques with the same Dresselhaus symmetry in an adjacent iron layer at room temperature. This enables the spin-orbit torque to be distinguished from the torque due to the spin-Hall effect by symmetry...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to advance our {{understanding}} {{in the area of}} neural adaptation to strength training. Current evidence has yet to establish the precise nature of this adaptation. The thesis comprises a series of reviews and experimental chapters that consider the idea that neural adaptation to strength training may share similar mechanisms to some forms of motor learning (i. e. use-dependent learning). For strength to increase by neural mechanisms, the nervous system must act by increasing neural drive to the agonist and/or synergist muscles that contribute to torque and/or inhibit neural drive to antagonist muscles that <b>oppose</b> <b>torque</b> in the desired direction. This process is similar to some forms of motor learning whereby neural connectivity for the desired movement is strengthened. A wealth of information about neural responses to single-session training paradigms is available in the motor learning literature. Chapter 2 therefore provides a brief review of motor learning paradigms that could be incorporated into research on strength training, including the mechanisms identified. This section concludes by providing a conceptual framework for early neural responses to training, highlighting the types of adaptation that are likely to occur and how this should contribute to long term adaptation and ultimately strength gains. The first experimental chapter (chapter 3) addresses a methodological issue (cross-talk) that could affect the findings of studies subsequently reported in the thesis and other studies using non-invasive stimulation techniques (i. e. transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and reflex studies). Cross-talk occurs when electromyographic signals generated by non-target muscles are recorded from electrodes intended to pick up signals from a specific target muscle. This chapter revealed that cross-talk can be large between muscles of the forearm and hand and provided a solution by designing a systematic method {{that can be used to}} quantify cross-talk during standard recording conditions. This method can also be used to identify cross-nerve stimulation. Chapter 4 examined whether strength training causes rapid adaptation to corticospinal responsiveness by assessing changes to the direction of twitches evoked by TMS, which are the result of the overall output of force produced by multiple muscles. Following the detection of baseline TMS-evoked twitch direction, a single session of strength training was conducted involving maximal force production 90 o away from the baseline direction. After training there was a shift in TMS-evoked twitches towards the training direction. This outcome occurred for all three training conditions that required maximal neural drive but varied in the rate of force development and contraction duration [i. e. rapid (ballistic) or ballistic sustained or slow, sustained contractions]. The strongest effect was found when the training program incorporated both ballistic and sustained contractions. Since no change occurred at the muscle level, this change was attributed to the adaptation of the nervous system that strengthens the neural networks in favour of the training direction. This change was also similar in characteristics to that previously found in ballistic motor learning, suggesting the possible involvement of similar neural mechanisms. Chapter 5 revealed that strength training (ballistic sustained contraction) also produced a shift in the direction of voluntary force production towards the training direction in a low-force isometric aiming task. The shift occurred even for targets that were distant (at least + 90 o) from the training direction. This suggests that early neural adaptation to strength training causes an aiming bias that generalises broadly to affect movements for a wide range of directions. A second part of this study showed that the aiming bias occurred towards the training direction defined in extrinsic space rather than muscle space. This information was revealed by performing strength training in a 90 o pronated forearm posture, whereas the low-force aiming task was performed in a neutral forearm posture. The shift in aiming was towards the training direction defined in extrinsic space, even for targets where this resulted in errors away from the pulling direction of the trained muscles in the alternative posture. It was concluded that a strengthening of neural networks had occurred for neurons that code movement direction in extrinsic space. Finally, the experiment also showed that strong neural drive was necessary to induce this change since low force contractions showed no bias towards the training direction as those found with high force contractions. In summary, the work described in this thesis provides evidence of neural adaptation to strength training as early as after a single session of training. This adaptation was found to be similar to those identified in some forms of motor learning. The research adds to understanding of neural responses to strength training by showing that the nervous system can learn to produce high force more effectively, through the strengthening of neural networks in favour of the training direction in extrinsic space. The rapid and transient changes revealed are thought to be a necessary step that precedes more long term neural adaptation that ultimately enhances strength...|$|R
5000|$|The first monster truck {{ever built}} was {{a pickup truck}} that was {{modified}} with a larger suspension and larger tires. Today, trucks now have custom built tubular chassis, with four-link suspension to provide up to 4-feet of clearance and they also now have fiberglass bodies that go onto the chassis separately and {{are designed to be}} easily removed and easily replaced when damaged. Mounted just behind the driver on most trucks are the engines, which are typically supercharged and run on methanol, an alcohol and corn-based oil, and have displacement up to 575 cubic inches (9.42 L). Axles are mostly taken from either heavy-duty military trucks or road vehicles like school buses, and are modified to have a planetary gear reduction at the hub to help turn the tires. All trucks have hydraulic steering in both the front and the rear (four wheel steering), with the front wheels controlled by the steering wheel and the rear wheels by a toggle switch. The tires are typically [...] "Terra" [...] tires used on fertilizer spreaders, and have measurements of 66″×43″×25″ (1.7×1.1×0.6 m). Most trucks utilize a modified and/or custom designed automatic transmission, such as a Turbo 400, Powerglide, Ford C6 transmission, or a Torque-flite 727. A limited number of trucks utilize a Lenco transmission, which traces its roots to drag racing. Most of the automatic transmissions are heavily modified with transbrakes, manual valve bodies, and heavy duty gear sets. Trucks running a Lenco use a centrifugal clutch as <b>opposed</b> to a <b>torque</b> converter, which are used in automatic transmissions. Lenco transmissions are usually found in two-speed or three speed configurations, and are commonly shifted using compressed CO2.|$|R
40|$|This {{story begins}} in the 1970 s, when Dr. Joseph Heyman, a young {{scientist}} at NASA s Langley Research Center, was asked to support the investigation of a wind tunnel accident at a sister center. Although the work was outside of his physics background, it sparked a research focus that guided his lengthy NASA career and would earn him a slew of accolades, including NASA s highest award medals for Exceptional Leadership, Exceptional Achievement, and Exceptional Service; the coveted Silver Snoopy Astronaut Award for Space Shuttle Return to Flight; and the Arthur Fleming Award for {{being one of the}} Top Ten Federal Scientists in Government Service. He won 30 additional NASA awards, including the Agency s Invention of the Year and the Agency s highest award for technology transfer, and was the only person to ever win 4 R&D 100 Awards. Back in 1973, though, Heyman was a young civil servant with a background in physics who was asked to sit on an accident review panel. The panel met at Ames Research Center, in Moffet Field, California, and after considerable investigation, concluded that a high-pressure pebble heater used for heating gas had failed, due to improperly tightened bolts in a 1, 000 -pound gate valve control section. The accident showered the facility with incendiary ceramic spheres and nearly a ton of metal, but, luckily, caused no injuries. Heyman returned to Langley and began work on a solution. He developed an ultrasonic device that would measure bolt elongation, as <b>opposed</b> to <b>torque,</b> the factor typically measured in testing bolt preload or tension. Torque measurement can lead to load errors, with miscalculations as high as 80 percent that can be passed over during installation. Bolt stretch, however, is nearly always accurate to 1 percent or better. Within 1 month, he had an acoustic resonance solution that accurately determined bolt elongation. He assumed his work on this project had ended, but it was actually the start of nearly 15 years of work perfecting, improving, inventing, and modifying the "bolt monitor", all the while, filing numerous patents, presenting papers, and holding demonstrations as the technology matured. Industry engineers challenged Heyman s inventiveness, and reminded the physicist that most bolts are not perfect resonators, and that early devices required that the bolt have reasonably flat and parallel faces. The U. S. Geological Survey asked NASA for help in determining the load in mine roof bolts, which are 8 - to 10 -feet-long and rough cut. To solve that problem, Heyman modified the original device to operate at a lower frequency and to generate propagation modes {{that could be used to}} "lock" the instrument on a particular mode. Further work in this vein led to the development of the Pulsed Phase Locked Loop (P 2 L 2) that worked on the mine bolts. The next set of problems involved high-strength bolts with head markings. For this solution, Heyman invented a modified P 2 L 2 that tracked a specific phase point in the measurement wave. This class of instrumentation, well suited to measuring small changes in acoustic velocity, won the NASA "Invention of the Year" award in 1982. Other scientists and engineers have continued the evolution of this technology both inside NASA and outside of the Agency. Within NASA, the technology has been improved for medical applications, with a particular focus on intercranial pressure (ICP) monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Topside Variable Speed Drive (VSD) {{feeding a}} subsea load via a long cable {{is not a}} new {{technological}} challenge and many features in systems feeding asynchronous machines are well known. For a synchronous machine the situation is different as a net positive machine torque is not guaranteed. Therefor an analysis of the start sequence of such machine is of interest. In this work starting of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) powered by a VSD via a long subsea cable have been studied. Long transfer distance gives need for increased cable voltage, and thus transformers are introduced. A dynamic simulation model has been developed in SIMULINK? SimPowerSystems? consisting of voltage source, saturable transformers, cable, machine and mechanical load. To synchronize the machine the electrical frequency is lowered as suggested in literature with the result that the system impedances change compared to steady state and resistance become the dominant parameter. Source voltage amplitude must also be reduced accordingly to avoid iron core saturation. The consequence is that the large cable voltage drop result in insufficient start up torque produced by the machine when a stiction torque around 30 % is present. The mentioned dynamic simulation model has been used to compare system modifications proposed in literature to an unmodified base case with a cable length of 50 km. This have been done to investigate how stiction torque affects the start sequence and to draw conclusions about which method gives the most benefits for this type of machine. The main cases tested are increased voltage/frequency ratio, reduced cable resistance and machine damping. If the electromagnetic torque produced overcomes stiction torque the rotor is set into motion. Because of the rotor and load inertia and the high <b>opposing</b> friction <b>torque</b> rotor oscillations around zero speed is not avoided for any of the cases when stiction torque is applied. Oscillation motion is assumed to heat up the bearing oil such that the static torque is reduced and eventually synchronous operation is achieved after several seconds. It is shown in this work that what separates the cases where sufficient torque is produced is the time the machine uses to reach synchronism. All modifications shows improvement compared to the base case. Damping and voltage boost are the modifications with the most promising results for a broad range of stiction torques. This is expected as damping gives a net positive torque as in an induction machine, and that voltage boost directly increases the machine current. Higher voltage boost is better, but may easily lead to transformer saturation so this method must be used with great care. A rotor design with very high damping may result in a machine with lower air gap magnetic flux and conversely lower electromagnetic torque. The tradeoff between the modifications must be considered for each specific system. Oscillations are found to be present to the same degree independent of initial power angle. This means that as long as no dynamic control strategy is applied one does not {{have to take into account}} the initial angle of the rotor relative to the stator field. The assumption about reduction in static friction in the mechanical load should be tested in laboratory or existing installations. No cost- or sizing considerations are included in this work. In relation to offshore installations space requirements may often be an issue, but this has to be considered in each specific case. Resonance conditions must be treated with great care in such system and could be subject for further studies. Off special interest are multilevel inverters producing a very low harmonic output. A great challenge is to achieve general results and models that may be part of a tool box for system development in the future. The model developed here may be a part of such tools...|$|R
