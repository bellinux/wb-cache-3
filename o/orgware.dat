In the quest for efficient and sustainable mobility, the Flemish government becomes entangled in endless struggles between ever more involved and changing stake- and shareholders. The role and effectiveness of the government is exposed to rising challenges from inside and outside. Since most new projects focus on infrastructural (hardware) or (socio-) technical innovations {{in the use of}} mobile means (software), innovations within the organizational structure of mobility (orgware') have mostly remained untouched. We address this hiatus by approaching mobility projects as complex adaptive systems, comprising various, dynamic actor-networks.

To grasp these complex challenges, one needs to unravel the <b>orgware</b> and identify the potentials of the mobility systems regarding the travel, transport and traffic mobility arenas. We draw upon a combination of actor-network theory and institutional theory insights applied to conceptual mobility frameworks.

40|$|Modern plant {{breeding}} is {{highly dependent on}} new technologies to master future problems. More traits have to be combined, frequently originating from wild species. Traditional breeding is connected with linkage drag problems. The crop plant itself and its crossable species represent the traditional breeders gene pool. GM-breeding is {{a new way of}} improving existing varieties. Transgenes originate from non-crossable species and are representing a new gene pool. For release of GM-plants into the environment and onto the market in Europe Directive 2001 / 18 /EC has been developed, primarily based on GM-technology and not on gene source. In society, opposition against GM crops is complicating the implementation of GM crops. In this paper, it is shown that not only transgenes, representing a new gene pool but also cisgenes and intragenes are available, representing the breeders gene pool. Cisgenes are natural genes and intragenes are composed of functional parts of natural genes from the crop plant itself or from crossable species. Cisgenesis is the combined use of only cisgenes with marker-free transformation, mimicking linkage drag free introgression breeding in one step. Therefore, cisgenesis is a new sub-invention in the traditional breeding field and indicates the need for reconsideration of GM Directives. Inventions are frequently containing not only hardware elements, but also software and <b>orgware</b> elements. For cisgenesis it is foreseen that the technical (hardware) and bioinformatic (software) elements will develop smoothly, but that implementation in society is highly dependent on acceptance and regulations (<b>orgware).</b> It could be made in a step by step approach by specific crop-gene derogations from the Directive, followed by adding cisgenesis to annex 1 b of Directive 2001 / 18 /EC for exemption. At present GM crops can only be introduced by large companies. An open innovation approach for cisgenesis by public private partnership including traditional SMEs has been discussed.

40|$|Trans-Alpine freight {{transport}} suffers because of severe road congestion due to under-capacity of roads and causes considerable environmental damages in the transit countries, particularly in Austria and Switzerland, {{but also in}} Italy. The obvious strategy of shifting trans-Alpine flows from road to rail is hampered by several factors such as Jack of coordination among the various national railway companies, lack of provision of competitive services (e. g., blocktrains, etc.), and insufficient efforts to increase and promote combined transport. One of the key problems is the disintegrated policy approach which does not conceive road and rail as complementary modes of transport, but still as competitive ones. Using the five dimensions - hardware, software, <b>orgware</b> (institutions), tinware, and the environment - as a checklist the current paper makes a modest attempt to identify areas of major concern for road and rail.

You have enough to ponder and find out in pondering {{the life of the}} future; but do not ask history to show you the means and the {{instrument}} to do it (Nietzsche 1957, 41). “I am a robot, ” thus spoke Dator. I vaguely recall the first time I heard this odd statement radiate from his beaming, yet decidedly matter-of-fact, face. I still feel a bit nonplussed at his assurance that this is indeed the case, even if the thought that he might be an extra-terrestrial has come to mind on more than one occasion. Although I remain a bit uncertain about the full context for his declaration, I think Jim’s contention centers at least in part on his theory of technology, which he discerns as having a symbiotic relationship with humanity, especially as it is fundamentally and simply “how humans ‘get things done’” (Dator 1983, 30). In light of this seemingly pedestrian formulation, Dator paints a more complete portrait by distinguishing between three kinds of technology: social, biological, and physical.

In order to achieve its agricultural policy objectives, the Moroccan government has developed programs of technology diffusion involving financial support. These programs focused on the introduction of equipments and technology, i. e.,the 'hardware' component of innovation and not on farmers' capacity to manage the 'software' side of innovation. For the dairy sector, activities of development plans have allowed some improvement in the introduction of new cattle breeds, the use of new food and agricultural equipments. However, the results did not achieve planned objectives. Farmers have a lack of knowledge to manage introduced innovations. State supported activities for farmer capacity-building were not implemented in the most appropriate way and moreover became quantitatively limited with state withdrawal. In such context, farmers have developed knowledge networks: they exchange with pairs and with the different stakeholders involved in the dairy sector. A balance between the hardware,and software components of innovation is required for a new agricultural development strategy. This could {{be the best way to}} allow family farmers to improve their investment returns in technical innovations. Also, <b>orgware</b> organisational set-ups should take into account the current diversity of actual formal and informal knowledge networks.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{directed}} {{to the importance of}} different inventions as driver for sustainable development of agriculture. Inventions are defined as radical new ideas, perspectives and technologies that hold the potential to trigger a change in sustainable agriculture. Innovation is based on one or more inventions that can bring a major breakthrough or have a smaller impact. Inventions can be science driven or society driven. They have been crucial in history of the existing agricultural knowledge infrastructure and will remain important in the future as driver for sustainable development. The main difference with the past is that inventions and their implementation will not always follow the old linear process of fundamental – (university), strategic – (research institute) and applied research with extension – (applied institutes) but that these processes are often non-linear and more complex, including society. For inventions to become successful innovations and to prevent negative side effects not only technical hardware elements of an invention are important but also software and <b>orgware</b> elements. Another important prerequisite for innovation through inventions is value capturing through entrepreneurship. Nowadays in agricultural life sciences patent rights are introduced which have to co-exist with, for example, plant breeders’ rights in plant varieties with its principle of breeders exemption in order to preserve open innovation. Lessons learned show that new solutions aiming at sustainable development can be organized by intersectional inventions, directional inventions or open innovations sometimes followed by a switch between the...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{starts from}} the overal {{societal}} {{concern about the}} sustainability of energy and material flows, in particular in highly urbanized regions, {{and the role of}} agriculture to increase this sustainability. The case of Flanders (Belgium) is taken because of its high throughput of energy and materials. The paper proposes a conceptual and methodological framework for interactively and iteratively clarifying and designing more sustainable systems, investigating how local innovations can be facilitated and evaluated in a consistent way. The innovations are seen as organisationtranscending, as they radically change the interactions between enterprises, organisations and individuals involved (system innovations). The research develops theoretical insights based on action research in case-study settings. Through iterative cycles of observation, reflection, planning and active experimentation, an adaptive research agenda is built, which is orientated towards the local conditions and the major issues of relevance. Besides the more theoretical justification of the –predominantly qualitative- research approach, the paper shows first-stage results on the “rapeseed for biofuel” case, up to now the first-at-hand system innovation in Flanders with respect to more sustainable energy and material flows. A context analysis describes the system innovation through its hardware (technology), software (knowledge, vision, motivation) and <b>orgware</b> (organisational and institutional conditions) and offers a typology of rapeseed producers with different management strategies. This helps to understand why so little farmers engage in cultivating rapeseed in Flanders at the moment, and highlights opportunities for fostering the system innovations’ growth/success. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Planning Support Systems (PSSs) are {{a family}} of {{computer}} based instruments specifically designed to support actors in their complex tasks {{in the field of}} planning. There is a gap between the high expectations that PSS developers have about the usefulness of their instruments and the instruments’ application in daily planning practice. PSS academics have proposed several ways to close this so-called implementation gap through a range of software, hardware and <b>orgware</b> approaches. Several of these approaches have been applied in practical planning settings. There is however a lack of consistent and structured reporting on the effectiveness of these approaches in improving PSS performance. Therefore, it is hard to distinguish between successful and less successful strategies, {{and it is difficult to}} draw overall lessons. This paper (1) proposes a comprehensive multidimensional framework that operationalizes PSS performance, and (2) analyses how recent PSS implementation studies have reported on this performance. The developed framework, based on literature from Group Model Building and group psychology, is sensitive to a wide variety of performance dimensions and therefore forms a useful guideline for assessing PSS implementation strategies. Studying these in a common framework supports the potential transfer of lessons to other PSS implementations. Most of the analyzed studies only posed hypotheses about which dimensions are improved through a specific strategy, but did not report on measuring impacts. By structurally measuring the effectiveness of a range of strategies to improve PSS implementation, lessons can be exchanged and a consistent body of knowledge can be built...|$|E
40|$|Part 1 : Environmental Application in the Scope of the Future InternetInternational audienceIn {{terms of}} {{contemporary}} civilization development {{one of the}} key aspects of environmental protection is the effort to avoid wasting resources. In the case of environmental information systems there is a necessity to strive for such systems, which deliver the highest benefits with the lowest possible consumption of resources (material, energy, as well as human, etc.). Therefore, every information system must be regarded comprehensively, i. e. as a set of mutually interactive subsystems (components, parts). The experiences confirm that the information system, parts of which are not mutually balanced, leads to the lower effectiveness and efficiency of the system as a whole in contrast with a system which may be managed {{in such a way that}} all its parts are maintained at a comparable level. Thus, the effectiveness of environmental/information systems must be harmonized as a whole. This paper presents “the HOS method” developed in the Faculty of Business and Management of the Brno University of Technology. This method enables the primary assessment of the balance of organizations’ information systems. The HOS analysis is based on a considering of the basic subsystems: Hardware, <b>Orgware</b> and Software (hence the title HOS), but also the following subsystems: Peopleware, Dataware, Customers, Suppliers and Information System Management. The understandable and transparent HOS diagrams for assessing the balance of an information system are presented in a short case study where authors submit also some selected statistics about their current survey results obtained by means of empirical measurement of approximately four hundred chosen organizations from the Czech Republic and Slovak republic.

40|$|Conclusion The {{main point}} {{of this study is}} that Parkstad’s current {{restructuring}} approach does not meet the needs of the businesses. The growth potential of businesses will only be unleashed if Parkstad meets their needs. These needs do not seem to be a restructuring of the hardware on the industrial estates. Unfortunately BIDs have proven not to contribute to sustainable socio-economic development. Hence, the approach to restructuring of industrial estates that can contribute to a transition towards a sustainable socio-economic structure should contain other elements. The elements such an approach should contain can primarily be found in the evolutionary economic theories. Evolutionary economists argue that qualitative change, that is the attraction of new variety, is the way to achieve economic growth. The emergence of networks is hereby important as they quickly transfer knowledge and with that promote learning and innovation. Related variety is important to accelerate the formation of such networks. The intangible features that especially related variety networks have, make the actors within the network regionally embedded. The embeddedness is on the one hand caused by the multiple relations ones business has within the region, but on the other hand on the devastating effects leaving such a network would have for ones business. Networks can however not be created by policy means, it always is a natural process started by businesses from the bottom-up. Hence, the only way for Parkstad to execute this approach is to take a facilitative role and to meet the needs of businesses. This can be referred to as restructuring the soft- and <b>orgware</b> of the industrial estates. This alternative approach of restructuring the soft- and <b>orgware</b> of the industrial estates improves the economic performance of the region. This new approach towards restructuring implies for planning that Parkstad and other governmental parties should take a facilitative role to let leading private actors initiate new projects. This approach furthermore implies that Parkstad needs to unlearn in order to build new institutional capacity that is totally adjusted to this new approach. Recommendations An opportunity is a centre of excellence for life science. First Parkstad should get the support from leading actors like DSM, Philips, Medtronic, Maastricht University and Aachen University. If these actors join forces and define themes they want to work on, a start is made. Then the involved actors should define which institutions are holding the region back from becoming a centre of excellence for life science. Formal institutions like ‘patent driven innovation’ and informal institutions like the non-entrepreneurial atmosphere could be such institutions. A new institutional context should be implemented that can work its way round these institutions. When this is done the strategy can be defined. Related variety seems hereby the key to success. With related variety the region can create a centre of excellence that has intangible features. Spin-offs, labour mobility and networks are the most important factors to achieve this. Therefore, the actors should try to connect and cooperate with related industries, firms and knowledge centres to ultimately create an extensive network. Also they should focus on mobilizing employees of these businesses to change employers in order to stimulate knowledge transfer, learning and innovation. For example, the absorption of new high talented professors for the universities and academic students graduating at companies like Medtronic and DSM. Last, the region should try to stimulate employees and students with new inventions to start new businesses with these inventions. These factors would most likely be able to create the centre of excellence for life science. Hence, to really let restructuring of industrial estates contribute to a more sustainable socio-economic structure, a real transition for Parkstad is needed. The way of looking at restructuring should change, the way of looking at space should change, the way the public actors are operating and making policy should change and the attitude of the businesses should change. However, it is the ability to unlearn that makes a region attract new variety. New variety is needed for the growth of the regional economy. It would therefore suit Parkstad if they would really go for it...|$|E

The conceptual framework of this project lies {{on the assumption that the}} cultural heritage of Europe is not just an ensemble of tangible assets to be defended through passive conservation, but rather an element of dynamism of the territory, affecting trajectories of regional development.

The establishment of an "European identity 2 ̆ 01 d, gaining from difference and variety, is also part of this vision. In this light, the ESPON 1. 3. 3 project sets out to highlight the spatial expressions and effects of heritage assets and identify the (existing or potential) elements of territorial coherence at the regional and local scale, mapping the geographical aspects that are actually strengthening regional identities and networks. This paper introduces a list of regional indicators of the European cultural heritage and identity, reflecting elements such as heritage availability, concentration and diversity, spatial patterns at the local and cross-regional level, local embeddedness of intangible heritage assets, pressures on- and potential for the development of heritage, and the governance structure of the heritage management institutions.
