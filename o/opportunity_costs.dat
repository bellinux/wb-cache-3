5|$|If <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case {{reflects}} {{a situation where}} resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve.

The marginal <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of guns in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost of guns in terms of butter is 4.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{cultivation}} persisted {{only in the}} light, well-drained, and chalk-based soils of {{the north}} Essex countryside. The Essex town of Saffron Walden got its name as a saffron growing and trading centre; its name was originally Cheppinge Walden, and the culinary name change was effected to punctuate {{the importance of the}} crop to the townsfolk; the town's arms still feature blooms from the eponymous crocus. Yet as England emerged from the Middle Ages, rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron's use and cultivation. Puritanical partisans favoured increasingly austere, unadorned, and unspiced foods. Saffron was also a labor-intensive crop, which became an increasing disadvantage as wages and time <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> rose. And finally, an influx of more exotic spices from the far East due to the resurgent spice trade meant that the English, as well as other Europeans, had many moreand cheaperseasonings to dally over.|$|E

5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E
5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{research}} on the association between <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of time and sports and exercise {{due to lack of}} data on <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of time. Using a sample of 14142 adults from Health Survey for England (2006), we develop and test a composite index of <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of time (to address the current issues with data constraint on <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of time) in order to explore the relationship between <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of time and sports participation. Methods: Probit regression models are fitted adjusting for a range of covariates. <b>Opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of time is measured with two proxy measures: a) composite index (consisting of various indicators of wage earnings) constructed using principal component analysis; and b) education and employment, approach in the literature. We estimate the relative impact of the composite index compared with current proxy measures, on prediction of sports participation. Findings: Findings suggest that higher <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of time is associated with increased likelihood of sports participation, regardless of the time intensity of activity or the measure of <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of time used. The relative impacts of the two proxy measures are comparable. Sports and exercise was found to be positively correlated with income.

40|$|The <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> {{concept has}} been {{advocated}} {{as the prime}} decision cost concept by economists and accountants, notably scholars of the London School since Nineteen Thirties. However, there are certain conditions as discussed by Edwards (1937) and Coase (1938) which have to be met before the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> concept can be functionally applied in the accounting context. Moreover, there are few research into the decision practices of accountants and business managers relating to {{the application of the}} <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> concept in business decisions. Thus, it is uncertain if the concept is adopted in practices by managers and executives. The purposes of this paper are, therefore, to carry out a critical review of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> concept, both in terms of its theoretical validity and its applicability to the business context, as well as to investigate whether the concept has actually been adopted in practice for business decisions. Based on the contents of the agency theory, behavioural decision theory (which includes the Resouceful, Evaluative, Maximising Model), expectancy theory, and the theory of choice, a model which is termed the Expectancy Decision Processing Model is proposed to explain the decision behaviour of business managers and how they would adopt or otherwise the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> concept, represented by the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> accounting model within the accounting context, in making decisions under different circumstances. Results of the analyses indicate that accountants and managers very often do not invoke the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> accounting model in making decision calculations. Managers will only invoke the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> accounting model in calculating the possible payoffs of different decision alternatives when two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that they find no difficulty in making use of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> accounting model; the second condition is that the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> accounting model will provide a priority ranking of the decision alternatives that is desired by the managers who are maximising their own decision benefits...|$|R

25|$|School feeding {{programs}} {{have the capacity}} to increase gender equity in access to education, which allows for gender equity across all spheres of social and economic life. There are a variety of reasons that girls' education is impacted by factors on both the supply and demand side of schooling. These include gender-stereotyped curriculum and teaching practices, increased risks for girls' safety outside of the house, socio-cultural practices that cause girls' education to hold a very low value, and school infrastructure that is not suitable for girls. Due to the combination of such barriers, girls are disproportionately affected by the direct and opportunity cost of schooling, which prevents girls from very poor households from attending school. <b>Opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> for girls' education include lost time that would otherwise be spent doing household chores and care work. School feeding programs reduce the costs of sending girls to school and allow for an increased number of girls to be sent to school by their families. Furthermore, improvements in female literacy that come from increased education have been linked to declining rates of fertility, increased economic opportunities, and other markers of female empowerment.|$|E
25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both real costs, such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> such as lost productivity), the cost of employee turnover to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and indirect costs relate {{to the loss of}} production, reduced performance levels, unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is going to depend on a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the direct costs can be readily calculated, while the indirect costs can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur action planning within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E
