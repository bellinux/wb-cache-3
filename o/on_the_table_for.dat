5|$|With paying gigs {{harder to}} find and paying less, Sims turned to other sources of income. Despite not having had any formal {{instruction}} himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic. Despite the lean times for hoofers, Sims was always able to put food <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> his family, having married in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The cakes {{were to be}} left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> a week, {{and then}} be {{replaced}} with new ones on the Sabbath, so that there were always fresh loaves on the table, and those that had started going stale were removed; the Biblical text states that the Jewish priests were entitled to eat the cakes that had been removed, {{as long as they}} did so in a holy place, as it considered the bread to be holy. The narrative of David's sojourn at Nob mentions that Ahimelek (the priest) gave David the holy bread, at his request.|$|E
25|$|David Uckotter, {{who was the}} {{engineering}} director for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government during the road's construction, also noted that Man o' War had to be designed and built around numerous subdivisions that were sprouting throughout south Lexington in that era. He indicated that this dictated a 120-foot right-of-way, which left no room for breakdown lanes. Uckotter also added {{that at the time}} Man o' War was proposed, plans were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> a southern beltway similar to New Circle Road outside Man o' War, hugging the border between Lexington and Jessamine County. These plans were dropped in the early 1980s, leaving Man o' War as Lexington's only circumferential road outside New Circle, which Uckotter contends has contributed to current problems with Man o' War.|$|E

25|$|Season 3 creates many dynamic {{changes with}} regards to {{relationships}} and power within the characters' society. Firstly, Marissa is expelled from the Harbor School. The Cooper family, left with little money, is forced {{to move into a}} trailer park. Julie Cooper-Nichol, once one of the richest women in all of Newport, struggles to put food <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> her daughters. Marissa's life begins to spiral out of control, as she struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as dealing with the loss of her close friend Johnny. Similarly, Kirsten confronts her alcohol addiction and eventually leaves rehab, only to encounter more problems when she begins business with a con artist. The other characters look towards college, with Seth and Summer competing for a spot at Brown University. Sandy's moral compass becomes imperiled when a past love interest makes her way back into his life, and he takes over Caleb's old position as head of The Newport Group, pursuing a project to establish more low-income housing in Newport. Ryan also attempts to resolve his individual relationships with his mother, and with his childhood friend Theresa Diaz. He also pursues the idea of a post-secondary education, with encouragement from both Sandy and Kirsten to visit Berkeley. Ryan's life is quickly put on hold when, in the season 3 finale, Ryan decides to drive Marissa to the airport, and they are run off the road by Kevin Volchok, Marissa's most recent love affair gone wrong. In the last few minutes of the episode, Ryan pulls Marissa out from the burning car, only to watch her die in his arms.|$|E

[...] Accompanied by an honour guard, he arrived in Hartford on 31 October, and met that evening with the colonial leadership. [...] According to legend, during this meeting the charter was laid out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> all to see. [...] The lights in the room unexpectedly went out, and when relit, the charter had disappeared. The charter {{was said to have}} been hidden in a nearby oak tree (referred to afterward as the Charter Oak) so that a search of nearby buildings would not locate the document.|$|E
500|$|On foreign policy, Booker {{supports}} {{scaling down}} U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and is against intervention in Syria. After the US strike on Syria in April 2017, Booker criticized military action [...] "without a clear plan" [...] or authorization from Congress. He supports {{a two-state solution}} to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. On Iran, Booker has stated the country poses {{a direct threat to}} American and Israeli security and feels all options should be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> dealing with the conflict. However, his decision to back the Iran nuclear deal framework damaged his long-term relationship with Jewish voters and supporters. In an attempt to reduce the damage, Booker initiated an emergency summit for Jewish leaders, which some of his longstanding supporters did not attend.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Weston Smith, {{known as}} Wolfman Jack (January 21, 1938 – July 1, 1995) was an American disc jockey.

Andrews said {{the government}} had acquired the consortium for $1. The decision was condemned by Abbott as [...] "reckless" [...] and said Victorians would suffer as a result. Abbott said: [...] "The East West Link is the only answer. Tens {{of millions of dollars}} and years of planning have already been invested to get the project shovel-ready. $3 billion from the Commonwealth government remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> any Victorian government which wants to build the East West Link." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the issue}} of nuclear power, in 2005, Obama stated, [...] "... as Congress {{considers}} policies to address air quality and the deleterious effects of carbon emissions on the global ecosystem, it is reasonable – and realistic – for nuclear power to remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> consideration. Illinois has 11 nuclear power plants – {{the most of any}} State in the country – and nuclear power provides more than half of Illinois's electricity needs." [...] Regarding McCain's plans for 45 new nuclear power plants, Obama said that it's not serious, it's not new, it's not the kind of energy policy that will give families the relief they need. Obama declared himself flatly opposed to building the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. Furthermore, he opposes new nuclear plants until the problems of nuclear waste storage, safety and cost can be addressed.|$|E
