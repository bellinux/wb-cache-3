5|$|A port of No One Lives Forever – Game of the Year Edition for the Mac OS X {{operating}} system {{was developed by}} MumboJumbo, and published by MacPlay. It was released on November 21, 2002, soon after the original Windows release of No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way (which was also ported to Mac OS X by MacPlay later). Similarly to the Windows version of the game, the Mac OS X port also uses GameSpy technology for its online multiplayer mode, allowing players to play with each <b>other,</b> <b>no</b> matter which platform they use.|$|E
5|$|In Brown's {{arrangement}} of the genus, B.sphaerocarpa was placed between B.pulchella and B.nutans in taxonomic sequence; that is, an order that places related taxa next to each <b>other.</b> <b>No</b> subdivision of the genus was given, other than to separate a single distinctive species into a subgenus of its own. Swiss botanist Carl Meissner published a more detailed arrangement in 1856, placing B.sphaerocarpa in section Eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series Abietinae, whose members have inrolled leaf margins with no, or only very fine, serrations. Meissner also published a variety, B.sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens, based on specimens collected by James Drummond; this is now considered a synonym of B.incana.|$|E
5|$|Northallerton was {{formerly}} a parliamentary borough. Its first representatives were John le Clerk and Stephen Maunsell, who were {{elected to the}} parliament of King Edward I in 1298, {{but for some reason}} or <b>other</b> <b>no</b> subsequent return was made until 1640, when the privilege was again resumed by order of the House of Commons. From 1640 to 1885 The town formed the parliamentary borough of Northallerton, returning two Members of Parliament until 1832, and one thereafter. Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, boundaries were extended to include neighbouring Brompton and Romanby and its representation was reduced to a single member. In 1885 the constituency was abolished and was absorbed into the Richmond division of the North Riding. The serving member for Richmond constituency is the Conservative, Rishi Sunak, who has held the seat since 2015 when he succeeded former party leader and Foreign Secretary William Hague. In modern times it has been an ultra-safe seat for the Conservative Party with them having held it continually since 1929.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 2000s the Caribous were {{becoming}} difficult to maintain, and {{were no longer}} capable of operating in war zones as they lacked electronic warfare systems {{and other forms of}} self-protection. As a result, it was decided in late 2008 to retire the aircraft and replace them with Beechcraft King Air 350s on an interim basis until another tactical transport entered service. The Caribous were gradually retired from May 2009, the last leaving service on 27 November that year when A4-140 was flown to Canberra and handed over to the Australian War Memorial for preservation. By the time the aircraft were retired, No. 38 Squadron had been operating Caribous for 45 years. Three King Air 350s were transferred to No. 38 Squadron from the Army's 173rd Surveillance Squadron on 20 November 2009, and deliveries of a further five newly built aircraft were completed in July 2010. At least one of the Army aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with ground surveillance sensors, and this capacity was retained after it was transferred to the Air Force. No. 38 Squadron's King Airs were initially operated by Army personnel, who were given the choice of transferring to the RAAF or converting to helicopters at the end of their posting. The <b>other</b> <b>No.</b> 38 pilots were converted to the type at the Army's Oakey Army Aviation Centre, but the squadron began conducting its own conversion courses after the second batch of five aircraft were delivered.|$|E
5|$|No. 151's Pilot Officer Richard Milne {{shot down}} Gruppenkommandeur of II./KG 53, Major Reinhold Tamm. The He 111 blew up, killing all aboard. The escorting Bf 109s counter-attacked, {{shooting}} down two No. 151 Squadron Hurricanes, killing one pilot and wounding the <b>other.</b> <b>No.</b> 257 Squadron also engaged and lost one pilot {{killed in a}} crash landing after combat with Bf 110s. No. 46 Squadron—the only 12 Group unit to take part—also engaged. Shortly hence, the 13 Hurricanes from No. 85 Squadron, led by Peter Townsend, struck at the bombers but was blocked by ZG 26 Bf 110s. Bf 109s was also present and inconclusive engagements began. It was likely the Bf 109s belonged to III./JG 51 providing top cover. There was intense combat around the bombers. No. 1 Squadron's leader, David Pemperton, accounted for one JG 3 Bf 109. No. 85 Squadron accounted for one He 111, but lost a Hurricane to the Bf 110s, the pilot, Pilot Officer Paddy Hemmingway, bailed out into the Channel and survived. Another pilot, Flight Lieutenant Dick Lee, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of France and a flying ace with nine victories was reported missing in action. He was last seen chasing three Bf 109s out to sea. His body was never found. Among the few British squadrons left in the fight (owing to fuel and ammunition running low) was No. 54 Squadron. Its commander, Colin Falkland Gray, destroyed a Bf 110.|$|E

25|$|The 1950 election, however, gave Labor 24 {{seats to}} the Liberals' 27 and the Country Party's 13. Since the Liberals and Country Party hated each <b>other,</b> <b>no</b> stable {{majority}} government was possible, and this, {{together with the}} unpopularity of the new federal Liberal government, gave Cain his opportunity. In October 1952 the Country Party premier, John McDonald, resigned and called early elections. Labor won 37 seats, {{the first time it}} had won a majority in the lower house, and Cain formed his third government.|$|E
25|$|The {{striped hyena}} competes with the gray wolf in the Middle East and central Asia. In the latter area, a great {{portion of the}} hyena's diet stems from wolf-killed carcasses. The striped hyena is {{dominant}} over the wolf on a one-to-one basis, though wolves in packs can displace single hyenas from carcasses. Both species {{have been known to}} share dens on occasion. On rare occasions, Striped Hyenas are also known to travel with and live amongst wolf packs, with each doing the <b>other</b> <b>no</b> harm. Both predators may benefit from this unusual alliance, as the hyenas have better senses of smell and greater strength, and the wolves may be better at tracking large prey. Red foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh which is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin {{also built}} six engines for the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway, {{three of which}} were {{delivered}} in 1890, with the fourth being delivered in 1897. These engines featured steeply inclined boilers and used the Abt rack system to propel them up the average 16 percent grade. The last Baldwin engine {{was taken out of}} regular service in 1955. During the following years the engines were used as back-up engines and for snow removal. Three of the engines are currently on static display around Colorado. One (No. 1) is located at the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, Colorado. The other two on display are located in Manitou Springs, Colorado: one (No. 2) near city hall and the <b>other</b> (<b>No.</b> 5) at the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway depot. The engine No. 4 is still in limited operation for photo opportunities and special events. However, it no longer completes the journey to the top of Pike's Peak {{due to the fact that}} many of the water tanks along the line have been removed. Engines No. 3 and No. 6 were scrapped and used for parts over the years.|$|E
