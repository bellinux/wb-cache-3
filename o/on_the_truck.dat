5|$|The bridge formula (also {{referred}} to as Formula B) is based on research into single-span bridges, and fails to consider multiple-span bridges. Two-span bridges may not be fully protected by Formula B, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> length, span length, and other factors. Shorter wheelbase vehicles (usually specialized trucks such as garbage trucks and water trucks) have trouble complying with Formula B.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{terrorist}} attacks in Paris on the Friday evening of the race weekend, Formula One decided to honour the victims with all drivers wearing black armbands during the parade lap on race day as well as the French tricolore being displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> that took the drivers around the track. French driver Romain Grosjean had already worn an armband with the flag of his country during Saturday's sessions. However, a long planned minute of silence for the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims was upheld and plans to dedicate the salute to the Paris attacks discarded.|$|E

Reyes is able to {{retrieve}} the license plate number <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> used to kidnap the abductee. It is later revealed that it belongs to Travis Clayton Moberly, better known as Absalom, {{the leader of a}} doomsday cult. The FBI storms the cult's compound, and arrests Absalom, but Smith is not found. Absalom tells Scully and Doggett that he has been saving abductees that had been left for dead by the aliens. Examining video of the compound raid, Scully, Reyes and Doggett watch Smith step through a doorway and transform into Agent Doggett. Doggett is stunned, and the agents realize that Smith is still in the compound.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 {{the company}} {{purchased}} a {{car from the}} Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company, this being a double-decker with a single ended body pivoted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> This device removed the need to detach the horses at the terminus, as the horses would turn the car round {{and be ready to}} start off in the opposite direction again.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} uneven {{adhesion}} coefficient and crosswind on alignment design indexes, a six-axle semi-trailer is selected as the typical vehicle model to investigate the effects of uneven adhesion coefficient caused by superelevation under the condition of rainfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck's</b> lateral stability, quantifying the crosswind using TruckSim. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basic theory of vehicle dynamics, vehicle safety driving model is established. Also, the minimum radius is calculated with the consideration of uneven adhesion coefficient and crosswind. The results show that the effects of uneven adhesion coefficient and crosswind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck's</b> lateral stability increase with the increasing of <b>the</b> <b>truck's</b> speed. Truck's lateral slide instability begins to appear when crosswind grade grows up to 9 or above. According to sensitive analysis, speed, rainfall, crosswind, and the interaction of the speed and rainfall have significant influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck's</b> lateral stability. <b>The</b> results quantify the effects of uneven adhesion coefficient and crosswind <b>on</b> <b>truck's</b> lateral stability. <b>The</b> advised index for horizontal curve design control is proposed, which provides a good reference for road safety design and safety protective measures. It can also provide theoretical basis and guidelines for highway safe operation in the windy and rainy areas...|$|R

25|$|A unique {{feature of}} these units {{is that there}} is a {{variable}} traction control system in their computer systems. One of the differences between an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the air cylinders and linkages <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> sideframes of the ES44C4; these are part of the traction control system. Every time a variation in grade, traction, or wheel slip occurs, the computer will adjust the pressure in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the drive axles.|$|E

25|$|Although most {{cars were}} bought {{from the usual}} {{engineering}} companies, the larger depots carried out significant rebuilding work and Milehouse is even credited with building new cars. The first was car 91 in 1920, which had a completely new body built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> from Devonport car 22. Similar work was carried out on car 24 which emerged as a new number 93 in 1922. A third new car emerged the same year and was given the number 112. Some engineering cars were also built, or rebuilt, at the various depots. Most notable being a rail grinder built at Crompton depot in 1915, and car 42 which was converted to a welding car in 1924.|$|E

A few hours later, aircraft of the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) raided the harbour castle and the main hills of the small island, where the commandos were entrenched. Ladybird was struck by a bomb and three seamen wounded; already short of fuel, Ladybird was forced to re-embark the Royal Marines party and make for Haifa, which cut the radio link of the commandos with Alexandria. After communications breakdowns and other mishaps, the follow-up force from Cyprus was diverted to Alexandria.|$|E
