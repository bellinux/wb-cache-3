5|$|In {{its early}} days tourism was a {{relatively}} new concept, but grew slowly before exploding {{with the advent of}} air travel around 1959, the year Hawaii became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations, and Kīlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the world in a more or less constant state of moderate eruption, is {{a major part of the}} island's tourist draw. Today, Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceed up the volcano from the recently revamped Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kīlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater. The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging, and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access. In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened for tourists in Kalapana on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.|$|E

Though evidence for private emperor worship is as sparse in this era as in all others, Fronto's letters imply the genius cult of the living emperor as an official, domestic and personal practice, probably more common than cult to the divi in this and other periods.|$|E
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} four interventions: improving social skills, enhancing social support, increasing opportunities for social interaction, addressing abnormal social cognition (faulty thoughts and patterns of thoughts). The {{results of the study}} indicated that all interventions were effective in reducing loneliness, possibly with the exception of social skill training. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that correcting maladaptive social cognition <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> chance of reducing loneliness.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{treatment}} for tick paralysis is the careful administration of anti-tick serum. The effectiveness of anti-tick serum is most dependent on how early it is administered. Early treatment <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> chance of full recovery. Unlike snake bite, tick envenoming has a relatively slow onset. Despite this slow onset the fatality rate {{can be very}} high (even higher than snake bite) if antiserum is not given sufficiently early, before the signs are advanced.|$|E

25|$|Treatment for {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{also depends}} upon {{the severity of the}} curvature, the spine’s potential for further growth, and the risk that the curvature will progress. Mild scoliosis (less than 30 degrees deviation) may simply be monitored and treated with exercise. Moderately severe scoliosis (30–45 degrees) in a child who is still growing may require bracing. Severe curvatures that rapidly progresses may be treated surgically with spinal rod placement. Bracing may prevent a progressive curvature, but evidence for this is not very strong. In all cases, early intervention <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> results.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few {{different}} dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> dimensional stability.|$|E
25|$|The range can {{be easily}} {{accessed}} via a paved road which parallels Bighorn Canyon, and which provides excellent viewing of the horses. The range can also be accessed from Laurel, Montana, by traveling south on U.S. Route 310 and then taking the Forest Service gravel road to Dryhead Overlook. Those with four-wheel drive vehicles can take the rutted dirt road through the forest to Penn's Cabin, which is another good horse viewing spot. Those interested in circumnavigating the range can take the dirt Burnt Timber Ridge Road from Penn's Cabin to the dirt Sykes Ridge Road, and follow Sykes Ridge Road to its terminus. (Sykes Ridge Road also <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> viewing of the Bighorn Basin.) Roads around the range tend to be impassable in wet weather or snow. Some of the range may be accessed via the Crow Indian Reservation. A trespass permit (obtainable from the Crow Nation) is required to cross tribal land or exit a vehicle while on tribal land.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{reception}} {{has been}} very favorable. Trans-Europe Express has the highest possible ratings from publications including AllMusic, Drowned in Sound, Mojo, Rolling Stone and Slant Magazine. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that the album [...] "is often cited as perhaps the archetypal (and most accessible) Kraftwerk album ... Overall, Trans-Europe Express <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> blend of minimalism, mechanized rhythms, and crafted, catchy melodies in the group's catalog". Q, in a 1995 review, wrote that the album [...] "changed the face of American dance music" [...] {{and that it was}} one of the most compelling beats of this or any other era". In 2009, Drowned in Sounds Chris Power stated that [...] "Trans-Europe Express is all at once antique, timeless, retro and contemporary. Its status as modern electronic music's birth certificate is well-earned, but its hallowed reputation should never be allowed to disguise its true value and power as a work of art. Nor should it obscure a longevity that, 32 years on, we might as well start calling by its real name: immortality".|$|E
500|$|After his PhD, Hadley {{worked as}} a {{lecturer}} in communication ethics in the Charles Sturt University (CSU) School of Communication and a lecturer in philosophy at the CSU School of Humanities and Social Sciences. He then joined the University of Western Sydney School of Humanities and Communication Arts, first as a lecturer in philosophy, {{and then as a}} senior lecturer in philosophy. Animal Ethics and Philosophy: Questioning the Orthodoxy, a collection edited by Hadley with the Finnish philosopher Elisa Aaltola, was published in 2015 by Rowman & Littlefield International. The book aimed to move debate in animal ethics beyond developing extentionist accounts and to examine the metaphilosophical and metaethical problems with extentionist accounts. Hadley's own contribution drew attention to a perceived inconsistent triad in animal rights philosophy: the idea that moral status is determined by psychological factors (like sentience), and not species; that human and nonhuman animals are of the same kind; and that [...] <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> explanation for change in natural selection. In the same year, Hadley published a monograph with Lexington Books entitled Animal Property Rights: A Theory of Territory Rights for Wild Animals. The book, partially building upon his doctoral research, presents a large amount of new material on Hadley's animal property rights theory.|$|E
500|$|The game's premise {{and writing}} were warmly received; a {{review in the}} New York Times noted [...] "The game's level of detail and its {{emotional}} impact have prompted some players to cast about for literary peers." [...] Reviewers were pleased {{with the ability to}} shape their character's journey as they wished. In 2005, GameSpot stated [...] "Planescape: Torment has quite possibly the best implementation of role-playing an evil character ever to appear in a computer or video game to date". The heavily tattooed, egocentric and potentially selfish Nameless One was welcomed as a change of pace from the conventional RPG hero, who was considered a predictable do-gooder. Reviewers also approved of the protagonist's ability to gain new powers by [...] "remembering" [...] past lives. The dark and diversified representation of the D setting of Planescape was lauded as a fresh departure from the traditional high fantasy of computer role-playing games. A review in NextGen praised the game, saying that [...] "Torment <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> RPG gameplay anyone can find on store shelves, hands down." [...] Uros Jojic of Actiontrip commented that [...] "Planescape: Torment proves {{that it is possible to}} make an inventive, fun and refreshing game in this [...] "sea of clones".

2500|$|One {{reason for}} high prices is that Fairtrade farmers {{have to sell}} through a monopsonist cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – {{certainly}} some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt {{if they wish to}} retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists.
