While existing research has often attributed overspending to the availability <b>of</b> advance <b>credit,</b> there remains a dark spot in understanding why consumers are overspending, particularly through the use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> This study aims to understand consumer perceptions on the usage <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> and subsequently provide recommendations to promote the responsible use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Fifteen qualitative, in-depth interviews with young consumers were employed to understand their perceptions and considerations toward the usage <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Findings suggest a change in consumer culture from one which focused on saving first, spending later to one which encourages spending now, thinking later. Various rationales have been identified as motivators that encourage <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> usage, including security trends for a cashless society and as a reflection of social desires.

25|$|A {{secured credit}} card {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> secured by a deposit account owned by the {{cardholder}}. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of {{the total amount of}} credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.|$|E

Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses SSL to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk.

A survey was conducted (n = 636), decision trees were then constructed using Chi-square automatic interaction detection algorithm (CHAID) and SPSS software AnswerTree to examine the association between the number <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> (target variable) and the demographic characteristics, perceptions and other <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> related variables. The number <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{was found to be}} significantly influenced by income and gender as well as perceptions that include “credit card leads to overspending”, “savings as payment source”, “unreasonable interest rates”, “credit card as status symbol”. The number <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> was also affected by <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> related variables such as missing payments sometimes, frequency of use, entertainment expenditures, and petrol purchase. This research provides an in-depth understanding of Singaporean multiple cardholders, thus it is useful in designing marketing strategies for card-issuers as well as anti-debt strategies for policy-makers in Singapore. Despite the importance <b>of</b> consumer <b>credit,</b> virtually no literature or research exists on the ownership and use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> in Singapore, so this paper intends to close this gap.
