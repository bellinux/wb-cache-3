In this study we avoid specification problems by examining the issue in time-varying frequency domain, a data-dependent technique that decomposes the variability <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> in different dynamic paths. Using intraday data, we find that positive and negative returns are generated by different data generating processes: positive returns are mostly characterized by slow adjustments, while negative returns are characterized by fast and reverting adjustment. These findings support the notion <b>of</b> non-linearity <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> and provide a methodological basis for future research on this topic. 1...|$|R
