At the same time, Buffalo Braves president and general manager Norm Sonju grew an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise. While the Braves went to California as the San Diego Clippers, Sonju eventually returned to Texas, and was introduced to Carter by mayor Robert Folsom, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association – which moved to San Antonio in 1973 to become the San Antonio Spurs.

25|$|The {{first season}} of Stand Alone Complex {{focuses on the}} Laughing Man incident, wherein a hacker {{ultimately}} reveals to the Major that he had discovered that several micromachine manufacturing corporations, {{in association with the}} Japanese government, suppressed information on an inexpensive cure to a debilitating cyberization disease in order to profit from the more expensive micromachine treatment. He abducted <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of the company and attempted to force him to reveal the truth on live television, resulting in the hacker live-hacking everyone's vision and cameras at the event to cover his face with the stylized laughing face logo that became synonymous with his image. His popularity spawned several genuine imitators, resulting in the series' titular Stand Alone Complex. When Section 9 discovers that these companies and several Japanese politicians later used the Laughing Man's image to garner public support and profit, they begin a campaign to disseminate the truth, ultimately leading to the Cabinet labeling them as domestic terrorists and forcibly disbanding them, resulting in the capture of several members and the apparent death of Motoko Kusanagi. However, it is all a ruse to deceive the government, and the very alive and well members of Section 9 regroup to bring the micromachine corporations and corrupt politicians to justice, resulting in the dissolution of the current Japanese government.|$|E
