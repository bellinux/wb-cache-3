40|$|At the inter-domain level, the Internet {{topology}} can {{be represented}} by a graph with Autonomous Systems (ASes) as nodes and AS peerings as links. This AS-level topology graph has been widely used {{in a variety of}} research efforts. Conventionally this topology graph is derived from routing tables collected by RouteViews or RIPE RIS. In this work, we assemble the most complete AS-level topology by extending the conventional method along two dimensions. First, in addition to using data from RouteViews and RIPE RIS, we also collect data from many other sources, including route servers, looking glasses, and routing registries. Second, in addition to using routing tables, we also accumulate topological information from routing updates over time. The resulting topology graph <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> contains 44 % more links and 3 % more nodes than that from using RouteViews routing tables alone. Our data collection and topology generation process have been automated, and we publish the latest topology on the web on a daily basis. 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>day,</b> I used {{my credit}} cards in {{connection}} with a number of minor transactions. I made eight purchases, and I paid two credit card bills. I also discarded (without opening) three solicitations for new cards, balance transfer programs, or other similar offers to extend credit via a credit card. Statistics suggest that I am not atypical. U. S. consumers last year used credit cards in about 100 purchasing transactions per capita, with an average value of about $ 70. At the end of the year, Americans owed nearly $ 500 billion dollars, in the range of $ 1, 800 for every man, woman, and child in the population. Although the individual credit card transaction is small and routine, the transactions collectively {{have a significant effect on}} the overall stability of many American families, leading to a rise in consumer borrowing and an increase in bankruptcy filing rates. The crux of the borrowing problem is the relationship between the cardholder and the issuer, which the law relegates almost entirely to the private contractual relationships between those groups. Yet the existing literature has done little to assess the unique contracting problems that those transactions present. That is not to say that scholars. have overlooked credit cards. On the contrary, some scholars have noticed the lengthy fine-print agreements that issuers tender to their cardholders. Thus, credit cards have become a common topic in the boilerplate literature that culminates in the symposium for which this Article is prepared. The branch of that literature focused on consumer contracts explores the extent to which voluminous terms in adhesion contracts become enforceable without the type of voluntary and informed assent on which the paradigm of contract law rests. At the same time, other scholars have become increasingly concerned about the likelihood that cognitive and behavioral limitations restrict the ability of consumers to evaluate borrowing transactions effectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} a robust system for {{enabling}} robots {{to detect and}} identify humans in domestic environments is proposed. Here presented <b>a</b> sample model <b>on</b> <b>a</b> live human detection and tracking system based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> microcontroller. In <b>recent</b> <b>days</b> the high speed wireless technologies are improving day by day {{in the field of}} automation applications. Using these advanced technologies a fast, accurate, new robotic controlling device based on advanced control algorithms are developed. The critical part of the system is the microcontroller unit interfaced to the robotic circuitry; the mechanical movements are monitored and controlled by the micro controller in control circuitry. To detect the live person we are using PIR sensor called as passive infrared sensor which is used to detect the persons whether they are alive or not. The remote uses certain range of Radio frequencies which is used to transfer the commands from the remote to the robot. By using this we can change the directions of the robot. The CPU of the robot is a microcontroller (AT 89 C 52). The power is derived from a set of three 9 V batteries. Locomotion is with the help of two geared motors attached to the chassis. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I...|$|R
