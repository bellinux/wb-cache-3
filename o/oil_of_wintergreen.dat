50|$|This {{is a small}} woody {{perennial}} reaching a maximum height and width of about 20 centimeters, including its inflorescence. Its rounded or spade-shaped, woolly, petioled leaves are located {{at the base of}} the plant; their resemblance to the leaves <b>of</b> <b>wintergreens</b> (genus Pyrola) gives the species its name.|$|R
5000|$|On May 12, 1868, the United States Patent Office {{granted a}} patent to Dr. Samuel Pitcher (1824-1907) of Barnstable, Massachusetts, for a cathartic {{composed}} of senna, sodium bicarbonate, essence <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen,</b> taraxacum, sugar and water. [...] The remedy was initially sold {{under the name}} Pitcher's Castoria. Over time the product formula has changed.|$|R
50|$|While usually due to aspirin, other {{possible}} causes include <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> and bismuth subsalicylate. Excess doses {{can be either}} on purpose or accidental. Small amounts of <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> can be toxic. Diagnosis is generally based on repeated blood tests measuring aspirin levels and blood gases. While a type of graph has been created to try to assist with diagnosis, its general use is not recommended. In overdose maximum blood levels may not occur for more than 12 hours.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{yellow birch}} {{has been used}} for distilling wood alcohol, acetate of lime and for tar and oils. <b>Oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> can be {{distilled}} from the bark.|$|E
50|$|Betula lenta {{was used}} commercially {{in the past}} for {{production}} of <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> before modern industrial synthesis of the oil; the tree's name reflects the wintergreen scent of the shoots.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit of}} many Gaultheria species is edible, {{particularly}} that of salal, which makes an excellent jelly. One, the American wintergreen or eastern teaberry, G. procumbens, {{is the traditional}} source <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> flavouring; {{it is called the}} eastern teaberry because its leaves {{can be used to make}} a tea, and its berries can be eaten as are. The fruit of most other Gaultheria species is insipid in flavour and not extensively consumed.|$|R

50|$|Methyl {{salicylate}} (<b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> or wintergreen oil) is {{an organic}} ester naturally produced by {{many species of}} plants, particularly wintergreens. It is also synthetically produced, used as a fragrance, in foods and beverages, and in liniments.|$|E
50|$|The first peoples had {{techniques}} {{for dealing with}} disease. Medicines included those made from high bush cranberries, <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> and bloodroot. A type of tea made from the bark of the spruce or hemlock could prevent or cure scurvy.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, a 10,000 acre {{tract of}} land known as The Big Survey, located {{in the heart of}} Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains and home {{to a wide variety of}} forestry, timberland, and wildlife, was {{purchased}} by a group of investors. Within a few years, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes of Boston purchased The Big Survey, and the planning <b>of</b> <b>Wintergreen</b> began. The Sea Pines Company soon joined the group to plan and market the area and a new community.|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s, Wint-O-Green Life Savers {{were used}} to create soda geysers. The tubes of candies were {{threaded}} onto a pipe cleaner and dropped into the soft drink to create a geyser. At {{the end of the}} 1990s, the manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>Wintergreen</b> Lifesavers increased the size of the mints and they no longer fit in the mouth of soda bottles. Science teachers found that Mint Mentos candies had the same effect when dropped into a bottle of any carbonated soft drink.|$|R

60|$|The {{room was}} beautifully furnished; but the chairs, tables, {{pictures}} and ornaments were all composed of candy of some sort, {{and there was}} a fragrant odor <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen,</b> peppermint and rose about the room that made Tot's mouth water in delightful anticipation. The boy seated himself in a pretty pink and white chair, and Dot sat down upon a small sofa; but happening to remember the sofa was candy, she quickly arose and remained standing, although she was also a little afraid of the sticky floor, which seemed to be well powdered.|$|R
50|$|The Jason Skinner House {{stands on}} the south side <b>of</b> <b>Wintergreen</b> Circle, a loop of public housing {{adjacent}} to the municipal office and library complex in central Harwinton.

The possessed Slade then seemingly murdered Wintergreen, mounting his severed head on a wall as he vowed that [...] "Deathstroke hunts alone." [...] Before his death, Wintergreen had apparently believed that he would inevitably be murdered by Slade, evidenced by his last words, [...] "I suppose {{it was only a}} matter of time." [...] Slade would forever be haunted by his mentor's dying words.|$|R
50|$|Most {{instances}} of human toxicity due to methyl salicylate {{are a result}} of over-application of topical analgesics, especially involving children. Some people have intentionally ingested large amounts of <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen.</b> Salicylate, the major metabolite of methyl salicylate, may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in an autopsy.|$|E
50|$|The root {{product is}} called Senegae Radix, Radix Senegae, or simply senega. Active {{compounds}} include saponins such as senegin, {{as well as}} phenolic acids, sorbitol derivatives, methyl salicylate (<b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen),</b> and sterols. The expectorant property comes from the irritation of mucous membranes by the saponins, which causes an increase in respiratory secretions {{and a decrease in}} their viscosity, giving a productive cough.|$|E
5000|$|Many organic {{compounds}} {{are produced by}} plants {{for the purpose of}} defending the host plant from predation. A trivial case is tree rosin, which is a natural insecticide. Specific, the production of oleoresin by conifer species is a component of the defense response against insect attack and fungal pathogen infection. [...] Many fragrances, e.g. <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen,</b> are in fact antifeedants.|$|E
40|$|The net {{mineralization}} {{of organic}} sulfur compounds in surface sediments <b>of</b> <b>Wintergreen</b> Lake was estimated from a mass-balance budget of sulfur inputs and sediment sulfur concentrations. The net mineralization of organic sulfur inputs is 80 % of total sulfur) in sediment. Although sediment sulfur is predominantly organic, sulfate reduction {{is the most}} significant process in terms of the quantities of sulfur transformed in surface sediments. Rates of sulfate reduction in these sediments average 7 mmol/m 2 per day. On an annual basis, this rate is 19 -fold greater than net rates of organic sulfur mineralization and 65 -fold greater than sulfate ester hydrolysis...|$|R
50|$|Odorizers {{are used}} in carbon dioxide fire {{extinguisher}} systems, the odorizer assembly injects wintergreen oil into the carbon dioxide stream when the agent is discharged. Approximately 50 cc <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> contained within a frangible glass cartridge is mounted within a protective housing attached to the discharge piping {{in such a manner}} as to rupture the glass container when the carbon dioxide manifold is pressurized during discharge, atomizing the oil and dispersing it. The strong wintergreen scent effectively notifies the occupants of the presence of carbon dioxide gas after carbon dioxide has been discharged into the hazard.|$|R
50|$|Both yellow, {{and sweet}} birch have nearly {{identical}} leaf shape and both give an odor <b>of</b> <b>wintergreen</b> when crushed. To differentiate {{the two species}} the range, buds, or bark must be examined. The ranges do overlap in Appalachia where they commonly grow together, but black birch does not grow west of Ohio or north into Canada whereas yellow birch does. Black also has black non-peeling bark compared to the lighter, bronze colored, peeling bark of yellow birch. For young trees where bark has not yet developed, yellow birch can also be identified by its has hairy buds and stems; sweet birch has hairless buds.|$|R
