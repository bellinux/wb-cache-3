40|$|Disposal of damaged {{proteins}} and protein aggregates {{is a prerequisite}} for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and impairment of this disposal can lead to a broad range of pathological conditions, most notably in brain-associated disorders including Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases, and cancer. In this respect, the Protein Quality Control (PQC) pathway plays {{a central role in the}} clearance of damaged proteins. The Hsc/Hsp 70 -co-chaperone BAG 3 has been described as a new and critical component of the PQC in several cellular contexts. For example, the expression <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 in the rodent brain correlates with the engagement of protein degradation machineries in response to proteotoxic stress. Nevertheless, little is known about the molecular events assisted by BAG 3. Here we show that ectopic expression <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 in glioblastoma cells leads to the activation of an HSF 1 -driven stress response, as attested by transcriptional activation <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 and Hsp 70. BAG 3 overexpression determines an accumulation of ubiquitinated {{proteins and}} this event requires the N-terminal region, WW domain <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 and the association <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 with Hsp 70. The ubiquitination mainly occurs on BAG 3 -client proteins and the inhibition of proteasomal activity results in a further accumulation of ubiquitinated clients. At the cellular level, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 in glioblastoma cell lines, but not in non-glial cells, results in a remarkable decrease in colony formation capacity and this effect is reverted when the binding <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 to Hsp 70 is impaired. These observations provide the first evidence for an involvement <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 in the ubiquitination and turnover of its partners...|$|R

40|$|Caspase-mediated {{cleavage}} and proteasomal {{degradation of}} ubiquitinated proteins are two independent mechanisms for {{the regulation of}} protein stability and cellular function. We previously reported BAG 3 overexpression protected ubiquitinated clients, such as AKT, from proteasomal degradation and conferred cytoprotection against heat shock. We hypothesized that the BAG 3 protein is regulated by proteolysis. Staurosporine (STS) {{was used as a}} tool to test for caspase involvement in BAG 3 degradation. MDA 435 and HeLa human cancer cell lines exposed to STS underwent apoptosis with a concomitant time and dose-dependent loss <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3, suggesting the survival role <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 was subject to STS regulation. zVAD-fmk or caspase 3 and 9 inhibitors provided a strong but incomplete protection of both cells and BAG 3 protein. Two putative caspase cleavage sites were tested: KEVD (BAG 3 (E 345 A/D 347 A)) within the proline-rich center <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 (PXXP) and the C-terminal LEAD site (BAG 3 (E 516 A/D 518 A)). PXXP deletion mutant and BAG 3 (E 345 A/D 347 A), or BAG 3 (E 516 A/D 518 A) respectively slowed or stalled STS-mediated BAG 3 loss. BAG 3, ubiquitinated under basal growth conditions, underwent augmented ubiquitination upon STS treatment, while there was no increase in ubiquitination <b>of</b> the <b>BAG</b> 3 (E 516 A/D 518 A) caspase-resistant mutant. Caspase and proteasome inhibition resulted in partial and independent protection <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 whereas inhibitors <b>of</b> both blocked <b>BAG</b> 3 degradation. STS-induced apoptosis was increased when BAG 3 was silenced, and retention <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 was associated with cytoprotection. BAG 3 is tightly controlled by selective degradation during STS exposure. Loss <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 under STS injury required sequential caspase cleavage followed by polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The need for dual regulation <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 in apoptosis suggests a key role for BAG 3 in cancer cell resistance to apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|Autophagy is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved, selective degradation pathway {{of cellular}} components {{that is important}} for cell homeostasis under healthy and pathologic conditions. Here we demonstrate that {{an increase in the}} level <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 results in stimulation of autophagy in glioblastoma cells. BAG 3 is a member of a co-chaperone family of proteins that associates with Hsp 70 through a conserved BAG domain positioned near the C-terminus of the protein. Expression <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 is induced by a variety of environmental changes that cause stress to cells. Our results show that BAG 3 overexpression induces autophagy in glioma cells. Interestingly, inhibition of the proteasome caused an increase in BAG 3 levels and induced autophagy. Further analysis using specific siRNA against BAG 3 suggests that autophagic activation due to proteosomal inhibition is mediated by <b>BAG</b> 3. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 domain mutants suggest that the WW domain <b>of</b> <b>BAG</b> 3 is crucial for the induction <b>of</b> autophagy. <b>BAG</b> 3 overexpression also increased the interaction between Bcl 2 and Beclin- 1, instead of disrupting them, suggesting that BAG 3 induced autophagy is Beclin- 1 independent.
