25|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} {{differences of}} a Melway-style map from other Australian street directories {{is in the}} rendering of roads. Rather than the traditional drawing of two lines with the road name printed in-between, (known as 'double casing') Melway maps show a single line with the name above or below the road, in many colours reflecting the identity or usage of the road. This allows for much more detail {{to fit into the}} same size map, as well as showing dual carriageways, slip lanes, service roads, speed bumps, roundabouts, and <b>other</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Handbook of Alpha Kappa Psi is a {{comprehensive}} information source and guide for members and officers of the Fraternity. [...] The publication includes topics such as a detailed history of AKPsi, a directory of notable alumni, organizational structure, awards, emblems, alumni information, chapter administration, finances, public relations, ritual, {{and a great deal}} of <b>other</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information.</b> The origin of the handbook is traced to 1926 when Ralph L. Power of Nu Chapter, issued a publication titled Handbook of Alpha Kappa Psi, a Manual for Nu Chapter. [...] The handbook was first published Fraternity-wide in 1934, and it has since been followed by several more comprehensive and revised editions. [...] The last edition published was the seventh edition in 1997, edited by Theodore G. Ehrsam. [...] Ehrsam was also working on the eighth edition before he entered Audit Eternal in July 2004. The eighth edition was to be published in fall 2004 as part of the Fraternity's Centennial Celebration.|$|E
2500|$|Scouting of {{the route}} began on May 16, and Mullan lead the work crew out on July 1. The road headed north to Fort Taylor, where the Snake River was crossed with pontoon boats. One man drowned during the {{crossing}}. After crossing the Snake, the crew began leaving wooden mile markers, sometimes also inscribed with information about distance to the nearest water or <b>other</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information.</b> An old branding iron with the letters [...] "M" [...] and [...] "R" [...] on {{it was used to}} inscribe each marker. Mullan intended the initials to mean [...] "Military Road", but the crew began using them to mean [...] "Mullan Road". The crew also made the first longitudinal observations north of 42 degrees latitude, and made maps of the territory which remained the best for another 50 years. In mid-July, the crew reached Lake Coeur d'Alene. Mullan decided to build the road on the shortest route past the lake, which was along the southern edge. Unfortunately, this meant a rapid, [...] descent into the Valley of the St. Joe River, and then an extremely difficult passage through dense timber and heavy underbrush. Massive, fallen trees blocked the route every few feet, and boulders, some of them half-buried, had to be blasted or rolled out of the way. It took eight days just to reach the valley floor. Mullan then encountered a large swamp, which his crew bridged with a corduroy road. Reaching the [...] St. Joe River, the crew built two flat-bottomed boats to serve as a ferry, since building a bridge was not practical. The work crew reached the Coeur d'Alene Mission on August 16, having blazed [...] of road.|$|E

40|$|Laser-ultrasound spectroscopy, a {{non-contact}} ultrasonic {{technique was}} used to characterize a zinc coating on a steel substrate. This characterization is based on fitting the measured velocity dispersion of surface acoustic waves (SAW) to the dispersion calculated using the conjugates gradients algorithm (C. G). A short laser pulse {{was used to}} generate a wideband pulse of ultrasound and a laser interferometer was used for its detection. From {{a large number of}} echoes we identified the one corresponding to the SAW. Furthermore <b>other</b> <b>useful</b> <b>informations</b> were obtained from these data like attenuation and surface skimming longitudinal wave velocity. Measurements of the velocity dispersion of the Rayleigh wave were achieved up to 50 MHz.
