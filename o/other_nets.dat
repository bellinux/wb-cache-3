5000|$|Sending {{a message}} to a U-boat usually began with Rear Admiral Dönitz (Commander of the Submarines, German: Befehlshaber der U-Boote, abbr. BdU) who {{maintained}} tight control on U-boat operations. The Officer of the watch would take the message, timestamp it, and hand it to the duty radio technician watch officer for encryption. Fifteen to twenty radiomen worked per shift enciphering and deciphering messages. As only officers could set the rotor positions, which remained in force for two days, the watch officer set every Enigma with a new inner key, bar one, just before midnight every second day. One Engima cipher machine remained on the previous key setting to decipher late messages. After the officer completing setting the rotors, the radio technician configured the Plugboard and turned the rotors to the key. When the Engima was configured, the message was enciphered and then immediately deciphered on another Enigma {{to ensure that it}} could be read. If readable, it was sent to the appropriate location. To do that, the radio technician determined the location of the target, usually a U-boat, and the specific circuit to transmit it on (Cryptochannel, Telecommunication circuit). Naval Command had several geographical nets, the Kriegsmarine version of the German Naval Grid System ( [...] Marinequadratkarte), which were called, Amerika A, for the northern Atlantic area, Amerika B for the southern Atlantic area, Afrika 1 and 2, Ireland and others.

40|$|Gate sizing is a {{practical}} and a feasible crosstalk noise correction technique in the post route design stage, especially for block level sea-of-gates designs. The difficulty in gate sizing for noise reduction is that by increasing a driver size, noise at the driver output is reduced, but noise injected by that driver on <b>other</b> <b>nets</b> is increased. This can create cyclical dependencies between nets in the circuit with noise violations. In this paper, we propose a fast and effective heuristic post-route gate sizing algorithm that uses a graph representation of the noise dependencies between nodes.

The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown on several high performance designs. ...|$|E

In such a multi-layer routing technology, one of the important objective functions is via-minimization, that is, the number of vias should be kept as small as possible.

TPR is a layer assignment method which assigns each net to one of the layers without crossing <b>other</b> <b>nets</b> in the same layer. Although an optimum TPR is unfortunately known as an NP-complete problem, it can be approximately solved in polynomial time for the channel layout model as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem using a flow graph.

40|$|A {{compatibility}} graph-based, {{general area}} router for integrated circuit (IC) designs is presented. The highly flexible constraint system allows {{a number of}} modern and mixed-signal routing requirements to be handled, even for {{a large number of}} nets. The IC router can efficiently construct near-minimal Steiner trees for multi-terminal nets in both classical rectilinear, or Manhattan, geometry as well as octilinear geometries. These Steiner trees can be constructed around blockages, and in the presence of obstacles such as <b>other</b> <b>nets.</b> A method for routing trees through weighted areas is also introduced. The routing system can predict congested routing areas before routing is performed, and appropriately weight congested areas in order to reduce net congestion. Finally, a fast crosstalk violation checker can run alongside the routing engine. Each portion of the router is bounded by O(n log(n)) runtime, or less, making the entire routing process bounded by the same runtime. The system thus scales well to handle {{a very large number of}} exact routes in a fully mixed-signal aware engine, in either rectilinear or newly-introduced octilinear geometries...|$|E

40|$|While the short-run {{financial}} status of Social Security is secure, its long-run {{financial status}} is very uncertain. The retirement and disability {{part of the}} system (OASDI) is projected to be in long-run actuarial deficit under the Social Security Administration's intermediate economic and demographic f 9 recasts. Hospital Insurance (HI) is projected to run a large deficit, beginning in the 1990 s. OASDI is projected to accrue a very large surplus over the next thirty years, peaking at almost 30 % of GNP. Social Security has never accrued a surplus this large; it may well be dissipated for other purposes, such as to bail out HI, fund other programs, raise benefits, or cut taxes. These alternatives may affect net national saving, directly because Social Security surpluses or deficits are part of government sector saving and indirectly through effects on private saving or the non-Social Security part of the federal government budget. This paper documents how various systematic deviations from, or return to, pay-as-you-go finance of the Social Security system may affect net national saving. For example, under base case assumptions with respect to the non-Social Security deficit, a constant net private saving rate of 6 %, and long-run budget balance in the state and local government sector, the Social Security deficit offsets 40 % of <b>other</b> <b>net</b> national saving over the Social Security Administration's 75 -year projection period. In the first 25 -year sub-period, the Social Security surplus adds one-sixth to <b>other</b> <b>net</b> national saving; in the second, it offsets almost one-half; and in the third, it offsets five-sixths of <b>other</b> <b>net</b> national saving. Of course, private saving may respond to changes in Social Security's funding as may the non-Social Security balance in the federal budget. The paper presents several alternative scenarios such as benefits increasing or taxes falling during the OASDI surplus period, various stylized rules concerning the non-Social Security budget deficit, and separate balancing of HI via outlay reductions or tax increases. The results indicate that OASDI may effect net national saving substantially. For example, if benefits ratchet up during what would have been the period of the OASDI surplus, the OASDI system may subsequently offset virtually all of remaining net national saving. On the other hand, if HI is brought into balance and the OASDI surplus is allowed to accrue, Social Security will offset only about 4 % of <b>other</b> <b>net</b> national saving. Changes in private saving may accentuate or ameliorate the swings in the net national saving rate generated by the future financing of OASDHI, but the alternative financing options will be important determinant of net national saving, and therefore of private domestic investment and international capital flows. ...|$|R
