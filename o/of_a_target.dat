5|$|In 1942, during World War II, Birch took a {{leave of}} absence from Harvard, in order to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Radiation Laboratory, which was {{developing}} radar. He worked on the proximity fuze, a radar-triggered fuze that would explode a shell in the proximity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target.</b> The following year he accepted a commission in the United States Navy as a lieutenant commander, and was posted to the Bureau of Ships in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target {{is not in the}} array.|$|E
30|$|STATE 3 : Occlusion causes <b>a</b> <b>target</b> to {{be hidden}} and not identified. Therefore, the {{duration}} of the estimation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target’s</b> position is extended until the estimated position is moving out of Region B. Non-target objects/people have also been tracked in this state. All of the objects/people within 0.5  m <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target’s</b> estimated position are tracked. This procedure allows for re-identification after long-term occlusion.|$|R

5|$|Some {{events have}} bonus stages that add to a player's score, {{even if it}} has already reached the maximum number. In the skydiving, rocket belt, and hang glider modes, landing on moving {{platforms}} rewards players with a perfect score, and a bonus stage for extra points may be earned by falling into the water <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> area. These stages include maneuvering a diving penguin into a pool, bouncing a winged man across a series of trampolines, and flying another winged man as far as possible.|$|E
5|$|The above {{procedure}} only performs exact matches, {{finding the}} position <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> value. However, {{due to the}} ordered nature of sorted arrays, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches. For example, binary search {{can be used to}} compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} many gameplay {{elements of}} the original Final Fantasy VII, including a three-member party structure and adaptations of the game's subsystems. The items, spells and equipment available to the player are based upon those in the original game, and although a large number have been omitted along with optional characters and some side quests, the original story was reproduced in very minute detail. The game was received with mixed reception, cited as an impressive achievement {{but at the same}} time criticized for its difficulty and choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> console.|$|E

5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the secondary structure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E
5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>target.</b> Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Target</b> store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E

That is, three-dimensional measurement can be obtained with the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single CCD camera. To facilitate the measurement using various kinds of CCD cameras, parameters pertinent to the cameras can be established via a proposed mechanism in this paper. As a result, any kinds of CCD cameras {{can be used to}} perform three dimensional measurement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>targeted</b> object via software implementation of the proposed measuring method.
