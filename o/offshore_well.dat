2500|$|The site of Canada's first {{salt water}} <b>offshore</b> <b>well</b> was [...] off {{the shores of}} Prince Edward Island. Spudded in 1943, the Hillsborough #1 well was drilled by the Island Development Company. The company used a {{drilling}} island constructed in [...] of water of wood and some 7,200 tonnes (7,086 L/T or 7,937 S/T) of rock and concrete. The well reached [...] {{at a cost of}} $1.25 million – an extremely expensive well in that era. Part of the Allied war effort, Hillsborough was declared dry and abandoned in September 1945.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2005 Devon Energy started {{drilling}} {{the first}} <b>offshore</b> <b>well</b> in Canadian {{waters of the}} Beaufort sea since 1989, from the drilling rig SDC. The SDC (or Steel Drilling Caisson) was built for Canmar in 1982 by attaching the forebody of the Very Large Crude Carrier World Saga {{to the top of}} a steel barge with sloping sides (mimicking an artificial island); the barge can be ballasted to sit on the bottom for drilling operations. The Paktoa C-60 well was completed in 2006, but results are unknown as it was designated a [...] "tight hole" [...] – a well for which, for competitive reasons, no information could be released.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{commercial}} {{deposits of}} minerals {{have not been}} found, exploration in the 1940s for natural gas beneath the northeastern end of the province resulted in the discovery of an undisclosed quantity of gas. The Island was reported by government to have only 0.08tcf of [...] "technically recoverable" [...] natural gas. Twenty exploration wells for hydrocarbon resources have been drilled on Prince Edward Island and offshore. The first reported well was Hillsborough No.#1, drilled in Charlottetown Harbour in 1944 (the world’s first <b>offshore</b> <b>well),</b> {{and the most recent}} was New Harmony No.#1 in 2007. Since the resurgence of exploration in the mid-1990s, all wells that have shown promising gas deposits have been stimulated through hydraulic fracture or “fracking”. All oil and natural gas exploration and exploitation activities on the Island are governed by the Oil and Natural Gas Act R.S.P.E.I. 1988, Cap. 0-5 and its associated regulations and orders.|$|E

2500|$|Normally, an <b>offshore</b> <b>well</b> {{would have}} been built with at least [...] of {{conductor}} casing, as required by federal regulations at the time, as well as approximately [...] of a secondary, inner steel tube known as the surface casing. [...] Both of these protective casings were intended to prevent blowout of high-pressure gas out of {{the sides of the}} well bore into and through adjacent geologic formations. [...] At Well A-21, this is exactly what happened. [...] Since there was no casing below [...] sufficient to stop the immense pressure of gas, once the well was plugged at the rig, the oil and gas left the well bore, ripping right through the soft sandstones {{on the floor of the}} Santa Barbara Channel, and spewing a huge amount of oil and gas all the way to the water surface where a thick bubbling oil slick quickly began to grow and spread.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Golden Lane" [...] ("Dos Bocas-Alamo structure" [...] or The Ridge") {{refers to}} a series of oil fields aligned in an arc onshore and a {{symmetrical}} alignment offshore, forming two sides of a Cretaceous atoll 180km long. The structure was discovered in 1908 by Weetman Pearson's Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company San diego de la Mar No. 1 well, which flowed 2,500 bbl/day. The Golden Lane oil fields penetrate a massive elliptical reef platform, identified as the Sierra del Abra limestone (consisting of reef, backreef and lagoonal facies), which dips southeast. The site for the discovery well was selected due to the presence of petroleum seeps, just as was Edward Laurence Doheny's La Paz No. well in the Ebano-Panuco petroleum district west of Tampico, Tamaulipas, the first Mexican discovery well in 1904. In 1908, the infamous Dos Bocas oil fire occurred after the San Diego de la Mar No. 3 blowout. This was followed by the Potrero del Llano No. 4 well, flowing 100,000 bbl per day during the three months it was out of control. Doheny's Cerro Azul No. 4 well, located by Ezequiel Ordonez, became the largest daily production record holder in 1916 at 260,000 bbl. Geophysical studies, in particular gravimetry, starting in 1920 led to the discovery of the Poza Rica Field in 1932 and Moralillo Field in 1948, on the west flank of the Golden Lane in the Tamabra forereef facies. Refraction seismography surveys started in 1930, augemented in 1948 with reflection seismography, which led to the discovery of the southern extent of the atoll with the Ezequiel Ordonez No. 1 well in 1952 and additional discoveries through 1968. Marine seismic and magnetometer surveys starting in 1957 showed the extent of the atoll offshore and led to the first <b>offshore</b> <b>well,</b> Isla de Lobos No. 1-B, in 1963. The depths of wells are on the order of 500 m onshore and 2000 m offshore.|$|E

40|$|The Algarve Basin, {{southern}} Portugal is under-explored {{in terms}} of petroleum geology. Organic maturation levels and the thermal history of this basin have been ascertained, together with their implications for future exploration. Maturity was determined using vitrinite reflectance and spore fluorescence/colour. The succession was extensively sampled (158 onshore samples and 20 samples from two <b>offshore</b> <b>wells).</b> Thermal history was modelled using 1 D PetroMod®. A palynostratigraphic study of two <b>offshore</b> <b>wells</b> was also completed, showing thick marl–limestone sequences of Middle and Upper Jurassic age. Hiatuses were identified in the <b>offshore</b> <b>wells</b> within the Jurassic section and between the Jurassic and the Miocene sections. The Mesozoic rocks of the Algarve Basin lie within the oil window. Vitrinite reflectance ranges from 0. 52 – 0. 7 %Rr in the Lower Cretaceous to 1 – 1. 1 %Rr in the Upper Triassic–Hettangian. Miocene rocks that unconformably overlie the Mesozoic strata are immature (0. 42 – 0. 47 %Rr). Maturation levels increase with increasing age of the strata, indicating that burial was the main process controlling maturation. Thick marl–limestone sequences of the Middle Jurassic (Callovian) and the Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) are the main source rock intervals. The Miocene successions of both <b>offshore</b> <b>wells</b> contains reworked vitrinite and palynomorphs with maturation levels similar to the Mesozoic rocks of the basin, suggesting exposure and erosion of these rocks during Miocene times. Palaeogeothermal gradients in the onshore Algarve Basin range from 52 °C/km to 24. 7 °C/km with pre-Miocene exhumation estimated at 2000 – 2500 m. The probable age for the removed cover is Upper Cretaceous to Lower Palaeocene(?) and peak temperatures in the Mesozoic rocks were attained during latest Cretaceous–Early Palaeocene times. Modelled palaeotemperatures suggest that the Jurassic entered the oil-window {{at the beginning of}} the Cretaceous with peak oil generation in late Cretaceous time...|$|R
30|$|However, these {{previous}} works {{were focused on}} superheated steam (or multi-component thermal fluid), which cannot be {{used to analyze the}} flow behaviors of SCW in wellbores. At present, the study on SCW flow in wellbores was very limited. This paper moves one step forward to develop a numerical model for simulating SCW flow in offshore wellbores. There are mainly three contributions of this paper to the existing body of the literature: (1) a numerical model is developed for SCW flow in <b>offshore</b> <b>wells</b> with consideration of turbulent flow of seawater. (2) Type curves of SCW flow in <b>offshore</b> <b>wells</b> were obtained by finite difference method on space and iteration technique.

50|$|While the {{location}} of the well will be a large factor in the type of equipment used to drill it, there is actually little difference in the well itself. An <b>offshore</b> <b>well</b> targets a reservoir that happens to be underneath an ocean. Due to logistics, drilling an <b>offshore</b> <b>well</b> is far more costly than an onshore well.
