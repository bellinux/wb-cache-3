2500|$|The {{market price}} of a bond may be quoted {{including}} the <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> since the last coupon date. (Some bond markets include <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> in the trading price and others add it on separately when settlement is made.) The price including <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> {{is known as the}} [...] "full" [...] or [...] "dirty price". (See also Accrual bond.) The price excluding <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> is known as the [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "clean price".|$|R
2500|$|The price can be {{quoted as}} clean or dirty. [...] "Dirty" [...] {{includes}} {{the present value}} of all future cash flows, including <b>accrued</b> <b>interest,</b> and is most often used in Europe. [...] "Clean" [...] does not include <b>accrued</b> <b>interest,</b> and is most often used in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|An accrual bond is a fixed-interest {{bond that}} is issued at its face value and repaid {{at the end}} of the {{maturity}} period together with the <b>accrued</b> <b>interest.</b> In Germany, the <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> is compounded. In contrast to zero-coupon bonds, accrual bonds have a clearly stated coupon rate.|$|R

5000|$|To {{separate}} out {{the effect of}} the coupon payments, the <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> between coupon dates is subtracted from the value determined by the dirty price to arrive at the clean price. [...] The <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> is based on the day count convention, coupon rate, and number of days from the preceding coupon payment date.|$|R

5000|$|... 12% {{compounded}} monthly. Because {{interest is}} compounded, {{there is no}} significant <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> account. The current month's obligation becomes part of principal immediately when due. Therefore, there is no issue as to the order in which payments are to be applied. All payments are applied to principal, which includes <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> because interest has been compounded. No grace period.|$|R
2500|$|When a {{borrower}} makes a Pay-Option ARM payment that is {{less than}} the <b>accruing</b> <b>interest,</b> there is [...] "negative amortization", which means that the unpaid portion of the <b>accruing</b> <b>interest</b> is added to the outstanding principal balance. For example, if the borrower makes a minimum payment of $1,000 and the ARM has <b>accrued</b> monthly <b>interest</b> of $1,500, $500 will be added to the borrower's loan balance. Moreover, the next month's interest-only payment will be calculated using the new, higher principal balance.|$|R

5000|$|However, when {{operating}} in a bank, where the amount the bank can lend (and therefore get interest) {{is linked to the}} value of its assets (including <b>accrued</b> <b>interest),</b> traders usually use daily compounding to discount cash flows. Indeed, even if the interest of the bonds it holds (for example) is paid semi-annually, the value of its book of bond will increase daily, thanks to <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> being accounted for, and therefore the bank will be able to re-invest these daily <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> (by lending additional money or buying more financial products).

50|$|There {{are five}} kinds of student loans {{available}} through the government: Perkins Loans, subsidized Stafford Loans, unsubsidized Stafford Loans, direct loans, and PLUS loans. A student's eligibility {{for any of these}} loans, as well as the amount of the loan itself is determined by information on the student's FAFSA. The interest rate and whether or not <b>interest</b> <b>accrues</b> on the loan while the student is in school depends of the type of federal loan. Fro example, subsidized Stafford Loans do not <b>accrue</b> <b>interest</b> while a student is enrolled in a university, whereas unsubsidized Stafford Loans <b>accrue</b> <b>interest</b> as soon as a student receives them.|$|R
50|$|The {{price of}} a bond is {{the present value of}} its future cash-flows. To avoid the impact of the next coupon payment on the {{price of a}} bond, this cash flow is {{excluded}} from the price of the bond and is called the <b>accrued</b> <b>interest.</b> In finance, the dirty price is the price of a bond including any <b>interest</b> that has <b>accrued</b> since issue of the most recent coupon payment. This is to be compared with the clean price, which is the price of a bond excluding the <b>accrued</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|R
