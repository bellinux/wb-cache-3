In Los Angeles, and occasionally returning to New York and elsewhere, Manne recorded with musicians of all schools and styles, ranging from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> era through bebop to later developments in modern jazz, including hard bop, usually seen as the antithesis to the cool jazz frequently associated with West Coast playing.|$|E
5|$|Having first {{established}} {{themselves in}} the West Coast third wave ska scene, the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot. Released {{at the onset of}} the late 1990s swing revival, Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing movement. By the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up Soul Caddy led to an abrupt hiatus in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E

25|$|While lindy hop {{developed}} {{as a response to}} swing jazz in the 1920s and 30s, its popularity today can be largely attributed to the popularity of neo swing music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> revival in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laser tracker to aid <b>the</b> {{alignment}} <b>of</b> a Swing Arm Profilometer (SAP) and measure <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> arm, thus calibrating <b>the</b> operating radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SAP. The measurement uncertainty analysis is given. A laser tracker {{is used to}} align the SAP to ensure <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probe head passes through <b>the</b> rotary axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotary table. By building the coordinate system by laser tracker measurement on the rotary table and measuring <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> arc <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arm, we can determine whether <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probe head passes through <b>the</b> rotary axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotary table and perform the corresponding adjustment if necessary. A laser tracker {{is also used to}} measure the arm length, i. e. the length between the probe's ball centre and <b>the</b> rotation axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> arm. By placing a retroreflector or the tracker ball on <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> arm and scanning <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arm using the laser tracker, we can acquire <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> an arc and fit to determine <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probe head center to rotation axis of swinging arm, thus giving accurate SAP calibration data...|$|R

The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place.|$|E
25|$|By 1904, {{the city}} had {{obtained}} permission to issue bonds to replace the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> bridges on the Chicago River. Ericson sent the Scherzer Company and the Sanitary District specifications for the bridge in 1905. A design by John W. Page, the inventor of a bascule bridge over the Sanitary and Ship Canal, was rejected in March 1905 due to noncompliance to specifications. The Scherzer Company waited until the bidding deadline to submit two separate designs; both of these were also rejected due to noncompliance. Two contracts were bid out for the trunnion style bascule bridge that Ericson had pioneered; one contract for $81,369 (1905) went to the Jackson and Corbett Company for the substructure, and one for $111,983 (1905) went to the Roemheld and Gallery Company for superstructure work.|$|E
25|$|One {{makes an}} {{overhand}} throw, using the sling to extend one's arm. The motion {{is similar to}} bowling a cricket ball. This is relatively accurate, instinctive and quite powerful. One faces 60 degrees away from the target, with one's non-throwing hand closest to the target: thus, imagining the thrower {{at the center of}} a large horizontal circle with the target at the 12 o'clock position, a right-handed thrower would orient one's body toward 2 o'clock, with the arm rotating vertically in the 12 o'clock plane. The coordinated motion is to move every part of the body, legs, waist, shoulders, arms, elbows and wrist in the direction of the target in order to add as much speed as possible to the stone. One releases the projectile near the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing,</b> where the projectile will proceed roughly parallel to the surface of the earth.|$|E
