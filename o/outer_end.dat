5|$|It {{was agreed}} that Broad Street would be closed, with trains {{diverted}} to Liverpool Street once a new connecting chord was built from the North London Line. Until this was done, {{it was possible}} to accommodate this last service from the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of one platform, and, in November that year, demolition of the station began. The remaining single platform was used until 27 June 1986. The station was formally closed on 30 June, along with Dalston Junction, the other station operating on the North London Line's City branch. Demolition of the station was completed by the end of 1986. The service from Watford to Liverpool Street was withdrawn on 28 September 1992, with Primrose Hill station, the only station exclusively served by the route from Watford to the City, being closed at the same time.|$|E

40|$|Three {{fragments}} of reproductive caps {{have been discovered}} in the Sarmatian limestones of Tinnye (Hungary). They are assigned to the genus Acetabularia (Polyphysaceae, formerly Acetabulariaceae). Two of these fragments are quite well preserved with nine rays each. One specimen bears distinct spines at the <b>outer</b> <b>ends</b> of long rays, whereas another one has short rays with rounded <b>outer</b> <b>ends</b> and, possibly, a partially preserved corona. The third fragment is characterized by very elongated rays containing numerous gametangia...|$|R

25|$|The vaginal opening {{is at the}} <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of the vulva, {{posterior}} to {{the opening}} of the urethra, at the posterior end of the vestibule. The opening is closed by the labia minora in female virgins and in females who have never given birth (nulliparae), but may be exposed in females who have given birth (parous females).|$|E
25|$|Between the 14th and 20th years, the {{remaining}} parts ossify in quick succession, and usually in this order; first, in {{the root of}} the coracoid process, {{in the form of a}} broad scale; secondly, near the base of the acromion; thirdly, in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the vertebral border; fourthly, near the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of the acromion; fifthly, in the vertebral border.|$|E

25|$|A {{shoulder}} separation occurs {{where the}} collarbone (clavicle) meets the shoulder blade (scapula). When ligaments {{that hold the}} AC (acromioclavicular) joint together are partially or completely torn, the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of the clavicle may slip out of place, preventing it from properly meeting the scapula. Most often the injury {{is caused by a}} blow to the shoulder or by falling on an outstretched hand. After injury it is hard to do a 180 degrees rotation.|$|E
25|$|Proselyte {{was caught}} in the ice on 5 December and was wrecked at the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of the Anholt reef. The ice pushed her onto her {{starboard}} beam, forcing her crew to abandon her. They then walked, with great difficulty but no losses, eight miles to Anholt Island. Proselyte's loss led the British to send a squadron in May consisting of Standard, Owen Glendower and some smaller vessels to seize Anholt and restore the lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of the roller has to rotate {{much faster than}} the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece roller turned on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{badge of}} the Order is a 70mm wide gilt silver cross pattée, with arms that are flared towards the concave <b>outer</b> <b>ends.</b> [...] The cross obverse is {{enamelled}} in blue. At its {{center is a}} circular red enamelled medallion edged in gold and bearing the gilded coat of arms of the Russian Federation. [...] A green enamelled laurel wreath passes under and near the <b>outer</b> <b>ends</b> of the cross. [...] Golden rays extend between the cross's arms to the laurel wreath. [...] The reverse is plain (golden) and bears the award serial number.|$|R
50|$|These formed, notionally, 34 3-car units Motor-Trailer-Driving Trailer, and 25 2-car units Motor-Trailer. The 2-car units {{only had}} a driving cab {{at one end and}} could not be {{operated}} on their own, only coupled to one of the 3-car units, which was an unusual feature of this stock. It was normal to form the main 5-car sets with the motor cars at the <b>outer</b> <b>ends</b> of the formation, and the trailer coupled to the driving trailer in the centre. The 6-car sets were formed with motor cars at the <b>outer</b> <b>ends</b> of the formation with the driving trailers coupled together in the centre.|$|R

25|$|The Wigtown Bay Sailing Club welcomes all visiting yachtsmen {{whether they}} arrive by sea or by land with trailered boats. The clubhouse is {{situated}} on the harbour and has all the usual facilities. The harbour dries 3 hours either side of high water, {{and there is a}} dedicated visitors' berth at the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of the quay. There are also two slipways for launching trailer boats or dinghies, one of which is at the inner end of the quay and is sheltered in all weathers. The other, which gives access into the bay, can be used at virtually any state of the tide. The club is active throughout the summer with dinghy or cruiser races organised for most weekends and some races mid-week.|$|E
25|$|The T.III's {{alternative}} undercarriages {{were both}} fixed, {{with the two}} legs independent of each, avoiding the cross bracing which would have interfered with the bomb or torpedo release. Each mainwheel was on a horizontal axle supported at the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> by a longitudinal V-strut from the wing underside. There were two more pairs of Vs, one fixed below the wing {{and the other on}} the lower fuselage, angled towards each other to support the inner end of the axle. A tailskid completed the undercarriage. The T.III's twin float undercarriage projected just forward of the nose. The floats were mounted on the fuselage by two sets of N-struts, with diagonal transverse bracing between them, on each float. Both wood and aluminium floats were available. Fitting floats added 243kg (536lb) to the unladened weight and reduced the maximum speed by 11km/h (7mph).|$|E
25|$|Stanton's role in Manny's legal trio {{was as a}} researcher. Though he {{admitted}} that George Harding, an established patent lawyer, was more adept at the scientific aspects of the case, Stanton worked to summarize the relevant jurisprudence and case law. To win McCormick v. Manny for Manny, Stanton, Harding and Watson had to impress upon the court that McCormick had no claim to exclusivity in his reaper's use of a divider, a mechanism on the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of the cutter-bar which separated the grain. A harvesting machine would not have worked properly without a divider, and Manny's defense knew this. However, to assure a win, Watson opted to use duplicity—he employed a model maker named William P. Woods to retrieve an older version of McCormick's reaper and alter it to be presented in court. Woods found a reaper in Virginia which was built in 1844, one year prior to McCormick's patent being granted. He had a blacksmith straighten the curved divider, knowing that the curved divider in Manny's reaper would not conflict with a straight one in McCormick's reaper. After using a salt and vinegar solution to add rust to where the blacksmith had worked to ensure the antiquity of the machine was undeniable, Woods sent the reaper to Cincinnati. Stanton was joyed when he examined the altered reaper, and knew the case was theirs. Arguments for the case began on September 1855. In March 1856, Justices John McLean and Thomas Drummond delivered a ruling in favor of John Manny. McCormick appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and McCormick v. Manny, was, all of a sudden, a political issue, and the matters concerning the case {{found their way to}} the floor of Congress.|$|E

500|$|The forward {{compound}} {{was split}} into lower(C) and upper(B) parts {{by a wall}} linking towers 4 and 7. The entrance(II) is in the lower part, guarded by towers 8 and 9. [...] Tower 8 has, in turn, been fortified with a cannon port. Opposing the entrance was a second portcullis {{that led to the}} rear compound. Along the path was a ditch 0.5metres wide and 0.75metres deep which then became a steep decline. At the <b>outer</b> <b>end</b> of the lower part, and connected to the 9thtower with a low wall, is tower 10, which the Turks added to act as a lower artillery tower. [...] It controlled passage along the Danube and guarded the entrance to the harbour, which was probably situated between towers 5 and 10. There are remains connected to tower 8 which probably formed a larger whole with it, but the lower part did not otherwise contain buildings.|$|E
