5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence collected from Frank's body, there were also samples of residue taken from the air vents and hat rack located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft near {{the leading edge of}} the wing. These samples contained sodium carbonate, sodium nitrate, and mixtures of sodium-sulfur compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a fixed graph H <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> each instance is also called the H-coloring problem. When H is the complete graph K'k, this is the graph k-coloring problem, which is solvable in polynomial time for k = 0, 1, 2, and NP-complete otherwise.|$|E

50|$|Defined anatomically, it is {{the area}} of the {{anterior}} chest wall over the heart. It is therefore usually <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side, except in conditions like dextrocardia, where the individual's heart is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side.</b> In such a case, <b>the</b> precordium is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> as well.|$|R
40|$|A patient, 38 -year-old woman, was {{admitted}} to the Osaka Red-Cross Hospital with the chief complaint of severe flank pain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side.</b> Urological examinations revealed that she had marked hydroureter due to stenosis at <b>the</b> ureterovesical junction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> and <b>the</b> blind-ending bifid ureter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side branching off at 5 cm from the ureteral end. Nephrectomy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> and resection of <b>the</b> bifid ureter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side were performed. This seems to be the first case of the blind-ending bifid ureter having the contralateral anomaly...|$|R
5|$|The {{specimen}} {{had serious}} puncture wounds {{on the front}} of the skull, indicating that it had been preyed upon by a large carnivore. One puncture wound was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the braincase and may have been the fatal blow. There was also a bite mark on the frontal trigon.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} was found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints {{that could not be}} identified.|$|E
5|$|On September 4, 2016, it was {{announced}} that Holiday had previously been diagnosed with a brain tumor during her pregnancy. Her husband chose to take a leave of absence to care for her. The tumor, which was benign, was found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her brain in late June 2016. Holiday gave birth to Jrue Tyler Holiday, a baby girl in September 2016, and the tumor was successfully removed in October.|$|E

5|$|T-26 mod. 1939 in the Kubinka Tank Museum, Moscow Oblast (Russia): this {{tank with}} pressed turret front {{armoured}} plate is in drivable condition (the GAZ-41 engine from the BRDM-2 {{was installed in}} 2005). The tank has combat damage taken during the Great Patriotic War (many marks from armour-piercing bullets and a welded hole <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the turret from a 50mm shell).|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E

5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold {{on the left side of}} the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a restrictive pattern related to obesity.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the screen and the enemies {{on the left side of}} the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral. He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as a warning to others, and then shot. Because No's heart was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his body, the bullet missed it and he survived.|$|E
5|$|The iPad has two {{internal}} speakers reproducing {{left and}} right channel audio located on the bottom-right of the unit. In the original iPad, the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports carved into the device, while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill. A volume switch is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the unit. A 3.5-mm TRRS connector audio-out jack on the top-left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and/or volume controls. The iPad also contains a microphone {{that can be used}} for voice recording.|$|E

5|$|The pudendal nerve is paired, meaning {{there are}} two nerves, {{one on the left}} and one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body. Each is formed as three roots {{immediately}} converge above the upper border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the coccygeus muscle. The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord, and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament. The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth sacral spinal nerves, with the primary contribution coming from the fourth.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} of each patrol adopted their own markings. The New Zealand 'R' Patrol used a green Hei-tiki {{with a red}} tongue painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bonnet of the vehicle, and on the left a Māori place name beginning with the letter 'R' (for example, 'Rotowaro'). The 'T' Patrol vehicles had a black Kiwi over green 'grass' and a Māori name starting with 'Te' (for example, 'Te Anau') in the corresponding places. The 'W' Patrol vehicles had a Māori name or word starting with 'W' painted on their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Vision is {{generated}} by light that hits the retina of the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that {{is sent to the}} visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left visual field is received <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in {{the opposite side of the}} brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex.|$|E
