50|$|The {{exceptions}} are (out of order): objection by the <b>original</b> <b>offeror</b> in advance; objection by the <b>original</b> <b>offeror</b> {{within a reasonable}} time after notice; and material alteration of the contract. The third exception, whether the additional terms materially alter the contract, {{is the most difficult}} to apply. Typically, to show it, the merchant must be subjected to undue hardship and/or surprise {{as a result of the}} varied term, as measured by the industry involved. It is well established that disclaimer of warranty, indemnification, and arbitration are all clauses that do constitute material alterations.|$|E
5000|$|UCC ยง 2-207(3) only applies {{when the}} proviso {{language}} from subsection 1 is used. When the proviso is used, {{there is no}} contract formed at that time unless the <b>original</b> <b>offeror</b> assents to the terms that the party purporting to accept has made [...] "expressly conditional." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{position}} is adhered to in Australia (New South Wales). If a person were {{to accept an}} offer, but make a modification, then they are actually rejecting the offer presented to them and are proposing a counter-offer: Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353. That modifying party is then the one making a new offer, and the <b>original</b> <b>offeror</b> is now {{the one who has}} to accept.|$|E
5000|$|The Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") {{dispenses}} {{with the}} mirror image rule in ยง 2-207. UCC ยง 2-207(1) provides that a [...] "definite and seasonable expression of acceptance...operates as" [...] an acceptance, {{even though it}} varies {{the terms of the}} original offer. Such an expression is typically interpreted as an acceptance when it purports to accept and agrees on the following terms of the original offer: subject matter, quantity, and price. However, such an expression is not interpreted as an acceptance if it is [...] "expressly conditional" [...] on the original offeror's assent to the varied terms, discussed below. This language is known as the proviso. When the proviso is not used, the terms of the contract are determined by subsection 2. When the proviso is used, but there is no assent by the <b>original</b> <b>offeror</b> to the offeree's varied terms, yet the parties go ahead and perform (act like they have a contract, hence a contract implied in fact), the terms of the contract are determined by subsection 3. So, the terms of a contract under 2-207 are never determined by a combination of subsections 2 and 3.|$|E
