40|$|This report {{presents}} a novel interface for musical performance which utilizes a record-player turntable augmented with a computation engine and a high-density optical sensing array. The turntable {{functions as a}} standalone step sequencer for MIDI events transmitted to a computer or another device and it is programmed in real-time using visual disks. The program instructions are represented on printed paper disks directly as characters of English alphabet that could be read by human as effectively as they are {{picked up by the}} machine’s <b>optical</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The result is a tangible interface that allows the user to manipulate pre-arranged musical material by hand, by adding together instrumental tracks to form a dynamic mix. A functional implementation of this interface is discussed in view of historical background and other examples of electronic instruments for music creation and performance incorporating optical turntable as a central element...|$|E

40|$|This {{is a case}} study. It {{deals with}} the use of a 'virtual file system' (VFS) for Boeing's UNIX-based Product Standards Data System (PSDS). One of the {{objectives}} of PSDS is to store digital standards documents. The file-storage requirements are that the files must be rapidly accessible, stored for long periods of time - as though they were paper, protected from disaster, and accumulative to about 80 billion characters (80 gigabytes). This volume of data will be approached in the first two years of the project's operation. The approach chosen is to install a hierarchical file migration system using <b>optical</b> disk <b>cartridges.</b> Files are migrated from high-performance media to lower performance optical media based on a least-frequency-used algorithm. The optical media are less expensive per character stored and are removable. Vital statistics about the removable <b>optical</b> disk <b>cartridges</b> are maintained in a database. The assembly of hardware and software acts as a single virtual file system transparent to the PSDS user. The files are copied to 'backup-and-recover' media whose vital statistics are also stored in the database. Seventeen months into operation, PSDS is storing 49 gigabytes. A number of operational and performance problems were overcome. Costs are under control. New and/or alternative uses for the VFS are being considered...|$|R

50|$|The first {{products}} {{to be released}} in keep cases were VHS tapes, though most were stored in less expensive pressboard sleeves. In the days before video games were released on <b>optical</b> media, <b>cartridges</b> would rarely come packaged in specially designed plastic keep cases with lugs inside to hold the instruction manual, as opposed to pressboard boxes. Cartridges and cards for the Sega Master System platform were the first video games to be packaged in any kind of keep case. The vast majority of Sega Genesis games would come in a plastic keep case (roughly the size of a VHS case), but were later packaged in pressboard boxes, as a cost-cutting measure. Before the standard, commonly used DVD case was invented, early CD-ROM based video games such as Sega CD and early PlayStation titles, would often come in thicker and taller jewel case. These have been reputed to break very easily. Since the PlayStation 2, most major console-based video game software is packaged in some sort of keep case, including Nintendo DS cartridge titles, and Sony PSP titles.|$|R
50|$|In computing, the BIOS {{parameter}} block, often shortened to BPB, is a {{data structure}} in the volume boot record describing the physical layout of a data storage volume. On partitioned devices, such as hard disks, the BPB describes the volume partition, whereas, on unpartitioned devices, such as floppy disks, it describes the entire medium. A basic BPB can appear and be used on any partition, including floppy disks where its presence is often necessary, however, certain filesystems also make use of it in describing basic filesystem structures. Filesystems making use of a BIOS parameter block include FAT12 (except for in DOS 1.x), FAT16, FAT32, HPFS, and NTFS. Due to different types of fields {{and the amount of}} data they contain, the length of the BPB is different for FAT16, FAT32, and NTFS boot sectors. (A detailed discussion of the various FAT BPB versions and their entries {{can be found in the}} FAT article.) Combined with the 11-byte data structure at the very start of volume boot records immediately preceding the BPB or EBPB, this is also called FDC descriptor or extended FDC descriptor in ECMA-107 or ISO/IEC 9293 (which describes FAT as for flexible/floppy and <b>optical</b> disk <b>cartridges).</b>|$|R
