5|$|Applewhite and Nettles sent {{advertisements}} {{to groups}} in California and {{were invited to}} speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded {{about half of the}} 50 attendees to follow them. They also focused <b>on</b> <b>college</b> campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The coverage was negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.|$|E

5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} sleep hygiene education <b>on</b> <b>college</b> campuses.|$|E
5|$|Female {{students}} were {{admitted to the}} college {{for the first time}} in 1987; until then it had been single sex. Since this time the college has become fully mixed, with undergraduate numbers expanding to nearly seven hundred. Expansion caused a strain <b>on</b> <b>college</b> numbers, however, and in 2004 the college was unable to provide accommodation for all of its fresher students {{for the first time in}} its history. Following the foundation of Josephine Butler, Durham's first new college to be opened since 1972, pressure from the university to take on additional students has lessened, and undergraduate numbers have been intentionally reduced in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 4, the {{shooting}} of four students at Kent State protesting against the United States' invasion of Cambodia led directly to the student strike of 1970, a nationwide protest by students <b>on</b> <b>college</b> campuses against US involvement in Vietnam, including at Syracuse. Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E

5|$|The Vietnam War (1955–1975) was an {{important}} issue <b>on</b> <b>college</b> campuses across the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. As a belated response to Vietnam War protesters who believed that funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made the university part of the military–industrial complex, the Stanford Research Institute split from Stanford University in 1970.

5|$|After {{spending}} {{about a decade}} living as a recluse on Mercer Island near Seattle, Russell rose to prominence again {{at the turn of}} the millennium. Russell's Rules was published in 2001, and in January 2006, he convinced Miami Heat superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to bury the hatchet with fellow NBA superstar and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant, with whom O'Neal had a bitter public feud. Later that year, on November 17, 2006, the two-time NCAA winner Russell was recognized for his impact <b>on</b> <b>college</b> basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.

5|$|Animal House was {{the first}} film {{produced}} by National Lampoon, the most popular humor magazine <b>on</b> <b>college</b> campuses in the mid-1970s. The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine’s writers were recent college graduates, hence their appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a Lampoon writer and the magazine’s first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university's elite Spee Club). Kenney {{was responsible for the}} first appearances of three characters that would appear in the film, Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973's National Lampoon’s High School Yearbook, a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P. E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{according}} to agreement, the SPARS enlisted personnel received their indoctrination training <b>on</b> <b>college</b> campuses operated for such by the U.S. Navy.

Beginning in late June, all enlisted personnel received their indoctrination and specialized training there. Some 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were {{given the opportunity to}} train in other fields. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
