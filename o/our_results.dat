30|$|When {{the base}} space (Ω,F,P) of the RN module is trivial, namely F={∅, Ω}, <b>our</b> <b>result</b> {{automatically}} degenerates {{to the classical}} Danes̆ theorem. So <b>our</b> <b>result</b> is a nontrivial random extension.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we compute {{explicitly}} the oscillation constant {{for certain}} half-linear second-order differential equations having different periodic coefficients. <b>Our</b> <b>result</b> covers known result concerning half-linear Euler type differential equations with α—periodic positive coefficients. Additionally, <b>our</b> <b>result</b> {{is new and}} original in case that the least common multiple of these periods is not defined. We give an example and corollaries which illustrate cases that are solved with <b>our</b> <b>result...</b>|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, I was not satisfied. I wanted Brierly, or {{some other}} fifth person, in the room, in order that both of the psychic's hands could be {{controlled}} {{at the same time}} that Mrs. Fowler's were secured. So long as a single hand was left free, the doubter would be warranted in questioning <b>our</b> <b>results.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{observed}} no such synchronism," [...] repeated Fowler. [...] "We {{not only}} controlled Mrs. Smiley's hands, but nailed {{her to her}} chair. In a way, our test was more rigid than those you are describing. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> were not so dramatic, but they were produced under test conditions, and their significance is as great as that of Bottazzi's lamp-lighting." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{rest of our}} {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. In Section  2, we give some preliminary lemmas, which are useful in the proof of <b>our</b> <b>result.</b> In Section  3, we give the detailed proof of <b>our</b> <b>result.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we give a {{positive}} {{answer to the}} question of Fang by proving a new fixed point theorem for a probabilistic φ-contraction in Menger spaces. In <b>our</b> <b>result,</b> the function φ is required to satisfy a more weak condition than (1.1) and the t-norm is not required to be of H-type. <b>Our</b> <b>result</b> improves the corresponding one of Fang [14] and some others. Finally, an example is given to illustrate <b>our</b> <b>result.</b>|$|R
50|$|For simplicity, we {{will use}} the {{discrete}} form of the partition function in this section. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> will apply equally well to the continuous form.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{simplifying}} assumption {{that some of}} the metric coefficients are zero, some of <b>our</b> <b>results</b> in this motivational treatment will not be as general as they could be.|$|E
30|$|We now state <b>our</b> main <b>results.</b> <b>Our</b> first <b>result</b> covers both convex–concave and concave–concave cases.|$|R
30|$|Thus, <b>our</b> <b>result</b> is proved.|$|R

30|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. In Section  2, we provide some definitions and preliminary lemmas, {{which are the}} key tools for <b>our</b> main <b>result.</b> We give and prove <b>our</b> main <b>result</b> in Section  3.

30|$|We {{investigate}} certain sum-difference inequalities in {{two variables}} which provide explicit bounds on unknown functions. <b>Our</b> <b>result</b> {{enables us to}} solve those discrete inequalities considered by Sheng and Li (2008).
