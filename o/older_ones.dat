5|$|In {{the past}} the Norman water supply has also been criticized for the {{presence}} of excessive levels of arsenic. The city is attempting to combat this problem by building new wells and removing <b>older</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brownhills {{has several}} public houses. Although some <b>older</b> <b>ones,</b> {{such as the}} Victorian-era Jolly Collier in Coppice Side, were {{demolished}} in the 1980s, several dating from the 19th century still stand comparatively unchanged, including the Shoulder of Mutton, which still bears windows etched with the emblem of the brewery which owned it in the 1850s. The Station Hotel in the High Street hosted concerts, including an appearance by Black Sabbath in 1968.|$|E
5|$|By 1908 {{there were}} calls for another Royal Commission into Western Australia's penal system. Truth {{newspaper}} repeatedly criticised Fremantle Prison between 1903 and 1910, {{with much of}} the blame placed on the comptroller general and superintendent. Allegations included that new offenders still were not separated from <b>older</b> <b>ones,</b> that regulations were systemically broken, and that prisoners were not paid for the work they did.|$|E
50|$|In Being Human (UK), the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are a {{group of}} vampires of varying ages. They are {{introduced}} with Ivan in series 2, and Hal Yorke, {{a member of the}} series 4-5 trio, is an <b>Old</b> <b>One.</b> Series four's main plot revolves around the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> trying to take over the world. The vampire world takes great effort to prepare for them, including rituals, Cutler's plan, even such things as red carpets. The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are unaffected by religious symbols. Mr. Snow is an <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> and also one of the first vampires, whose blood can be found in every vampire.|$|R
50|$|Old Speech: This is {{the spoken}} {{form of the}} ancient {{language}} of the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b> When an <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> comes to power, this language is used instinctively by the <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> when speaking {{to members of the}} Light or the Dark. Will Stanton begins to do this without even realizing it. When an <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> speaks the <b>Old</b> Speech in front of a normal human, it will sound like gibberish.Some agents of the Dark, such as the Rider, can also speak Old Speech, but with a distinctive accent which gives them away to the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{defeat of}} the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> {{is exactly the same}} as in the past, even down to the minutes before the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> get banished.|$|R
5|$|Khrushchev founded several {{academic}} towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier {{believed that}} Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university {{towns such as}} Oxford, isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger scientists, with <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.|$|E
5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site {{should not be}} used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, and beans, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.|$|E
5|$|While {{their eyes}} rested upon these last {{scenes in the}} home land, the... young people... were perhaps {{thinking}} more of the village greens of Ilchester and Yeovil... and their playmates from whom they were now separated... while the <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> were more likely turning their thoughts toward the unknown sea with some doubts and misgivings mayhap, but yet with stout hearts and strong hopes facing the great adventure that lay before them in a new world.|$|E
50|$|The epic {{deals with}} two white horses owned by Genghis Khan. The younger one feels their {{services}} for the ruler are not being appreciated enough, and tries to convince the <b>older</b> <b>one</b> to move away together. The <b>older</b> <b>one</b> is reluctant, but after the younger one runs away on his own, the <b>older</b> <b>one</b> follows.|$|R
5000|$|Having a close {{connection}} to the Great <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> Bugg-Shash, so should Yibb-Tstll {{be regarded as a}} Great <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> - specifically in the Drowners group introduced by Brian Lumley, parasitic alien entities which thrive by vampyrizing the Great <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> themselves - though in RPG materials she is classed as [...] "Outer God".|$|R
50|$|The {{leader of}} the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> is/was a Great <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> once called Xy who, {{through a series of}} {{circumstances}} and betrayal, forgot his own past and now believes himself to be Thoth, the ancient Egyptian god of Wisdom. It was he, as Thoth, who helped to fashion the super-spell that would finally force the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> into mystic slumber.|$|R
5|$|During the partnership, work {{continued}} on designing new churches and restoring <b>older</b> <b>ones.</b> In 1884–85 a chapel was built at Carlett Park at Eastham in the Wirral and in 1884–87 St Deiniol's Church {{was built in}} Criccieth, Caernarfonshire. Christ Church, Rossett (1886–92), St Paul's Church, Colwyn Bay (1887–88 with later additions), and St Andrew's Church, West Kirby (1889–91) followed. StJohn's Church in Barmouth, Merionethshire was built between 1889 and 1895. It {{is one of the}} largest of Douglas's churches, although in 1891, during its construction, the tower collapsed and had to be rebuilt. Other churches built in North Wales were Christ Church in Bryn-y-Maen, Colwyn Bay, and All Saints, Deganwy (both 1897–99).|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found growing in large numbers, sometimes in clumps, though solitary specimens are occasionally encountered. Several bodies can be connected at their bases, or younger bodies can {{grow out of}} the bases of <b>older</b> <b>ones.</b> The youngest fruit bodies are conical in shape. When the body reaches around 2mm in length, {{the tip of the}} cone begins to expand, forming the head. This is the stage at which the hymenium becomes differentiated {{from the rest of the}} body, and the bodies quickly reach their mature form, maturing only through growth after that point. Fruit bodies can be infected by the mould Hypomyces leotiarum.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} proper {{neuronal}} migration through the cortical plate (CP) is an inside-out arrangement of neurons, where the younger neurons migrate past the older neurons to their proper locations. Studies in reeler mutant mice show that knocking out the reeler gene results in aberrant migration {{as well as}} outside-in layering, in which younger neurons are unable to travel past the <b>older</b> <b>ones.</b> Such abnormal layering is also seen in VLDLR−apoER2− and dab1- mutants, indicating {{the importance of this}} entire pathway in cortical migration of the developing embryo.|$|E
5000|$|They {{arrive to}} find out by Scarlett's {{housekeeper}} that Scarlett's father has rushed her to Hong Kong on apparent [...] "urgent business". Matt is very disappointed by this news and he, Jamie and Richard have a meeting with The Nexus where Matt finally discovers the Old Ones' plan. The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> have trapped Scarlett in Hong Kong, China in hope of luring Matt there too by using Scarlett as the bait. It is then discovered that the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> want the Gatekeepers to have the diary, {{so that they can}} discover where the doors around the world are, and as there is one in Hong Kong the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> hope the Gatekeepers will go through the door where the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> will capture them all and torture them, whilst the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> take over the world. It is then revealed that Scarlett's father works for Nightrise and so will give Scarlett to the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Book II: <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> Second Edition (June 1996) - Describes {{communities}} and forts in the Timiro Kingdom, also gives {{information about the}} <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> minotaurs, and the Place of Magic.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were a {{race that}} had evolved even earlier than the Necrontyr, but along {{substantially}} different lines. Where the Necrontyr developed purely on science and technology, leaving spirituality and mysticism in the dark annals of their history, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> embraced both science and their spirituality. In their alternate philosophies and mystic practices, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> eventually gained access to the primordial Warp, but not the Warp {{as it is known}} in the 41st Millennium. In the days of the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> the Warp was a shining parallel reality where emotions, thoughts, and even dreams were intensely reflected and molded together. Through natural fluency and masterful concentration, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> used the Warp to become a civilization of powerful psykers, with supernatural abilities far exceeding any other sentient race in the galaxy. These abilities gave the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> a harmonious bond with (as well as control over) great cosmic forces, bestowing onto them the gift of immortality and near-omniscience. It is not known why the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> refused to trade or even interact with the expanding Necrontyr empire at the time, however their continual refusal to share their knowledge, most especially on the secrets of immortality, would eventually garner the enmity of the short-lived Necrontyr. This simmering hatred was used as a basis by the Triarchs to wage war with the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
5|$|The usual {{magnetostrictive}} {{materials used}} for the transducer are either ferrite or compressed powdered iron. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially <b>older</b> <b>ones,</b> nickel wire may be {{used for the}} input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E
5|$|By 1957 {{the synagogue}} sanctuary, {{which had been}} {{designed}} for 350 families, had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 {{over half of the}} members, and three-quarters of those with children in the congregational school, lived there. School attendance increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the younger children attending on Saturday and the <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> on Sunday, and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled. In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from office on December 1, 1794, giving Washington two months' notice, {{in the wake of}} his wife Eliza's miscarriage while he was absent during his armed repression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit to Congress to curb the debt problem. Hamilton grew dissatisfied with what he viewed as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> made permanent and stated that any surplus from the excise tax on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. His proposals were included into a bill by Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> created two massive gates at {{the poles}} that allowed instant {{transport}} between the Warhammer world and wherever the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> came from. Later, {{in the coming}} of Chaos, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> either went missing, or sacrificed themselves to try to destroy the polar gates and halt the never-ending tide of Chaos in a cataclysmic explosion. Every race formed by the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> fought against the threat of Chaos, including the great armies of the Lizardmen which consisted of billions of Saurus. After the wars, the Slann immediately put defences and wards in place to better contain the threat of Chaos.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of Warhammer 40,000, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> traveled through space manipulating minor species on several planets and growing them into tools for their {{battle against the}} C'tan. The Slann were probably their servants. Although a reference in the novel Ghostmaker (2000) might indicate that the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> could be the Eldar, all other instances that refer to both the Eldar and the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> make clear that the two are separate races, the Eldar always being less powerful than [...] - [...] and usually servants and/or creations of [...] - [...] the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the frequency of hematoma formation subsequent to injection of dental local anesthetics in 4, 134 children, 3 to 13 years of age. Hematoma formation occurred following 0. 1 % of the injections, all being buccal infiltrations of maxillary molars. This represents a 0. 4 % incidence of hematoma formation subsequent to this injection. There was no age specificity in hematoma formation, occurring in <b>one</b> 5 year <b>old,</b> <b>one</b> 7 year <b>old,</b> <b>one</b> 8 year <b>old,</b> <b>one</b> 10 year <b>old,</b> and <b>one</b> 11 year <b>old...</b>|$|R
5|$|International Speedway Corporation (ISC) is a {{corporation}} whose primary business is the {{ownership and management}} of NASCAR and IndyCar race tracks. ISC was founded by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. in 1953 {{for the construction of}} Daytona International Speedway and in 1999 they merged with Penske Motorsports {{to become one of the}} largest motorsports companies in North America. The company has played an important, though controversial, role in the modernization of the sport. It has worked with NASCAR to create new tracks and update <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> in an effort to improve the racing and the experience for spectators (though because both companies have several members of the France family in top positions, ISC's competitors have filed multiple lawsuits on antitrust grounds) and has constructed popular new tracks in regions previously thought uninterested in NASCAR.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E
