40|$|Olive growers need {{relevant}} information about economic justifications of their {{investments in the}} construction of new olive groves, and about economic effects of olive growing. In that context, the purpose of the research is the analysis of an investment in olive grove establishment and of the economic indicators of production of olives in full growth. The purpose is to establish the economic justification of investments in the olive groves establishment, and to establish the economic effectiveness of olive growing. In the course of work, the method of simulation modeling was applied. For the purpose of the research, a deterministic simulation model was constructed, consisting of a sub-model of olive grove establishment, and a sub-model of olive growing. Total investment value of 1 hectare of olive grove establishment amounts to 65, 500 kn. Profit evaluation indicates that investment of 1 hectare of olive grove establishment is economically justifiable. An olive grove, 1 hectare large, in one year of full yield, makes a profit in the amount of 34, 751 kn, and the <b>olive</b> <b>grower</b> has to evaluate if the economic results satisfy his expectations for the work he put in...|$|E
40|$|The {{productive}} {{performance of}} an olive orchard is strongly {{affected by the}} <b>olive</b> <b>grower</b> capacity in choosing, combining, and properly performing the several agronomical practices, such as fertilization, soil management, irrigation, also {{taking into account the}}ir environmental impact. On the other hand, such expertise is taken into consideration by the recent agricultural European Union policy which supports and encourages the use of production technologies aimed to preserve natural resources. Among agronomical practices, fertilization can induce a ready and effective vegetative-productive response in olive tree. A well balanced and appropriate fertilization should take into account some steady points:  real nutrient needs of olive trees along the different stages of plant life cycle;  soil nutrient availability and tree nutritional status;  synchronization between nutrient requirements by the plants (olive trees and, in case, cover crops) and their availability in soil volume where roots are present;  fertilization techniques and their efficiency;  soil management techniques (spontaneous or seeded cover crops, recycling of pruning material within the orchard, use of manure or compost) and water availability linked to natural conditions (rainfall) or irrigation practice. In the present report some practical suggestions for an appropriate mineral and organic fertilization are reported taking into account the different farm management system...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the study is to study {{diversification}} among Australian <b>olive</b> <b>growers</b> in various regions, as well as perceived opportunities and challenges of olive growing from the perspective of micro <b>olive</b> <b>growers.</b> In doing so, the study considers and adopts the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews with 24 micro <b>olive</b> <b>growers</b> operating in the Australian state of New South Wales were conducted. Findings – The findings partly identify alignment with the TPB. Essentially, attitude or growers’ favourable assessment to diversify appears to determine growers’ intention to implement diversification strategies, including adding value to olive production, and marketing it through tourism. In contrast, subjective norm, which refers to the impact of social influence or pressures, {{in the case of the}} present study to growing olives or to diversifying into olive oil production, was to a great extent disconfirmed. Originality/value – Very limited research has investigated the motivations of micro <b>olive</b> <b>growers,</b> especially in the Southern Hemisphere. In particular, the use of the TPB has been adopted to a very limited extent in the context of micro-farm diversification, including among emerging industries such as olive growing in Australia.

However, the adoption of organic farming is not an easy decision and it carries with it several barriers. Different interrelated factors are usually at play, rather than one decisive single motive, concerning financial, environmental, health issues and personal beliefs and values. This study aims to indentify the factors that encourage <b>olive</b> <b>growers</b> to adopt organic practices and the reasons that discourage them to continue.

A survey was conducted with 62 <b>olive</b> <b>growers</b> in the region of Sfax in Tunisia. First, a diagnosis of the situation of the farms was undertaken comparing between organic and conventional farms. Second, an empirical analysis was achieved to asses the sustainability of organic farms versus conventional farms following the French “IDEA” method developed by Vilain [1] 1. The “IDEA” indicators showed a greater ranking for the organic farms. The analysis indicated the sustainability of organic farming on the three scales adopted; ecological scale, through the soil fertility and reduction of pollution, socio-territorial scale through employment creation, reinforcement of the spirit of collective work and the products quality, and finally on the economic scale by enhancing profitability, responding to demand and prices allowing organic farming adopters to reach better incomes. sustainability, organic farming, Tunisia, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} to assess the {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) intensity of olive oil production in Portugal. A life-cycle model and inventory were implemented for the entire production process, including a comprehensive analysis of olive cultivation, olive oil extraction, packaging, and distribution. Data originates from five differently-sized Portuguese <b>olive</b> <b>growers</b> and from a total of six olive oil mills, representing the three extraction processes in use: three-phase extraction, two-phase extraction, and traditional pressing. The results show that the GHG intensity lies in the range 1. 8 - 8. 2 kg CO 2 eq/liter and that the main contributors were fertilizers (production and field emissions). Efficient use of fertilizers thus seems to be a key factor for mitigating the GHG intensity of olive oil production.

A bottle proclaiming that it is olive oil might actually include another, lessexpensive vegetable oil derived from, for example, safflower or canola. Mislabeling is of concern not just to shoppers, retailers, and chefs, but also to America’s <b>olive</b> <b>growers,</b> <b>olive</b> oil processors, and more—especially those newly entering the U.

40|$|Pruning is an expensive, but {{indispensable}} {{practice in}} the olive orchard. Pruning techniques are based on physiological needs and responses of the tree {{as well as economic}} and organizational issues. Pruning used to require {{a lot of time and}} labour in the past, but modern approaches to this practice allow to form and maintain the tree structure at a relatively low cost. Strategies of “minimum pruning” can be developed at the farm level independently of the type and size of the orchard. Managing the canopy according to the criteria of “minimum pruning” is suitable both for traditional olive groves and modern, high-density orchards. The basic features of both traditional and modern training systems are here briefly reviewed.
