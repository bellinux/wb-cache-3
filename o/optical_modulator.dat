50|$|Modulation of a {{light source}} is used to encode {{information}} on a light source. Modulation {{can be achieved by}} the light source directly. One of the simplest examples is to use a flashlight to send Morse code. Another method is to take the light from a light source and modulate it in an external <b>optical</b> <b>modulator.</b>|$|E

50|$|Addition {{to energy}} level shift, the DC {{electric}} field causes decrease of absorption coefficient. Because electron and hole {{are forced to}} opposite direction by the field, the overlap of relating valence and conduction band in transition is decreased. Thus, according to Fermi's golden rule, which says that transition probability {{is proportional to the}} overlap, optical transition strength is weakened. Using this, light absorption of materials can be controlled by changing electric field and can be used as an <b>optical</b> <b>modulator.</b>|$|E
50|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>modulator</b> is {{a device}} {{which is used}} to {{modulate}} a beam of light. The beam may be carried over free space, or propagated through an optical waveguide (optical fibre). Depending on the parameter of a light beam which is manipulated, modulators may be categorized into amplitude modulators, phase modulators, polarization modulators etc. Often the easiest way to obtain modulation of intensity of a light beam, is to modulate the current driving the light source, e.g. a laser diode. This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason light modulators are, e.g. in fiber optic communications, called external light modulators.|$|E

50|$|In January 2012, Optelian {{acquired}} Versawave Technologies Inc., of Vancouver, British Columbia, {{a leader}} in the field of ultra-high bandwidth gallium arsenide based <b>optical</b> <b>modulators</b> with patented polarization modulation technology.|$|R
30|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>modulators</b> are an {{important}} device to the current and future optical systems and {{still need to be}} improved. Graphene shows great potential in fabricating broadband and ultrafast <b>optical</b> <b>modulators.</b> <b>Optical</b> transition including interband and intraband transitions in graphene is the main process during absorption. Electro-optical GOMs have been demonstrated while the modulation speed is limited to approximately 1  GHz due to the RC constant. The position of the graphene sheet efficiently influences the light-graphene interaction. Higher modulation depth can be easily achieved by placing graphene close to the maximum of the electric field. Following the first demonstration, many <b>optical</b> <b>modulators</b> enhanced by graphene have been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. However, higher modulation speed is necessary for current electro-optical GOMs. Driven by saturable absorption, all-optical GOMs show a potential of ultrafast modulation speed due to the ultrafast relaxation time. But direct measurement of ultrafast modulation has not been demonstrated. In the field of terahertz, graphene has a prominent advantage of high modulation depth. Electro-optical and all-optical modulation are both possible. In principle, theoretical simulations go much further than experiment. GOMs with new structures and high performance tend to be demonstrated in the near future.|$|R
5000|$|Laser diodes {{are often}} {{directly}} modulated, {{that is the}} light output is controlled by a current applied directly to the device. For very high data rates or very long distance links, a laser source may be operated continuous wave, and the light modulated by an external device, an <b>optical</b> <b>modulator,</b> such as an electro-absorption modulator or Mach-Zehnder interferometer. External modulation increases the achievable link distance by eliminating laser chirp, which broadens the linewidth of directly modulated lasers, increasing the chromatic dispersion in the fiber. For very high bandwidth efficiency, coherent modulation {{can be used to}} vary the phase of the light in addition to the amplitude, enabling the use of QPSK, QAM, and OFDM.|$|E
50|$|Optical {{modulators}} can {{be implemented}} using Semiconductor Nano-structures to increase the performance like high operation, high stability, high speed response, and highly compact system. Highly compact electro-optical modulators have been demonstrated in compound semiconductors. However, in silicon photonics, electro-optical modulation has been demonstrated only in large structures, and is therefore inappropriate for effective on-chipintegration. Electro-optical control of light on silicon is challenging owing to its weak electro-optical properties. The large dimensions of previously demonstrated structures were necessary to achieve a signiﬁcant modulation of the transmission {{in spite of the}} small change of refractive index of silicon. Liu et al. have recently demonstrated a high-speed silicon <b>optical</b> <b>modulator</b> based on a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) conﬁguration. Their work showed a high-speed optical active device on silicon—a critical milestone towards optoelectronic integration on silicon.|$|E
50|$|Most OEOs {{utilize the}} {{transmission}} characteristics of an <b>optical</b> <b>modulator</b> {{together with a}} fiber-optic delay line to convert light energy into stable, spectrally pure RF/microwave reference signals. Light from a laser is introduced into an E/O modulator, the output of which is passed through a long optical fiber and detected with a photodetector. The output of the photodetector is amplified and filtered and fed back to the electric port of the modulator. This configuration supports self-sustained oscillations, at a frequency determined by the fiber delay length, the bias setting of the modulator, and the band pass characteristics of the filter. It also provides for both electric and optical outputs. The conditions for self-sustained oscillations include coherent addition of partial waves each way around the loop and a loop gain exceeding losses for the circulating waves in the loop. The first condition implies that all signals that differ in phase by some multiple of 2π from the fundamental signal may be sustained. Thus the oscillation frequency is limited only by the characteristic frequency response of the modulator and {{the setting of the}} filter, which eliminates all other sustainable oscillations. The second condition implies that, with adequate light input power, self-sustained oscillations may be obtained without the need for the RF/microwave amplifier in the loop.|$|E

30|$|In {{this review}} article, we provide a brief {{overview}} of graphene-based <b>optical</b> <b>modulators.</b> Our survey is not intended to cover every single device reported in prior publication, but rather to introduce some typical designs and highlight some recent notable work. Classified by whether electrical elements are involved or not, the principle and paradigms of electro-optical and all-optical graphene <b>optical</b> <b>modulators</b> are elaborated in the ‘Electro-optical graphene optical modulator’ and ‘All-optical grapheme optical modulator’ sections, respectively. In addition, graphene-based material systems for THz wave modulation are discussed in the ‘Graphene terahertz modulator’ section. The article closes with a final conclusion and outlook in the ‘Conclusions’ section.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{parameters}} are defined and specified {{to quantify the}} performance of optical switches. The steady state performance of an optical switch (or optical switching matrix) is measured by its ability to effectively transmit optical power from an input port {{to any one of}} N output ports over the “on” state transmission path, and its ability to effectively isolate input power sources from all non-active ports over the “off” state transmission paths. Other key optical performance parameters include transmission efficiency over a range of wavelengths, the ability to minimize input optical power reflected back into the input fiber, transmission balance, and bidirectional transmission. The optical switch (or switching matrix) transient behavior is another important characteristic that is specified by its speed of response to control stimulation via the time interval it takes to either transmit or block the optical signal on any given output port. Two rates can be associated with switches: the switching rate and the signal transmission rate. The switching rate is the rate at which a switch changes states. The signal transmission rate is the modulation rate of information passing through a switch. The signal transmission rate is usually much greater than the switching rate. (If the switching rate approaches or exceeds the transmission rate, then the switch can be called an <b>optical</b> <b>modulator.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>modulator</b> is {{an optical}} device {{which is used}} to {{modulate}} a beam of light with a perturbation device. It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through optical fiber (optical waveguide) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like amplitude modulator (majority), phase modulator, polarization modulator etc.The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source (laser diode). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators.According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators (absorption coefficient) and refractive modulators (refractive index of the material). Absorption coefficient can be manipulated by Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined Stark Effect, excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of electro-optic effect (amplitude & phase modulation), other modulators are made with acousto-optic effect, magneto-optic effect such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is spatial light modulator (SLM) which is modified two dimensional distribution of amplitude & phase of an optical wave.|$|E

Silicon photonics provides a route to the realisation of low cost photonic integrated circuits through fabrication which is synonymous with CMOS electronic fabrication, i. e., high volume and high yield. The development of high performance <b>optical</b> <b>modulators</b> based on a silicon photonic platform can therefore support a number of low cost applications.

40|$|Modulators. (Under the {{direction}} of Dr. John F. Muth) In narrower band gap semiconductors researchers have exploited the ability to manipulate the exciton resonance via the Quantum Confined Stark Effect to make {{a variety of different}} types of <b>optical</b> <b>modulators</b> at infrared wavelengths. In this thesis, the large exciton binding energy of Gallium Nitride is used as the basis for ultraviolet <b>optical</b> <b>modulators</b> without the need for quantum confinement. A 5 x 5 array of UV <b>optical</b> <b>modulators</b> at 360 nm was fabricated. The modulators operated in a transverse geometry and consisted of a GaN active layer surrounded by transparent AlGaN insulating and electrical contact layers. The typical thickness of the GaN layer was 0. 4 um so the effects of the electric field on the exciton resonance could be directly observed. A hydrogenic model for the bulk exciton was assumed. The applied electric field opposed the attractive coulomb potential between the electron and hole and broadens the exciton resonance. This results in more or less light through the device depending on the spectral position. To understand the magnitude of the applied field within the device structure a 1 D Poisson Solver was used...|$|R
