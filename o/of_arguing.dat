5|$|In April 1866, Sprigg {{relocated}} to Moorefield in the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia {{and established a}} law partnership with former judge J.W.F. Allen. Due to West Virginia's disenfranchisement of Confederate sympathizers and belligerents, Allen was unable to practice law, and Sprigg initially carried the burden <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> the practice's cases. The law firm was immediately successful, and Sprigg continued {{the practice of law}} in Hardy County for over 23 years, during which time he argued in every important civil and criminal case held in that county court. In addition to Hardy County, Sprigg and Allen were also members of the Hampshire County bar.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{embarked}} for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, {{sharing a}} cabin {{with an old}} friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who had been in his battalion.|$|E

25|$|Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz {{whether the}} Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler's motives were twofold. The first was that {{reprisals}} {{could be taken}} against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies (as was happening on the Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in abeyance). Instead <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz's jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaigns of}} {{intelligent}} design proponents seeking curricular challenges have been disruptive, divisive and expensive for the affected communities. In pursuing {{the goal of}} establishing intelligent design {{at the expense of}} evolution in public school science classes, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly, diverting funding away from education and into court battles. For example, {{as a result of the}} Dover trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of teaching the controversy.|$|E
25|$|In the United States Supreme Court, Penn Central changed theories. Instead <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> {{that it was}} not {{receiving}} a reasonable return on its property because of the city regulations, it argued that the regulation took its air rights above Grand Central Terminal which had been designed to accommodate a twenty-story building on top of it. The Supreme Court disagreed and held that under a new taking test that it formulated in this opinion, the economic impact on Penn Central was not severe enough to constitute a taking because Penn Central conceded that it could still continue with its present use whose return was reasonable. Thus, the regulation did not interfere with its reasonable investment-backed expectations. The court therefore found that the city's restrictions on Grand Central Terminal did not amount to a taking.|$|E

25|$|Kon Ichikawa {{stated in}} a Criterion Collection {{interview}} that he had witnessed {{the destruction of the}} atom bomb first hand, and had felt since then that he had to speak out against the horrors of war, despite the many comedies that made up most of his early career. Fires on the Plain got greenlighted by the studio Daiei, because they thought it would be an action movie. Ichikawa decided that it was a film that needed to be made in black and white, specifically requesting Eastman's black and white. The studio initially balked, but after a month <b>of</b> <b>arguing,</b> the studio agreed to Ichikawa's request. Ichikawa also said that he had wanted actor Eiji Funakoshi to be in the film from the beginning. Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, penned the script which got the approval of novel author Shohei Ooka.|$|E
25|$|The Zohar, one of {{the primary}} sources of Kabbalah (a form of Jewish mysticism), {{attributes}} holiness to the beard, and strongly discourages its removal, declaring that even the shortening of a beard by scissors is a great sin; it was even said that Isaac Luria, a significant figure in the history of Kabbalistic mysticism, meticulously avoided touching his beard, lest he should accidentally cause hairs to drop from it. Kabbalistic teachings gradually spread into Slavonic regions, and consequently beard trimming was discouraged in these areas, even if it involved scissors; it was the Hasidic Jews who more closely followed Kabbalistic practices than Jews of a Lithuanian or Misnagdish background, and thus it became the Hasidic Jews who are known for the distinctive traditional practice of growing their beards. However, in Italy, shaving the beard was so popular that even the Italian followers of Kabbalah did it; an Italian Kabbalist even went to the extent <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> that beard shaving was only prohibited in Canaan, and was actually to be encouraged elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|At the hearing, Alagad party-list {{representative}} Rodante Marcoleta questioned if {{the committee}} should {{wait for the}} court's decision on Gutierrez's motion for reconsideration. After the minutes of the previous meeting was approved, Nacionalista Party member Marc Douglas Cagas IV from Davao del Sur's 1st district motioned to reconsider {{the approval of the}} minutes, which was denied by vice chairperson Rodolfo Fariñas (Nacionalista, Ilocos Norte–1st) since Cagas was absent at the previous meeting. After several minutes <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> whether to wait for a Supreme Court decision, Rodolfo Albano (Lakas-Kampi, Isabela–1st) motioned to wait for the decision; the motion was defeated 8–37. Tupas read a letter submitted by Gutierrez, and the representatives debated anew on whether to wait for the court's decision; Fariñas later bared his plan on filing impeachment cases against the justices for not reading Gutierrez's petition before issuing the status quo ante order. The committee ultimately voted that both complaints were sufficient in grounds, with the first complaint passing on a 41–12 vote, and the second complaint approved on a 42–12 decision.|$|E

25|$|After {{the river}} had been {{diverted}} to King's Lynn, the town {{developed as a}} port. Evidence for this can still be seen, as two warehouses built in the 15th century for trade with the Hanseatic League have survived. However, the harbour and the river below Denver sluice were affected by silting, and the problem was {{perceived to be the}} effects of the sluice. Sand from The Wash was deposited by the incoming tide, and the outgoing tide did not carry it away again. Colonel John Armstrong was asked to survey the river in 1724, and suggested returning it to how it was prior to the construction of the drainage works. John Smeaton rejected this idea in 1766, suggesting that the banks should be moved inwards to create a narrower, faster-flowing channel. William Elstobb and others had suggested that the great bend in the river above King's Lynn should be removed by creating a cut, but it took 50 years <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> before the Eau Brink Act was obtained in 1795 to authorise it, and another 26 years until the cut was finally opened in 1821. During this time, most of the major civil engineers of the time had contributed their opinions. The original project head and chief engineer was Sir Thomas Hyde Page.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{testimony}} of 12 witnesses, who stated that Gordon was of excellent character and was loyal to both the king and the constitution, Erskine rose, and instead <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> that Gordon had not been involved instead took the line that his crimes did not constitute treason. High treason {{was at the time}} still based on the Treason Act 1351, which mandated that the definition of treason could not be extended by judges. Notwithstanding this, the judiciary had extended this to include constructive treason. Erskine was successful in showing that Gordon's motives had only been to defend his nation, not to harm it, and that without the intention to commit treason, no treason could be committed. The original law required the act to be treasonous in nature, not in consequence, and Gordon's crimes fell into the second category.|$|E

500|$|Until {{the attack}} on the Soviet Union, Germany and Japan were able to {{exchange}} materials and personnel using the Trans-Siberian Railway. Afterwards, submarines had to be sent on so-called [...] "Yanagi" [...] (Willow) – missions, since the American and British navies rendered the high seas too dangerous for Axis surface cargo ships. However, given the limited capacities of submarines, eyes were soon focused directly on the Mediterranean, the Middle East and British India, all vital to the British war effort. In the long run, Germany and Japan envisioned a partnered linkage running across the British-held Indian subcontinent that would allow for the transfer of weaponry and resources as well as potential joint military operations. After all, the choice of potential trading partners was very limited during the war and Germany was anxious for rubber and precious metals, while the Japanese sought industrial products, technical equipment, and chemical goods. By August 1942 the German advances in North Africa rendered an offensive against Alexandria and the Suez Canal feasible, which, in turn, had the potential of enabling maritime trade between Europe and Japan through the Indian Ocean. On the other hand, in the face of its defeat at the Battle of Midway in June 1942 with the loss of four aircraft carriers, the Japanese Navy decided to pursue all possibilities of gaining additional resources to quickly rebuild its forces. As a consequence, Ambassador Ōshima in Berlin was ordered to submit an extensive [...] "wish list" [...] requesting the purchase of vast amounts of steel and aluminium to be shipped from Germany to Japan. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop quickly dismissed Tokyo's proposal, since those resources were vital for Germany's own industry. However, in order to gain Japanese backing for a new German-Japanese trade treaty, which should also secure the rights of German companies in South-East Asia, he asked Hitler to at least partially agree upon the Japanese demands. It took another five months <b>of</b> <b>arguing</b> over the Reichsmark-Yen-exchange rate and additional talks with the third signatory, the Italian government, until the [...] "Treaty on Economic Cooperation" [...] was signed on 20 January 1943.|$|E
