5|$|Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a {{distributed}} computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, {{and other types}} of molecular dynamics. The project uses the idle processing resources of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> folding, which is the process by which proteins reach their final three-dimensional structure, and to examine the causes <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> misfolding. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for medical research into Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer, among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to predict a protein's final structure and determine how other molecules may interact with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at Stanford University, under the direction of Prof. Vijay Pande, and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home {{is one of}} the world's fastest {{computing}} systems, with a {{speed of}} approximately 70 petaFLOPS.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{developments}} {{in research on}} the stability <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> show that ion-pairs potentially contribute to the thermostability <b>of</b> <b>proteins,</b> according to comparisons of ion-pairs between homologous structures. This study proposes a probabilistic Bayesian statistical method to predict efficiently the thermostability <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> based on considering the properties of ion-pairs. The experimental {{results suggest that the}} number, types, and bond distance of ion-pairs can be used to predict thermostability <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> with functions similar to each other with a high accuracy up to 80 %. The predictions have high precision of 99 %, especially for hyperthermophilic proteins. The experimental results <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> with different functions also indicate that the number of ion-pairs is related to the thermostability <b>of</b> <b>proteins,</b> and predictions <b>of</b> thermostability can also be made for proteins with different functions...|$|R

5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b> Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

5|$|In addition, many {{non-standard}} {{amino acids}} {{have a specific}} code.
