5|$|Barbadian {{traditional}} {{folk songs}} are {{heavily influenced by}} the music of England. Many traditional songs concern events current {{at the time of}} their composition, such as the emancipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of Barbados, and the coronations of Victoria, George V, and Elizabeth II; this song tradition dates back to 1650. The most influential Barbadian folk songs are associated with the island's lower-class laborers, who have held on to their folk heritage.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves.</b> Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we examine a design method for {{master-slave}} systems of bilateral control systems. In master-slave systems, human operator works to achieve tasks via the master and <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>slave</b> system contacts <b>the</b> environment and works the tasks. According to past studies, when <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> environment {{is treated as}} uncertainties, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> unstable poles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system is required to be equivalent to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system with <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment. In some cases, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> unstable poles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system with <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> environment {{is different from that}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system. We propose a simple design method of bilateral control systems such that <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> unstable poles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system with <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> environment is different from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system without <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment...|$|R

5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their {{insurers}} for the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves.</b> When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required {{to pay for the}} slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton is {{not known}} to have ever owned slaves, {{although}} {{members of his family}} were slave owners. At the time of her death, Hamilton's mother owned two slaves named Christian and Ajax, and she had written a will leaving them to her sons; however, due to their illegitimacy, Hamilton and his brother were held ineligible to inherit her property, and never took ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves.</b> Later, as a youth in St. Croix, Hamilton worked for a company trading in commodities that included slaves. During his career, Hamilton did occasionally purchase or sell slaves for others as their legal representative, and one of Hamilton's grandsons interpreted some of these journal entries as being purchases for himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, a {{year after}} independence, slaves made up 29% of the {{population}} of Brazil, a figure which fell throughout the lifetime of the Empire: from 24% in 1854, to 15.2% in 1872, and finally to less than 5% in 1887—the year before slavery was completely abolished. Slaves were mostly adult males from southwestern Africa. Slaves brought to Brazil differed ethnically, religiously and linguistically, each identifying primarily with his or her own nation of origin, rather than by a shared African ethnicity. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> brought to the Americas had been captured while fighting intertribal wars in Africa and had then been sold to slave dealers.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to her passengers and cargo, De Soto also acted as a conduit for news between Cuba and the United States. Most of the news conveyed by De Soto was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E
5|$|Mackandal has expert {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} the forest, using its herbs and fungi as weapons against the planters.

The powerful climate of the Caribbean is more similar to Africa than Europe, making nature an ally <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves.</b> Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E
5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs.

The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} killing of 133African slaves by {{the crew of}} the British slave ship Zong in the days following 29November 1781. The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, owned the ship and sailed her in the Atlantic slave trade. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> as cargo. When the ship ran low on potable water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea to drown, partly in order to ensure the survival {{of the rest of the}} ship's passengers, and in part to cash in on the insurance on the slaves, thus not losing money on the slaves who would have died from the lack of drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Vicksburg's fall gave Union forces {{control of}} the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy. By that time, Grant's {{political}} sympathies fully coincided with the Radical Republicans' aggressive prosecution {{of the war and}} emancipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves.</b> The success at Vicksburg was a morale boost for the Union war effort. The personal rivalry between McClernand and Grant continued after Vicksburg until Grant removed McClernand from command when he contravened Grant by publishing an order without permission. When Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton suggested Grant be brought back east to run the Army of the Potomac, Grant demurred, writing that he knew the geography and resources of the West better and {{he did not want to}} upset the chain of command in the East.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of Zong voyage reached Britain, the ship's owners claimed {{compensation}} from their insurers for the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves.</b> The insurers refused to honour the claim and the owners took them to court. Zongs logbook went missing after the ship reached Jamaica, {{two years before the}} hearings started. The legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre but there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the appeals hearing. The ship's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a position-exchange controller for bilateral teleoperation of flexible surgical robots. The controller requires <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> master arm and <b>the</b> deformed shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm, but no force information is required. <b>The</b> position-tracking controller <b>of</b> <b>the</b> master arm causes the master arm to follow <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm. <b>The</b> position tracking controller <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm causes <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> to follow <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> master and also deforms <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm until <b>the</b> force generated at its tip matches the force {{applied to the}} master. The position exchange controller is illustrated using two systems. The first is a simple one degree of freedom flexible robot. The second system is a surgical robot constructed from a set of precurved superelastic concentric tubes. The control structure enables fast computation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deformed shape kinematics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm using Cosserat rod theory.

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{take the}} view that Gregory {{initiated}} the mission, although exactly why remains unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote {{a history of the}} British Church, relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Anglo-Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. Supposedly Gregory inquired about the identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves,</b> and was told that they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels. The earliest version of this story is from an anonymous Life of Gregory written at Whitby Abbey about 705. Bede, as well as the Whitby Life of Gregory, records that Gregory himself had attempted to go on a missionary journey to Britain before becoming pope. In 595 Gregory wrote to one of the papal estate managers in southern Gaul, asking that he buy English slave boys in order that they might be educated in monasteries. Some historians have seen this as a sign that Gregory was already planning the mission to Britain at that time, and that he intended to send the slaves as missionaries, although the letter is also open to other interpretations.|$|E
5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> should be thrown overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36more followed {{in the next few}} days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E
