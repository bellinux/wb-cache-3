5|$|Harry confronts monsters in {{each area}} with both melee weapons and firearms. An <b>ordinary</b> <b>man,</b> Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting. His {{inexperience}} in handling firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady. A portable radio collected {{early in the game}} alerts Harry to the presence of nearby creatures with bursts of static.|$|E
5|$|Created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, Raynor is {{loosely based}} on a {{character}} {{of the same name}} in the 1991 film Rush. Metzen conceived Raynor to represent the <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> in a series populated with politically motivated characters. Raynor's physical appearance was designed by Metzen himself. A Terran in his thirties, Raynor is a former soldier and outlaw who eventually becomes a marshal on a backwater colony world. Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolution against the oppressive Terran Confederacy but becomes disillusioned with Mengsk's genocidal tactics, forming his own paramilitary group to challenge Mengsk's tyranny.|$|E
5|$|No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American neo-Western thriller film produced, directed, written, {{and edited}} by Joel and Ethan Coen. Based on Cormac McCarthy's {{novel of the}} same name, the film is about an <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> to whom chance {{delivers}} a fortune that is not his, and the ensuing cat-and-mouse drama as the paths of three men intertwine in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas. The film stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and Javier Bardem, with Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, and Beth Grant in featured roles.|$|E

5|$|The {{follow-up}} {{album was}} released on 2 April 2012. It describes five different scenarios of Gerald Bostock's life, where he potentially becomes a greedy investment banker, a homeless homosexual man, {{a soldier in the}} Afghan War, a sanctimonious evangelist preacher, and a most <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> who runs a corner store and is married and childless. Thick as a Brick 2 lists 17 separate songs merged into 13 distinct tracks (some labelled as medleys), although also all flowing together much like a single song. To follow the style of the mock newspaper on the original Thick as a Brick, a mock online newspaper was set up.|$|E
5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an <b>ordinary</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an <b>ordinary</b> <b>man,</b> but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to him than she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E

5|$|His {{debut album}} 我只是想要 (All I Want Is...), which {{contains}} four original songs and ten covers, was certified platinum in Singapore within {{five days of}} its release. Its title track topped the Singapore music charts in February 2006, while another of its songs, 触摸 (Touch), won Best Theme Song at the 2006 Star Awards. In total, the album sold 45,000 copies in Singapore and 15,000 copies in Malaysia. In 2007, his second album i伟联 (i-Weilian) was released and the song 普通的人 (<b>Ordinary</b> <b>Man)</b> topped the Singapore charts that October. This album eventually sold 15,000 copies in Singapore and 20,000 copies in Taiwan. Several songs that Tan composed himself were included in his third album, 走唱陈伟联 (Moving Notes...Kelvin Tan), which he promoted through busking appearances. Although its sales figures are not known, the songs 永远的朋友 (Forever Friends) and 分手的请书 (Break Up Letter) topped the Singapore charts in October 2009, while the album peaked at 5th in the Taiwan charts in February 2010. In addition, 分手的请书 won two awards at the 2010 Singapore Entertainment Awards and 我们 (Together) won Best Theme Song at the 2010 Star Awards. However, his contract with Warner Music expired in September 2010 and was not renewed.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear My Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E

5000|$|Saints as {{the source}} of baraka, can {{transmit}} baraka to <b>ordinary</b> <b>men</b> simply through their presence. As this hadith explains, [...] "By means of the righteous Muslim, God repulses affliction from one hundred neighbors". In this way, the saints provide a means for <b>ordinary</b> <b>men</b> to connect with the blessings of God through baraka. The physical closeness to a saint's shrine is said to emit baraka, which is why many followers of Islam choose to visit shrines. The ritualistic act of visiting tombs and other holy places, such as shrines, to receive baraka is known as ziyara.|$|R
60|$|Neither can we {{say that}} the thing is {{explained}} by that second case of human secrecy which is so secret {{that it is hard}} to discuss it in public. A decency is preserved about certain primary human matters precisely because every one knows all about them. But the decency touching contributions, purchases, and peerages is not kept up because most <b>ordinary</b> <b>men</b> know what is happening; it is kept up precisely because most <b>ordinary</b> <b>men</b> do not know what is happening. The ordinary curtain of decorum covers normal proceedings. But no one will say that being bribed is a normal proceeding.|$|R
25|$|Sciascia {{wrote of}} his unique Sicilian experience, linking {{families}} with political parties, the treachery of alliances and allegiances, and the calling of favors {{that result in}} outcomes that do not benefit society, but those individuals who are in favor. His books are rarely characterized by a happy ending or by justice for the <b>ordinary</b> <b>man.</b> A prime {{example of this is}} Equal Danger (1973; Uguale pericolo), in which the police's best detective is drafted to Sicily to investigate a spate of murders of judges. Focusing on the inability of authorities to handle such investigation into the corruption, Sciascia's hero is finally thwarted.|$|E
25|$|In Joe Keller, Arthur Miller creates just a {{representative}} type. Joe {{is a very}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>man,</b> decent, hard-working and charitable, a man no one could dislike. But, like the protagonist of the ancient drama, he has a flaw or weakness. This, in turn, causes him to act wrongly. He is forced to accept responsibility – his suicide is necessary to restore the moral order of the universe, and allows his son, Chris, to live free from guilt and persecution. Arthur Miller later uses the Everyman in a criticism of the American Dream in Death of a Salesman, which {{is in many ways}} similar to All My Sons.|$|E
25|$|As an Anglican and {{a regular}} church-goer, Wakley's {{opposition}} to aspects of the Lord's Day Observance legislation was based not on secularism but on his sympathy for the <b>ordinary</b> <b>man.</b> In his day, men worked a full six days each week and could not shop on pay nights. If all shops closed {{for the whole of}} Sunday, it was clearly unfair to working men. Also, he advocated that places of education, such as museums and zoos, should be open to all on Sundays. The working week became five days long around 1960, and it was even later before shops were able to open on Sundays.|$|E

25|$|Man la yahduruh al-faqih {{represents}} a synopsis {{of all the}} traditions that Ibn Babawayh had collected, while his prior works, for example, Kitab al-nikah (the book of marriage) and Kitab al-hajj (the book of pilgrimage) are each a treatise on different aspect of furu'. Further, Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih {{was intended as a}} reference for the <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> in that the Isnads are not recorded. The isnads are the chain of authorities through which the traditions were received from the Prophet or one of the Imams. In the science of traditions, this providence is all important. A scholar would expect the isnads to be present for examination.|$|E
500|$|StarCraft creator Chris Metzen {{designed}} Raynor as rough-living {{and dangerous}} man; Clotworthy describes Raynor {{as a man}} that other characters [...] "wouldn't mess with".
