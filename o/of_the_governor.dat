5|$|Texas has a plural {{executive}} branch system limiting the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor,</b> {{which is a}} weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the Secretary of State, voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor. This election system has led to some {{executive branch}}es split between parties and reduced the ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> {{to carry out a}} program. When Republican President George W. Bush served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor,</b> Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Land Commissioner, Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the Secretary of State.|$|E
