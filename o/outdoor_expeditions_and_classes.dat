50|$|The School {{has always}} {{recognised}} {{the importance of}} <b>outdoor</b> education, with <b>expeditions</b> <b>and</b> camps taking a high priority alongside team sports. Bredon School {{was one of the}} first to commit itself to the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme and it is now an Operating Centre. One of the School’s earliest and most uncommon assets was its working Farm. Pupils acquire agricultural and horticultural skills and can choose to pursue vocational land-based qualifications. Over the years the School has continued to develop its expertise with the addition of a Forest School to its other facilities. In 2011 the School received the Woodland Trust’s gold award for its woodland work. Pupils at Bredon School also take part in annual camps and training expeditions; from the North Devon coast trip to the Cairngorms expedition, all are designed to develop individual talents and team-work.|$|R
50|$|Norrøna {{was founded}} on 29 April 1929 by Jørgen Jørgensen. He was succeeded in turn by his son Bjarne, by Bjarne's son Ole Jørgen, and in 2005 by Ole Jørgen's son Jørgen Jørgensen, who opened the company's first shop in November 2009, and won the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the {{retailing}} category in 2012. The company has expanded over the years into areas including garden furniture, but now again concentrates on <b>outdoor</b> clothing <b>and</b> <b>expedition</b> equipment. The first children's collection is to go on sale in August 2014. Norrøna's annual turnover increased 44% to 235 million Norwegian kroner in 2011, and 22% to 245 million kroner in 2012.|$|R

50|$|During a {{semester}} at the Alzar School, students {{live at the}} 100-acre campus in Cascade, Idaho and spend six weeks living abroad in Chile. Students participate in significant <b>outdoor</b> <b>expeditions,</b> learning to whitewater kayak/raft, hike, rock climb, surf, ski/snowboard, and more. Additionally, they study their traditional academic courses (Science, Math, History, English, Spanish, etc.).|$|R

5000|$|Other {{university}} level programs are entirely field-taught on <b>outdoor</b> <b>expeditions.</b> These courses combine traditional academic readings and written assignments with field observations, service projects, open discussions of course material, and meetings with local speakers {{who are involved}} with the course subjects. These [...] "hybrid" [...] experiential/traditional programs aim to provide the academic rigor of a classroom course with the breadth and personal connections of experiential education.|$|R
60|$|The German governess, {{chosen by}} Mrs. Mohun, was very German indeed, and greatly {{occupied}} {{in her own}} studies. When she found that the armes- liebes Madchen shrank from being wept over and caressed on the mournful return, she decided that the English had no feeling, and acquiesced in the routine of lessons <b>and</b> <b>expeditions</b> to <b>classes.</b> She was never unkind, {{but she did not}} try to be a companion; and old Caroline was excellent in the attention she paid to the comforts of her master and his daughter, but had no love of children, and would not have encouraged familiarities, even if Dolores had not been too entirely a drawing-room child to offer them.|$|R
5000|$|The HMI Semester is the {{cornerstone}} program at the institute. In the HMI Semester, 48 students {{from all over the}} country (and globe) come together to spend either the fall or spring semester of their junior year of high school outside their comfort zone. The key element of the HMI Semester is the integration of residential life, wilderness <b>expeditions,</b> <b>and</b> rigorous academics. <b>Classes</b> are taken at an honors level, with class sizes ranging from 42 to 4. On campus, students live with about ten other students in cabins heated with wood-burning stoves. Physical training consists of a fitness regimen of early-morning runs and skiing culminating in a [...] "Fun Run" [...] (a 10-mile run at 10,000 feet). Students take three trips into the back country (which varies from the canyons of southeast Utah to the slopes of Mount Elbert). Since these trips last from 10 to 14 days each, a substantial part of the semester is spent in the wilderness. During the expeditions, students do homework, learn back-country cooking, and survival skills while learning about leadership and natural ethics.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, {{these teams}} are tasked {{to operate in}} remote and {{changeable}} environments with limited support or backup (action environments). Leadership of people in these environments requires {{a different set of}} skills to that of front line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment. This has been termed action oriented leadership. Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an <b>outdoor</b> <b>expedition,</b> or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.|$|R
50|$|For {{the fall}} {{semester}} of 2013, Crespi introduced a STEM Cohort program that will allow students to focus on studies that will expose them to and prepare them for STEM careers. Furthermore, Crespi boasts unique academic honors opportunities such as Environmental Studies and Outdoor Leadership. To graduate with honors from this program, students must participate in academic seminars on environmental issues as well as <b>outdoor</b> <b>expeditions</b> such as backpacking and nature trail rehabilitation. In addition to carrying on a tradition of academic excellence, Crespi is committed to academic innovations such as the programs above {{as well as a}} rotating block and semester system that have been adopted by many other area schools.|$|R
