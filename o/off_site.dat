5|$|A {{section of}} the track on land owned by Fisons (who {{extracted}} peat from the area) was donated to the British Museum in London. Although this short section can be assembled for display purposes, it is currently kept in store, <b>off</b> <b>site,</b> and under controlled conditions. A reconstructed section was displayed at the Peat Moors Centre near Glastonbury. The centre was run by the Somerset Historic Environment Service, but was closed in October 2009 {{as a result of}} budget cuts imposed by Somerset County Council. The main exhibits are extant, but future public access is uncertain. Other samples of the track are held in the Museum of Somerset.|$|E
5|$|The Global Crop Diversity Trust is an {{independent}} international organisation which exists to ensure the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide. It was established through a partnership between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) acting through Bioversity International. The CGIAR is a consortium of International Agriculture Research Centers (IARC) and others that each conduct research on and preserve germplasm from a particular crop or animal species. The CGIAR holds one of the world's largest <b>off</b> <b>site</b> collections of plant genetic resources in trust for the world community. It contains over 500,000 accessions of more than 3,000 crop, forage, and agroforestry species. The collection includes farmers' varieties and improved varieties and, in substantial measure, the wild species from which those varieties were created. National germplasm storage centers include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, India's National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, the Taiwan Livestock Research Institute, and the proposed Australian Network of Plant Genetic Resource Centers.|$|E
5|$|The World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) are {{non-profit}} {{organizations that}} provide funding and other support to <b>off</b> <b>site</b> and on site conservation efforts. The wise use of crop genetic diversity in plant breeding and genetic modification can also {{contribute significantly to}} protecting the biodiversity in crops. Crop varieties can be genetically modified to resist specific pests and diseases. For example, a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a natural insecticide toxin. Genes from Bt can be inserted into crop plants to make them capable of producing an insecticidal toxin and therefore a resistance to certain pests. Bt corn (maize) can however adversely affect non-target insects {{closely related to the}} target pest, as with the monarch butterfly.|$|E

25|$|In {{steel plate}} construction, {{stringers}} join parallel steel plates. The plate assemblies are fabricated <b>off</b> <b>site,</b> and welded together on-site to form steel walls connected by stringers. The walls become the form into which concrete is poured. Steel plate construction speeds reinforced concrete construction by cutting out the time-consuming on-site manual steps of tying rebar and building forms. The method results in excellent strength because the steel {{is on the}} outside, where tensile forces are often greatest.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer has {{inherited}} Wyeth's liabilities in the American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater, New Jersey. This site {{is highly}} toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site. Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land {{in order to}} clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses. The Sierra Club and the Edison Wetlands Association have come out {{in opposition to the}} cleanup plan, arguing that the area is subject to flooding, which could cause pollutants to leach. The EPA considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness, arguing that an alternative plan involving trucking contaminated soil <b>off</b> <b>site</b> could expose cleanup workers. The EPA's position is backed by the environmental watchdog group CRISIS.|$|E
25|$|Multiplex {{also took}} the {{original}} steel contractor, Cleveland Bridge, {{to court to}} claim up to £38million compensation for costs resulting from Cleveland Bridge {{walking away from the}} job. Cleveland Bridge, in turn, claimed up to £15million from Multiplex. The case was finally resolved in September 2008 with Cleveland Bridge ordered to pay £6.1million in damages and 20% of Multiplex's costs after the court found Cleveland Bridge was in the wrong to walk <b>off</b> <b>site.</b> The judge criticised both sides for allowing the case to reach court, pointing out that total costs were £22million, including £1million for photocopying. Multiplex's ultimate bill is estimated to be over £10million. In 2007, Multiplex also contested a claim from its concrete contractor, PC Harrington, that Multiplex owes £13.4million to PC Harrington.|$|E

Collective:Unconscious also founded its own unofficial parade, the annual July 4 Monster Parade and in conjunction with sub-group IFAM, won several Coney Island Mermaid Parade contests in the Sea Monster category (see photo, left).

25|$|The Central Laboratory at Sellafield is the {{headquarters}} of the National Nuclear Laboratory and is the flagship nuclear Research and Development facility in the UK. It supports newly built reactors, operation of reactors, operations of fuel processing plants and decommissioning and clean-up. The NNL's Central Laboratory is available to run a wide range of radioactive and non-radioactive experimental programmes. In addition, it offers a wide range of analytical services, building on its location on the Sellafield site and considerable expertise of its resident technologists. Customers range from Government and the NDA to site licence companies, utilities, nuclear specialists and universities. The facility has been designed with flexibility and collaboration firmly at its heart. Smaller experiments can be easily set, taking advantage of the modular nature of the laboratories. Larger experiments and rigs can be assembled <b>off</b> <b>site,</b> installed and pre-tested in non-radioactive areas prior to active testing.|$|E

2500|$|Once a site is {{suspected}} of being contaminated {{there is a need}} to assess the contamination. Often the assessment begins with preparation of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. The historical use of the site and the materials used and produced on site will guide the assessment strategy and type of sampling and chemical analysis to be done. Often nearby sites owned by the same company or which are nearby and have been reclaimed, levelled or filled are also contaminated even where the current land use seems innocuous. For example, a car park may have been levelled by using contaminated waste in the fill. Also important is to consider <b>off</b> <b>site</b> contamination of nearby sites often through decades of emissions to soil, groundwater, and air.
