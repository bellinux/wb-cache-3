AWT was the contractor {{of the plant}} and could become its operator under a proposed off-take plan. Another large desalination plan {{on the drawing board}} is the Jeddah 4 plant that could be implemented as an IWPP, although pre-bidding as a normal construction contract had already been initiated.|$|E

If however the market price is below an agreed level, the <b>offtaker</b> pays the {{difference}} to the project company, and vice versa if it is above an agreed level.|$|E

40|$|Crude oil {{produced}} from several PT. XYZ fields in Riau {{will be sent}} to Gathering Stations and then collected to Dumai storage tank before lifted to <b>Offtakers.</b> It came from domestic and also from International such as Japan, China, Russia and other countries. Shipping pump with 2400 HP capacity and consist of 4 units which used to support daily lifting activities. Crude oil lifting average is around 120 MM BOPY. At the one moment and condition, there is possibility to lift it with 4 unit engine running. Surprisingly in 2015, one-unit shipping pump was damaged. In this thesis, Author firstly do SWOT analysis to take information from an environmental analysis and separate it into internal and external issues. In deeply assessment, Author also assesses the financial aspect by Capital Budgeting analysis and risk management. Furthermore to meet the crude oil demand from buyers and to meet crude oil quotas target as one of Production Sharing Contract of Government Indonesia. By this condition, there are some efforts to put ALCO engine back to run by generating several alternatives. Hopefully the selected alternative will be the best solution with consider contract expiration in 2021. Keyword: Risk Analysis, financial analysis, <b>Offtakers,</b> NPV, depreciation, SWO...|$|R
40|$|The {{process design}} of large, highly {{integrated}} and energy-efficient petrochemical plants will depend significantly {{on the local}} energy market. The pricing, availability and possible <b>offtakers</b> for steam, power and fuel consumed and produced by the unit often dictate the process configuration of the plant. Of great influence also are the local ambient conditions that provide the ultimate heat sink, either by cooling water or directly by aircoolers. This paper introduces the complex issues involved with establishing an energy philosophy for major petrochemical projects. This philosophy subsequently directs {{many aspects of the}} fundamental process design of these plants. For illustrative example ethylene plants are considered. Ethylene is the major building block for plastics and other petrochemicals. The ethylene plant is a major consumers of hydrocarbons that have potential value as fuel. Economic optimization of ethylene production depends upon efficient use of energy within the plant. We will examine several alternative plant configurations that respond to different local energy market situations...|$|R
50|$|An {{off-take}} {{agreement is}} {{an agreement between}} the project company and the <b>offtaker</b> (the party who is buying the product / service that the project produces / delivers). In a project financing the revenue is often contracted (rather than being sold on a merchant basis). The off-take agreement governs mechanism of price and volume which make up revenue. The intention of this agreement is to provide the project company with stable and sufficient revenue to pay its project debt obligation, cover the operating costs and provide certain required return to the sponsors.|$|E
40|$|Offtaking {{agreements}} {{are an important}} risk transfer mechanism in project finance. However, {{they can also be}} thought of as a trade-off between lower market and higher counterparty risks. We use the case of the Quezon Power Ltd Co. to test the effect of higher counterparty risk on the cost of funding. Results indicate that the spread of Quezon's bond and counterparty risk are positively correlated when risk is represented by the daily volatility of the offtaker's stock returns. We also find an inverse relation between the rating upgrades of the <b>offtaker</b> and the spread paid by Quezon Power. Risk analysis Counterparty risk Project finance...|$|E
40|$|This article {{uses the}} case of Ghana to {{provide insight into the}} {{policies}} and strategies used by, as well as the cooperation between, Chinese state actors in their quest for natural resources in Africa. In 2007, Ghana discovered commercial quantities of oil. While the so-called Jubilee oilfield was initially divided amongst primarily Western oil companies, in 2010 the China National Offshore Oil Corporation partnered with Ghana’s national oil company to try and purchase a stake in Jubilee. Although this bid was rejected, later that year a second Chinese state-owned oil company, Sinopec, was able to access Ghana’s oil indirectly through an <b>offtaker</b> agreement, linked to a $ 3 billion dollar loan provided by the state-owned China Development Bank. The article uses these two cases to examine the level of coordination between the strategies of Chinese state actors in their attempts to access African natural resources. It shows that China’s national oil companies and policy banks operate in increasingly autonomous ways. This goes against the developmental state thesis, which argues that the Chinese state has full control over the overseas activities of its state actors. The article also shows that national political institutions in Africa can make use of and are able to influence Chinese resource deals, countering the notion of African passivity...|$|E
40|$|Contract farming (CF) {{agreements}} are presently being restructured to {{form part of}} more complex Inclusive Business (IB) set-ups. Additional instruments, alongside CF, are implemented to overcome the challenges of CF and {{to adapt to the}} policy environment in which the different stakeholders operate. This paper develops a theoretical framework that gives insight into how these complex entities are structured and operate in a developing country context. This theoretical analysis takes a holistic approach by adopting elements of existing theories to form a new critical research paradigm: (i) Resource Dependence Theory to incorporate the wider operating environment in which the two cases operate, (ii) Transaction Cost Economics to explain the internal efficiency of the different models, and (iii) Agency Theory to account for the safeguard mechanisms. This new framework is then tested on two complex IBs that aim to integrate smallholder farmers into the commercial value chain, but which have each implemented a different institutional set-up developed around CF arrangements. It finds that a high dependence by the <b>offtaker</b> in the first case study stimulates a higher level of commitment and investment by this stakeholder in the contract arrangement. In turn, this increases the asset specificity aspect, which then requires safeguards to ensure the smallholders adhere to the contractual agreement. A higher dependency in this particular study also resulted in a higher number of smallholders being engaged in the contract, requiring mechanisms to efficiently monitor and coordinate them.
