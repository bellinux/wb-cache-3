40|$|Abstract — View occluders {{influence}} the image {{quality of a}} subject when occluders exist between a camera and a subject.

In this paper, we propose an automatic removal method <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> occluders from images using multiple focusing. Our method automatically detects foreground occluder regions by using two images with and without flashlight. The influence <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> occluders is estimated and overlapping effects <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> occluders are removed by using multiple focus images.

40|$|Abstract. Most {{existing}} techniques <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> extracting work only in interactive mode. This paper introduces a novel algorithm <b>of</b> auto-matic <b>foreground</b> extraction for special object, and verifies its effective-ness with head shoulder images. The main contribution of our {{idea is to}} make the most use of the prior knowledge to constrain the processing <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> extraction. For human head shoulder images, we first detect face and a few facial features, which helps to estimate an approximate mask covering the interesting region. The algorithm then extracts the hard edge <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> from the specified area using an iterative graph cut method incorporated with an improved Gaussian Mixture Model. To generate accurate soft edges, a Bayes matting is applied. The whole process is fully automatic. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is both robust and efficient. ...|$|R

40|$|Structuring of {{information}} proceeds through the <b>foregrounding</b> <b>of</b> {{certain parts of}} the information. In general, foregrounding can be realized on various linguistic levels and it is possible to distinguish: Conceptual, Functional, Discourse and Pragmatic devices, which can be represented by various formal means: Phonetic-Phonological, Morphological-Syntactic and Lexical-Pragmatic. All the devices can co-occur during the information packaging. Some of them are obligatory and are on the high level of the hierarchically organized processes <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> (e. g. conceptual or functional foregrounding); some of them are optional and they are defined by the specific discourse and/or pragmatic values of a sentence (e. g. focus or topic); some forms <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> are implicational (e. g. sometimes reordering implies emphasis of intonation) and so on. The relations between the different kinds <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> are language specific, but it seems possible to speak about universal models of formalization of the information structures. In Georgian there is no morphological topic marker, but all other devices <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> are possible. The paper examines the main models of such devices. 1...|$|R

Second, such ownership is particularly significant in countries {{with low levels of}} per capita income, underdeveloped financial systems, interventionist and inefficient governments, and poor protection of property rights. Third, government <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> banks is associated with slower subsequent financial development. Finally, government <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> banks is associated with lower subsequent growth of per capita income, and in particular with lower growth of productivity rather than slower factor accumulation.
