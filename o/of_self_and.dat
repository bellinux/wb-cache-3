25|$|Adults with C-PTSD have {{sometimes}} experienced prolonged interpersonal traumatization as {{children as well}} as prolonged trauma as adults. This early injury interrupts the development of a robust sense <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> of others.

25|$|Strengthen team cohesion: The {{extent to}} which group members {{identify}} with their group also determines the amount of social loafing.

When individuals derive their sense <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> identity from their membership, social loafing is replaced by social laboring (members will expand extra effort for their group).|$|E
25|$|From {{this period}} {{through at least}} the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, attitudes toward drinking were characterized by a continued recognition of the positive nature of moderate consumption and an increased concern over the negative effects of drunkenness. The later, which was generally viewed as arising out of the increased self-indulgence of the time, was seen as a threat to spiritual salvation and societal well being. Intoxication was also inconsistent with the emerging emphasis on rational mastery <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> world and on work and efficiency.|$|E

25|$|In the pre-modern era, many people's sense <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> {{purpose was}} often {{expressed}} via a faith {{in some form}} of deity, be it that in a single God or in many gods. Pre-modern cultures have not been thought of creating a sense of distinct individuality, though. Religious officials, who often held positions of power, were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person. It was only through these intermediaries that the general masses had access to the divine. Tradition was sacred to ancient cultures and was unchanging and the social order of ceremony and morals in a culture could be strictly enforced.|$|E
25|$|Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD), {{also known as}} emotionally unstable {{personality disorder}}, is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by unstable relationships with other people, unstable sense <b>of</b> <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> unstable emotions. There is often frequent dangerous behavior, a feeling of emptiness, self-harm, and an extreme fear of abandonment. Symptoms may be brought on by seemingly normal events. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs {{across a variety of}} situations. Substance abuse, depression, and eating disorders are commonly associated with BPD. BPD increases the risk of self-harm and 10% of people affected die by suicide.|$|E
25|$|Passion: An Essay on Personality is a {{philosophical}} inquiry into human nature by philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger. The book explores {{the individual and}} his relation to society, asking how one comes to an understanding <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> others. Unger here sees the root human predicament as the need to establish oneself as a unique individual {{in the world but}} at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context.|$|E

25|$|Structuration is {{very useful}} in synthesising micro and macro issues. On a micro scale, one of individuals' {{internal}} sense <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> identity, consider {{the example of}} a family: we are increasingly free to choose our own mates and how to relate with them, which creates new opportunities but also more work, as the relationship becomes a reflexive project that has to be interpreted and maintained. Yet this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking at the individual level as people did not spontaneously change their minds about how to live; neither can we assume they were directed to do so by social institutions and the state.|$|E
25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E
25|$|This psycho-physical {{process is}} further linked with {{psychological}} craving, manas (conceit) and ditthi (dogmas, views). One {{of the most}} problematic views according to the Buddha, {{is the notion of}} a permanent and solid Self or 'pure ego'. This is because in early Buddhist psychology, there is no fixed self (atta; Sanskrit atman) but the delusion <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> clinging to a self concept affects all one's behaviors and leads to suffering. For the Buddha, there is nothing uniform or substantial about a person, only a constantly changing stream of events or processes categorized under five categories called skandhas (heaps, aggregates), which includes the stream of consciousness (Vijñāna-sotam). False belief and attachment to an abiding ego-entity {{is at the root of}} most negative emotions.|$|E

25|$|Unger {{sees the}} Christian-Romantic {{tradition}} {{as the one}} tradition that puts the individual {{at the center of}} the world and gives him the tools for the liberation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{examining}} employers' {{attempts to}} regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' {{respond to these}} regulations. According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage {{in some form of}} emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a smile and friendly attitude independent of their own mood or temperament at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.|$|E
25|$|Non-penetrative genital {{stimulation}} is {{very common}} throughout the animal kingdom. Different forms <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> partner genital stimulation have been observed in the animal kingdom. Oral sex has been observed throughout the animal kingdom, from dolphins to primates. Bonobos have been observed to transition from a simple demonstration of affection to non-penetrative genital stimulation. Animals perform oral sex by licking, sucking or nuzzling the genitals of their partner. Another form of genital stimulation is masturbation. Masturbation is widespread throughout mammals {{for both males and}} females. It is less common in birds. There are several techniques, in which animals engage in masturbation from using paws, feet, flippers, tails, and sometimes using objects like sticks, pebbles, and leaves. Masturbation occurs more often in primate species with large testes relative to their body size.|$|E
