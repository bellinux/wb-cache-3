25|$|As {{a result}} of falling opinion poll ratings for the <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> in the months {{approaching}} {{the start of the}} campaign, the election was one of the more closely fought in decades, with the outcome being very uncertain.|$|E
25|$|No other {{opposition}} party, noticeably Labour, {{would agree}} to a pre-election pact with Fine Gael, sensing the unpopularity of the party. This meant that no-one felt that Fine Gael {{would be able to}} lead a government after the election. In contrast, the two parties of the <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> fought the election on a united front.|$|E
40|$|Icelandic voters {{recently}} ejected its post-Crisis government – {{a government}} that successfully avoided economic collapse when the odds were stacked against it. The new government comprises the same parties that were originally responsible for the Crisis. What’s going on? This column argues that this switch is, in fact, logical given the <b>outgoing</b> <b>government’s</b> mishandling {{of the economy and}} their deference towards foreign creditors...|$|R

25|$|During the 1990s, {{the water}} and {{sanitation}} sector was decentralized again. In May 1990, the <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> of Alan García decided to transfer all SENAPA constituent companies and operational units to the municipalities. SENAPA was to be converted into a company in charge of only giving technical assistance to the municipalities, a decision that was never implemented.|$|E
25|$|Coalitions {{have been}} {{rare in the}} United Kingdom, because the first-past-the-post system has usually led to one party winning an overall {{majority}} in the Commons. However, with the <b>outgoing</b> <b>Government</b> being a coalition and with opinion polls not showing a large or consistent lead for any one party, there was much discussion about possible post-election coalitions or other arrangements, such as confidence and supply agreements.|$|E
25|$|On 30 January, Napolitano {{appointed}} Franco Marini {{to try to}} form {{a caretaker}} government {{with the goal of}} changing the current electoral system, rather than call a quick election. The state of the electoral system had been under criticism not only within the <b>outgoing</b> <b>government,</b> but also among the opposition and in the general population, because of the impossibility to choose candidates directly and of the risks that a close-call election may not grant a stable majority in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|Hung Parliaments {{have been}} unusual in post-War British {{political}} history, {{but with the}} <b>outgoing</b> <b>Government</b> a coalition and opinion polls not showing a large or consistent lead for any one party, it was widely expected and predicted throughout the election campaign that no party would gain an overall majority, which could {{have led to a}} new coalition or other arrangements such as confidence and supply agreements. This was also associated with a rise in multi-party politics, with increased support for UKIP, the SNP and the Greens.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016 general {{election}} the <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> consisting of Fine Gael and its partner the Labour Party was defeated. The previous government {{had the largest}} majority {{in the history of}} the state with a combined 113 seats out of the 166-seat Dáil Éireann. The aftermath of the {{general election}} resulted in months of negotiations for an agreement of government. A deal was reached with the main opposition and traditional rival Fianna Fáil to facilitate a minority Fine Gael-led government. Fine Gael now governs Ireland alone with eight Independent members of the Dáil.|$|E
25|$|In {{its role}} as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and {{efficiency}} of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.|$|E

500|$|On stamps, {{the name}} of the state has always been written in Irish and rarely also written in English. The overprints were stamped first Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann ("Provisional Government of Ireland") and later Saorstát Éireann ("Irish Free State"). Subsequent stamps nearly all used the name Éire ("Ireland"), even though this was not {{the name of}} the state until the 1937 Constitution took effect. The {{exceptions}} were issued in 1949 and 1950, and used POBLAĊT NA hÉIREANN or Poblacht na h-Éireann ("Republic of Ireland"). This phrase is the official description of the state specified in the Republic of Ireland Act, which came into force in April 1949; the state's name was not changed by the Act. Fianna Fáil defeated the <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> in the 1951 election and abandoned the use of the description, reverting to the name on stamps and elsewhere. Originally, Éire was written in Gaelic type; from 1952 to 1979, many stamps had {{the name of the}} state in Roman type, usually in all caps, and often written EIRE rather than ÉIRE, omitting the síneadh fada accent over the initial 'E'. In 1981 the Department of Posts and Telegraphs recommended the inclusion of the word [...] "Ireland" [...] along with [...] "Éire" [...] on stamps but the Department of the Taoiseach vetoed the idea on the basis it could cause [...] "constitutional and political repercussions" [...] and that [...] "the change could be unwelcome." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the 2009 federal election, Schäuble, by {{then one}} of Germany's most {{seasoned}} politicians, became Minister of Finance in October 2009. Then aged 67, he was the oldest man in the cabinet and the longest-serving member of the parliament {{in the history of}} the Federal Republic. He was also one of seven conservative ministers in Merkel's <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> who remained in power. By 2014, the Wall Street Journal called Schäuble [...] "Germany's second most powerful person after Chancellor Angela Merkel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fortuyn {{explicitly}} distanced {{himself from}} [...] "far-right" [...] politicians such as the Belgian Filip Dewinter, the Austrian Jörg Haider, or Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Pen whenever compared to them. While he compared his own politics to centre-right politicians such as Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, he also admired former Dutch Prime Minister Joop den Uyl, a social democrat, and Democratic U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Fortuyn also criticised the Polder model and {{the policies of the}} <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> of Wim Kok and repeatedly described himself and LPF's ideology as pragmatic and not populistic.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the eve of}} Japan's surrender, Kim and his {{supporters}} tried {{to take control of}} the situation. On August 12, Kim's <b>outgoing</b> <b>government</b> was retained as [...] "Provisional Government" [...] to oversee the day-to-day running of the country. Kim asked Bảo Đại to issue an imperial order on August 14 repealing the treaties of 1862 and 1874, thus removing the last French claims to sovereign rights over Vietnam. Messengers were sent from the central capital to northern and southern Vietnam to reunify diverse groups under the central government in Thuận Hóa, but they were apprehended en route by the Viet Minh.|$|E
2500|$|Members of Canada's Liberal Party, {{who lost}} the 2006 Election (as the <b>outgoing</b> <b>government)</b> have {{attempted}} to change their positions, and {{have been accused of}} [...] "flip-flopping" [...] on the issue during the election campaign as well as being questioned about their sincerity. Many Chinese, particularly the surviving head tax payers and their descendants have criticized Raymond Chan, the Chinese-Canadian cabinet minister who was left in charge of settling the matter, for compromising the Chinese community in favour of the government. Recent published articles, in fact, indicate that he deliberately misled the public regarding a number of facts and issues.|$|E
50|$|Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime {{minister}} said {{within the first}} month of the October 2015 election that he had plans to restore relations between the two nations, {{in the wake of the}} Iranian nuclear deal, in which the <b>outgoing</b> Harper <b>government</b> had strongly opposed.|$|R
50|$|The Liberal Party won the {{election}} after a campaign focused mostly on inflation, industrial unrest, states' rights and education. The <b>outgoing</b> Tonkin <b>government</b> had had a turbulent ride in its three years of office, having only a one-seat majority in the Assembly and being outnumbered two-to-one in the Council.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{a second}} debate {{involving}} the [...] "challengers", those in the above list who were not members of the <b>outgoing</b> coalition <b>government.</b> There were also two programmes - one with Cameron and Miliband; one with Cameron, Miliband and Clegg - in which the leaders answered questions but did not debate head-to-head.|$|R
2500|$|This {{election}} was fought as a contest for Taoiseach between the outgoing Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition and the [...] "Alliance for Change"; a proposed Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition. Opinion polls {{did not show}} either option as being certain, and other possibilities include Fianna Fáil-led coalition with other parties, or Fine Gael and the Labour Party with the Green Party. Fine Gael and the Labour Party had an agreed transfer pact. The Green Party was non-aligned but made statements favouring a change from the <b>outgoing</b> <b>Government.</b> [...] All parties, {{with the exception of}} the Green Party, claimed that they would not include Sinn Féin in a new Government.|$|E
6000|$|The {{executive}} transition {{was to be}} gradual. The {{office of}} viceroy [...] would remain, {{but he would not}} be the minister of a party, nor [...] quit office with an <b>outgoing</b> <b>government.</b> He would have a privy [...] council; within that council would be formed an executive body of [...] ministers like the British cabinet. This executive would be [...] responsible to the Irish legislature, just as the executive [...] government here is responsible to the legislature of this country. [...] If any clause of a bill seemed to the viceroy to be ultra vires, [...] he could refer it to the judicial committee of the privy council [...] in London. The same reference, in respect of a section of an Irish [...] Act, lay open either to the English secretary of state, or to a [...] suitor, defendant, or other person concerned.|$|E

This led to speculation of a possibility of a coalition between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, of a minority government, or of another general election later in 2016. Talks to form a government got underway in March.|$|R
