5|$|In the {{meantime}} Sigismund also arrived and was crowned in Kraków, which initiated his {{long in the}} Commonwealth (1587–1632) reign as Zygmunt III Waza.

However concerning the latter, the control of Estonia had soon become the bone <b>of</b> <b>contention.</b> Sigismund's ultra-Catholicism appeared threatening to the Swedish Protestant establishment and contributed to his dethronement in Sweden in 1599.|$|E
