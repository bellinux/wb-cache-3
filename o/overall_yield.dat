5|$|Bupropion is a {{substituted}} cathinone. It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position {{adjacent to the}} ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% <b>overall</b> <b>yield.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> of the enemy territory.|$|E
25|$|Partial rootzone drying {{has been}} shown to {{significantly}} increase a vine's water use efficiency. While PRD is shown to slightly reduce leaf area, this is generally not a problem as <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> is unaffected.|$|E
50|$|Nakabululu clones are soft-textured and savory. They mature quickly, {{but their}} fruits are smaller and have lesser <b>overall</b> <b>yields</b> per bunch.|$|R
30|$|For all {{practical}} purposes xylitol production represents a loss of carbon that could be converted to ethanol. The lower xylitol production in strategies employing fed-batch prefermentation contributed to the xylose conversion efficiency and, thus, the higher <b>overall</b> ethanol <b>yields</b> obtained. Despite lower xylose utilization the <b>overall</b> ethanol <b>yields</b> were higher than for strategies employing batch prefermentation (Table  3). The higher <b>overall</b> ethanol <b>yields</b> were correlated with the decreased xylitol production obtained with fed-batch prefermentation.|$|R
40|$|A concise {{and highly}} {{efficient}} protocol for {{the synthesis of}} barbigerone and its structural analogues is reported. Resorcinol was converted to the final products via Friedel-Crafts reaction, pyranoid ring formation, aldol reaction, and oxidation-rearrangement-cyclization with 24 %similar to 30 % <b>overall</b> <b>yields...</b>|$|R
25|$|A total {{asymmetric}} synthesis of salvinorinA, which {{relies on a}} transannular Michael reaction cascade to construct the ring system, was achieved in 2007 by Evans and co-workers in 4.5% <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> over 30 steps. More recently, a synthesis was published by a Japanese group, requiring 24 steps to yield salvinorinA in 0.15% yield.|$|E
25|$|The first {{synthesis}} of tropinone was by Richard Willstätter in 1901. It started from the seemingly related cycloheptanone, but required many steps {{to introduce the}} nitrogen bridge; the <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> for the synthesis path is only 0.75%. Willstätter had previously synthesized cocaine from tropinone, in {{what was the first}} synthesis and elucidation of the structure of cocaine.|$|E
25|$|The Schreiber {{team found}} that the NiCl2 and CrCl2 {{promoted}} addition of alkynyl iodide to aldehyde effectively. The reaction provides a 2:1 mixture of desired product and its isomer. However, the undesired isomer can be recycled to the desired epimer in three steps, including Swern oxidation and Corey’s asymmetric reduction. Pd catalyzed partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to establish the Z-configuration at C(8)–C(9). The pivaloyloxy group was then converted to a bromide for the final coupling. A stereoselective enolate alkylation between the allylic bromide with the lithium enolate derived from the second fragment provided a 3:1 mixture of isomers and completed the backbone assembly of (-)-discodermolide. During the final conversion, the NaBH4 reduction of ketone provided a separable 2.5:1 mixture of isomers. The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> of 3.2% with a longest linear sequence of 24 steps and 36 total steps. In 1996, the Schreiber group published the total synthesis of natural discodermolide with similar synthetic strategy (4.3% <b>overall</b> <b>yield,</b> 36 steps, 24 steps longest linear sequence.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Paterson and his {{co-workers}} disclosed the third-generation total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide. The stepwise method used in previous generations to incorporate the C(1)–C(8) subunit {{was replaced by a}} late-stage Still-Gennari olefination, which leads to a notable improvement in convergence. The Paterson third-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> of 11.1% (highest reported to date) with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps and 37 total steps.|$|E
25|$|Paterson and his {{co-workers}} at the University of Cambridge have developed a strategy which utilizes novel chelation-controlled and reagent-controlled aldol reactions with high selectivity for subunit connections. Another feature of this synthesis was the induction of C(8)-C(9) olefin with cis geometry via Still-Gennari Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction. The Paterson first-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> of 10.3% with a longest linear sequence of 23 steps and 42 total steps.|$|E
25|$|Oats {{can also}} be left {{standing}} until completely ripe and then combined with a grain head. This causes greater field losses as the grain falls from the heads, and to harvesting losses, as the grain is threshed out by the reel. Without a draper head, there is also more damage to the straw, since it is not properly oriented as it enters the combine's throat. <b>Overall</b> <b>yield</b> loss is 10–15% compared to proper swathing.|$|E
50|$|No chromatographic {{techniques}} provide 100% {{yield of}} active material and <b>overall</b> <b>yields</b> {{depend on the}} number of steps in the purification protocol. By optimizing each step for the intended purpose and arranging them that minimizes inter step treatments, the number of steps will be minimized.|$|R

25|$|Palladium(0)-mediated crosscoupling of vinyl iodide {{with the}} organozinc {{derivative}} of alkyl iodide afford product in 66% yield. After a two-step conversion to the corresponding phosphonium salt, wittig union of phosphonium salt with aldehyde, fragment C, proceeded in 76% yield and good selectivity. The last {{feature of this}} synthesis was the titanium-mediated installation of the diene. The smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> of 2.0% with a longest linear sequence of 29 steps and 42 total steps.|$|E
25|$|In the Marshall synthesis, the {{coupling}} between the alkyne fragment to the aldehyde fragment proceeded in 92% yield, with 85:15 diastereoselectivity. The condensation of aldehyde with iodoethylidene triphenylphosphorane {{was the most}} challenging step, which produce 40% yield and an 85:15 inseparable mixture of (Z) and (E) isomers. The last coupling was performed via a Suzuki union of vinyl iodide with the boronate derived of alkyl iodide. The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> of 1.3% with a longest linear sequence of 30 steps and 48 total steps.|$|E
25|$|Aside from total synthesis, a {{potentially}} useful application of hydrogen bond catalysis is the bulk synthesis of difficult-to-access chiral small molecules. A notable {{example is the}} gram-scale Strecker synthesis of unnatural amino acids using thiourea catalysis, reported in the journal Nature in 2009. The catalyst, whether polymer-bound or homogeneous, is derived from natural tert-leucine and can catalyze (4mol% catalyst loading) {{the formation of the}} Strecker product from benzhydryl amines and aqueous HCN.

5000|$|Modular {{synthesis}} {{allows for}} a more diverse range of structures, however the multi-step reactions can result in lower <b>overall</b> <b>yields.</b> In general synthesis involves the generation of separate mono‑oxazoline (typically halogenated) and bis-oxazoline units, which are then coupled using a strong base such as tBuLi [...] or KN(SiMe3)2.|$|R
3000|$|... (3) and (4) were {{synthesized}} in <b>overall</b> <b>yields</b> of 4 and 60 %, respectively, whilst {{the last}} synthesis {{steps of the}} reference compounds for (5) and (6) were obtained with yields of 57 and 65 %, respectively. This led to an <b>overall</b> synthesis <b>yield</b> of 2.1 % for (5) and 39 % for (6). After purification, both reference compounds (5) and (6) showed no impurities and they were analysed using proton and carbon NMR. Exact masses {{were found to be}} 345.0787 for (5) and 345.0791 for compound (6).|$|R
25|$|After the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT), which limited {{underground}} explosions to 150 kilotons or less, warheads {{like the}} half-megaton W88 {{had to be}} tested at less than full yield. Since the primary must be detonated at full yield in order to generate data about the implosion of the secondary, the reduction in yield had {{to come from the}} secondary. Replacing much of the lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel with lithium-7 hydride limited the tritium available for fusion, and thus the <b>overall</b> <b>yield,</b> without changing the dynamics of the implosion. The functioning of the device could be evaluated using light pipes, other sensing devices, and analysis of trapped weapon debris. The full yield of the stockpiled weapon could be calculated by extrapolation.|$|E
25|$|In {{this first}} usage the oxazoline ligand {{performed}} poorly, giving an ee of 4.9% compared to 65.6% {{from one of}} the Schiff base ligands. However Brunner reinvestigated oxazoline ligands during research into the monophenylation of diols, leading to the development of chiral pyridine oxazoline ligands, which achieved ee's of 30.2% in 1986 and 45% in 1989. In the same year Pfaltz et al. reported the use of C2‑symmetric semicorrin ligands for enantioselective carbenoid cyclopropanations, achieving impressive results with ee's of between 92-97%. Reference was made to both Brunner's and Aratani's work, however the design of the ligands was also largely based on his earlier work with various macrocycles. A disadvantage of these ligands however, was that they required a multi-step synthesis with a low <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> of approximately 30%.|$|E
25|$|During the {{introduction}} of business rates, criticism focused {{on the level of}} the multiplier to be chosen, and on the transitional relief scheme, with organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry calling for a lower multiplier and a relief scheme more to the benefit of its members. In 2007, the Lyons Inquiry into Local Government said there was no significant opposition to the principles of the tax, but that the level was a concern to property-intensive businesses. Due to the <b>overall</b> <b>yield</b> being linked to the Retail Prices Index as a measure of inflation, the contribution of business rates to local government finance has decreased compared to Council Tax and government grants. Many local authorities have called for the rate to be increased, and for the power to set the multiplier to be returned to local control; both suggestions have been opposed by business organisations such as the British Retail Consortium. The Lyons Inquiry rejected the return to local control, and instead proposed giving local authorities the power to levy a local supplement, in consultation with affected businesses; responses from the business sector have ranged from caution to opposition.|$|E

Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten."
