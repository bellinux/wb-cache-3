5|$|Brussels' hosting <b>of</b> <b>institutions</b> {{has made}} it a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has {{attracted}} more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to {{the large number of}} people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school.

The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E
