2500|$|The King George Vs {{were the}} first British battleships to {{alternate}} engine rooms and boilers in the machinery spaces, which reduced the likelihood of one hit causing the loss of all power. The machinery was arranged in four engine (turbine) rooms and four boiler rooms, with the 8 machinery compartments alternating in pairs of engine or boiler rooms. Each pair of boiler rooms formed a unit {{with a pair of}} engine rooms. Nominal full power was 110,000 shaft horsepower at 230 rpm with [...] steam at [...] The machinery was designed to operate at an overload power of 125,000 shp and Prince of Wales [...] "...main machinery steamed at overload powers of 128,000 to 134,000 shaft horsepower with no difficulties..." [...] during the hunt for the Bismarck. The Admiralty boilers operated very efficiently and similar boilers of nearly identical power, fitted to [...] during her rebuilding in 1937, achieved a full power specific fuel consumption [...] of 0.748lb per shp on trials which compared favourably with contemporary battleships. During full power trials on 10 December 1940, King George V at 41,630 tons displacement achieved 111,700 shp at 230 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.715lb per shp. [...] After 1942 the Royal Navy was forced to use fuel oils with considerably higher viscosity and greater seawater content than these boilers could efficiently use. The poor quality of the oil fuel combined with the seawater contamination to reduce the efficiency of the steam power plant and increased the maintenance required. [...] By 1944 the specific full power fuel consumption had increased to 0.8lb per shp and boiler maintenance was becoming increasingly difficult. The Admiralty had been aware of this problem and were designing new types of <b>oil</b> <b>sprayers</b> and burners that could burn the available fuel oil much more efficiently, and sometime after 1944, Duke of York and Anson were fitted with new, higher pressure, <b>oil</b> <b>sprayers</b> and burners that restored the boilers to full efficiency.

40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to generate drift curves from pesticide applications on coffee plants and to compare them with two European drift‑prediction models. The used methodology {{is based on the}} ISO 22866 standard. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with ten replicates in a 2 x 20 split‑plot arrangement. The evaluated factors were: two types of nozzles (hollow cone with and without air induction) and 20 parallel distances to the crop line outside of the target area, spaced at 2. 5 m. Blotting papers were used as a target and placed in each of the evaluated distances. The spray solution was composed of water+rhodamine B fluorescent tracer at a concentration of 100 mg L‑ 1, for detection by fluorimetry. A spray volume of 400 L ha‑ 1 was applied using a hydropneumatic <b>sprayer.</b> The air‑induction <b>nozzle</b> reduces the drift up to 20 m from the treated area. The application with the hollow cone nozzle results in 6. 68 % maximum drift in the nearest collector of the treated area.

40|$|When liquids {{are forced}} under {{pressure}} through small orifices (like <b>sprayer</b> <b>nozzles)</b> they are sheared into small aerosols or particles having nearly a thousand fold range in spherical diameters. Owing to gravitational {{forces and the}} viscosity of air, the rate of fall to ground can be predicted by Stokes Law and {{is proportional to the}} radius of the particles. The rate of fall before a particle hits ground (or conversely how long a particle remains in air before it falls a given distance) is modified by entrainment in a mobile air mass. Rate of fall of a spray particle will also be influenced by the rate of evaporation of the liquid constituting the aerosol. The longer the aerosol remains in air before falling to ground (or alternatively striking an object above ground) the greater the opportunity to be carried away from its intended target (e. g., crop canopy). In general, all size classes of spray particles are capable of movement off-target, but the smallest particles would move the farthest before depositing on the ground. Drift has been historically considered to be the movement of pesticide residues via air masses during and after application. Post application movement of pesticide residues (i. e., after deposition on plants or soil) via volatilization has been distinguished as secondary o...|$|R

Maize leaves were sprayed varying the neem extracts, <b>sprayer</b> <b>nozzles,</b> concentration and number of application. In the first experiment, the results showed the smallest damage to chlorpyrifos (2. 00) and for the aqueous extracts from neem leaves (2. 50) applied three times through flat nozzles. The commercial extract did not protect maize leaves from larval damage (7. 22 to 7. 90). The larval development showed consistent with the low leaves damage, resulting in the low larval weight (97. 41 mg). In the second experiment, the smallest leaves damage (2. 62 and 2. 65) were observed in three applications of the aqueous extract, using 80. 01 / 80. 04 / 80. 01 nozzles, 10, 000 and 7, 500 ppm, respectively.
