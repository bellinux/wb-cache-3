25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1kg of meat {{requires}} up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires {{nearly half of}} the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{generally}} {{have a higher}} food conversion efficiency than more traditional meats, measured as efficiency of conversion of ingested food, or ECI. While many insects can have an energy input to protein <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> of around 4:1, raised livestock has a ratio closer to 54:1. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that feed first needs to be grown for most traditional livestock. Additionally endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates need to use a significantly greater amount of energy just to stay warm whereas ectothermic (cold blooded) plants or insects do not. An index which can be used as a measure is the Efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance: for example, only 10% of ingested food is converted to body substance by beef cattle, versus 19–31% by silkworms and 44% by German cockroaches. Studies concerning the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) provide further evidence for the efficiency of insects as a food source. When reared at 30°C or more and fed a diet of equal quality to the diet used to rear conventional livestock, crickets showed a food conversion twice as efficient as pigs and broiler chicks, four times that of sheep, and six times higher than steers (oxen) when losses in carcass trim and dressing percentage are counted.|$|E
500|$|Growth {{had been}} of {{interest}} to 18th-century classical economists like Adam Smith, but work tapered off during the 19th and early 20th century marginalist revolution when researchers focused on microeconomics. The study of growth revived when neo-Keynesians Roy Harrod and Evsey Domar independently developed the Harrod–Domar model, an extension of Keynes's theory to the long-run, an area Keynes had not looked at himself. Their models combined Keynes's multiplier with an accelerator model of investment, and produced the simple result that growth equaled the savings rate divided by the capital <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> (the amount of capital divided {{by the amount of}} output). The Harrod–Domar model dominated growth theory until Robert Solow and Trevor Swan independently developed neoclassical growth models in 1956. Solow and Swan produced a more empirically appealing model with [...] "balanced growth" [...] based on the substitution of labor and capital in production. Solow and Swan suggested that increased savings could only temporarily increase growth, and only technological improvements could increase growth in the long-run. After Solow and Swan, growth research tapered off with little or no research on growth from 1970 until 1985.|$|E

5000|$|For example, [...] "normal" [...] fouling at a {{conventionally}} fired 500 MW (net electrical power) {{power station}} unit accounts for output losses of the steam turbine of 5 MW and more. In a 1,300 MW nuclear power station, typical losses could be 20 MW and up (up to 100% if the station shuts down due to fouling-induced component degradation). In seawater desalination plants, fouling may reduce the gained <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> by two-digit percentages (the gained <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> is an equivalent that puts the mass of generated distillate {{in relation to the}} steam used in the process). The extra electrical consumption in compressor-operated coolers is also easily in the two-digit area. In addition to the operational costs, also the capital cost increases because the heat exchangers have to be designed in larger sizes to compensate for the heat-transfer loss due to fouling. To the output losses listed above, one needs to add the cost of down-time required to inspect, clean, and repair the components (millions of dollars per day of shutdown in lost revenue in a typical power plant), and the cost of actually doing this maintenance. Finally, fouling is often a root cause of serious degradation problems that may limit the life of components or entire plants.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a growth model of technology diffusion and endogenous Total Factor Productivity (TFP) levels {{both at the}} sector and aggregate level. At the aggregate, the model behaves as the Neoclassical growth model. Our goal is for this model {{to bridge the gap}} between the theoretical and empirical studies of technology adoption and economic growth. We bridge this gap in three important directions. First of all, we use our model to show how one unified theoretical framework is broadly consistent with the observed dynamics of both economic growth as well as of many different measures of technology adoption, like adoption rates, capital to <b>output</b> <b>ratios,</b> and <b>output</b> <b>ratios.</b> Secondly, we estimate our model using a broad range of technological adoption measures, covering 17 technologies and 21 industrialized countries over the past 180 years. This allows us to show how its predicted adoption patterns fit those observed in the data. Finally, we estimate the disparities in sectoral productivity levels as well as aggregate TFP that can be attributed to the differences in the range of technologies in use across countries. These disparities are almost completely determined by the quality of the worst technology in use, rather than by the quality of the newest technology that has just been adopted or by the number of technologies in use. Further, we find that the TFP component attributable to the range of technologies used is highly correlated with overall sectoral TFP differences across countries, though the variance is smaller. ...|$|R
50|$|The final {{important}} {{chain in}} the default trap mechanism {{is that the}} increase in the ratio of debt to output will induce higher probability of future default. Is this positive relationship between debts to <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> with default probability true? Rogoff, Reinhart, and Savastano supported this relationship by tracing a history of default back to 1820s. In their conclusion, they argued that the safe international debt to GNP threshold are low, perhaps as low as 15 percent in some cases and country specific threshold depends on a country’s default history. The probability of default for a given debt-to-GNP level is increasing with the number of past defaults. Moreover, If a country ever defaulted before, even a lower debt to <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> may be enough to make it default again compared with another country of the same debt level but of no default history. The higher the ratio to output it is, the higher risk of the default it will be. From the 1970s to 2002, the 9 Latin American default countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Philippines, Turkeys and Venezuela had their average institutional investor ratings (approximate as repayment probability) as 39.4 and average debt to GNP ratio as 44.1, while the no default countries like India, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand had 61.8 as their repayment probability and 27 as average debt to GNP ratio.|$|E
50|$|A {{voltage divider}} {{can be used}} as a crude logic level shifter to {{interface}} two circuits that use different operating voltages. For example, some logic circuits operate at 5V whereas others operate at 3.3V. Directly interfacing a 5V logic output to a 3.3V input may cause permanent damage to the 3.3V circuit. In this case, a voltage divider with an <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.3/5 might be used to reduce the 5V signal to 3.3V, to allow the circuits to interoperate without damaging the 3.3V circuit. For this to be feasible, the 5V source impedance and 3.3V input impedance must be negligible, or they must be constant and the divider resistor values must account for their impedances. If the input impedance is capacitive, a purely resistive divider will limit the data rate. This can be roughly overcome by adding a capacitor in series with the top resistor, to make both legs of the divider capacitive as well as resistive.|$|E
50|$|The above two {{phenomenon}} are {{explained by}} including two structural features: high conditional volatility of output, a well-documented fact in Kose et al. and in Arellano and Catão and Kapur that higher output volatility tends to raise higher interest rates; high persistence in output shocks discussed in Aguiar and Gopinath that greater output persistence tends to raise sovereign default risk. From these literatures, {{it is clearly}} that countries with more volatile and persistent output shocks {{are more likely to}} face higher spreads(lower debt issuing price) and thus more likely to fall into default traps. Without output shock persistence, default will not have information on the expected future output and future default probability and thus on the change of the future debt to expected <b>output</b> <b>ratio.</b> Volatility on the one hand increases the need for international borrowing to help smooth domestic consumption {{and on the other hand}} causes low enough output realizations for borrowers to default.|$|E
