50|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wealthier</b> individual, {{the risk of}} losing $100 would be less significant, and for such small amounts his utility {{function}} would be likely to be almost linear, for instance if u(0) = 0 and u(100) = 10, then u(40) might be 4 and u(50) might be 5.|$|R

5|$|The {{hundreds}} of villae found in Switzerland, some very luxurious, {{attest to the}} existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wealthy</b> and cultured upper class of landowners.

Urmston was only one of three manors in Trafford to have had two medieval halls, the others being Hale and Timperley. Neither of the halls has survived to the present day.|$|E

5|$|Wulfred is {{believed}} to have come from Middlesex and to have been a member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wealthy</b> and important family with considerable landholdings in Middlesex and neighbouring regions. Although earlier historians felt that Wulfred came from the Kentish nobility, it no longer appears that this was so. A kinsman, Werhard, owned property near Hayes, and Wulfred later owned property there also. Other evidence suggests that he was related to a noble family that owned lands in Harrow and Twickenham as well as Hayes.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Boston Latin School in 1750, Hancock {{enrolled}} in Harvard College and received a bachelor's degree in 1754.

Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. John Hancock learned much about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed playing the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wealthy</b> aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.|$|E

5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views {{had a profound effect}} on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wealthy</b> cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{was born}} in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 29, 1809. His birthplace, a house just north of Harvard Yard, {{was said to have}} been the place where the Battle of Bunker Hill was planned.

Sarah was the daughter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wealthy</b> family, and Holmes was named for his maternal grandfather, a judge. The first Wendell, Evert Jansen, left the Netherlands in 1640 and settled in Albany, New York. Also through his mother, Holmes was descended from Massachusetts Governor Simon Bradstreet and his wife, Anne Bradstreet (daughter of Thomas Dudley), the first published American poet.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 Bondfield met Mary Macarthur, some {{eight years}} her junior, {{who chaired the}} Ayr branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wealthy</b> Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a works meeting in 1901 to discuss {{the formation of a}} NAUSAWC branch transformed her into an ardent trades unionist. In 1903 Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield's recommendation, she became secretary of the Women's Trade Union League. The two became close comrades-in-arms during the next two decades, in a range of causes affecting women. The historian Lise Sanders suggests that Bondfield's more intimate friendships tended to be with women rather than men; Bondfield's biographer Mary Hamilton described Macarthur as the romance of Bondfield's life.|$|E
