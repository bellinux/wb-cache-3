The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, most notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and, most recently, Vietnam, which overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999 and reached 15% market share by 2011.|$|E
25|$|Processing <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> India is {{accomplished}} using two methods, dry processing and wet processing. Dry processing {{is the traditional}} method of drying in the sun which is favoured for its flavour producing characteristics. In the wet processing method, coffee beans are fermented and washed, which is the preferred method for improved yields. As to the wet processing, the beans are subject to cleaning to segregate defective seeds. The beans of different varieties and sizes are then blended to derive the best flavour. The next procedure is to roast either through roasters or individual roasters. Then the roasted coffee is ground to appropriate sizes.|$|E
25|$|The first coffee {{plantation}} in Brazil occurred in 1727 when Lt. Col.

Brazil, which {{like most other}} countries cultivates coffee as a commercial commodity, relied heavily on slave labor from Africa for {{the viability of the}} plantations until the abolition of slavery in 1888. The success <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> 17th-century Europe was paralleled with the spread of the habit of tobacco smoking all over the continent {{during the course of the}} Thirty Years' War (1618–1648).|$|E
