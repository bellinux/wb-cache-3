5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>market.</b> Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, Maryland's economy was {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} price fluctuations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>market</b> of its main cash crop, tobacco. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the cost of production, leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.|$|E

25|$|For {{more than}} one hundred years, the iron ore found in the Lahn-Dill area (haematite) was {{processed}} at the Sophienhütte ironworks. As of 1887, iron ore mines were being shut down one by one, interrupted only by the First World War, because foreign ore from strip mines was being offered at lower prices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>market.</b> In 1926, mining came to an end altogether.|$|E

From 1906 to 1947 the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company {{was the primary}} producer here, with output reaching its peak in the 1930s. However, by 1947, mining here had become too costly, because of political instability, labor disputes and low prices for silver <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>market.</b> The company sold its interests to the Mexican government in 1965.|$|E

25|$|Russia {{bounced back}} from the August 1998 {{financial}} crash with surprising speed. Much {{of the reason for}} the recovery is that world oil prices rapidly rose during 1999–2000 (just as falling energy prices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>market</b> helped to deepen Russia's financial troubles), so that Russia ran a large trade surplus in 1999 and 2000.

The well-off millionaire and billionaire oligarchs likened themselves to 19th century robber barons. Rather than creating new enterprises, Yeltsin's democratization led to international monopolies hijacking the former Soviet markets, arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
