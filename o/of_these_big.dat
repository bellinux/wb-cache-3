[...] Among the non-Russian entrants were Ludwig von Salm-Hoogstraeten, Harold Kitson and Einer Ulrich. The first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>big</b> tests came in the semifinals against Count Salm. The Austrian lost in straight sets only showing resistance in the second. [...] The final match should have been a showdown between Kitson and Sumarokov but lasted short. After Sumarokov scored the first set 6:3 Kitson got frustrated, complained to the chair umpire, grabbed his towel and left the court citing a right hand injury, which resulted in a walkover home victory. He became the undisputed champion after winning the doubles and mixed doubles as well with Count Salm and Ekaterina Hirschfeld respectively.|$|E

The importance of Titania scattering layers was studied as a part <b>of</b> this work. <b>These</b> scattering layers were prepared from two different grain-sizes (100 nm & 500 nm) for SQ 2 -NIR and N 3 -UV/Vis DSCs.
