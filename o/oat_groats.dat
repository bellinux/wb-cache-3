25|$|This process uses {{two large}} smooth or {{corrugated}} rolls spinning {{at the same}} speed in opposite directions at a controlled distance. After rolling, the oats are then toasted to make rolled oats. Oat flakes, also known as rolled oats, have many different sizes, thicknesses and other characteristics {{depending on the size of}} <b>oat</b> <b>groats</b> passed between the rolls. Typically, the three sizes of steel cut oats are used to make instant, baby and quick rolled oats, whereas whole <b>oat</b> <b>groats</b> are used to make regular, medium and thick rolled oats. Oat flakes range in thickness from 0.36mm to 1.00mm.|$|E
25|$|The unsized <b>oat</b> <b>groats</b> {{pass through}} a heat and {{moisture}} treatment to balance moisture, but mainly to stabilize them. <b>Oat</b> <b>groats</b> are high in fat (lipids) and once removed from their protective hulls and exposed to air, enzymatic (lipase) activity begins {{to break down the}} fat into free fatty acids, ultimately causing an off-flavour or rancidity. Oats begin to show signs of enzymatic rancidity within four days of being dehulled if not stabilized. This process is primarily done in food-grade plants, not in feed-grade plants. Groats are not considered raw if they have gone through this process; the heat disrupts the germ and they cannot sprout.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of bait and the {{effectiveness of}} operational baiting were both evaluated for controlling forest pocket gophers (Thomomys spp.) with strychnine <b>oat</b> <b>groat</b> bait and diphacinone paraffin block bait. Radio-telemetry monitoring and recovery of pocket gophers showed that control of individual pocket gophers 1 month after baiting was 72 % for strychnine bait and 62 % for diphacinone bait. Reduction in pocket gopher activity from operational baiting was based on censusing activity in sample plots. After 1 month the reduction in activity was 61 % for strychnine oats and 36 % for diphacinone blocks. Bait blocks implanted with radio transmitters were extensively moved and fed on by pocket gophers. Pocket gopher activity was not significantly reduced by either treatment 6 months or 1 year after baiting...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{procedure to}} classify <b>oat</b> and <b>groat</b> kernels based on coupling hyperspectral imaging (HSI) {{in the near}} infrared (NIR) range (1006 - 1650 nm) and chemometrics was designed, developed and validated. According to market requirements, the amount of groat, that is the hull-less oat kernels, {{is one of the}} most important quality characteristics of oats. Hyperspectral images of <b>oat</b> and <b>groat</b> samples have been acquired by using a NIR spectral camera (Specim, Finland) and the resulting data hypercubes were analyzed applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for exploratory purposes and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) to build the classification models to discriminate the two kernel typologies. Results showed that it is possible to accurately recognize <b>oat</b> and <b>groat</b> single kernels by HSI (prediction accuracy was almost 100 %). The study demonstrated also that good classification results could be obtained using only three wavelengths (1132, 1195 and 1608 nm), selected by means of a bootstrap-VIP procedure, allowing to speed up the classification processing for industrial applications. The developed objective and non-destructive method based on HSI can be utilized for quality control purposes and/or for the definition of innovative sorting logics of oat grains. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

50|$|Many foods can be dried or {{dehydrated}} {{to reduce}} water weight. Dehydrated meals {{can be purchased}} or dehydrated at home. On the trail, rehydration can typically be performed by cooking in hot water.

40|$|Agronomic, {{genetic and}} {{environmental}} influences on oat grain quality were investigated. Nitrogen application at the boot stage of crop development did not generally affect physical characteristics of <b>oat</b> grain. <b>Groat</b> protein content increased with {{the application of}} nitrogen at the boot stage of crop development but oil content tended to decrease while $ beta$-glucan content was generally not affected. Delayed seeding usually reduced oat grain quality and usually increased protein and $ beta$-glucan contents. Heritability of $ beta$-glucan content, groat percentage and rust resistance were all low; hence, breeding to improve these traits may be difficult. Results of experiments on the inheritance of $ beta$-glucan were not conclusive {{but it appears that}} $ beta$-glucan content is {{under the influence of the}} endosperm genome. Genotype by environment interactions were significant for grain yield and for protein, oil and $ beta$-glucan contents. The cultivars Ultima and Sylva were superior in mean grain yield across environments compared to other cultivars. The cultivars Laurent and Nova were superior for mean protein content across environments and the cultivar Marion QC was superior for mean oil and $ beta$-glucan contents.

40|$|We {{examined}} if Valley pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) {{exhibited a}} seasonal preference for consuming steamed-rolled <b>oat</b> (SRO) <b>groat</b> bait treated with 1. 6 % Dupont oil blue A (fat-marking dye). Field {{tests were conducted}} in California alfalfa fields during winter, summer, and fall, and in walnut orchards during winter and summer. Five treatment units (TUs) were established each with 60 burrows for each season and habitat studied during 1997 – 1999. SRO groat marker bait (4 g) was placed inside each active burrow. All bait sites were re-opened about 96 h later and examined for the presence (all or some) or absence of bait. The average bait site disturbance after 4 days of baiting was 78. 2 %. Traps were used to capture gophers up to 5 days after baiting. Valley pocket gophers (n= 744) were examined {{for the presence of}} blue dye in their cheek pouches, skin/fur, and fat. We expected that if gophers moved the bait, their cheek pouches and fur would be marked; if they consumed bait, their fat would be marked. In alfalfa, 54. 2 %, 46. 8 %, and 65. 7 %, of gophers were marked (trapping on days 5 – 9) by blue dye in one or more of their cheek pouches, skin, fur, or subcutaneous fat in the winter, summer, or fall, respectively. In orchards, 57. 1 % of gophers were marked in winter and 53. 4 % in summer. Of those that were marked, all (100 %) had their fat dyed blue, followed by skin/fur (34. 4 % males: 43. 7 % females) and cheek pouches (5. 7 % males: 10. 1 % females). ANOVA results indicated no difference in seasonal marking efficacy in either alfalfa or orchards (F= 3. 59, P= 0. 0598 and F= 0. 12, P= 0. 7384, respectively). The usefulness of 1. 6 % Dupont oil blue A dye as a marking agent for Valley pocket gophers was not demonstrated overall or for any season in either habitat. Therefore, a better marker for this gopher is needed. Some factors that may have influenced these results were discussed including: (1) baiting methodology (66 % of the bait sites were devoid of bait {{at the end of the}} study), (2) species specific dye properties, (3) bait acceptance (i. e. aversion to the dye), or (4) availability of alternative foods...|$|R
5000|$|The oat, {{like other}} cereals, has a hard, {{inedible}} outer husk {{that must be}} removed before the grain can be eaten.

40|$|Most dry dog {{foods are}} based on cereals, but very little {{published}} information and few comparative studies {{are available on the}} nutritive value of various cereals in dogs. To determine the apparent nutrient digestibilities and feed values of five different autoclave-processed and ground cereals: <b>oat</b> <b>groats,</b> barley, wheat, corn and rice, a digestibility trial was carried out on twelve adult huskies according to a 6 x 4 cyclic changeover design. Total tract organic matter (OM), crude carbohydrate and gross energy (GE) digestibilities were higher in rice than in all the other cereals. Apparent crude protein (CP) and acid hydrolyzed fat digestibilities of rice (80 % and 94 %, respectively) were as good as for <b>oat</b> <b>groats</b> (81 % and 93 %). However, <b>oat</b> <b>groats</b> had higher OM, CP and GE digestibilities than barley, wheat and corn.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the nutritional value of oats and oat products in diets of weanling pigs. In Exp. 1, 115 weanling pigs (avg initial body wt of 12. 4 lb and avg age of 19 d) were used in a 38 -d growth assay. Treatments were 1) a corn-soybean meal-based control, 2) ground oats, 3) <b>oat</b> <b>groats,</b> and 4) oat flour. Phase I diets were formulated to 1. 55 % lysine, and at d 10 postweaning the pigs were switched to a Phase II diets formulated to 1. 3 % lysine. At d 24 postweaning, all pigs were changed to a sorghum-based Phase III diet. The diets were fed in pelleted form. For Phase I, pigs fed the oat products tended to have greater efficiencies of gain compared to pigs fed corn. Pigs fed the reduced fiber oat products (groats and flour) were more efficient than pigs fed ground whole oats, and the most refined oat product (oat flour) tended to support the greatest efficiencies of gain (8 % greater ADG and 13 % greater F/G than the corn control). These same trends for pigs fed oat flour were noted in Phase II and for the overall experiment (I. e., d 0 to 38). In Exp. 2, 172 weanling pigs (avg initial body wt of 12. 5 lb and avg age of 19 d) were used in a second 38 -d growth assay. Treatments were 1) a com-soybean meal-based control, 2) ground oats, 3) roasted oats, 4) <b>oat</b> <b>groats,</b> 5) steam-flaked <b>oat</b> <b>groats,</b> and 6) oat flour. The data indicated that roasting decreased the nutritional value of ground oats. However, steam-flaking improved the nutritional value of <b>oat</b> <b>groats.</b> Feeding diets formulated with processed oat products (i. e., steam-flaked <b>oat</b> <b>groats</b> and oat flour) improved F/G through Phase II (e. g., 6 % greater efficiency of gain compared to the corn-based control), but much of that advantage was lost during Phase III while the pigs were fed the same sorghum- based diet. In conclusion, the most refined oat products (steam-flaked <b>oat</b> <b>groats</b> and oat flour) supported better F/G than com in Phases I and II. However, cost must be continuously balanced against the improved performance to ensure that use of these oat products is economically viable...|$|E
