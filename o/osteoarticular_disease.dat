40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{transforming}} growth factor β (TGF-β) {{on the production}} of matrix macromolecules was studied in cultures of rabbit articular chondrocytes. A 24 h exposure to TGF-β at concentrations of 0. 1, 1 and 10 ng/ml markedly stimulated the synthesis of collagen and non-collagen protein. Similar increases of glycosaminoglycan production was observed in the same experimental conditions. The distribution of these newly synthesized macromolecules between cell layer and medium was not altered by treatment with TGF-β. The factor slightly enhanced the proliferation of chondrocytes in these experiments but its potent effect on matrix synthesis was independent of this growth stimulation. These results indicate that articular chondrocytes are target cells for TGF-β and suggest that this growth factor could {{play a role in}} the repair process of cartilage during <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} replicate the factor structure of CFQ in <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disease,</b> diabetes mellitus, obesity, depressive disorder, and normative population. It further examined the factorial invariance of the CFQ across these 5 groups. Method Data from 299 participants (N General Population = 67, N <b>Osteoarticular</b> <b>Disease</b> = 73, N Diabetes Mellitus = 47, N Depressive Disorder = 45, and N Obesity = 60) were subjected to confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) to replicate the structural model of CFQ dimensionality. Results CFA supported a 1 ‐factor structure with good internal consistency and construct related validity. The 1 ‐factor solution was also supported by a second independent data set, which showed a configural, strict measurement, and structural invariance of the 1 ‐factor solution proposed. Multigroup CFA showed the configural invariance, strict measurement invariance, and structural invariance of CFQ across the 5 groups under study. Conclusions The unidimensional model has both similar meanings and the same structure, but the measurement model across the groups was not the same. The study provides the first approach to CFQ to Portuguese population, as a reliable tool of general cognitive fusion. Furthermore, results indicated that CFQ has a coherent structure across multiple samples and clinical utility, as it discriminate individuals with psychological distress from those who do not.

40|$|Background: Imbalances in the {{functional}} binding of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to their receptors (FGFRs) have consequences for cell proliferation and differentiation that in chondrocytes {{may lead to}} degraded cartilage. The toxic, proinflammatory, and oxidative response of cytokines and FGFs can be mitigated by dietary polyphenols. Objective: We explored the possible effects of polyphenols {{in the management of}} <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>diseases</b> using a model based on the transduction of a mutated human FGFR 3 (G 380 R) in murine chondrocytes. This mutation is present in most cases of skeletal dysplasia and is responsible for the overexpression of FGFR 3 that, in the presence of its ligand, FGF 9, results in toxic effects leading to altered cellular growth. Design: Different combinations of dietary polyphenols derived from plant extracts were assayed in FGFR 3 (G 380 R) mutated murine chondrocytes, exploring cell survival, chloride efflux, extracellular matrix (ECM) generation, and grade of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Results: Bioactive compounds from Hibiscus sabdariffa reversed the toxic effects of FGF 9 and restored normal growth, suggesting a probable translation to clinical requests in humans. Indeed, these compounds activated the intracellular chloride efflux, increased ECM generation, and stimulated cell proliferation. The inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was interpreted as the main mechanism governing these beneficial effects. Conclusions: These findings support the rationale behind the encouragement of the development of drugs that repress the overexpression of FGFRs and suggest the dietary incorporation of supplementary nutrients in the management of degraded cartilage...|$|R

Early identification of these factors is crucial, since it may lead to prevention of functional dependencies. Objective: To analyze the association between mobility, sociodemographic factors and the prevalence of noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in oldest old. Methods: The sample consisted of 120 elderly persons aged (80 and 95 years), with 76 of them being women (83 ± 3 years) and 44 of them men (83 ± 3 years). Sociodemographic factors and NCDs which we studied were: age, gender, marital status, education, nutritional status, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes and <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Mobility was analyzed using a battery of Physical Performance Tests. For statistical analysis we used the chi-square test and binary logistic regression {{to examine the relationship}} between sociodemographic factors, NCDs and mobility. SPSS (17. 0) software was used for this and the significance level was set at 5 %. Results: Level of education (p &# 8804; 0. 001) and age (p = 0. 034) are the two factors related to low mobility. However, the model built by multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that age is independently related to limited mobility in oldest old people (OR 3. 29; 95 % CI 1. 09 to 9. 87). Conclusion: Thus, oldest old > 85 years are at a greater risk of decreased mobility independent of their education, marital and nutritional statuses and gender.

40|$|Background. The {{necessity}} for more effective therapies for chronic <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>diseases</b> {{has led to}} the development of treatments based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the natural precursors of musculoskeletal tissue. Treatments with autologous MSCs yielded excellent results, with nearly 70 % improvement of pain and disability in osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease. Using allogeneic MSCs is logistically more convenient and would widen the pool of eligible patients, but potential immune rejection should be considered. In this context, MSCs are purportedly immune evasive and better tolerated than other cell types. Methods. We used samples collected during the performance of 2 randomized clinical trials using allogeneic bone marrow MSCs for treatment of osteoarthritis (NCT 01586312) and degenerative disc disease (NCT 01860417). Serum samples were used to determine anti-HLA antibodies, whereas either blood or MSC samples were used for HLA typing of recipients and donors, respectively. Algofunctional indexes were used as indicators of clinical evolution, and the correlation between the number of donor-host HLA mismatches and the efficacy of treatment was determined. Results. Immune response was weak and transient, with reactivity decaying during the first year. Consistently, better donor-recipient HLA matching did not enhance efficacy. Conclusions. This lack of reactivity is presumably due to the cooperation of 2 factors, (1) downregulation of the host immune responses by the transplanted MSCs and (2) effective insulation of these cells inside the articular cavity or the intervertebral disc, respectively. Interestingly, better HLA matching did not enhance efficacy. These observations have medical relevance as they support the clinical use of allogeneic cells, at least as a single-dose administration.

This study investigated these proteases and inhibitors in young KBD cartilage. The percentages of chondrocytes staining for MMP- 1 /- 13 and MMP-generated DIPEN neoepitope, aggrecanase-generated ITEGE neoepitope in aggrecan in KBD patients {{were significantly higher than}} in controls. However, TIMP- 1 was significantly less numerous than in controls in the superficial and middle zones of KBD samples, the percentage of chondrocytes staining for the TIMP- 2 was significantly higher than in controls. Staining for MMP- 1 /- 13 and, TIMP- 1 /- 2 in KBD patients was prominent in the superficial zone and the middle zone of articular cartilage. Staining for ITEGE and DIPEN neoepitopes in KBD samples was prominent in the superficial zone and the middle zone of articular cartilage. The strongest staining for the MMP and aggrecanase-generated neoepitopes was adjacent to areas of chondronecrosis. These results indicated that KBD cartilage destruction depends on collagen- and aggrecan-degrading proteases such as collagenases (MMP- 1 /- 13), as well as aggrecanases. Increased TIMP- 2 level adjacent to necrotic areas suggest that attempted repair mechanism are also activated. © 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith an {{improvement}} in the temporal and spatial resolution, computed tomography (CT) is indicated {{in the evaluation of}} a great many osteoarticular diseases. New exploration techniques such as the dynamic CT and CT bone perfusion also provide new indications. However, CT is still an irradiating imaging technique and dose optimisation and reduction remains primordial. In this paper, the authors first present the typical doses delivered during CT in <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disease.</b> They then discuss the different ways to optimise and reduce these doses by distinguishing the behavioural factors from the technical factors. Among the latter, the optimisation of the milliamps and kilovoltage is indispensable and should be adapted to the type of exploration and the morphotype of each individual. These technical factors also benefit from recent technological evolutions with the distribution of iterative reconstructions. In this way, the dose may be divided by two and provide an image of equal quality. With these dose optimisation and reduction techniques, it is now possible, while maintaining an excellent quality of the image, to obtain low-dose or even very low-dose acquisitions with a dose sometimes similar that of a standard X-ray assessment. Nevertheless, although these technical factors provide a major reduction in the dose delivered, behavioural factors, such as compliance with the indications, remain fundamental. Finally, the authors describe how to optimise and reduce the dose with specific applications in musculoskeletal imaging such as the dynamic CT, CT bone perfusion and dual energy CT...|$|E

Human brucellosis is a zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution. It is prevalent in developing countries where humans and animals live in close proximity. Prevalence in humans is directly proportional to animal disease. Animal handlers are specifically more susceptible due to their occupation. It is associated with lot of morbidity and loss of man days. Vaccination is the most important method for prevention of animal brucellosis. Control of animal brucellosis is influenced by various factors and hence, prevalence keeps on changing. Animal brucellosis is highly prevalent in many states of India. There is no collaboration between the veterinarians and the clinicians. Lack of awareness among clinicians, low index of suspicion and sometimes non availability of diagnostic tests can lead to missed diagnosis. Brucellosis is characterized by protean clinical manifestations though it commonly presents as pyrexia of unknown origin or <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disease.</b> Other manifestations include glomerulonephritis, pneumonitis, encephalitis and hepatitis.

The osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs is regulated either by systemic hormones or by local growth factors able to induce specific intracellular signal pathways that modify the expression and activity of several transcription factors. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2) and Wnt signaling-related molecules are the major factors critically involved in the osteogenic differentiation process by hMSCs, and SRY-related high-mobility-group (HMG) box transcription factor 9 (SOX 9) {{is involved in the}} chondrogenic one. hMSCs have generated a great interest in the field of regenerative medicine, particularly in bone regeneration. In this paper, we focused our attention on the molecular mechanisms involved in osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of hMSC, and the potential clinical use of hMSCs in <b>osteoarticular</b> pediatric <b>disease</b> characterized by fracture nonunion and pseudarthrosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an {{abundant}} class of small single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules ranging from 18 to 24 nucleotides. They negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play key roles in many biological processes, including skeletal development and cartilage maturation. In addition, miRNAs involvement in <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>diseases</b> {{has been proved}} {{and some of them}} were identified as suitable biomarkers for pathological conditions. Equine osteochondrosis (OC) {{is one of the most}} prevalent juvenile osteoarticular disorders in horses and represents a major concern for animal welfare and economic reasons. Its etiology and pathology remain controversial and biological pathways as well as molecular mechanisms involved in the physiopathology are still unclear. This study aims to investigate the potential role of miRNAs in equine osteochondrosis (OC) physiopathology. Short-read NGS technology (SOLID (TM), Life Technologies) was used to establish a comprehensive repertoire of miRNA expressed in either equine cartilage or subchondral bone. Undamaged cartilage and subchondral bone samples from healthy (healthy samples) and OC-affected (predisposed samples) 10 -month Anglo-Arabian foals were analysed. Samples were also subjected or not to an experimental mechanical loading to evaluate the role of miRNAs in the regulation of mechano-transduction pathways. Predicted targets of annotated miRNAs were identified using miRmap. Results: Epiphyseal cartilage and subchondral bone miRNome were defined, including about 300 new miRNAs. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between bone and cartilage from healthy and OC foals, as well as after an experimental mechanical loading. In cartilage, functional annotation of their predicted targets suggests a role in the maintenance of cartilage integrity through the control of cell cycle and differentiation, energy production and metabolism as well as extracellular matrix structure and dynamics. In bone, miRNA predicited targets were associated with osteoblasts and osteoclasts differentiation, though the regulation of energy production, vesicle transport and some growth factor signaling pathways. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest a role of miRNAs in equine OC physiopathology and in the cellular response to biomechanical stress in cartilage and bone. In silico target prediction and functional enrichment analysis provides new insight into OC molecular physiopathology...|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} {{neurological}} deficits and sequels {{in the upper}} extremities that affect the {{activities of daily living}} in patients who have undergone stroke, have been analyzed from a subjective clinical point of view. Prognosis recovery after stroke depends on many factors, among which are included individualized program of rehabilitation and cooperation of patients. Simulation patients in the beginning of stroke. The aim of this work is to show a novel environment to simulate the initial improvement upper limb functions a few days after stroke and simulate the functional recovery of patients under a rehabilitation program. Twenty-nine patients in the first four days post stroke were selected. Inclusion criteria were: over eighteen years of age, collaborative patients, and neurological deficits in upper extremities post stroke without a previous history of stroke of motor sequelae second to other neurological or <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>diseases</b> that might identify pre-existing disability. Assessments were performed with 3 - 4 days and 7 days and 1, and 3 months post stroke recording the following variables: demographics, stroke type, stroke classification according to the Oxford scale, neurological deficit determined by the NIHSS, disability measures (Barthel’s Index, Rankin Scale), assessment of the motor dysfunction of the upper extremities according to the Fugl-Meyer Scale as well as muscle tone (Ashworth’s Scale) and muscle balance of the upper extremities. We measured the deficits of angles, lengths and range of motion for the arm and hand affected. These measures were implemented in a virtual environment with 29 DOF for each arm and hand. The different types of deficit and sequelae seen in the upper extremities of stroke patients impairing their activities of daily living have been analysed from a subjective clinical standpoint based on clinical and functional assessments. The prognosis for recovery of each patient very much depends on many factors, which {{can be found in the}} rehabilitation program and individual goals together with the collaboration afforded by the patients themselves while they are unaware a priori of the objective outcome of the rehabilitation process.
