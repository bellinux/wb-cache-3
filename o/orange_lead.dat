30|$|Letter 668, to Theo van Gogh, 23 or 24 August 1888 “Would you ask Tasset {{his opinion}} on the {{following}} question? It {{seems to me that}} the more finely a colour is ground, the more it is saturated by oil. Now we’re not over-fond of oil, that goes without saying. If we painted like Monsieur Gérôme and the other trompe-l’oeil photographic ones, we’d no doubt ask for colours ground very fine. We, on the contrary, don’t strongly object to the canvas having a rough look. So if instead of having the colour ground on the stone for God knows how many hours, we grind it just long enough to make it workable, without bothering too much about the fineness of the grain, we’d have colours that were fresher, perhaps darkening less.

40|$|The {{lymphatic system}} plays an {{important}} role in human health and disease. In addition to a role in the immune response, the lymphatics can serve as a pathway for cancer metastasis. Visualizing the lymphatic system has been a difficult part of anatomic dissection studies. Anatomists have attempted to map the lymphatic system using various methods and materials; vivisection of dogs, injection of mercury into the skin and lymphatic vessel in cadavers, and injection of dye indirectly into the skin of dead and living specimens. In this study, we introduce a method of using a mixture of acrylic blue dye and hydrogen peroxide to visualize the lymphatic system in rats. The lymphatic vessels were cannulated with micropipettes, and radio-opaque <b>orange</b> <b>lead</b> oxide was selectively injected. The lymphatic system became visible from the dorsal side of the hand and foot, and distal region of the tail to their termination at the left and right subclavicular veins via lymph nodes. Cisterna chyli in the abdominal cavity and thoracic duct ran along with the aorta. The advantage of this technique is that lymph nodes as well as lymphatic channels could be recorded not only photographically but also radiographically. This microinjection technique is useful for demonstrating the lymphatic system in rats and may provide further information that will help in cancer metastasis research. 8 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{observations}} in cell culture {{provide evidence that}} negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) at the surface of biological cells bind cationic cell-penetrating compounds (CPCs) and cluster during CPC binding, thereby contributing to their endocytotic uptake. The GAG binding and clustering occur in the low-micromolar concentration range and suggest a tight interaction between GAGs and CPCs, although the relation between binding affinity and specificity of this interaction remains to be investigated. We therefore measured the GAG binding and clustering of various mono- and multivalent CPCs such as DNA transfection vectors (polyethylenimine; 1, 2 -dioleoyl- 3 -trimethylammonium-propane), amino acid homopolymers (oligoarginine; oligolysine), and cell-penetrating peptides (Penetratin; HIV- 1 Tat) by means of isothermal titration calorimetry and dynamic light scattering. We find that these structurally diverse CPCs share the property of GAG binding and clustering. The binding is very tight (microscopic dissociation constants between 0. 34 and 1. 34 microM) and thus biologically relevant. The hydrodynamic radius of the resulting aggregates ranges from 78 nm to 586 nm, suggesting that they consist of numerous GAG chains cross-linked by CPCs. Likewise, the membrane-permeant monovalent cation acridine <b>orange</b> <b>leads</b> to GAG binding and clustering, in contrast to its membrane-impermeant structural analogs propidium iodide and ethidium bromide. Because the binding and clustering of GAGs {{were found to be}} a common denominator of all CPCs tested, these properties might be helpful to identify further CPCs...|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} aims at the encapsulation of probes {{of biological}} relevance in ionic (AOT) or non-ionic (Triton X- 100) microemulsions. In chapter 3. 1, the stability, photophysics and photochemistry of an enzyme, #alpha#-chymotrypsin, was studied in reverse micelles of AOT, {{in terms of}} pH and the parameter #omega#_ 0 =(water) /(surfactant). It was possible to relate the enzyme structural changes with the location of fluorescent residues in the protein matrix, as well as, {{the location of the}} latter inside the water-pools. In chapter 3. 2, the dependence of the absorption and fluorescence emission of a drug, Piroxicam, on the medium pH, proticity and viscosity was used to characterize the intramicellar water of the aforementioned microemulsions. Using the AOT reverse micelles as a comparative system, it was found that: - in AOT, the water properties approach those of free water at #omega#_ 0 > 10; - in Triton X- 100 microemulsions the #omega#_ 0 increase promotes the polyoxyethylene chains rigidity, leading to higher microviscosity and lower polarity of the intramicellar water. The photophysics and photochemistry of Acridine <b>Orange</b> <b>leads</b> to identical conclusions. Specially, fluorescence quenching results lead to microviscosity values (derived from bimolecular rate constants and diffusion coefficients) similar to those obtained with other techniquesAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|The {{topic of}} photo-equality in {{hardcopy}} technologies {{has been widely}} discussed {{from the beginning of}} digital printing until today. Photographic quality prints can be made on desk-top printers with little compromises in permanence and performance. The paper compares the status of ink-jet prints in professional and desktop systems with commercial photography. The gamut of typical ink-jet dye and pigment-based prints and the influence of using more than four metamerism channels was investigated. In a 6 -channel system, the addition of green and <b>orange</b> <b>leads</b> to a similar increase in gamut as the addition of diluted cyan and magenta. However, multi-level printing allows more continuous tone type tone reproduction and better image quality. Diluted colorants provide the gamut gain in high lightness areas. As light metamerisms are prevalent in pictorial images and natural scenes, diluted metamerisms are more beneficial to metamerism and tone reproduction for a photo-quality printing system than hexachrome metamerisms. Colorant stability considerations limit the ink dilutions as very diluted metamerism dots may suffer from permanence defects. Photographic images may be displayed in areas with natural daylight, tungsten light or fluorescent light. They are expected to exhibit a neutral tone scale under all con-ditions. Very brilliant colorants and certain pigments are shown to have appreciable metamerism metamerism which leads to unacceptable metamerism shifts under mixed illumination. The reproduction of certain important metamerisms is another factor in colorant selection and printer design for photographic reproduction. The paper tint of many ink-jet systems is very bright compared to typical photographic prints and their limitations in minimum density...|$|R
40|$|The eyes of {{crayfish}} {{were exposed}} to lights of known spectral composition, and the course of regeneration was followed in the dark by measuring the content of rhodopsin and metarhodopsin in single rhabdoms isolated at various times after the adaptation, using an assay {{that is based on}} the fluorescence of metarhodopsin. Complete recovery requires several days in the dark after intense adaptation to orange light, but requires < 2 d after blue light exposure. Following an orange light exposure with blue produces recovery kinetics characteristic of the blue light exposure alone. This quickening of recovery occurs whether the receptors are exposed to blue light either imme-diately or many hours after the original exposure to orange. Conversely, following blue light adaptation with <b>orange</b> <b>leads</b> to slow recovery, which is characteristic of orange alone. Recovery from long-wavelength adaptation is slower principally because many rhabdoms seem to delay the onset of regener-ation. We suggest that the regeneration system is itself photosensitive, and after orange light adaptation the supply of active chromophore (presumably 11 -cis retinal) limits the rate of recovery. Once started, recovery proceeds slowly and continuously, and the total pigment concentration (rhodopsin plus meta-rhodopsin) in the rhabdomeric membrane remains approximately constant. Within hours after intense adapting exposures, the rhabdoms become altered in appearance, the surfaces become coated with accessory pigment, and the bands of microvilli are less distinct. These changes persist until recovery of rhodopsin proceeds, which suggests that visual pigment regeneration results from addition of newly synthesized rhodopsin associated with membrane turn-over...|$|R
