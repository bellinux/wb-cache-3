5|$|Coconut crabs {{live in the}} Indian Ocean and {{the central}} Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of the coconut palm. The western limit {{of the range of}} B. latro is Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, while the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn mark the northern and southern limits, respectively, with very few population in the subtropics, such as the Ryukyu Islands. There is evidence that the coconut crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs in any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>places.</b> As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|E

5|$|Hart's {{new role}} {{involved}} overseeing the upkeep of the cemeteries and memorials {{established by the}} Commission in the Middle East, Turkey and Greece. Ensuring the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>places</b> required extensive travel, and his duties also became more difficult when Italy joined in the Second World War in June 1940 and conflict {{broke out in the}} Middle East. This required the creation of an organisation responsible for the graves of Allied personnel killed in the region. Consequently, Hart became Assistant Director, Graves Registration and Inquiry Section for the Middle East, in addition to his existing Commission duties. His new position entailed him becoming a serving officer in the British Army as a lieutenant, but with the acting rank of brigadier. He set up grave registration units, new cemeteries and organised the relocation of existing graves in remote areas to the new cemeteries. This work struck a personal note when his nephew was killed during the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942. Early the following year Hart visited the El Alamein battlefield and the nearby cemetery, the establishment of which was partly due to the infrastructure he helped put in place, to lay flowers at his nephew's grave.|$|E
5|$|In {{this event}} {{there is a}} {{qualification}} round on the opening day, in which 40 to 70 athletes each jump once to ensure their place {{for the rest of}} the event's two individual competitions. 40 <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>places</b> are available in the first competition (compared to 50 in the similar Ski Jumping World Championships), which is narrowed down to 30 for the second competition. The order of jumps – or 'starting order' – in the qualification round is based on the athletes' current rank within the Ski Jumping World Cup standings in ascending order of points, with the leader (who is assigned a distinctive yellow bib) going last. A unique feature of the World Cup, which applies to all ski flying and ski jumping events, is that the top ten ranked athletes are in a 'pre-qualified' bracket: their place in the event is already secure, so their qualification jump is entirely optional.|$|E
5|$|The brief {{peace in}} Europe allowed Napoleon {{to focus on}} the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of {{political}} autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>places.</b> The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million.|$|E

More than 92 % of the remaining spontaneously active hippocampal pyramidal cells recorded from freely-behaving rats were place cells; i. e., they exhibited spatially specific changes in firing activity {{in at least one}} environment.

5|$|The corps was {{assigned}} to the Sixth United States Army in preparation for the offensive in the Philippines from the assets of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary and the recognized guerrilla units. On 9 January 1945, I Corps successfully landed on the coast of the Lingayen Gulf in Northern Luzon with the mission of establishing a base for future operations to the north and of denying the enemy northern access to the South China Sea. As a part of the Sixth Army with an overall force of 175,000 men, the American forces faced over 260,000 Japanese in Luzon. In a sustained drive of thirty-four days which covered over 100 miles, I Corps crossed central Luzon and thus separated the Japanese forces in the north from those in southern Luzon, destroying Japanese armored units along the way. Additional landings at Samar and Palawan were conducted in February, reducing the pressure on the forces of I Corps. Following this accomplishment, the corps turned northward and began the systematic reduction of the enemy positions on the approach to the Cagayan Valley. The breakthrough into the valley was followed by a swift exploitation that took the corps to the north coast. This advance covered two hundred miles in little over 100 days; eliminating effective enemy resistance in northern Luzon. Manila was recaptured by the Allies after heavy fighting that ravaged the city. The intense fighting that ensued cost 8,000 killed and 30,000 wounded in the Sixth Army, compared to 190,000 dead for Japan. As the Sixth Army finished off the Japanese on Luzon, the Eighth United States Army in the south sent units all throughout the Philippines to eliminate remaining Japanese resistance on the islands. The Tenth United States Army in the north commenced securing Okinawa and Iwo Jima. With the defeat of the Japanese at each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>places,</b> the US forces had locations from which to launch attacks into mainland Japan.|$|E
