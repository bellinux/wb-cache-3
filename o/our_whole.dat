As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E

FASD is also {{considered}} a serious threat to preserving Aboriginal cultural traditions in the Valley, which are passed down by elders and not recorded in writing. Aboriginal cultural knowledge is taught to new generations through song, dance and storytelling, and Oscar was concerned. “These kids may have speech delays and difficulty remembering. But memory is critical to <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> heritage because Aboriginal culture and language is passed down orally.

25|$|In {{advance of}} {{becoming}} {{president of the}} Society of Authors in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. Addressing this issue, Pullman said: New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, {{for all kinds of}} reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is a bad one, and needs to be changed. That is <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> argument.|$|E
25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

[...] Critic Chris Lanier attributes the protagonist's appeal to readers to Masereel's avoiding a preaching tone in the work; [...] "rather", Lanier states, [...] "he gives us a story as a device through which we can examine ourselves". [...] This openness in the images invites individual interpretation, according to Beronä.|$|E
500|$|After {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Saville was {{assigned}} to United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters in Washington {{as director of the}} country's air defenses, which he considered inadequate. Because of the greatly increased civilian interest in air defense, much of Saville's unpublished air defense doctrine was copied into the War Department's Training Circulars No. 70 and 71, published nine and eleven days after Pearl Harbor, respectively. These training materials emphasized regional command and control of air defenses. Fighter group commanders were to direct the efforts of anti-aircraft artillery officers—one of Saville's suggestions that had been a sticking point, resisted by artillerists. Before these plans were implemented, British radar pioneer Robert Watson-Watt surveyed West Coast defenses and found them [...] "dangerously unsatisfactory", a confirmation of Saville's assessment. Saville found Watson-Watt's report [...] "a damning indictment of <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> warning service." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement. The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> world up when we read it. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head."

500|$|Yorkshire {{had been}} criticised {{in the press}} for fielding a {{weakened}} line-up against the Natives when the sides first met in December. After the unexpected loss, Yorkshire were determined to make amends and a strong side was selected for the county, including Fred Bonsor, Richard Lockwood and John Willie Sutcliffe, all of whom would appear for England against the Natives later that season. Described as [...] "knocked about" [...] and [...] "stale", the Natives struggled to compete against such strong opposition, and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to Ellison left the scores at 9–1 at half-time. The second half was little better for the Natives; they conceded a further two tries {{as well as a}} drop-goal. The second of these tries was scored by Lockwood after he ran the ball from his own half. Ellison scored a converted try late in the match, but this didn't prevent the Natives suffering their largest defeat of the tour: 16–4 to the Yorkshiremen. Ellison later described the match as [...] "without a murmur, the biggest beating we received in <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> tour".|$|E

[...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E

Does not the Soviet Union inspire fear {{in the world at}} large precisely because masses of human beings have no confidence in the justice of its criminal procedures against dissidents?... I trust that the Supreme Court will be able to correct a grave error in the operation of our political machinery by finding the... Smith bill unconstitutional." [...] William Z. Foster wrote: [...] "every democratic movement in the United States is menaced by this reactionary verdict... The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict, which belies <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> national democratic traditions. It will carry the fight to the higher courts, to the broad masses of the people." [...] Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party wrote that the verdict was [...] "a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American."

500|$|Kubrick {{found that}} Dr. Strangelove, a $2 million {{production}} which employed {{what became the}} [...] "first important visual effects crew in the world", {{would be impossible to}} make in the U.S. for various technical and political reasons, forcing him to move production to England. It was shot in 15 weeks, ending in April 1963, after which Kubrick spent eight months editing it. Peter Sellers again agreed to work with Kubrick, and ended up playing three different roles in the film. Upon release, the film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther worried that it was a [...] "discredit and even contempt for <b>our</b> <b>whole</b> defense establishment... the most shattering sick joke I've ever come across", [...] while Robert Brustein of Out of This World in a February 1970 article called it a [...] "juvenalian satire". Kubrick responded to the criticism, stating: [...] "A satirist is someone who has a very skeptical view of human nature, but who still has the optimism to make some sort of a joke out of it. However brutal that joke might be". Today, the film is considered {{to be one of the}} sharpest comedy films ever made, and holds a near perfect 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews as of August 2015. It was voted the 39th-greatest American film and third-greatest comedy film of all time by the American Film Institute, and in 2010, it was voted the sixth-best comedy film of all time by The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|... d. [...] Lucas {{described}} {{the scene on}} Redoutable: In less {{than half an hour}} our ship had been so fearfully mauled that she looked like little more than a heap of debris. Judging by appearances, no doubt, the Temeraire, now hailed us to surrender and not prolong a useless resistance. My reply was instantly to order some soldiers who were near me to fire back; which they did with great alacrity. At the same moment almost, the main mast of the Redoutable fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the Temeraire then came down, falling on board of us. <b>Our</b> <b>whole</b> poop was stove in, helm rudder and stern post all shattered to splinters, all the stern frame, and the decks shot through. All our own guns were either smashed or dismounted by the broadsides of the Victory and the Temeraire...The hull itself was riddled, shot through from side to side; deck beams were shattered, port lids torn away or knocked to pieces. Four of our six pumps were so damaged as to be useless. The quarter-deck ladders were broken, which rendered communication {{with the rest of the}} ship very difficult. Everywhere the decks were strewn with dead men, lying beneath the debris. Out of a crew of 634 men we had 522 hors de combat; of whom 300 were killed and 222 wounded nearly all the officers among them... The batteries and upper decks were practically abandoned – bare of men and were unable longer to offer any resistance. No one who had not seen the state of Redoutable could ever form an idea of her awful condition. Really I know of nothing on board that had not been hit by shot.|$|E
