5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed to hold his breath as long as he possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it <b>on</b> <b>eBay.</b> The listing was first put up <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E

5|$|Norman Dolph's {{original}} acetate {{recording of}} the Scepter Studios material contains several recordings {{that would make it}} onto the final album, though many are different mixes of those recordings and three are different takes entirely. The acetate was cut on April 25, 1966, shortly after the recording sessions. It would resurface decades later when it was bought by collector Warren Hill of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2002 at a flea market in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City for $0.75. Hill put the album up for auction <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> in November. On December 8, 2006, a winning bid for $155,401 was placed, but not honored. The album was again placed for auction <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> and was successfully sold on December 16, 2006 for $25,200.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 2006, Fischer telephoned an Icelandic {{television}} station {{and pointed out}} a winning combination, missed by the players and commentators.

The winning bid was made by the GoldenPalace.com online casino, known for their outrageous eBay purchases.|$|R
5000|$|... eBay {{argued that}} BE's use was {{unauthorized}} and intentional. The {{court said that}} eBay had not permitted BE's activity simply by having a website available over the Internet. BE had violated eBay's terms of use and ignored eBay's requests to stop using its crawlers. BE responded {{that it was not}} causing eBay irreparable harm because its activity (80,000-100,000 hits per day) represented only a small fraction (approximately 1&thinsp;½ percent) of the overall activity <b>on</b> <b>eBay's</b> site. eBay acknowledged that BE's activity was only a relatively slight interference with eBay's servers.|$|R
25|$|Computer {{information}} systems {{researchers have also}} shown interest in eBay. Michael Goul, Chairman of the Computer Information Systems department of the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, published an academic case based <b>on</b> <b>eBay’s</b> big data management and use in which he discusses how eBay is a data-driven company that processes 50 petabytes of data a day.|$|R
5|$|Less than an {{hour later}} the post was photographed off the screen and framed by another user who posted another reply in the thread with {{a photo of the}} framed quote.

5|$|Many artists use {{sites such}} as deviantArt to display fan art based on {{existing}} and fan-created characters; more than 500,000 pieces of Friendship Is Magic artwork were present on deviantArt by June 2012. Adult fans have also created a number of plush toys and other figures based on the show's and fandom-created characters, which they sell <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> and other auction sites to other fans, sometimes for over 100 US dollars.|$|E
5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale <b>on</b> <b>eBay.</b> Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E
50|$|In March 2005 he {{was hired}} as {{president}} of eBay Marketplaces. His role was to focus <b>on</b> <b>eBay's</b> core business, which accounts for {{a large percentage of}} the company's revenues. He made more than forty acquisitions, including Shopping.com and StubHub, and the classifieds sites Gumtree and LoQUo, and most recently, Shutl. After his departure from eBay in 2015, Donahoe was replaced by eBay Marketplaces President, Devin Wenig.|$|R

5|$|During Kheradpir's {{tenure at}} Verizon, the company reduced its {{information}} technology budget from {{six percent of}} revenue (the industry average) to four percent. From 2000 to 2003, he reduced IT staff by 20 percent and reduced purchasing from technology vendors by 30 percent. He negotiated aggressively with vendors to reduce prices and lobbied Verizon to eliminate its policy against purchasing IT equipment being auctioned <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> by failed dot-com businesses. Many contract programming positions were out-sourced to lower-cost labor in India. Additionally, new software was installed that improved Verizon's utilization of IT hardware.|$|E
5|$|Everybody Saves Father and The Only Girl in Camp were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on January 10, 1911. The total length of Everybody Saves Father is approximately 450 feet long and the Only Girl in Camp is 480 feet long. Though both films were on a split reel, sometimes the films were advertised independently or listed Everybody Saves Father only. Theaters showing the one or possibly both films are known in North Carolina Indiana, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and California. A surviving nitrate print of The Only Girl in Camp was sold <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> in 2009. The film was purchased and deposited in the Library of Congress for preservation.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2011 Tōhoku {{earthquake}} and tsunami, Stefani donated $1 million to Save the Children's Japan Earthquake–Tsunami Children in Emergency Fund. Stefani also ran an auction <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> from April 11 to 25, 2011, allowing participants {{to bid on}} vintage clothing items from her personal wardrobe and custom T-shirts designed and signed by her, {{as well as on}} admission to a private Harajuku-themed tea party hosted by her on June 7, 2011, at Los Angeles' first-ever Japanese-style maid café and pop art space, Royal/T, with proceeds from the auction going to Save the Children's relief effort.|$|E
50|$|On July 14, 2008 the {{district}} court {{ruled in favor of}} <b>eBay</b> <b>on</b> all issues. Tiffany appealed and on April 1, 2010 the Second Circuit court ruled in favor of <b>eBay</b> <b>on</b> all issues, except the false advertising claim, which it remanded back to {{the district}} court. On remand, {{the district court}} again ruled in favor of <b>eBay</b> <b>on</b> the last issue on Sept. 13, 2010. Tiffany applied for a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court of the U.S., which was denied on Nov. 29, 2010.|$|R
5000|$|... eBay wanted BE {{to access}} the eBay system only when a BE user queried the BE system. Doing so would {{increase}} the accuracy/currency of the data BE presented to its users and impose a lighter load <b>on</b> <b>eBay's</b> network. BE accessed eBay approximately 100,000 times a day, constituting about 1.53% of eBay's total daily requests. BE wanted to periodically crawl eBay's entire website to compile its own auction database, which would increase the speed of BE's response to user queries and allow BE to notify its users when eBay auctions changed.|$|R

5|$|On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website {{by stating}} that the article was sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek said that, of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> for $399.99, {{with a couple of}} units still in stock, and 35 were held for {{specific}} customers and sold at the MSRP. The remainder were given away. Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo. Nintendo has refused to comment on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Since Smallville began airing, {{a variety}} of {{merchandise}} connected with the series has been produced. Two soundtrack albums of songs from the show have been released. On February 25, 2003 Smallville: The Talon Mix, {{with a group of}} artists who licensed their music for the show, was issued. Smallville: The Metropolis Mix, with another group of artists, was released on November 8, 2005. In addition to the soundtracks, action figures, T-shirts, hats and posters have been produced.

40|$|In recent years, {{smartphones}} {{have changed}} {{the way that we}} interact with the web – and each other. But have they changed the way that we shop online? In a recent study of internet and mobile eBay transactions, Liran Einav, John Levin, Igor Popov and Neel Sundaresan, find that mobile adopters tended to be heavy eBay users, and tended to buy more using their mobiles, while their non-mobile purchases stayed largely the same. They also find that their mobile shopping behaviors in terms of prices and products are little different to those <b>on</b> <b>eBay’s</b> internet site...|$|R

5|$|The high US {{demand for}} {{tickets for the}} tour, and the {{difficulty}} which some fans had in getting them, brought attention to rapidity with which tickets turned up on the higher-priced secondary market. Some tickets were being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold <b>on</b> <b>eBay</b> for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} holding back tickets from general sale and delivering them straight into the secondary market, Live Nation said that U2 did not engage in this practice.|$|E
5|$|The voter {{approval}} of Initiative 695 in 1999, which eliminated the motor vehicle excise tax used to fund ferry service, cut $93 {{million from the}} ferry system's budget {{by the end of}} 2001. Voter rejection of 2002's Referendum 51, which would have funded the replacement of car ferries with a gas tax, led the state to consider eliminating passenger-only service to Bremerton and Vashon Island {{to make up for the}} shortfall. In May 2003, the state legislature approved cuts to ferry service, including the elimination of passenger-only ferries. Passenger-only ferry service ceased operations on September 20, 2003, and the MV Chinook and MV Snohomish were sold in 2008 to Golden Gate Ferries in the San Francisco Bay Area after an unsuccessful auction <b>on</b> <b>eBay.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{image of}} one of Onyx's early prototypes {{surfaced}} online, with a similar hardware to the 9000's, including the same trackball. That prototype was early reviewed by website CrackBerry, which confirmed diverse details about the device, such as the 480×360 display, the 3.2 megapixels camera and connectivity features—Wi-Fi and GPS. The same day, other information regarding technicalities were revealed on a surfaced AT filesheet about the smartphone. Already known as the BlackBerry 9020 and having started production, {{a photo of the}} device surfaced, though it replaced the trackball with a trackpad. A previous prototype with a trackball was put up for sale <b>on</b> <b>eBay,</b> where it passed the mark of $600; four days later, a pre-launch list of then-upcoming smartphones for AT surfaced online on August 9, 2009, which listed the device.

5000|$|EBay's {{use of the}} Tiffany marks - Tiffany {{pointed out}} that eBay advertised the {{availability}} of Tiffany goods <b>on</b> <b>eBay's</b> market through several ways such as [...] "on the eBay home page, through communications with sellers and buyers, and through lists of top search terms and popular brand names." [...] From this, the Court ruled that [...] "eBay's use of the Tiffany Marks on its website did not create the impression that Tiffany had affiliated itself with, sponsored, or endorsed the sale of Tiffany items on eBay" [...] and that eBay's use of Tiffany marks on its homepage was [...] "a protected nominative fair use." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nevertheless, {{the court}} found that {{although}} BE's interference was not substantial, [...] "any intermeddling with or use of another's personal property" [...] established BE's possessory interference with eBay's chattel. Further, BE's use of eBay's bandwidth and system resources, even though small, harmed eBay because other companies might follow BE's example: [...] "If the court were to hold otherwise, it would likely encourage other auction aggregators to crawl the eBay site, potentially to the point of denying effective access to eBay's customers. If preliminary injunctive relief were denied, and other aggregators began to crawl the eBay site, there appears to be little doubt that the load <b>on</b> <b>eBay's</b> computer system would qualify as a substantial impairment of condition or value." ...|$|R
