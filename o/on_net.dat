5|$|Playing in {{the final}} year of his contract, Glencross set {{personal}} highs of 24goals and 43points in 2010–11. While the Flames received offers from other teams for Glencross at the trade deadline, the team chose to hold on to him though they risked losing him as an unrestricted free agent following the season. Glencross chose to remain in Calgary, agreeing to a four-year, $10.2million contract with the Flames on May 17, 2011. Glencross felt that he could have earned a bigger contract on the open market, but chose to take less money to remain in Calgary. With 26 goals in 2011–12, Glencross finished second on the team to Jarome Iginla's 32. He was the league's most efficient scorer, scoring on 23.6 percent of his shots <b>on</b> <b>net.</b>|$|E

40|$|Neutrophils deposit {{antimicrobial}} proteins such as myeloperoxidase and proteases on chromatin, {{which they}} release as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophils also carry {{key components of}} the complement alternative pathway (AP) such as properdin or complement factor P (CFP), complement factor B (CFB) and C 3. However, the contribution of these complement components and complement activation during NET formation in the presence and absence of bacteria is poorly understood. We studied complement activation <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> and a Gram-negative opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA 01, PAKwt, PAKgfp). Here we show that anaphylatoxin C 5 a, formyl-Methionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine (fMLP), and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) that activates NADPH oxidase induce the release of CFP, CFB and C 3 from neutrophils. In response to PMA or P. aeruginosa, neutrophils secrete CFP, deposit it <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> and bacteria, and induce the formation of terminal complement complexes (C 5 b- 9). A blocking anti-CFP antibody inhibited AP-mediated but not non-AP-mediated complement activation <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> and P. aeruginosa. Therefore, NET-mediated complement activation occurs via both AP- and non AP-based mechanisms, and AP-mediated complement activation during NETosis is dependent on CFP. These findings suggest that neutrophils could use their AP tool kit to readily activate complement <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> and Gram-negative bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, whereas additional components present in the serum help to fix non-AP-mediated complement both <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> and bacteria. This unique mechanism may play important roles in host defense, and help to explain specific roles of complement activation in NET-related diseases...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: The main rural malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies has {{developed}} resistance to dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), hexachloro cyclo hexane (HCH) and malathion {{in the state}} of Haryana in northern India. An alternative synthetic pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin was therefore evaluated <b>on</b> mosquito <b>nets</b> against anopheline and culicine mosquitoes, in two villages Jagdishpur and Garh Mirakpur of Community Health Center (CHC) Badhkhalsa in district Sonipat, Haryana state. Methods: Two formulations of bifenthrin, suspension concentrate (SC) and micro-emulsion (ME) were compared with micro-capsule suspension (CS) of lambdacyhalothrin. The impact of three doses of bifenthrin (10, 25 and 50 mg/m 2) impregnated <b>on</b> mosquito <b>nets</b> was compared with lambdacyhalothrin (25 mg/m 2) and untreated control. Quality assessment of treatment <b>on</b> treated <b>nets</b> was carried out by residue analysis and the persistence of the insecticide <b>on</b> <b>nets</b> was determined by contact bioassays. Efficacy of treated <b>nets</b> <b>on</b> mosquito density was assessed by calculating mosquito entry rate, immediate mortality, delayed mortality and excito-repellency to the insecticides. Results: In susceptibility tests An. culicifacies was susceptible to bifenthrin (0. 1 % test papers...|$|R

40|$|Generating {{negative}} emissions by removing carbon dioxide {{from the atmosphere}} is a key requirement for limiting global warming to well below 2 °C, or even 1. 5 °C, and therefore for achieving the long-term climate goals of the recent Paris Agreement. Despite being a relatively young topic, negative emission technologies (NETs) have attracted growing attention in climate change research over the last decade. A sizeable body of evidence <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> has accumulated across different fields that is by today too large and too diverse to be comprehensively tracked by individuals. Yet, understanding the size, composition and thematic structure of this literature corpus is a crucial pre-condition for effective scientific assessments of NETs as, for example, required for the new special report on the 1. 5 °C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this paper we use scientometric methods and topic modelling to identify and characterize the available evidence <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> as recorded in the Web of Science. We find {{that the development of}} the literature <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> has started later than for climate change as a whole, but proceeds more quickly by now. A total number of about 2900 studies have accumulated between 1991 and 2016 with almost 500 new publications in 2016. The discourse <b>on</b> <b>NETs</b> takes place in distinct communities around energy systems, forests as well as biochar and other soil carbon options. Integrated analysis of NET portfolios—though crucial for understanding how much NETs are possible at what costs and risks—are still in their infancy and do not feature as a theme across the literature corpus. Overall, our analysis suggests that NETs research is relatively marginal in the wider climate change discourse despite its importance for global climate policy...|$|R
