5|$|During the Late Classic {{there was}} greater {{public access to}} the acropolis; as the threat of warfare grew during the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900), access became much more restricted. The end of formal {{occupation}} {{of the city in}} the Terminal Classic appears to have been violent, with evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> recovered during excavations of the acropolis. Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, battle {{was not necessary}} for either side; the main strategic theatre was mainland Greece itself. Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in a}} clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any strategic considerations. The Persians, seeing little to gain in battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> as the Persians, sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{director}} Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American {{soldier in}} the film Black Hawk Down (2001). Scott, with a recommendation from Russell Crowe and impressed by Bana's performance in Chopper, did not require him to audition. In the film, he played Sergeant First Class Norm 'Hoot' Hooten, an elite Delta Force soldier, who fights his way out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> in Mogadishu, Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry. Bana shed the weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began. He also trained with Delta Force operators at Fort Bragg, learning to fire weapons and clear rooms.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, Shakti, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> {{group of}} four ships, began a {{sustained}} operational deployment to the South China Sea and the North West Pacific Ocean.

This battle group was {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral P Ajit Kumar, Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Naval Command. According to the Ministry of Defence, the two-month deployment, far from India's usual area of operations, along with naval exercises with a number of countries, aimed to demonstrate the Indian navy's operational reach.|$|E

The tradition that the battle actually took place at Dunsinane has its origins in later medieval legend.

5|$|In the {{production}} of his The Brigand, Planché created tableaux vivants of three recent paintings by Charles Eastlake: An Italian Brigand Chief Reposing, The Wife of a Brigand Chief Watching the Result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Battle,</b> and The Dying Brigand. This feature was a success and widely copied. Paintings inspired his work {{in a number of}} other plays. For The Golden Branch (1847) and Love and Fortune (1859), he created costumes based on the paintings of Watteau. The latter play, which was subtitled A Dramatic Tableau (in Watteau Colours), also included a tableau from Watteau's Noces de Village.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) convinces the Xindi-Aquatics to aid him in {{his fight}} against the Xindi-Reptilians and Insectoids {{alliance}} to prevent Earth's destruction by their superweapon. In the midst <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between the two Xindi factions, an away team is sent to rescue Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), previously captured by the Reptilians. However, the superweapon departs for Earth, with Archer in pursuit on board a Xindi vessel.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Fordun's account of the Battle of Mortlach {{is due to a}} distortion of local tradition. Mortlach is nearby the site of the battle in which Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III) wrested power from Lulach. Máel Coluim's first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, was the niece of Harald III of Norway, and it has been argued by Alex Woolf that the tradition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between the Scots and Norwegians is due to a Scandinavian involvement on the side of Máel Coluim.|$|E

5|$|Keynsham {{played a}} part in the Civil War as the Roundheads saved the town and also camped there for the night, using the pub now known as the Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post. During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth. Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{relations}} between Egypt {{and its neighbors}} were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, {{one of the earliest}} known depictions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders. More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{histories}} {{describe the}} formation and destruction of the Bridge of the Gods, a land bridge that connected the Oregon and Washington sides of the river in the Columbia River Gorge. The bridge, which aligns with geological records of the Bonneville Slide, was described in some stories as the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between gods, represented by Mount Adams and Mount Hood, in their competition for the affection of a goddess, represented by Mount St.Helens. Native American stories about the bridge differ in their details but agree in general that the bridge permitted increased interaction between tribes on {{the north and south}} sides of the river.|$|E

5|$|Over the summer, Stephen {{intensified}} the long-running siege of Wallingford Castle {{in a final}} attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south {{in an attempt to}} relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle. As a result, instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> ensuing, members of the church brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana, {{known in}} Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Rise of Mana, is a Japanese action {{role-playing}} video game developed by Square Enix and Goshow for iOS, Android and PlayStation Vita. It {{was published by}} Square Enix in 2014 for mobile devices and 2015 for the Vita. It is the eleventh game in the Mana series, featuring a new narrative unconnected to other games in the series. The gameplay uses a similar action-based battle system to earlier Mana titles while using a free-to-play model in common with mobile titles. The story focuses on two characters, an angel and a demon, who are cast down to the mortal world in the midst <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> and are forced to share a body in order to survive.|$|E
5|$|The Fleet Law of 1900 {{authorized}} the French Navy to build six new battleships, {{along with a}} host of other warship types; the law signaled an end to the Jeune École doctrine that emphasized commerce raiding and torpedo boats instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> fleet of capital ships. The first two battleships ordered, the , formed the design basis for the subsequent four of the Liberté class. The naval engineer Émile Bertin designed both the République and Liberté classes.|$|E

5|$|The Klamath {{tribe of}} Native Americans, whose {{ancestors}} may {{have witnessed the}} collapse of Mount Mazama {{and the formation of}} Crater Lake, have long regarded the lake as a sacred site. Their legends tell <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld Llao. Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating Crater Lake, called giiwas in the Klamath language. The Klamath people used Crater Lake in vision quests, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers. The tribe still holds Crater Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.|$|E
5|$|The Saxons conquered Bath {{following}} the Battle of Deorham in 577, and the border was probably established {{along the line}} of the Wansdyke {{to the north of the}} Mendip Hills. Then Cenwalh of Wessex broke through at Bradford-on-Avon in 652, and the Battle of Peonnum possibly at Penselwood in 658, advancing west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett. In 661 the Saxons may have advanced into what is now Devon as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> fought at Postesburh, possibly Posbury near Crediton.|$|E
5|$|The airport area to {{the east}} of Honiara was the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between the United States and the Japanese during the Guadalcanal Campaign in World War II, the Battle of Henderson Field of 1942, from which America emerged victorious. After Honiara became the new {{administrative}} centre of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1952 with the addition of many administrative buildings, the town began to develop and grow in population. Since the late 1990s, Honiara has suffered a turbulent history of ethnic violence and political unrest and is scarred by rioting. A coup attempt in June 2000 resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the ethnic Malaitans of the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM).|$|E
