Mr. Grayle orders Rory locked in the cellar {{with a number of}} the cherub angels, while he has the Angel grab River by the wrist while he interrogates her. River is able to use her vortex manipulator to set a beacon for the TARDIS, allowing the Doctor and Amy to arrive. Amy, aware of River's having written the book to help guide them, uses the table <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the book to look for Rory. The Doctor is dismayed when he reads about River's wrist being broken and the title of the last chapter, [...] "Amelia's Last Farewell". He refuses to help River escape, hoping that the future can be changed. However, River breaks her own wrist to free herself, and the Doctor uses his regeneration energy to heal her. Amy finds the cellar empty and the Doctor is able to use River's vortex manipulator to locate Rory at the nearby Winter Quay apartment building.|$|E

As the main synchronizers in the functional models <b>of</b> dual <b>content</b> two professionally designed psycho-pedagogical disciplines "Didactic bases of vocational education" and "Methods of vocational training" were selected. Functional models which were selected and proposed are represented by the functional linear model <b>of</b> the dual <b>content</b> <b>of</b> professional training for the first stage of integration, by functional concentric model (after the composition <b>of</b> methods) <b>of</b> dual <b>content</b> <b>of</b> professional training of future engineers-teachers for the first stage, the concentric functional model <b>of</b> the dual <b>content</b> <b>of</b> professional training (after the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> methodology) for the second stage, the functional model of adaptive dual control <b>of</b> the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> professional training of future engineers-teachers for the third stage of implementation <b>of</b> the dual <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the vocational training.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> interrelation between constitution, <b>content</b> <b>of</b> body components and physical readiness of adolescents. The theoretical analysis showed that the somatic type significantly influences motor development of the person. Besides, it is an indicator of a reserve of an athletic ability in practice of physical education and sports training. The accounting <b>of</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> body components of the person is important for obtaining objective data about an individual type of the person. The bioelectric impedance analysis is the most operational and high-informative method <b>of</b> an assessment <b>of</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> body components. Schoolchildren of the 7 th grades of secondary school (n= 24) have taken part in the research. The assessment of somatic type of the adolescents was held by means of an index of Rorer. The analysis <b>of</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> body components it was carried out by means of a complex of hardware with the software «Diamant». Physical readiness of the adolescents was studied by means of motor tests. Also methods of mathematical statistics were used. Results of research showed that essential gender distinctions exist and female persons decrease in body weight. Our research hasn’t revealed significant interrelations between <b>content</b> <b>of</b> body components and physical readiness of the adolescents. Data on essential interrelation of an index of Rorer with indicators <b>of</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> body components of schoolchildren in the age 13 - 14 years were obtained...|$|R

The results indicate that mass loss of total system material (source material + crucible + crystal) and crucible augments with increasing <b>of</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> Si in sources material, growth temperature and growth time, but crystal mass gain increases. With increasing of atmosphere pressure, mass loss of system material decreases, crucible mass loss increases, crystal mass gain decreases.

2500|$|The {{collection}} in question, {{like that of}} Dionysius Exiguus on which it is based, contains two parts: the first includes canons of Greek, African, Gallican and Spanish councils, with some letters of St. Cyril of Alexandria and Atticus of Constantinople, while the second has the papal decretals as found in Dionysius, together with some others, most of the latter addressed to Spanish bishops. This is the chronological [...] "Hispana". Somewhat later, {{towards the end of}} the seventh century, it was recast in logical order, by some unknown writer, and divided into ten books, which were again subdivided into titles and chapters. This is the methodical [...] "Hispana". Finally, the copyists were wont to place at the beginning of the chronological [...] "Hispana" [...] a table <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the methodical collection, but with references to the text of the chronological: in this shape it was known as the [...] "Excerpta Canonum". The chronological [...] "Hispana" [...] seems to have been originally the [...] "Codex Canonum" [...] mentioned at the Fourth Council of Toledo (633), with later additions. In the ninth century it was attributed, with insufficient evidence, to St. Isidore of Seville.|$|E
2500|$|From 1849, {{she was a}} {{contributor}} to The Southern Quarterly Review, The Southern Literary Messenger, and De Bow's Review. These essays were characterized, not only by sharp logic and scintillating wit, but by a spirit of earnest, conservation. Among the most prominent were [...] " [...] Justice and Fraternity," [...] "The Right to Labor," [...] "Diversity of the Eaces, its bearing upon Negro Slavery," [...] "Negro and White Slavery," [...] "Enfranchisement of Women," [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin," [...] " [...] Carey on the Slave-trade," [...] "Negro Mania," [...] "Woman and her Needs," [...] "British Philanthropy and American Slavery," [...] "Charity which does not Begin at Home," [...] and [...] "A Letter to the Duchess of Sutherland from a Lady of South Carolina." [...] Davidson said that McCord was {{a contributor}} to the Southern Literary Messenger, to DeBow's Review, and to the Southern Quarterly Review. Examination of the complete files of the Southern Literary Messenger does not show her name; this is no negative proof, however. There are numerous anonymous articles, a few of which suggest McCord's style. A few poems are suspiciously like some selections found in [...] "My Dreams," [...] but because there is no signature her authorship cannot be inferred. In the editorial reminiscences secured and edited by Benjamin Blake Minor, one-time editor of the Messenger, McCord's name is not mentioned. The same problem is faced in a review of De Bow's Review. Her signature cannot be found, nor is her name acknowledged by J. D. B. De Bow in his quarterly Table of Contents. However, the Table <b>of</b> <b>Contents</b> <b>of</b> DeBow's Review lists only the signed articles; there are numerous unsigned ones. So accepting the statements of Duyckinck and Davidson, who agree that McCord contributed to these magazines, the assumption is made that for these magazines, except the Southern Quarterly, she worked anonymously. Though it is regrettable, it is true to type. Women authors often disguised their names under masculine noms de plume. However, most of her contributions to the Southern Quarterly Review were signed, and were easily available.|$|E

Hundreds of people grew to {{thousands}} long before his train left King’s Cross, and all the way to Edinburgh he found the same vivid interest and acclamation on the east coast that had greeted him in November on the west. At Grantham the mayor and a crowd estimated by nimble statisticians at two thousand, awaited him at the station; at York the lord mayor and six thousand; at Newcastle-on-Tyne too many thousands to count. The little addresses made at these stopping-places were described as a sort of table <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the more elaborate speeches to be delivered in Midlothian itself.
