40|$|Key points o Between 2000 and 2012 over 1, 000 police {{stations}} {{have been closed}} in the UK and many more have been placed on reduced opening hours. A similar situation is unfolding in Northern Ireland and Eire. This {{may be viewed as}} a strategic and operational withdrawal from the current concept of rural policing. This closure trend has significantly altered the landscape of rural policing in the UK. o In the same period, the landscapes of rural crime and criminality have also changed in {{that there has been a}} noticeable increase in the levels of the organisation of indigenous and international serious and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> involved in committing rural crimes. In short crime is becoming more entrepreneurial. The increase of rural crimes such as the theft of farm machinery and tools; livestock; and unregulated butchery practices, evidences the danger that serious and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> pose to rural areas as they expand their criminal activities in the current economic recession. It does appear that Eastern European <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> are targeting the UK by stealing tractors and other items of heavy plant for resale in Europe and on the African subcontinent. There is evidence that British based <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> are also becoming more organised at exploiting criminal opportunities in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|Foreword: In 2006, the Australian Government {{introduced}} the Anti-money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) which increased regulatory controls over businesses potentially able to facilitate organised criminal {{activities such as}} money laundering. The implementation of tougher legislation and associated law enforcement interventions may result in criminal organisations adjusting their tactics {{in order to continue}} their activities without detection. In this paper, the risk and potential impact of tactical displacement by organised criminals is discussed with regard to the potential for increased attempts by <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> to corrupt public servants. There is a paucity of research exploring {{the nature and extent of}} public sector corruption committed by <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups.</b> This discussion is informed by literature on ‘crime scripts’ originally developed by Cornish (1994) and the 5 I’s crime prevention framework developed by Ekblom (2011). Making use of public-source information about the commission of such crimes, as exemplified in two recent corruption cases, some intervention strategies are proposed that may be effective in reducing the risks of corruption of public sector officials by <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> in Australia...|$|R

The primary focus {{of the study is}} to determine if and to what extent the present criminal justice strategies designed to counter <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> activities have {{had an impact on the}} entry of New York's five Italian-American crime families and Russian-origin criminals into the securities market. There are scattered works and articles on <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> related frauds in the stock market, but there is no thorough empirical study on the movement of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> from traditional rackets into the securities market in New York.

40|$|Identity crime {{provides}} {{a foundation for}} many other forms of serious crime.

When a person has their identity stolen, they may experience repeated victimisation. In this way, <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> can use fraudulent identities to cause considerable financial loss.
