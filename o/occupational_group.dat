25|$|During this era, the Portuguese popularised {{the term}} Nair, {{referring}} {{to all of}} the locals who fought along with them as Nayari or Nayar, irrespective of strata or caste. The name Nayar existed prior to this merely as a title dispensed by kings to some families who had excelled in military matters. Those families, along with everyone else involved in the military, were known as Lokar. Other than this limited use of the Nayar title and the general use of Lokar to describe an <b>occupational</b> <b>group,</b> there is no certainty as to what the various castes which are now categorised as Nairs were called prior to the arrival of the Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|The {{demographics}} of medieval Islamic society varied in some significant aspects from other agricultural societies, including {{a decline in}} birth rates as well as a change in life expectancy. Other traditional agrarian societies are estimated to have had an average life expectancy of 20 to 25 years, while ancient Rome and medieval Europe are estimated at 20 to 30 years. Conrad I. Lawrence estimates the average lifespan in the early Islamic Caliphate to be above 35 years for the general population, and several studies on the lifespans of Islamic scholars concluded that members of this <b>occupational</b> <b>group</b> enjoyed a life expectancy between 69 and 75 years, though this longevity was not representative of the general population.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{dissertation}} is {{to identify}} significant differences between <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> concerning fluid and crystallized intelligence, work-motivation, innovation ability, the degree of specialization, and different paths of communication. Therefore three classifications of <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> (hierarchy, vocational content, vocational position) and associated subcategories are analyzed. It is shown that the diverse aspects of differential psychology possess varying relevance for <b>occupational</b> <b>groups.</b> The reason for {{the differences in the}} intelligence factors is seen in varying requirements for the <b>occupational</b> <b>groups.</b> Additionally, univariate and multivariate methods carry out that the dimensions of organizational structure discriminate in a different extent between the <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> because of various vocational requirements. Especially the relation between fluid and crystallized intelligence within single occupational subcategories is of particular importance. I conclude that different <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> are associated with certain requirements on fluid and crystallized intelligence. Concerning work-motivation and innovative ability only few significant differences between <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> are found. Furthermore, differences in specialization and communication seem to be of importance. Consequences for motivation and commitment are discussed. The basis of the empirical investigation is formed by a sample of 522 people. The participants are of the ages 21 - 65 years and active in very diverse occupations. They work in about 80 enterprises, which belong to the service branch, industrial enterprises and to the public administration...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} has been to see how DIK-forum {{represents}} the <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> that are represented in the frames of the trade journal. We have, {{to find out the}} phenomenon, done a content analysis by looking into 18 numbers of DIK-forum from year 2006 and 2007. The 18 strategically chosen journals was enough to give us a statistic result that we later on could generalize over those two years of DIK-forum. Totally there were 818 articles, news items and vacant advertisements that made the central point of this study. By these materials have we studied the representation of the <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> to find out if there were any over- and/or under represented groups, and also if the publications of the material were directed to the students or to the <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> in these trade journals. In our study the results shows that the trade journal DIK-forum does not represent all the <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> at the same level. There are two <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> that are over represented in DIK-forum, librarians and the professions of museum, while four <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> have an under representation. These under represented groups are handicraft, professions within tourism, language translators and editors. The <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> that have an even level of material amount are building antiquarian, culture intermediary, media and communication professions and archivist. The result show’s that there is an obvious difference regarding the representation in DIK-forum’s material (articles and news items). While 93, 2 percent of the material in DIK-forum was directed to the <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> only 6, 8 percent of it was directed to the students...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the gender wage gap in Poland in {{different}} <b>occupational</b> <b>groups.</b> The authors aim to investigate how much of the raw differences in wages can be explained by differences in personal characteristics and in which <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> the unexplained part of wage gap is the highest. The authors use the individual data from employers’ statistics with detailed information about wages and personal characteristics of workers. The authors use base salaries per hour as the dependent variable. After controlling for differences in the gender composition of <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> the authors choose 24 <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> at 3 -digit level and perform Oaxaca-Blinder two-component decomposition. The authors are the first to analyse the differences in gender wage gap in Poland by <b>occupational</b> <b>groups.</b> Another original contribution is that the wage gap is analysed not for the whole sample but after controlling for the segregation effect. The results indicate that firstly, the raw differences by gender in base wages per hour are smaller than the ones in average wages per hour. Secondly, after controlling for differences in the gender composition of <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> the raw wage gap in Poland increases from 6. 7 % to 10. 8 %. Thirdly, in most of the analysed <b>occupational</b> <b>groups</b> the differences in characteristics explain only a minor part of the wage gap. The highest share of the unexplained part was among managers and in groups in which the specific vocational skills are required...|$|R
