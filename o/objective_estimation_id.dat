40|$|This study {{reports on}} {{experiments}} that examine anchoring in single referendum questions in contingent valuation surveys on {{willingness to pay}} for public goods, and on <b>objective</b> <b>estimation.</b> Strong anchoring effects are found that lead to systematically higher estimated mean responses from Yes/No referendum responses than from open-ended responses. This response pattern is similar for contingent valuation questions and for <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> questions. The paper concludes that psychometric anchoring effects, rather than incentive effects, are the likely cause of results commonly found in contingent valuation studies, and that the currently popular single referendum elicitation format is highly vulnerable to anchoring. ...|$|R
40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been reported}} on HRIR modeling to lighten the high computation cost of the 3 -D audio systems without sacrificing {{the quality of the}} rendered sounds. The performance of these HRIR models have been widely evaluated usually in terms of the <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> errors between the original measured HRIRs and the modeled HRIRs. However, it is still unclear how much these objective evaluation results match the psychoacoustic evaluations. In this research, an efficient finite-impulse-response (FIR) model is studied as a case study which is essentially based on the concept of the minimum-phase modeling technique. The accuracy dependency of this modeling approach on the order of FIR filter is examined with the <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> errors and the psychoacoustic tests. In the psychoacoustic tests, the MIT HRIR database are exploited and evaluated in terms of sound source localization difference and sound quality difference by comparing the synthesized stimuli with the measured HRIRs and those with the FIR models of different orders. Results indicated that the measured hundred-sample-length HRIRs can be sufficiently modeled by the low-order FIR model from the perceptual point of view, and provided the relationship between perceptual sound localization/quality difference and the <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> results that should be useful for evaluating the other HRIR modeling approaches...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for semiparametric estimation where parametric and nonparametric criteria are exploited in density estimation and unsupervised learning. This {{is accomplished by}} making sampling assumptions on a dataset that smoothly interpolate between the extreme of independently distributed (or id) sample data (as in nonparametric kernel density estimators) to the extreme of independent identically distributed (or iid) sample data. This article makes independent similarly distributed (or isd) sampling assumptions and interpolates between these two using a scalar parameter. The parameter controls a Bhattacharyya affinity penalty between pairs of distributions on samples. Surprisingly, the isd method maintains certain consistency and unimodality properties akin to maximum likelihood estimation. The proposed isd scheme is an alternative for handling nonstationarity in data without making drastic hidden variable assumptions which often make estimation difficult and laden with local optima. Experiments in density estimation {{on a variety of}} datasets confirm the value of isd over iid <b>estimation,</b> <b>id</b> <b>estimation</b> and mixture modeling. ...|$|R

40|$|Air quality {{assessment}} regarding metals and metalloids using experimental measurements is expensive and time consuming {{due to the}} cost and time required for the analytical determination of the levels of these pollutants. According to the European Union (EU) Air Quality Framework Directive (Directive 2008 / 50 /EC), other alternatives, such as <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> techniques, {{can be considered for}} ambient air {{quality assessment}} in zones and agglomerations where the level of pollutants is below a certain concentration value known as the lower assessment threshold. These conditions occur in urban areas in Cantabria (northern Spain). This work aims to estimate the levels of As, Cd, Ni and Pb in airborne PM 10 at two urban sites in the Cantabria region (Castro Urdiales and Reinosa) using statistical models as <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> techniques. These models were developed based on three different approaches: partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and an alternative approach consisting of principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with ANNs (PCA-ANN). Additionally, these models were externally validated using previously unseen data. The results show that the models developed in this work based on PLSR and ANNs fulfil the EU uncertainty requirements for <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> techniques and provide an acceptable estimation of the mean values. As a consequence, they could be considered as an alternative to experimental measurements for air quality assessment regarding the aforementioned pollutants in the study areas while saving time and resources.

40|$|EDICS Number: SA 1. 4. 6 Perceived {{speech quality}} is most {{directly}} measured by subjective listening tests. These tests are often slow and expensive, and numerous {{attempts have been}} made to supplement them with objective estimators of perceived speech quality.

The <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> of the perceived quality of highly compressed digital speech, possibly with bit errors or frame erasures has remained an open question. We report our findings regarding two essential components of objective estimators of perceived speech quality: perceptual transformations and distance measures. A perceptual transformation modifies a representation of an audio signal in a way that is approximately equivalent to the human hearing process. A distance measure reflects the magnitude of a perceived distance between two perceptually transformed signals. We then describe a new <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> approach that uses a simple but effective perceptual transformation and a distance measure that consists of a hierarchy of measuring normalizing blocks.

40|$|Auditory {{brainstem}} responses (ABRs) using clicks enable global <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> {{of hearing}} threshold. Recently, {{it has been}} suggested that a chirp stimulus may produce a synchronous response from a larger portion of the basilar membrane than a click, and that a chirp will produce a greater amplitude response than a click at the same sensation level. Various workers have modified the stimulus to achieve frequency specificity (e. g. using tone-bursts). The present investigation used band-limited chirp stimuli having the same frequency-delay characteristics as the chirp mentioned above that compensate for frequency-dependent cochlear delays. The intention was to generate highly synchronized neural responses across parts of the nerve fibre array. Stimuli were presented at sensation levels between 10 and 50 dB to 10 adult subjects. Wave V was consistently identifiable even for low-frequency stimuli. Wave V amplitude increased and latency decreased as stimulus frequency increased. The latency decrease is consistent with high-frequency responses arising from basal regions of the cochlea. ABR thresholds were defined by <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> and visual inspection. Average ABR thresholds were 16 dB higher than behavioural thresholds for high-frequency chirps (3000 - 6000 Hz), increasing to 25 dB for low-frequency chirps (375 - 750 Hz). These ABR thresholds are closer to behavioural thresholds and have a smaller variance than reported for tone-burst stimuli without masking. However, they are not as close as those reported for tone-bursts in notched noise. The disadvantage of the band-limited chirps is that they have a wider spectral spread than tone-bursts and hence may elicit a response from unwanted frequency regions of the basilar membrane...|$|R
