These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Extensive {{coverage}} of Youngstown's economic challenges has overshadowed the city's long entrepreneurial tradition. A number <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> enterprises introduced in Youngstown later became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based Schwebel's Bakery, {{which was established}} in neighboring Campbell in the 20th century. The company now distributes bread products nationally. In the 1920s, Youngstown was {{the birthplace of the}} Good Humor brand of ice cream novelties, and the popular franchise of Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt was established there in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Youngstown-born developer Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. established one of the country's first modern shopping plazas in the suburb of Boardman. The fast-food chain, Arby's, opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s. More recently, the city's downtown hosted the corporate headquarters of the now-defunct pharmacy chain store Phar-Mor, which had been established by Youngstown native Mickey Monus.|$|E

Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox, the Xbox 360, and the Xbox One, as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS.|$|E

By {{the second half of}} the century, beaches and sports teams (especially in his native Cabo Rojo, which features a monument in his honor) were named for him; in the Dominican Republic, a resort town was named after the pirate. Cofresí's name has been commercialized, with a number <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> businesses adopting it and its associated legends. Puerto Rico's first flag carrier seaplane was named for him. Several attempts have been made to portray Cofresí's life on film, based on legend.|$|E

40|$|The global company {{operates}} from {{a number}} of locations worldwide, which entails geographical distances and logistical implications for <b>product</b> <b>and</b> parts transported, as well as the choice <b>of</b> <b>product</b> variety because <b>of</b> numerable worldwide consumer preferences. In these companies, packaging becomes a frequently used object to complement <b>product</b> features <b>and</b> achieve an effective and efficient means of transportation. In this context, it is interesting to integrate packaging development in the product development process to improve development decisions on e. g. manufacturing, assembly and distribution, and also to reduce repeated changes in <b>product</b> design <b>and</b> other development processes. To corroborate these thoughts, the overall objective for this thesis is to explore the potential of improving resource utilisation in the development <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging by an integrated development <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging. In three surveys in Swedish mechanical, pharmaceutical and food industries, which account for approximately 74 % <b>of</b> all packaged <b>products</b> produced in Sweden, the potential for the concept was explored and positively validated. By comparisons across survey results and additional information provided by literature reviews of mechanical, pharmaceutical <b>and</b> food <b>product</b> development, the possibility <b>of</b> introducing integrated <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging development into an integrated procedure model has been established. Note that the packaging developer’s perspective is excluded in this thesis. Duc to extensive diversity in composition <b>and</b> organisation for <b>product</b> development across the product areas surveyed, an integrated <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging procedure model is heavily dependent upon product area. For the integration <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging it is (1) important to include packaging in the product mission statement, (2) preferable to consider the function decomposition <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging when specifying the <b>product</b> <b>and</b> (3) beneficial to also decide upon packaging hierarchy and packaging materials when deciding on detailed <b>product</b> systems <b>and</b> subsystems. Note that when the product area is known, relevant methods and techniques for the integration <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging activities on an operational leve 1 in the procedure model may be developed Future research should implement a preliminary suggestion into one or more <b>of</b> the surveyed <b>product</b> areas’ product development activities to achieve a final <b>and</b> verified integrated <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging development procedure model...|$|R
