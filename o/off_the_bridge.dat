5|$|Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl {{installed}} planking {{and guard}} rails {{on the southern}} half of the bridge, which was then opened to the public. He allowed bungee jumping <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws. One person tried to bungee jump <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> without a restraining cord. The bridge was slightly damaged by a fire in mid-1999, but it was repaired by September of that year.|$|E

However, she is subsequently attacked on {{a nearby}} bridge and repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen by the Waif, {{in the guise of}} an elderly woman. Arya pushes the Waif away, and barely escapes by jumping <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and swimming away underwater. After surfacing, she is then left stumbling through the streets, critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Hase, an {{entrepreneur}} {{who had run}} bungee jumping and hot air ballooning companies, tried unsuccessfully in 2003 and 2004 to get a variance for another bungee jumping venture. During a public hearing about Hase's proposal, a county legislator began screaming to simulate the sound neighbours would hear repetitively when people jumped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also, {{throughout}} most of the stages, some routes will diverge, splitting into two different roadways. Usually, some of the roads will lead onto a bridge over ground, over a pit, or over water. Slipping <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> will cost <b>the</b> player precious time or force the player onto the ground route if one exists under <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R

5|$|Two {{men were}} {{killed during the}} {{construction}} of the bridge. In 1885, a 22-year-old woman named Sarah Ann Henley survived a suicide attempt <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> when her billowing skirts acted as a parachute and she landed in the thick mud banks of the tidal River Avon at low tide; she subsequently lived into her eighties.|$|E

However, {{the shock}} of seeing Harry Osborn hospitalized, overdosed on drugs, causes Osborn's amnesia to return once more. After the final {{restoration}} of his memories, the Green Goblin kidnaps and takes Gwen Stacy to a bridge. During Spider-Man's rescue attempt, Osborn knocks Gwen <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> resulting in the girl's death. Spider-Man, traumatised and obsessed with revenge, tracks Green Goblin to his hideout, and in the ensuing battle, Osborn is impaled by his own goblin glider.|$|E
5|$|The Stark army {{arrives at}} the Twins, a {{fortified}} bridge stronghold controlled by the cranky Lord Walder Frey, who is nominally sworn to Catelyn's father Hoster Tully. However, Lord Frey has sealed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and refuses to let the army cross, so Catelyn negotiates on her son Robb's behalf. After some hard bargaining, Frey agrees to allow the Stark army to cross through The Twins and to commit some of his troops to the conflict with the Lannisters, but, in return, he wants Robb and his sister Arya to marry two of his children, to which Robb reluctantly agrees.|$|E

There, {{an assemblage of}} supporters yelled the players' names, and with every name, a fan resembling {{a member of the}} victorious team leaped from the bridge into the waiting canal. However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the rabid crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese) from a nearby KFC and tossed it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> as an effigy.|$|E
5|$|Though the Binnewater rail {{station was}} {{once part of}} the {{historic}} district, it was located too close to Binnewater Road and was hit repeatedly by trucks until it fell apart in May 1989. The station was subsequently demolished by the county highway department. Another historic district, the Snyder Estate, runs along the Rosendale section. The Snyder Estate is a former mining site once used by all four major regional cement producers. The Rosendale trestle has been the site of numerous picnics, barbecues, {{and at least one}} wedding. One person has tried bungee jumping <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> without a restraining cord.|$|E
5|$|Jake and Elwood begin {{tracking}} down {{members of the}} band. Five of them are playing a deserted Holiday Inn lounge, and quickly agree to rejoin. Another turns them down as he is the maître d' at an expensive restaurant, but the brothers refuse to leave the restaurant until he relents. On their way to meet the final two band members, the brothers find the road through Jackson Park blocked by an American Nazi Party demonstration on a bridge; Elwood runs them <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> into the East Lagoon. The last two band members, who now run a soul food restaurant, rejoin the band {{against the advice of}} one's wife.

5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the station {{is at the bottom}} of the station approach, a ramp <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office exists within the small concourse. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are footbridges on either side of this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative {{entrance to the}} station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station car park. There also exists a subway which provides step-free access to all eight platforms in use at the station and with platform 7, at the south end of which is another entrance serving the station car park.|$|E
5|$|Detective Joe Salerno (Derek Russo), a {{very dear}} friend of Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), is found dead, after {{being run over}} by Sara Gonzales (Diane Guerrero). When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) arrives on scene, she concludes {{that he was dead}} before the car hit him, having been thrown <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> above the road. A distraught Samantha and Megan visit Joe's wife Helen (Kathryn Meisle) and their {{daughter}} Becky (Fátima Ptacek). Helen says that Joe had been distant before he died, after he was under review for assaulting Chuck Foster (John Magaro). Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) discovers Joe was doing freelance work on a cold case involving Lizzy Adler (Rebecca Blumhagen), a student athlete who was murdered, with Chuck being the prime suspect. Megan, Bud, Samantha and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) talk to Lizzy's lacrosse coach, Hal Davis, who states that Joe had been visiting the team recently. Megan exhumes Lizzy's body, without her boss, Kate Murphy's (Jeri Ryan), permission. Megan gets her judge mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy) to sign the request, who tells Megan that Lizzy is buried in the same graveyard as Megan's father David, who committed suicide when Megan was twelve. Megan and Peter later visit David's grave.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the only}} other bridge across the Delaware River easily {{accessible}} for vehicular use was the covered bridge in Columbia, New Jersey and Portland, Pennsylvania. Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington's Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large bushel baskets, which were often filled to the brim of quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and into the river below, although swimmers {{were never able to}} find anything of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed for the money. This was because the McCrackens kept two Airedales in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey. They kept the place clear from thieves and to add insult to injury, kept people away from visiting the McCrackens at all. Duke and Totsey often kept people from getting money they may have dropped on the ground for people exiting their cars.|$|E

5|$|After {{unsuccessful}} litigation to {{stop the}} project, the Big Four Bridge was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of Louisville Waterfront Park and the ongoing revitalization of the Louisville riverfront. This conversion had been proposed and planned since the 1990s. The Indiana Department of Transportation pledged $1million for the project to build a ramp to the Big Four Bridge on the Indiana side, on Riverside Drive, and Jeffersonville pledged $200,000; early estimates were that the Indiana ramp would cost $2.8million, but was likely to increase. The Kentucky ramp was expected to cost $4million; the ramp foundation is already done. Fixing the Big Four Bridge was expected to cost $3million and take 18months. The only other facility still standing that was owned by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway is the Spring Street Freight House. However, the mayor of Jeffersonville, Tom Galligan, called for a redesign of the entrance ramp to the bridge on the Indiana side, stressing that the proposed ramp would be unattractive and that {{the building of the}} column on a flood plain would probably not be possible. Galligan pointed out that neither the United States Coast Guard nor the Army Corps of Engineers had approved of the planned rampway. Galligan said he would rather have a ramp that reached over the floodwall and ended on Mulberry Street, causing a less severe incline on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> Previous plans to access the Big Four Bridge included building an elevator.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the bridge}} is not {{accessible}} to pedestrians, suicides by jumping from the bridge have been rare, with the most recent confirmed case taking place on December 31, 2012. There have been roughly a dozen suicides by people jumping <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
