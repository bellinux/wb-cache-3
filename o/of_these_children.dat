5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Maurice Brodie, a {{research}} assistant at New York University, attempted to produce a formaldehyde-killed polio vaccine from ground-up monkey spinal cords. His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself {{and several of his}} assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a vaccine that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Neither <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> were {{recognised}} by Belgrano in his will, {{where he}} said he had no children. However, it is thought that he did not mention them in order to protect their mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Adams {{was born}} in Boston in the British colony of Massachusetts on September 16, 1722, an Old Style date that is {{sometimes}} converted to the New Style date of September 27. Adams was one of twelve children born to Samuel Adams, Sr., and Mary (Fifield) Adams {{in an age of}} high infant mortality; only three <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> lived past their third birthday. Adams's parents were devout Puritans and members of the Old South Congregational Church. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston. Adams was proud of his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially virtue.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} where the child nodes of the {{collapsed}} nodes themselves have children, the conditional distribution <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>child</b> nodes given all other nodes in the graph {{will have to take}} into account the distribution <b>of</b> <b>these</b> second-level <b>children.</b> In particular, the resulting conditional distribution will be proportional to a product of the compound distribution as defined above, and the conditional distributions of all of the child nodes given their parents (but not given their own children). This follows from the fact that the full conditional distribution is proportional to the joint distribution. If the child nodes of the collapsed nodes are continuous, this distribution will generally not be of a known form, and may well be difficult to sample from despite the fact that a closed form can be written, for the same reasons as described above for non-well-known compound distributions. However, in the particular case that the child nodes are discrete, sampling is feasible, regardless of whether the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>child</b> nodes are continuous or discrete. In fact, the principle involved here is described in fair detail in the article on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution.|$|R

5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} with either of his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at precisely the time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took great pains to conceal the existence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children,</b> concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1942, over 1,000 {{children}} {{that had been}} rounded up during the Kozara Offensive were being held at the Stara Gradiška concentration camp, itself a sub-camp of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Information about the plight <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> was passed to concerned citizens in the NDH capital, Zagreb, {{one of whom was}} Diana Budisavljević, an Austrian. Budisavljević approached an Ustaše-appointed {{member of the board of}} the Croatian Red Cross, Kamilo Brosler, and told him about the children at Stara Gradiška. Brosler was horrified, and with the support of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross began to place pressure on the NDH government to release the children. Budisavljević also used her contacts with the German Army to intervene with the Ustaše regime on behalf of the children.|$|E
5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> had {{suffered}} major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E

5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{had been}} educated in a {{sequence}} of convents, however, and may well have taken the vows to formally become a nun, which formed an obstacle to the marriage progressing. She {{did not wish to}} be a nun and appealed to Anselm for permission to marry Henry, and the Archbishop established a council at Lambeth Palace to judge the issue. Despite some dissenting voices, the council concluded that although Matilda had lived in a convent, she had not actually become a nun and was therefore free to marry, a judgement that Anselm then affirmed, allowing the marriage to proceed. Matilda proved an effective queen for Henry, acting as a regent in England on occasion, addressing and presiding over councils, and extensively supporting the arts. The couple soon had two children, Matilda, born in 1102, and William Adelin, born in 1103; it is possible that they also had a second son, Richard, who died young. Following the birth <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children,</b> Matilda preferred to remain based in Westminster while Henry travelled across England and Normandy, either for religious reasons or because she enjoyed being involved in the machinery of royal governance.|$|E
