25|$|In his {{majority}} opinion, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes considered {{whether any}} of the three clauses of the California law, were, as the applicant alleged, a violation of her constitutionally-protected rights. The Court had previously established in a series <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> the right of free speech is essential to liberty, and is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The opinion noted, however, that this protection did not extend to forms of expression which may incite violence, crime, or the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means. The Court found little reason to question the validity of the second and third clauses of the statute as they pertain to such prohibited forms of expression, and concentrated instead on the first clause.|$|E
25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} {{neurosis}} {{is based on}} the premise of a self-regulating psyche composed of tensions between opposing attitudes of the ego and the unconscious. A neurosis is a significant unresolved tension between these contending attitudes. Each neurosis is unique, and different things work in different cases, so no therapeutic method can be arbitrarily applied. Nevertheless, there is a set <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> Jung especially addressed. Although adjusted well enough to everyday life, the individual has lost a fulfilling sense of meaning and purpose, and has no living religious belief to which to turn. There seems to be no readily apparent way to set matters right. In these cases, Jung turned to ongoing symbolic communication from the unconscious in the form of dreams and visions.|$|E
500|$|Frank, {{who worked}} on the Vioxx case early in his career, was called [...] "perhaps the loudest critic of the Vioxx litigation," [...] and debated trial lawyer Mark Lanier about the issue. Frank {{continued}} his criticism in a 2011 article. [...] "A final sordid chapter in the tort litigation over Vioxx closed, as Judge Eldon Fallon divvied up $315 million to be paid to the plaintiffs' attorneys {{who worked on}} the litigation. This sum was in addition to the more than $1.2 billion already paid to such attorneys. When you add in what Merck paid to plaintiffs and for its own attorneys, the Vioxx litigation cost it more than $7 billion. Yet Merck almost certainly did not do anything wrong. Even as an unsympathetic corporate defendant, it won the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> went to trial, and another dozen or more that plaintiffs' attorneys dismissed on the eve of trial rather than risk the publicity of a certain loss. Even in the handful <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> Merck lost at trial, such as the $253 million verdict in the Ernst case that generated much of the publicity that led {{to tens of thousands of}} cases being filed, Merck won reversals of most of those on appeal because the verdicts were based on conclusory junk-science expert testimony that should not have been admitted into evidence."

500|$|Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is {{investigating}} the woman's murder as {{the latest in a}} series <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> she believes are linked by numerology. [...] She realizes that when she adds the numbers of letters in the victims' names with the numbers in their birthdates, a pattern arises. [...] While explaining the case to Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who rejects the idea that numerology is relevant or that the world can be broken down into one simple equation, Scully discovers another possible clueâ€”marks on each of the victim's cheeks that looks like three small circles, likely imprinted by the killer's ring while he beat the victims. [...] On consulting a numerologist, who happens to have an office in the same building as the killer's apartment, Reyes ties the murders together. However, the killer also finds the numerologist, murdering her as she is on the phone with Reyes.|$|E
500|$|The eleven {{numbered}} circuit {{courts of}} appeals and the District of Columbia Circuit have appellate jurisdiction over cases {{in almost every}} area of the law arising {{within the boundaries of}} that circuit. However, the subjects that appear more frequently in each circuit vary according to the kinds <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> arise more often within the circuit's boundaries. The District of Columbia Circuit, for example, hears a large number of administrative law cases. Likewise, the Second Circuit hears nearly one third of all federal securities law appeals, and the Fifth Circuit hears approximately one half of all federal immigration appeals. Eric Hansford argues that this has led to [...] "specialized" [...] courts with particular expertise with the subjects that appear before the court more frequently. Studies also suggest that the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm decisions of circuit courts when the circuit court has ruled on a case for which they possess special expertise.|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{strictly}} {{legal and}} political concerns, Sawyer was also interested in the plight of black Americans, and {{became involved in the}} Civil Rights movement. According to his friend and fellow lawyer, Arlin M. Adams, Sawyer [...] "was troubled by the treatment of blacks in the South." [...] In 1965, he traveled to Selma, Alabama, to help register black voters there and in Mississippi, and gave legal representation to activists who were charged with breaking local ordinances. Closer to home, he also sued the Philadelphia Police Department and its commissioner, Frank Rizzo, over allegations that black applicants to the police academy were being unfairly rejected. Sawyer represented nine black applicants in a series <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> spanned nearly a decade, culminating in court-ordered measures to ensure greater racial diversity on the force. In 1972, he again sued Rizzo (who was by then Mayor of Philadelphia) over improper funding of the city workers' pension fund. As Sawyer's son Jonathan recalled in 1999, [...] "a magazine printed Rizzo's top-10 enemies, and my father was on the list. He was very proud that he made it." ...|$|E

500|$|Most visibly {{during the}} 2012 term, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor {{was part of}} a {{landmark}} 5â€“4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, [...] "Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well)." [...] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: [...] "Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?" [...] For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.|$|E
