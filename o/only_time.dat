5|$|The twenty days between Braden's {{perfect game}} and Halladay's was the {{shortest}} span between two perfect games since 1880 {{and there was}} a chance {{that for the first time}} in MLB history there would be three perfect games in such short succession. Had Galarraga's game been correctly called, the four-day span since Halladay's perfect game would have broken that 130-year-old record, and marked the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that three consecutive no-hitters had been perfect games, the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that three perfect games had occurred in one season (since done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain and Félix Hernández), the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that three perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a month, the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> four perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a year (as Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a perfect game in July 2009), and the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that four perfect games had occurred within a stretch of five no-hitters.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} the Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN) modeling paradigm to the performance analysis of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. GSPNs are first shown to be an adequate tool for the development of models of ATM networks, provided that <b>only</b> one <b>timed</b> transition is used, together with many immediate transitions. The <b>only</b> <b>timed</b> transition in the GSPN represents the ATM network cell time, while immediate transitions implement the ATM network behavior. The firing time distribution of the <b>only</b> <b>timed</b> transition in the GSPN is irrelevant for the computation of several interesting performance indices. The development of GSPN models of an ATM LAN with users exploiting the UBR (Unspecified Bit Rate) and ABR (Available Bit Rate) ATM service categories demonstrates the flexibility of the approach. 1 Introduction Performance problems are quite relevant in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, whose objective is to provide different ser [...] ...|$|R
