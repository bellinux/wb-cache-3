25|$|Avro first {{proposed}} {{to build the}} Avro 687 (Avro XX), which was a Lincoln bomber with a new circular section pressurized fuselage and a large single fin and rudder {{in place of the}} predecessor's double ones. During the design stage, the idea of a simple conversion was abandoned and the Avro 688 was designed, which retained the four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. It was designed by Roy Chadwick who, due to wartime restrictions, could not design a completely new aircraft, but had to use existing parts, tools and jigs. Using the Lincoln's wing, Chadwick, who had worked on the Lancaster, designed the Tudor to incorporate a new pressurized fuselage <b>of</b> <b>circular</b> <b>cross-section,</b> with a useful load of 3,765lb (1,705kg) and a range of 3,975mi (6,400km).|$|E

Thin walled tubes, {{particularly}} those <b>of</b> square or <b>circular</b> <b>cross-section,</b> are the common types of automobile crash-box, which equipped {{at the front}} end of a car, {{is one of the most}} important automotive parts for crash energy absorption.

The numerical simulations were carried out using the software LS-DYNA. The tubes were modeled using shell element of designation Belytschko-Tsay, which is suitable for large strain analyses. The FE model of the tube was validated by comparing the theoretical calculation results, experimental results and FE model results.
