5|$|The area {{is now one}} of {{the most}} ethnically and {{economically}} diverse in Louisville. Crime is becoming less of a problem. While in 2003 there were 11.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, over twice the average for the city <b>of</b> <b>Louisville</b> as a whole, which was 5.0 crimes per 1,000 residents Old Louisville now has a similar number of calls for police assistance as other parts <b>of</b> <b>Louisville.</b> The Louisville Metro Police 4th Division is responsible for a large portion <b>of</b> <b>Louisville</b> beyond Old Louisville, but is conveniently located in Central Park in Old Louisville. It had 134 officers assigned to it in 2006. Most calls are related to car break-ins and non-violent crimes. Murders are still rare, with one or two per year. Overall crime rates for both Old Louisville and the city as a whole increased sharply in 2005 over the 2004 rate, although there was a decline again the first half of 2006.|$|E

5|$|A large {{section of}} the neighborhood, from around Kentucky Street to Broadway, was razed. Many {{buildings}} south of Lee Street, and nearly all south of Avery Street (renamed Cardinal Boulevard) were razed {{for the construction of}} Noe Middle School, expansions to Manual High School and a major expansion of the University <b>of</b> <b>Louisville,</b> as well as to expand local industry east of Floyd Street. From 1965 to 1971, 639 buildings were razed as a part of this effort. However, the plan did spur the restoration of over 100 buildings in other parts of Old Louisville.|$|E

5|$|Alcoholism {{and poor}} health afflicted Clark during his final years. In 1809 he {{suffered}} a severe stroke. When he fell into an operating fireplace, Clark suffered a burn on his right leg that was so severe {{it had to be}} amputated. The injury made it impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13km) from the growing town <b>of</b> <b>Louisville,</b> and {{became a member of the}} household of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.|$|E

5|$|Barkley won the August 6 {{election}} {{by a vote}} of 294,391 to 223,149, carrying 74 of Kentucky's 120 counties, with large majorities in western Kentucky, the city <b>of</b> <b>Louisville,</b> and rural areas. It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, and the worst suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, but all of these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, Old Louisville was {{actually}} {{built as a}} suburb <b>of</b> <b>Louisville</b> starting in the 1870s, nearly a century after Louisville was founded. It was initially called the Southern Extension, and the name Old Louisville did not come until the 1960s. Old Louisville was initially {{home to some of}} Louisville's wealthiest residents, but saw a decline in the early and mid-20th century. Following revitalization efforts and gentrification, Old Louisville is currently home to a diverse population with a high concentration of students and young professionals.|$|E
5|$|During his campaign, Chandler {{had promised}} {{that he would}} fund a medical school at the University of Kentucky, {{despite the fact that}} the University <b>of</b> <b>Louisville</b> already had a medical school and a poll of state {{physicians}} showed overwhelming opposition to the plan because of this. Nevertheless, Chandler delivered on his promise, allocating $5million to the establishment of what became known as the Albert B. Chandler Medical Center. Chandler said the establishment of the school was his proudest achievement as governor.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2005 ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field, {{refusing to}} talk to reporters {{following}} the loss. Vick, who picked up a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in that game, also earned several unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the 2006Gator Bowl, where post-game replays revealed he purposefully stomped on the leg <b>of</b> <b>Louisville</b> Cardinals' defensive end Elvis Dumervil. Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology was made.

5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the majority of NY37B, the route was realigned west of Massena to follow a new riverside roadway to the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Louisville</b> Corner, where it came to an end at NY37. The remainder of NY37B along the Massena–Louisville town line road and in Massena was unchanged. By 1960, a connector between NY37 in Louisville and NY37B and Massena utilizing NY37's former routing west of the village was designated as NY131. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of the Maple Street/ Town Line Road intersection were flipped , placing NY131 on the riverside and town line roads and NY37B on NY37's former routing into Massena.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University <b>of</b> <b>Louisville</b> from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a measure {{that would have allowed}} collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E
