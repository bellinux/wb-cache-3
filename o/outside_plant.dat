50|$|<b>Outside</b> <b>plant</b> cabling, whether copper or fiber, is {{generally}} installed as aerial cable between poles, in an underground conduit system, or by direct burial.Hardware {{associated with the}} <b>outside</b> <b>plant</b> must be either protected from the elements (for example, distribution frames are generally protected by a street side cabinet) or constructed with materials suitable for exposure to the elements. Installation of the <b>outside</b> <b>plant</b> elements often require construction of significant physical infrastructure, such as underground vaults. In older large installations, cabling is sometimes protected by air pressure systems designed to prevent water infiltration. While {{this is not a}} modern approach, the cost of replacement of the older cabling with sealed cabling is often prohibitively expensive. The cabling used in the <b>outside</b> <b>plant</b> must also be protected from electrical disturbances caused by lightning or voltage surges due to electrical shorts or induction.|$|E
