40|$|Abortion and {{the death}} penalty {{are two of the}} most {{contentious}} issues in American public life. Previous scholarship has documented religious variations in attitudes toward each of these hotly con-tested issues. However, scant research has explored how religious factors affect <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> both <b>abortion</b> and capital punishment, two key elements of a consistent life ethic. This study offers a partial test of religious support for the consistent life ethic by examining {{the extent to which the}} nature and quality of the relationship between God and the religious believer fosters <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> both <b>abortion</b> and capital punishment. Using data from the 2004 General Social Survey, we find that a close relationship with a loving God predicts <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> both <b>abortion</b> {{and the death}} penalty net of other religious factors and covariates. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and delineating promising directions for future research. Key words: religion; abortion; capital punishment; death penalty; god image; consistent life ethic...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{their general}} <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion,</b> {{fundamentalist}} churches {{that include the}} conservative evangelical, Non-denominational, Southern Baptist and Pentecostal movements, {{do not have a}} consensus doctrine regarding abortion. While these movements hold in common that abortion (when there is no threat {{to the life of the}} mother) is a form of infanticide, there is no consensus as to whether exceptions should be allowed when the mother's life is in mortal danger, or when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Some argue that the lives of both the mother and fetus should be given equal consideration, in effect condemning all abortion including those performed to save the life of the mother. Others argue for exceptions which favor the life of the mother, perhaps including pregnancies resulting from cases of rape or incest.|$|E

25|$|Before the Roe v.
