5|$|The airport {{had very}} poor <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Whenever an {{aircraft}} was to land, the cranes at the shipyard {{had to be}} moved to allow sufficient clearance. Conversely, the airport {{could not be used}} when ships were launched. The industrial buildings were located just next to the taxiway. The control tower was located such that it did not have visual sight of the entire runway. The surrounding terrain, consisting of deep fjords, mountains and a town, made it impossible to install an instrument landing system. This again meant that the airport could only be served during daylight. The airport never received a permanent operating license.|$|E

The work will be done between 2012 and 2014 and will cost 10 million Euros. Alstom will cover half of the expenses. The problematic couplers will be changed to allow trains to be coupled on-the-fly again at intermediate stations. Heaters will be installed in the trains' undercarriages to prevent the formation of ice during the winter. In addition to these modifications, the tilt angle of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees. The operating speed of the train will remain the same. , new couplers have been installed in at least Sm3 units 7x12 and 7x18.|$|E

5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit {{had to be taken}} out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing the replacement of the bearings on all units within days.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to execute strength analysis of knuckle, which is made from FCD 50, by using static analysis on maximum loading. This maximum loading is obtained from front axle loading calculation on particular <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> That is, vehicle is braking while cornering in down hill. From previous vehicle loading calculation, we get a number of loading values on different speed and deceleration. At the end, we get a value of speed and deceleration that guarantee the vehicle safety if it is braking while cornering in down hill. As comparison, loading calculation is executed too for same <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> on level ground. This is because of different deceleration for each <b>operating</b> <b>condition,</b> 0, 5 g for <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> on downhill and 0, 2 g on level ground.
