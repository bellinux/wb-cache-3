40|$|Clive Sinclair is the {{archetype}} of a self-made man {{thanks to an}} entrepreneur spirit and his know-how in an emerging consumer electronics industry. Gifted as inventor, he always pursued cheaper and smaller radios, hi-fi devices, calculators, TVs, home computers [...] where he got his better achievements [...] and, even, vehicles. But this eclecticism was his first Achilles' heel: benefits from previous products were fully invested to develop new ones, often proving a lack of market knowledge. The second one was a proved impatience in releasing his products to the market: insufficient testings usually implied low quality, giving his products a poor image to the customers. The first time he almost went into bankrupt, the British National Enterprise Board saved Sinclair's company; the following time, British Government had changed to Thatcher's and no safety-net were existing then.
