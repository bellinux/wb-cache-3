50|$|In 1997, {{the first}} {{proceedings}} alleging {{human rights abuses}} on a FCV were brought in the New Zealand courts and the crew members were awarded compensation. The government conducted an investigation in 2004 and identified systemic human rights and contractual abuses but did not publicly release the findings. In September 2005, ten Indonesian crew of the Korean flagged Sky 75 vessel fled at port and complained to the New Zealand Police of subjection to inhumane conditions and non-payment of wages. In 2006, the government published the code of Practice on Foreign Fishing Crew. As this was non-binding policy directive, there was no obligation for New Zealand authorities to enforce the code, therefore exploitation continued, with further successful claims in the courts raising awareness of the issue. In 2010 the Oyang 70 sank, killing 6 crew members. Surviving crew members revealed {{that they had been}} subjected to human rights and contractual abuse. In 2011, crew members of the Shin Ji and Oyang 75 alleged they had been subjected to physical, psychological and sexual abuse, suffered inhumane working conditions and punishments, and were underpaid or denied payment of wages, forced under threat to conceal this to authorities. Following these allegations, the government conducted a Ministerial inquiry in March 2012. A bill containing many of the recommendations in the report was introduced to Parliament but failed to pass. It was later reintroduced under urgency and the Fisheries (Foreign Charter Vessels and Other Matters) Amendment Act passed into New Zealand law in 2014. This amendment mandates that all FCV’s within the EEZ must reflag to New Zealand by 2016, which will allow the New Zealand Courts full jurisdiction over all crew members, who will then be entitled to the same protections that are available to all workers in New Zealand. Additionally, an <b>Observer</b> <b>Programme</b> has been implemented in order to effectively monitor the situation.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, it has become widely {{recognized}} that the management strategies of world fisheries must ensure sustainability of bycatch {{as well as of}} target species. South Africa implemented a pilot <b>observer</b> <b>programme</b> from 1995 to 2000 to collect data on the levels and patterns of bycatch and discards in the demersal trawl fishery. Here, the results of that programme are used in conjunction with information on bycatch value and compliance to assess the issues and problems regarding bycatch and discarding in the fishery. In general, bycatch components can be placed into one of three categories (discarded bycatch, retained bycatch, and processing waste), each of which present different management problems and require different management approaches. The results were used to formu-late a bycatch management plan for the demersal trawl fishery in South Africa.

40|$|International audienceDeath {{in fishing}} gear of non-target species (called ‘bycatch’) {{is a major}} concern for marine wildlife, and mostly {{worrying}} for long-lived species like cetaceans, considering their demographic characteristics (slow population growth rates and low fecundity). In European waters, cetaceans are highly impacted by this phenomenon. Under the Common Fishery Policy, the EC 812 / 2004 regulation constitutes a legal frame for bycatch monitoring on 5 – 10 % of fishing vessels > 15 m. The aim of this work was to compare parameters and bycatch estimates of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) provided by <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> in France and UK national reports and those inferred from stranding data, through two approaches. Bycatch was estimated from stranding data, first by correcting effectives from drift conditions (using a drift prediction model) and then by estimating the probability of being buoyant. <b>Observer</b> <b>programmes</b> on fishing vessels allowed us to identify the specificity of the interaction between common dolphins and fishing gear, and provided low estimates of annual bycaught animals (around 550 animals year− 1). However, <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> are hindered by logistical and administrative constraints, and the sampling scheme seems to be poorly designed for the detection of marine mammal bycatches. The analyses of strandings by considering drift conditions highlighted areas with high levels of interactions between common dolphins and fisheries. Since 1997, the highest densities of bycaught dolphins at sea were located {{in the southern part of}} the continental shelf and slope of the Bay of Biscay. Bycatch numbers inferred from strandings suggested very high levels, ranging from 3650 dolphins year− 1 [2250 – 7000] to 4700 [3850 – 5750] dolphins year− 1, depending on methodological choices. The main advantage of stranding data is its large spatial scale, cutting across administrative boundaries. Diverging estimates between <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> and stranding interpretation can set very different management consequences: <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> suggest a sustainable situation for common dolphins, whereas estimates based on strandings highlight a very worrying and unsustainable process...|$|R

40|$|The ROentgen SATellite (ROSAT) and Extreme UltraViolet Explorer (EUVE) all-sky {{surveys have}} {{resulted}} in an important change {{in our understanding of}} the general composition of hydrogen-rich DA white dwarf atmospheres, with the photospheric opacity dominated by heavy elements rather than helium in the hottest stars (T > 40, 000 K). Most stars cooler than 40, 000 K have more or less pure H atmospheres. However, one question, which has not been resolved, concerned the specific nature of the heavy elements and the role of helium in the hottest white dwarfs. One view of white dwarf evolution requires that H-rich DA stars form by gravitational settling of He from either DAO or He-rich central stars of planetary nebulae. In this case, the youngest (hottest) DA white dwarfs may still contain visible traces of He. Spectroscopic observations now available with EUVE provide a crucial test of these ideas. Analysis of data from the EUVE Guest <b>Observer</b> <b>programme</b> and EUVE public archive allows quantitative consideration of the sources of EUV opacity and places limits on the abundance of He which may be present...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of the pelagic ray Dasyatis violacea (Bonaparte, 1832) in Uruguayan waters has been monitored since April 1998, {{the beginning of the}} National <b>Observer</b> <b>Programme</b> on board the Uruguayan tuna fleet (PNOFA). These are the first records of these species for the South Atlantic off Uruguay. Its distribution within the area is analysed, based on 13 trips made from April 1998 to September 2001 from 26 to 37 °S. Five hundred and twenty five specimens were caught during this period. The {{presence of}} the species appears to be closely associated with the highest values of surface water temperature, with CPUE being relatively low below 20 °C. The southern border of its distribution is around 36 °S. Dasyatis violacea is part of a well-defined warm water fauna that reaches Uruguayan and northern Argentinean waters following warm subtropical waters. The incidental capture of D. violacea in the area reaches significant levels; the species is always discarded.

40|$|Discards {{refer to}} {{the part of the}} catch not {{retained}} on board during commercial fishing operations, but returned to the sea. The proposed EU Common Fisheries Policy reform, to be implemented in 2014, sets out a gradual elimination of discards by reducing unwanted catches and ensuring that all catches are landed. To develop successful discard mitigation measures it is necessary to identify the reasons for discarding. Here we have developed a simple model that can be applied to data from <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> to establish the contribution of different drivers of discarding behaviour. The analysis makes inferences on the causes of discarding by partitioning discards into four categories based on the length of the fish and the associated regulatory restrictions. The drivers are defined as: fish discarded below the legal minimum landing size; fish {{for which there is no}} market and that do not have a MLS (minimum landing size); fish for which there are inconsistencies in market and sorting practices; and discards that can be attributed to fishermen’s responses to quota restrictions. The approach is applied to data generated from <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> from five European Member States. All of the inferred drivers contribute to the total discard quantity. Their relative contributions vary widely across countries, areas, gears and species. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{origin of}} the diffuse hard X-ray {{background}} is commonly interpreted as integrated emission of unresolved X-ray sources (possibly AGNs) {{along the line of}} sight (for a review see [1] and refs. therein). The MECS [2] instrument on board BeppoSAX [3] is particularly suited {{for the study of the}} cosmic X-ray background in the 2 - 10 keV range thanks to its low and stable instrumental background. BeppoSAX was launched on 30 April 1996 on a low Earth equatorial orbit. After the spacecraft and payload commissioning phase, the Science Verification Phase (SVP) began on 12 July 1996. During this phase a number of science and calibration pointings were made either with the NFIs or the WFCs being prime. The data rights belongs to the BeppoSAX hardware teams for one year.

40|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} data, collected {{as part of}} an <b>observer</b> <b>programme</b> {{and covering}} the period 1997 – 2014, were utilized in order to define key reproductive traits and spawning dynamics of the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides at South Georgia. Multi-year spawning site fidelity of D. eleginoides was revealed through the identification of previously unknown spawning hotspots. Timing of female spawning was shown to have shifted later, leading to a shorter spawning duration. A decrease in length and mass of female and male spawning fish and a reduced number of large spawning fish was found, evidence of a change in size structure of spawning D. eleginoides. During the study period fewer later maturity stage females (including spawning stage) were observed in conjunction with increased proportions of early stage female D. eleginoides. The findings are discussed in the context of reproductive success, with consideration of the possible effects such spawning characteristics and behaviours may have on egg and larval survival. This work presents the first long-term assessment of D. eleginoides spawning dynamics at South Georgia and provides valuable knowledge for both the ecology of the species and for future fisheries management of this commercially important species...|$|E
40|$|In {{the western}} and central Pacific purse seine fishery, {{observers}} have been deployed under the licensing provisions of two sub-regional arrangements, the US Tuna Treaty (between the United States {{and members of the}} FFA) and the FSM Arrangement (an arrangement for joint licensing of vessels flagged or sponsored by members of the PNA). The observer programmes associated with these arrangements are often referred to as sub-regional observer programmes, and are administered by the FFA Secretariat.

Meanwhile, the Stock Assessment Working Group was asked to provide an assessment of the impacts of bycatches on seabird populations and identify areas of potential interaction. Hence, the urgent need to develop effective mechanisms whereby data on seabird interactions can be recorded and exchanged within IATTC fisheries. Independent observer data is recognised as the only effective means of collecting this information. Observer coverage is currently comprehensive (observers on 100 % of vessels) in IATTC large purse-seine fisheries stemming from historically high levels of cetacean bycatch.

40|$|Fishery-dependent data {{underpin}} {{the scientific}} advice given to fishery managers. However, discard estimates are often imprecise {{as a result}} of limited sampling coverage. Estimating discard rates from length frequency distributions (LFDs) in commercial catches may complement information from observer trips. The accuracy of estimates depends greatly on careful investigation of the discard variability. Here, the impact of three essential factors was quantified for beam-trawl fisheries in the southern North Sea: (i) market prices, (ii) landings per trip (LPT) limitations, and (iii) selectivity of the commercial fishing gear. Observed discard rates for cod, plaice, sole, and whiting were compared with estimates based on length frequency data, taking account of the variability attributable to LPT limitations and market price. Observed discard estimates of cod and whiting differed significantly from LFD-derived estimates because of highgrading. The results indicate that LFD-derived discard estimates are only reliable if the crucial driving factors are quantified. LFDs can be collected from research vessels or by fishers in partnership with scientists. Based upon many of these LFDs and the discard-variability factors identified in <b>observer</b> <b>programmes,</b> discard rates can be estimated better...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThere is {{increasing}} awareness of and {{concern about the}} actual and potential adverse effects of fishing on the aquatic environment.

However, to date, these initiatives have been largely reactive and somewhat ad hoc.

40|$|Marine spatial {{planning}} and ecological research call for high-resolution species distribution data. However, those data {{are still not}} available for most marine large vertebrates. The dynamic nature of oceanographic processes and the wide-ranging behavior of many marine vertebrates create further difficulties, as distribution data must incorporate both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Cetaceans play {{an essential role in}} structuring and maintaining marine ecosystems and face increasing threats from human activities. The Azores holds a high diversity of cetaceans but the information about spatial and temporal patterns of distribution for this marine megafauna group in the region is still very limited. To tackle this issue, we created monthly predictive cetacean distribution maps for spring and summer months, using data collected by the Azores Fisheries <b>Observer</b> <b>Programme</b> between 2004 and 2009. We then combined the individual predictive maps to obtain species richness maps for the same period. Our results reflect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different months. This heterogeneity reflects a contrasting influence of oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. However, some persistent areas of increased species richness could also be identified from our results. We argue that policies aimed at effectively protecting cetaceans and their habitats must include the principle of dynamic ocean management coupled with other area-based management such as marine {{spatial planning}}...|$|E

Throughout this period, the average total catch and effort of the fleet was approximately 176, 000 t and 1720 days at sea per year, respectively. The target species were Sardinella aurita, Sardinella maderensis, Sardina pilchardus, Scomber japonicus and Trachurus trecae representing an annual average of 94 % by weight of the total catches. An alternating seasonal pattern of abundance in the catches was shown for S. aurita (dominant during summer) and S. pilchardus (dominant during winter). The amount of discards on average was less than 10 % of the total catch by weight and consisted mainly of commercial species. There was no size selective discarding for the five target species and seasonal changes in discarding were only detected for S. pilchardus.

40|$|Bycatch {{of several}} groups of species and their {{characteristics}} are presented {{for the period}} 2003 to 2007 for the European purse seine tuna fishery operating in the Atlantic Ocean. Data were collected through French and Spanish <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> and represented a total of 27 trips corresponding to 2. 9 % coverage. Bycatch is defined as non-targeted species and small or damaged target species. Bycatch species composition, main species length, sex ratio {{and the fate of}} the most common species are presented first. Stratified ratios relative to landings of major commercial tunas were then used to estimate the total bycatch; these ratios were considered the most appropriate variable for extrapolation. Stratification was based on the fishing mode (free school vs. floating object), season (quarters) and spatial areas. The annual average bycatch was estimated at about 6400 t, corresponding to a mean annual value of 80. 8 t per 1000 t of tuna landed or 7. 5 % of the total catch. Tunas represent 83 % (67. 2 t/ 1000 t) of the total bycatch, followed by other bony fishes (10 %, 7. 8 t/ 1000 t), billfishes (5 %, 4. 0 t/ 1000 t), sharks (1 %, 0. 9 t/ 1000 t) and rays (1 %, 0. 9 t/ 1000 t).

40|$|International audienceSeabirds are {{amongst the}} most globally-threatened of all groups of birds, and {{conservation}} issues specific to albatrosses (Diomedeidae) and large petrels (Procellaria spp. and giant petrels Macronectes spp.) led to drafting of the multi-lateral Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). Here we review the taxonomy, breeding and foraging distributions, population status and trends, threats and {{priorities for the}} 29 species covered by ACAP. Nineteen (66 %) are listed as threatened by IUCN, and 11 (38 %) are declining. Most have extensive at-sea distributions, and the greatest threat is incidental mortality (bycatch) in industrial pelagic or demersal longline, trawl or artisanal fisheries, often in both national and international waters. Mitigation measures are available that reduce bycatch in most types of fisheries, but some management bodies are yet to make these mandatory, levels of implementation and monitoring of compliance are often inadequate, and there are insufficient <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> collecting robust data on bycatch rates. Intentional take, pollution (including plastic ingestion), and threats at colonies affect fewer species than bycatch; however, the impacts of disease (mainly avian cholera) and of predation by introduced species, including feral cats (Felis catus), rats (Rattus spp.) and house mice (Mus musculus), are severe for some breeding populations.

40|$|To {{examine the}} current {{management}} of trawl fisheries {{is important to}} ensure albatross mortality is not being overlooked. By-catch of albatrosses in trawl fisheries occurs cryptically, which has hindered the development of conservation policy. The implementation of tasked seabird observer programmes in trawl fisheries, nevertheless, has shown that albatross mortality can happen at threatening levels. Consequently, mitigation measures have been developed and adopted in some trawl fisheries. Despite this, some trawl fisheries lack clear policy in relation to albatross mortality. In this context, I investigated the management of potential albatross mortality in a state trawl fishery, the New South Wales Ocean Trawl, in Australia. I conducted a literature search and addressed a set of questions to the responsible management agency through questions on notice at the State Parliament of New South Wales to understand albatross interactions from a policy standpoint. My results indicate that current policy neither encompasses albatross mortality nor is evidence-based. However, the combination of characteristics of this fishery and its overlap with albatross occurrence, along with the reported albatross mortality from other trawl fisheries, may warrant the need to collect empirical evidence on potential albatross interactions. Hence, the responsible management agency should take action according to legal obligations. In this scenario, I recommend {{the implementation of a}} tasked seabird <b>observer</b> <b>programme,</b> collection of baseline data, and adoption of adaptive management by the examined fishery.

As far as the assessment of small pelagics is concerned, the scientific <b>observer</b> <b>programme</b> was continued and {{towards the end of the}} project period the responsibility for this programme was handed over to IMROP scientists. In the course of the project two acoustic surveys were partly funded by the project, as well as a meeting of the FAO working group on the assessment of small pelagics in Northwest Africa. During 2006, by-catch data were collected by four different vessels for 1072 hauls. In 343 hauls an excluder was used, a proto-type of which was developed during the preceding contract. By-catch rates observed in 2006 were rather low, especially when compared with records from scientific observers for the years 2001 - 2004. A positive effect of the excluder on the amount of by-catches could not be shown, possibly because part of the by-catches was released while the net was still in the water, and therefore not recorded. The efficiency of the excluder for small cetaceans remains as yet to be proven...|$|E
40|$|Observation of the {{strengths}} and profiles of the hydrogen Balmer absorption series is an established technique for determining the effective temperature and surface gravity of hot H-rich white dwarf stars. In principle, the Lyman series lines should be equally useful but, lying in the far-UV, are only accessible from space. Nevertheless, there are situations (for example, where the optical white dwarf spectrum is highly contaminated {{by the presence of}} a companion) in which use of the Lyman series may be essential. Therefore, it is important to establish whether or not the Lyman lines provide an equally valid means of measurement. We have already made a first attempt to study this problem, comparing Lyman line measurements from a variety of far-UV instruments with ground-based Balmer line studies. Within the measurement uncertainties we found the results from each line series to be broadly in agreement. However, we noted a number of potential systematic effects that could bias either measurement. With the availability of the FUSE data archive and observations from our own Guest <b>Observer</b> <b>programmes,</b> we now have an opportunity of examining the use of the Lyman series in more detail from observations of 16 DA white dwarfs. The new results partially reproduce the earlier study, showing that Balmer and Lyman line determined temperatures are in good agreement up to 5 ̃ 0000 K. However, above this value there is an increasing systematic difference between the Lyman and Balmer line results, the former yielding the higher temperature.

40|$|Fisheries bycatch {{is a key}} {{threat to}} {{cetacean}} species globally. Managing the impact requires {{an understanding of the}} conditions under which animals are caught and the sections of the population affected. We used observer data collected on an albacore tuna gillnet fishery in the northeast Atlantic, to assess operational and environmental factors contributing to bycatch of common and striped dolphins, using generalised linear models and model averaging. Life history demographics of the captured animals were also investigated. In both species, young males dominated the catch. The age ratio of common dolphins was significantly different from that estimated for the population in the region, based on life tables (G = 17. 1, d. f.  = 2, p = 0. 002). Skewed age and sex ratios may reflect varying vulnerability to capture, through differences in behaviour or segregation in populations. Adult females constituted the second largest portion of the bycatch for both species, with potential consequences for population sustainability. Depth was the most important parameter influencing bycatch of both species and reflected what is known about common and striped dolphin habitat use in the region as the probability of catching common dolphins decreased, and striped dolphins increased, with increasing depth. Striped dolphin capture was similarly influenced by the extent to which operations were conducted in daylight, with the probability of capture increasing with increased operations in the pre-sunset and post-sunrise period, potentially driven by increased ability of observers to record animals during daylight operations, or by diurnal movements increasing contact with the fishery. Effort, based on net length and soak time, had little influence on the probability of capturing either species. Our results illustrate the importance of assessing the demographic of the animals captured during <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> and, perhaps more importantly, suggest that effort restrictions alone may not be sufficient to eradicate bycatch in areas where driftnets and small cetaceans co-occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} of ensuring adequate statistical coverage of whole fleets {{is a challenge}} {{for the implementation of}} <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> and may reduce the usefulness of the data they obtain for management purposes. This makes it necessary to find cost-effective alternatives. Electronic monitoring (EM) systems are being used in some fisheries as an alternative or a complement to human observers. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the use and reliability of EM on the tropical tuna purse-seine fishery. To achieve this objective, seven trips of tuna purse seiners operating in the three Oceans were closely monitored to compare the information provided by EM and on-board observers to determine if EM can reliably document fishing effort, set type, tuna catch, and bycatch. Total tuna catch per set was not significantly different between EM and observer datasets; however, regarding species composition, only main species matched between EM and observers. Success on set-type identification using EM varied between 98. 3 and 56. 3 %, depending on the camera placement. Overall, bycatch species were underestimated by EM, but large bodied species, such as billfishes, were well documented. The analyses in this study showed that EM can be used to determine the fishing effort (number of sets) and total tuna catch as reliably as observers can. Set-type identification also had very promising results, but indicated that refinement of the methods is still needed. To be fully comparable with observer data, improvements for accurately estimating the bycatch will need to be developed in the application and use of the EM system. Operational aspects that need to be improved for an EM programme to be implemented include standardizing installation and on-board catch handling methodology as well as improvements in video technology deployment...|$|R
