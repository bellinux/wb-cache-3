50|$|This dam {{is rather}} {{unique in that}} very little of its water is sourced is from rainfall. The dam was not built on a river but instead it is sited on what can at best be classed as a large stream in {{the upper reaches of}} a valley on the Nuwejaarspruit. The {{catchment}} area of the dam is less than three times the water surface area of the dam and therefore not risk to a flood. For this reason the main dam wall does not have the need for a spillway. Any excess rain water can be safely ejected from its <b>oulet</b> valves. The advantage of this location is the Dam is a highly effective reservoir, since it has the depth to store a large amount of water, with very little loss to evaporation. The Vaal Dam lake (reservoir) by comparison has a large surface area and is relatively shallow, which results in a higher rate of evaporation. It would take 17 years of rainfall to fill the dam. But capturing rainfall was not an important intent behind this project. It was built to capture water from the Tugela river and deliver it into the Vaal system.|$|E

40|$|On étudie, par des mesures en plongée sous-marine, les émergences en mer des écoulements souterrains dans le Piton de la Fournaise (île de la Réunion) {{dans le cadre de}} recherches sur les {{relations}} entre circulations souterraines, flux de chaleur et phénomènes magmatiques. On établit:- que l'ensemble des émergences se situe {{au niveau}} du rivage, et non en profondeur- que grâce à des mesures approchées des phénomènes de mélange des eaux, on peut estimer le débit moyen des résurgences en mer à 0, 4 m 3 s- 1 par kilomètre de côte sur la façade sud de l'île. Ce chiffre est cohérent avec des estimations indirectes obtenues à partir du bilan hydrique. The « Piton de la Fournaise » {{on the island}} of la Réunion receives as much as 6 to 10 m y-l of rainfall, which almost immediately infiltrates due to the highly pervious nature of the basalt (microfissures, scoria). Very few springs or rivers drain the systeml however, numerous marine outlets have been observed by infrared thermographic surveys. Some of these outlets can also be observed on SPOT images, although no infrared charmel is available on SPOT. In an attempt to study the role of underground flow in the thermal balance of the volcano and its relation with magmatic phenomena, we have tried to observe the nature of these outlets by underwater exploration and to evaluate their flow rate by salinity and temperature mesurements. Longitudinal and transverse salinity profiles were measured by divers using a salinity-conductivity meter with automatic correction of temperature, transported in a waterproof container, on those plumes that had been observed on airborne images or by helicopter surveys. All the observed plumes are indeed mixing zones of seawater and freshwater, with salinity ranging from 29. 9 to 35. 1 %o (ocean salinity is 35. 2 %o at la Réunion). Their temperature is in general lower than that of the sea, which explains why they are visible on infrared irnages. It was found, however, that all outlets are systematically situated very close to the shore line, with an elevation between + 1 and - 2 m of sea level. In none of the observations were outlets found that could originate deeper down in the sea. Most observable <b>oulets</b> are located at the base of basalt flows, in natural « tunnels » under such lava flows. This is consistent with the existence of an abrupt interface between seawater and freshwater on the island, which has been observed in a fewboreholes, and which forces the freshwater flow upwards towards the shore line, even if the nature of the flow is very discontinuous in the basalt. Based on the salinity profiles, we have attempted to estimate the flow rate. We focus here on a particular outlet at Vincendo. We liken the development and mixing of the plume to what occurs in an estuary with low flow. It has been observed that three mechanisms control the mixing in an estuary: wind which creates currents and pushes freshwater toward the edges; tidal effects and waves creating currents and turbulent mixing due to rugosity of the sides and bottom; density difrerences between seawater and freshwater, the latter floating on top of the former. Three cases are generally considered:a - Seas without tide: the interface is stratified;b - Seas with small tides: stratification and mixing occur sirnultaneously;c - Seas with large tides: no stratification and regular mixing in the vertical dimension. The observed salinity profiles at Vincendo clearly indicate {{that we are in the}} second case at la Réunion, where the tide amplitude is small (0. 7 m). Two dimensionless numbers are used in estuaries: the Richardson and Froude numbers (see expression in text) (FISHER et al., 1979). It has been observed that the transition from case a to c corresponds to Richardson numbers in the range 0. 08 to 0. 8. Assuming that salinity profiles are consistent with case b, i. e. a Richadson number in the range 0. 25 - 0. 80, we find that the freshwater flowrate should be in the range 0. 020 - 0. 260 m 3. s- 1. A second independent estimation can be obtained by observing that the average concentration gradient in the 7, 000 m 2 of the obseved mixing zone (30 x 40 m) is on the order of 0. 3 kg. m- 3. m- 1. Selecting (from FISCHER et al., 1979) a turbulent dispersion coefficient for coastal watcrs over the scale of several thousand m 2 of 2 to 5 x 10 - 3 m 2. s- 1, we can estimate the vertical dispersive flux over the mixing zone and, by mass balance, we obtain another estimate of the flux in the range 0. 150 - 0. 400 m 2. s- 1. We conclude that the flowrate is on the order of 0. 150 m 3. s- 1, with a plausible range of 0. 100 - 0. 300 m 3. s- 1. These results were extrapolated to the entire South and East shores ofthe island by assuming that the flow rate of an outlet was proportional to its area as observed on infrared surveys. We obtain an average flux of 0, 4 m 3. s- 1 km-l for the southern flank of the volcano. This ligure is consistent with a global estimate (0, 6 m 3. s- 1 km-l) obtained by a surface hydrologic balance over this part of the volcano. The difference can represent diffuse outlets into the sea...|$|R

40|$|Red yeast rice is a {{pigmented}} {{material that}} is traditionally used in Asia as a food colorant. In addition to food applications, red yeast rice is known in traditional Chinese medicine for its therapeutic actions. The aim of this work was to study the quality interactions during spray drying of extracts from the Monascus ruber van Tiegham fermentation broth. The quality indicators used for the dry powder properties were the levels of monacolin K, ratio of red to yellow pigments, {{as well as their}} antioxidant activity. The experiments followed a Box-Behnken design to study the effects of the adjuvant/drug ratio, adjuvant incorporation time, and <b>oulet</b> drying temperature on the pharmacotechnical, chemical, and biological properties of the dry extract. The influences of these factors on the characteristics of the dry powder were evaluated by the bulk density, tapped density, Carr index, Hausner factor, residual moisture content, water activity, antioxidant activity, monacolin K, yellow-to-red pigment ratio, and antioxidant activity. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) on experimental data revealed that an increase in drying temperature significantly increased the dry powder yield and caused an improvement in powder flow properties, which may be related to lower moisture contents. The drying temperature did not affect the monacolin K content in dry powder but showed a complex influence on its antioxidant activity. The increase in drying adjuvant-to-drug ratio affected the yield and also indicated a protective effect on the monacolin K content. The duration of drying adjuvant incorporation had little or negligible effect on powder properties. The dry extracts of red yeast rice showed adequate properties and the process proposed herein can be used to prepare nutraceutical products.

40|$|Forest {{products}} provide essential {{resources for}} human civilization, including energy and materials. In processing forest products, however, unwanted byproducts, such as {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are generated. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a cost effective and reliable air pollution control system to reduce VOC and HAP emissions from pulp, paper and paperboard mills and solid wood product facilities. Specifically, this work focused on the removal of VOCs and HAPs from high volume low concentration (HVLC) gases, particularly methanol since it is the largest HAP constituent in these gases. Three technologies were developed and tested at the bench-scale: (1) A novel composite material of activated carbon coated with a photocatalyst titanium dioxide (TiO{sub 2 }) (referred to as TiO{sub 2 }-coated activated carbon or TiO{sub 2 }/AC), (2) a novel silica gel impregnated with nanosized TiO{sub 2 } (referred to as silica-titania composites or STC), and (3) biofiltration. A pilot-scale reactor was also fabricated and tested for methanol removal using the TiO{sub 2 }/AC and STC. The technical feasibility of removing methanol with TiO{sub 2 }/AC was studied using a composite synthesized via a spay desiccation method. The removal of methanol consists of two consecutive operation steps: removal of methanol using fixed-bed activated carbon adsorption and regeneration of spent activated carbon using in-situ photocatalytic oxidation. Regeneration using photocatalytic oxidation employed irradiation of the TiO{sub 2 } catalyst with low-energy ultraviolet (UV) light. Results of this technical feasibility study showed that photocatalytic oxidation can be used to regenerate a spent TiO{sub 2 }/AC adsorbent. A TiO{sub 2 }/AC adsorbent was then developed using a dry impregnation method, which performed better than the TiO{sub 2 }/AC synthesized using the spray desiccation method. The enhanced performance was likely a result of the better distribution of TiO 2 particles on the activated carbon surface. A method for pore volume impregnation using microwave irradiation was also developed. A commercial microwave oven (800 W) was used as the microwave source. Under 2450 MHz microwave irradiation, TTIP was quickly hydrolyzed and anatase TiO 2 was formed in a short time (< 20 minutes). Due to the volumetric heating and selective heating of microwave, the solvent and by-products were quickly removed which reduced energy consumption and processing time. Activated carbon and TiO{sub 2 }/AC were also tested for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, which was chosen as the representative total reduced sulfur (TRS) species. The BioNuchar AC support itself was a good H{sub 2 }S remover. After coating TiO{sub 2 } by dry impregnation, H{sub 2 }S removal efficiency of TiO{sub 2 }/AC decreased compared with the virgin AC due to the change of surface pH. Under UV light irradiation, H{sub 2 }S removal efficiency of TiO{sub 2 }/AC composite doubled, and its sulfate conversion efficiency was higher than that of AC. The formation of sulfate is preferred since the sulfate can be removed from the composite by rising with water. A pilot-scale fluidized bed reactor was designed to test the efficiency of methanol oxidation with TiO{sub 2 }/AC in the presence of UV light. TiO{sub 2 }/AC was prepared using the spray desiccation method. The TiO{sub 2 }/AC was pre-loaded with (1) methanol (equivalent to about 2 %wt) and (2) methanol and water. When the TiO{sub 2 }/AC loaded with methanol only was exposed to UV light for one hour in the reactor, most of the methanol remained in the carbon pores and, thus, was not oxidized. The TiO{sub 2 }/AC loaded with methanol and water desorbed about 2 / 3 of the methanol from its pores during fluidization, however, only a small portion of this desorbed methanol was oxidized. A biofilter system employing biological activated carbon was developed for methanol removal. The biofilter contained a mixed packing with Westvaco BioNuchar granular activated carbon, perlite, Osmocote slow release ammonium nitrate pellets, and Agrasoke water crystals in a 4 : 2 : 1 : 1 ratio by volume. The biofilter was inoculated with a bacterial culture collected from a Florida pulp and paperboard plant. A non-inoculated biofilter column was also tested. Use of a biological inoculum enriched from biofilm in the pulp and paper process has the potential to enhance the performance of a GAC biofilter. During testing, packing material was removed from the inlet and <b>oulet</b> of the biofilters and analyzed for genetic diversity using molecular techniques. The biofilter inoculated with specifically-enhanced inoculum showed higher bacterial diversity for methylotrophs and all bacteria, as compared to a non-inoculated biofilter.

This dissertation scrutinizes the development of the shopping landscape in nineteenth-century Brussels.

The central question of this research centers on how these developments translated qualitatively in a shopping culture. In this dissertation it is argued that the heart of the Brussels shopping landscape densified intensively throughout the nineteenth century. Never were there more shops in the center of Brussels than during the beginning of the twentieth century. Rather than revolutionary new types of shopping sites, the century of ‘modernity’ brought Brussels a growing variety in the number of sites for shopping. Shopping in these sites increasingly and pre-eminently became an activity for pedestrians. Shopping and strolling in the city center molded into one activity. Window-shopping turned into an independent and indispensable part of rsquo;. Shopkeepers capitalized upon that fact by increasing the size of shop windows and creating spectacular designs and displays. The surroundings of the street too were increasingly fitted out to facilitate the practice of shopping for leisure. Sidewalks were constructed and possible obstructions were banned from the streets, including rsquo; commercial practices, such as street markets, displays of itinerant traders and so on. As such, the development of the shopping landscape was reflective of the ambitions of the bourgeois liberal city council for a ‘modern city’, and it added to the realization of these ambitions as well. The evolutions in shopping were indeed strongly intertwined with the council’s projects of beautification, sanitization and rationalization, while equally demonstrating the limitations of the council’s policy. This book demonstrates that shopping cultures (and –subcultures) were linked to the type of goods on sale and the locations in the city rather than to the type of retail <b>oulet.</b> The growing array of ‘sites for shopping’ contributed to the evolution in the Brussels shopping culture. Although no traces could be found of a retail or shopping revolution, the practices and contours of shopping in Brussels did evolve as the nineteenth century progressed. This book demonstrates that the development of the shopping landscape and its culture presented a complex process that ran back and forth, now coincidentally and then in a more orchestrated manner past the newer and older places of the nineteenth century. The eye-catching institutions – including arcades, market halls, auction houses and department stores – took on the role of a catalyst agent in a dynamic shopping landscape. These new sites for shopping and the broader shopping landscape they were engrained in were characterized by a search for splendor – even if that search did not always lead to the desired results. nbsp; This {{book is about}} the history of the Brussels shopping landscape during the nineteenth century.

Although the increasing commercialization of the nineteenth-century urban landscape has long been a topos in historiography, the entirety and diversity of shopping spaces has not yet been the object of thorough research. For decades, historians of retail and shopping have mostly been concerned withlsquo;modern’ forms of retail, such as the cooperation, the multiple and – especially – the department store, which, so it was argued, gave rise to the birth of a modern culture of leisurely shopping. These institutes were most often studied in isolation, rather than in relation to each other and to the broader context of less spectacular shopping spaces. When more recent research turned the focus to the resilience of more ‘traditional’ retail forms – such as the market, ambulant trade and the small shop – scholars have been especially interested in the conflict between tradition and modernity. Again, only rarely did historians include more than two commercial circuits into their scope. Although historians have tended to single out specific shopping sites, this isolation was nevertheless not a characteristic of historic reality. Markets, market halls, shops, department stores, arcades, auction houses, bazaars, branches of multiples and co-ops shared customers, streets and pavements with each other. Therefore, this book takes the shopping landscape as its object of study, with Brussels as its case-study. The history of shopping and shopping culture in the nineteenth-century city is re-evaluated from a spatial perspective. This reevaluation aims to engage with findings in research on early-modern retailing and shopping. Whereas historians studying the nineteenth century have long claimed the century’s modernity, scholars studying the early-modern period have demonstrated that many so-called ‘modern’ shopping- and business practices dated from before the nineteenth century and its department stores. Turning away from the traditional quest for modernity, this study searches for elements of continuity and discontinuity in both the shopping landscape and the culture of shopping that was engrained in it throughout the nineteenth century. It demonstrates the necessity of understanding the variety of shopping places in relation to one another, and the added value of tracing evolutions in shopping by examining the shopping scene as a whole. This dissertation scrutinizes the development of the shopping landscape in nineteenth-century Brussels. It examines the different types of sites for shopping and their relation to each other and the evolving shopping culture throughout the century. The central question of this research centers on how these developments translated qualitatively in a shopping culture.

40|$|Urban Reaction The thesis {{proposal}} {{comes out}} {{as a result of}} seeing the City of Brussels as a Mundaneum. At the beginning of the process, an analysis of the two main axis of the city revealed that the area that is in direct relation with the canal and the actual Harbour is not defined. Which is why, this area was choose as a possible site for the project. Historically speaking, the canal and all the infrastructure that relates with it had been remove in several occasions along time. At present days, the harbour is intended to be moved once again, leaving this area as a vacant space, creating a hole in the city. As an urban reaction, the idea is to keep this empty space which will be generated and give it to the city, creating a new park in the area which will include this location in the structure of parks of Brussels. Furthermore, the project proposes the generation of a new primary element which will border the park {{in order to avoid the}} city to invade the space. Public Pools Program The Mundaneum was a project proposed by Paul <b>Oulet,</b> considered as a building that would hold together all the knowledge of the world. As a first reaction to the problem of Mundaneum, it is intended for the primary element to act as a counter project for the other parks of the city. In one hand, all the other important parks are located in the highest points of the topography while the project is proposed for the lowest part of it. Also, the other parks contain buildings that are in direct relation with the expression of power, either political or religious. The thesis proposed a project that will hold a program that is not related with power, but a project for people. As long as one of the main elements of the site is the presence of water, and, that public baths since Roman Empire had always been considered as monuments for people. It was decided that this program was the most suitable for the proposed building. Design Infrastructures are primary elements per excellence because they either can accelerate or retard the urban process. In order to create a primary element in this point it was decided to create a new infrastructure which at the same time will provide a service for the city, it will work with the canal and hold the public program. In order to do this, the thesis proposed to merge in one single element architecture and infrastructure. In this sense, the thesis creates a water treatment plant merged with the program of a public pool. The building takes the water from the canal, purifies it and uses it for the pools, giving the building the spirit of machine that creates its own elemental basis to generate leisure for people. The Building is composed by system of steel truss frame structures created by the repetition and placement of a basic element of 7, 5 by 7, 5 m, which allows to create a mega structure of 600 m long by 260 m wide capable to save long distances without support and hold the machinery needed for the infrastructure and to generate the spaces needed for the program. This steel structure composes the main load bearing system, which is revealed in the façade, giving the building the expression of a giant industrial machine. Furthermore, the main load bearing system holds together a serious of substructures that contain the inside spaces and are based on modular systems that come out from the dimensions of the main structure. The substructures change in scale from outside to inside, maintaining the monumentality of the infrastructure to the outside and transforming it to the scale of a building to the inside. At the inside, the process of water purification is revealed becoming part of the public program of the building. Metaphor The expression that was looked for the building is the expression of an old fabric in which the pools become a piece of purified water inside an space which may not be considered as a proper environment for this type of program, the purified pools come as a result of a process of the re use of the polluted water from the canal, as an analogy of how infrastructures generate the base for societies to work. This analogy becomes a metaphor of a Mundaneum, because there is no need for the project to stack pieces of knowledge production because society is the one that produces knowledge demonstrating that it can also be a project devoted for people as long as it creates an absolute outbreak in our traditional way of life, and this project creates that outbreak in an urban, architectural, and programmatic levels.
