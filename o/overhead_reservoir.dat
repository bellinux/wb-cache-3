OptiNetwork in its modifications, introduced means of selecting options for advanced genetic algorithm parameters (Top mate; Roulette cost; Random; Tournament methods; and one point crossover; two points crossover; uniform crossover methods and random seed number). Using Badarawa/Malali existing water distribution network consisting of 96 pipes of different materials, 75 junctions, two tanks, and one <b>overhead</b> <b>reservoir,</b> and a source reservoir (i. e treatment plant) from which water is pumped through a pumping main to the <b>overhead</b> <b>reservoir</b> and later distributed to the network by gravity. The modified software optiNetwork was applied to Badarawa / Malali networks distribution designs. The results obtained were compared with those obtained using commercial software package (OptiDesigner), The modified software {{has been able to}} obtained almost equal result with OptiDesigner software for the first optimization i. e before the application of advance GA, after the application of Advance GA It was observed that the least-cost design of 195, 200. 00 that satisfies the constraints requirements was obtained using optiNetwork, which is much lower than 435, 118. 00 obtained from OptiDesigner software. The results obtained show that the introduction of the advanced genetic parameters of OptiNetwork is justified. This is because, it has been able to improve the search method in terms of achieving the “least-cost” designed water distribution system that will supply sufficient water quantities at adequate pressure to the consumers. ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated direct right ventricular drainage of the septal {{branch of the}} common left coronary artery of dogs with normal pressure-flow relationship maintained between the coronary vasculature and the ventricular chambers. 1 Using similar methods the search for Thebesian drainage of the common left coronary artery has been extended to the left heart of the dog, {{and the results of}} this investigation are herein re-ported. Methods These studies were performed in open-chest, mongrel dogs anesthetized with morphine and pentobarbital, and maintained on intratracheal positive pressure respiration. After anticoagula-tion with heparin, a Morawitz cannula with an occlusive balloon-tip was placed in the orifice of the coronary sinus via the right atrial appendage, and its outflow was diverted via a long (2 m) external circuit to a previously cannulated left external jugular vein. A short segment of the right carotid artery was excised and replaced by a T cannula with a one-way flap valve at its central end. This valve allowed blood to flow from the aorta into an <b>overhead</b> <b>reservoir</b> from which blood was re-turned to the animal through the cephalic seg-ment of the interrupted carotid artery. With this arrangement blood returned to the animal from the reservoir via the cerebral circulation rather than draining directly back into the aorta. After the valve was in place the aorta was ligated distal to the left subclavian artery and blood was di-verted into the <b>overhead</b> <b>reservoir,</b> the height of which was adjusted to maintain a mean aortic pressure of 100 mm Hg.

30|$|The {{diversity}} of Aedes mosquitoes in Karachi reflects {{a completely different}} distribution, showing high clusters in the north-west and south-east of Karachi. The low-income areas are the target of Aedes with Baldia and Korangi as the major hub, where open drains, water pitchers and <b>overhead</b> water <b>reservoirs</b> serve as major sources for breeding. It has been revealed from the spatial variation of mosquito breeding grounds in Karachi that {{the high incidence of}} vector-borne diseases is associated with low-income areas of the city. This is mainly because of poor health and sanitation conditions (for example, open sewage drains and unpaved roads resulting in standing rainwater). Furthermore, the high incidence of vector-borne diseases has also been noticeably increased in rural settings areas, where there is a general dearth of health facilities.|$|R

The 125 -ton OWR was an overhead 160, 000 - gallon-capacity tank approximately 193 feet high which supplied cooling water to the MTR. Radiation at ground level beneath the tank was 5 mR/hr and approximately 600 mR/hr at the exterior surface of the tank. Sources ranging from 3 R/hr to in excess of 500 R/hr exist within the tank. The tank interior is contaminated with uranium, plutonium, and miscellaneous fission products. The OWR was lowered to ground level {{with the use of}} explosive cutters.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{facilitate}} hardware design. One of the first design decisions is the partitioning of the system in smaller subsystems, which can be implemented on separate hardware and/or software components. Internal communication within components and external communication between different components can be distinguished. Especially external communication is cumbersome, because it determines the requirements for the communication channels in the system. Distinction between internal and external communication is defined by the functional partitioning step which thus has a major impact on the quality of the final design. By estimating communication between functions in advance, we enable a better functional partitioning and therefore improve the communication requirements in the system. As in [4], Java is used in this paper as a specification language for the system, because this language is ideally fit for communication analysis. We present a profiler which measures communication between methods in Java. Our profiler counts the so called consumer-producer relations for each pair of methods. Each consumer-producer relation is defined as a pair of a read operation from and the corresponding write operation to the Java heap memory. The profiling requires a huge increase in execution time. To reduce this <b>overhead,</b> we implement <b>reservoir</b> sampling [11]. This sampling method randomly and uniformly selects a smaller set of read operations to be profiled. The size of this set, i. e. the reservoir, specifies the sampling accuracy. Our approach is evaluated on the SPECjvm 98 benchmark suite. The sampling technique reduces the overhead by a factor of 15. Yet accuracy remains within pre-specified limits...|$|R
40|$|During {{end-of-life}} {{production from}} an oil well {{it is often}} impossible to sustain continuous production. Gas coning is a common cause of production problems, especially in thin oil reservoirs. This study compares three production strategies {{that can be used}} to deal with this problem for a specific field case. The strategies will be evaluated on the basis of two criteria: Total number of barrels produced and Net Present Value (NPV). The three strategies considered are (i) intermittent production, (ii) Well Head Control (WHC), (iii) Inflow Control Devices, (ICD). The first two are currently common practice, while the latter is an emerging technology which is not applied on a large scale yet, because of the larger expense incurred by ICD installation. The onset of gas breakthrough occurs in a much shorter timescale than many other production upsets, such as water flooding, making it a very challenging situation for a control strategy. A coupled dynamic reservoir-well model has been used in order to describe the breakthrough accurately. A simulation environment has been constructed and validated in which different well and reservoir models can be coupled. Since correct prediction of flow and pressure drop over ICDs is essential, special care was taken to accurately model these devices. For the WHC control strategies a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) algorithm was used. Despite the higher initial completion costs associated with ICDs, they can provide a cost-effective way to reduce long-term operating costs and increase yield. Production targets are achieved with longer, but fewer wells, maintenance and <b>overhead.</b> From a <b>reservoir</b> management point of view, ICDs can improve the productivity index (PI) by maximizing reservoir contact, minimizing gas coning by operating at lower drawdown, and increasing overall efficiency. In this study we evaluate a field case, which suffers from gas coning, to verify whether the implementation and usage of ICDs are cost-effective alternatives, and quantify the relative merits for each technology. The comparison is based on both the total barrels produced and the NPV, taking into account the integral cost, including installation, operating, and maintenance costs...|$|R
