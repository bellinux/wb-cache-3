40|$|The rich physics {{manifested}} by 5 d oxides {{falls outside}} the Mott-Hubbard paradigm used to successfully explain the electronic and magnetic properties of 3 d oxides. Much consideration {{has been given}} {{to the extent to which}} strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), in the limit of increased bandwidth and reduced electron correlation, drives the formation of novel electronic states, as manifested through the existence of metal-insulator transitions (MITs). SOC is believed to play a dominant role in 5 d 5 systems such as iridates (Ir 4 +), undergoing MITs which may or may not be intimately connected to magnetic order, with pyrochlore and perovksite systems being examples of the former and latter, respectively. However, the role of SOC for other 5 d configurations is less clear. For example, 5 d 3 (e. g Os 5 +) systems are expected to have an orbital singlet and consequently a reduced effect of SOC in the groundstate.

The axial ligand field parameter, Δ, is quite insensitive to the ammine metal (M) and is mainly determined by the solvent matrix. Density functional calculations, together with a simplified MO model, show that: (a) The value of Δ is dominated by the interaction between the filled cyanide π-orbitals and the ammine–metal dxz,yz orbitals, (b) Δ decreases with increasing solvent donicity because the resulting positive shift of the d-orbital energies reduces this interaction, (c) the insensitivity of Δ to the ammine–metal arises because an increase in the energy mismatch between the cyanide π-orbitals and the d-orbitals in <b>osmium</b> <b>compound</b> is offset by an increase in the 5 d resonance integrals relative to those in the 4 d shell.

It is the purpose of this communication to note briefly the interrelationship of a number of crucial observations and opinions on this point. It is generally agreed (e. g. see reference 1) that the osmium deposited in tissues probably exists in the form of mixed lower osmium oxides and/or hydroxides and metallo-organic compounds. These may have densities of the order of 2 to 8 gm. /cc, as compared to 22. 48 gm. /cc. for metallic osmium and about 1. 3 gm. / cc. for pure protein.

This is probably part of the explanation of the "osmiophilic staining " of droplets of free lipide. The results of Hall (2) in which relatively enormous quantities of dense reagent molecules are "soaked up" by virus particles, far in excess of the stoichiometry of the known reactions between both the nucleic acids and proteins on the one hand, and the reagent molecules used, demonstrate the efficacy of this type of non-stoichiometric impregnatio...|$|R

30|$|Preliminary, three {{forms of}} cobalt were {{screened}} for antiproliferative active against PC- 3 cancer cell line using MTT assay. MTT {{is the most}} widely widely used method to investigate antiproliferative potential of test compound against various cell lines (Dellai et al. 2012; Pieme et al. 2013; Rapisarda et al. 2015). The mechanism behind this assay includes conversion of yellow coloured MTT into blue colored formazon {{by the action of}} the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase within mitochondria of living cells. Our results showed CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O as the most active antiproliferative agent, hence it was further tested against other cancer cell lines. Cell death induced by CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O inhibited the formation of blue colored formazan crystals. Lower the intensity of blue colour, more will be the antiproliferative potential of the test compound. CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O was tested at 6 concentrations ranging from 5 to 100  mg/L against four cell lines viz. 293 T, PC- 3, A 549 and IMR- 32. It induced maximum cell death in IMR- 32 cancer cell line. Similar studies were conducted by (Martinez-Built et al. 2015; Villa-Pérez et al. 2016) using Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cu(II) complexes against HeLa, HTC- 15, MCF- 7 and PC- 3 cell lines and they established that ligand binding capability of transition metals is responsible for their antiproliferative activity. Although, the growth of normal non cancerous cells was also inhibited to certain degree but interestingly, this growth inhibition was more in case of cancer cell lines. Further, the LDH assay was also performed to check whether the mode of cell death induced by test compound is apoptosis or necrosis. The results clearly showed a very mild release of LDH from cell culture treated with CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O. This prompted us to look for other way of cell death i.e., apoptosis. Further studies were conducted on PC- 3 cells to eke out the apoptotic signatures from both inside and outside of the cell. All the microscopic studies on CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O treated PC- 3 cells showed the appearance of apoptotic bodies, blebbing, condensation of chromatin and shrinkage of cells. These morphological and cytological changes in PC- 3 cells point towards the apoptotic mode of cell death (Brauchle et al. 2014). Similar apoptotic inducing activities of cobalt were studied by Akita et al. (2007) where they found that salts of cobalt reduces expression of Bcl- 2 protein at transcriptional as well as translational level in HSG cells and induces apoptosis. The cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry showed an initial PC- 3 cell arrest at sub Go phase of cycle. Most of the anticancer drugs act by first arresting the cancer cells at particular phase of cell cycle and then start inducing apoptosis (Pathania et al. 2015). Similar studies were conducted by Van Rijt et al. (2014) and they observed cell arrest in S-phase after treatment with organometallic <b>osmium</b> <b>compounds</b> in A 549 cancer cells. The cell surface markers change their positions during apoptosis and to confirm this annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining was done and images of stained cells were taken by confocal microscope. The pattern of staining showed the DNA damage and movement of apoptotic markers to cell surface to which annexin was bound. It was further tested that whether apoptosis was operating by intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. The treated and untreated PC- 3 cells were checked spectroflurimetrically for ROS and MMP using different dyes. Results showed that CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O induced generation of ROS which in turn damaged mitochondria as was evident from MMP reading. These results were in accordance with studies by Zhang et al. (2016) where Co(II) complexes were found to alleviate ROS and disrupted mitochondrial membrane in cancer cell lines. The intrinsic pathway requires an induction like overproduction of ROS, radiations that damage mitochondria which in turn activate caspases to bring out apoptotic death (Hajrezaie et al. 2015; Elmore 2007; Tian et al. 2015; Leverson et al. 2015). Thus, caspases being an important class of cysteine proteases play requisite role in apoptosis (Exile et al. 2014). Our results showed a dose dependent increase in caspase activity in PC 3 cells with an increase in the concentration of CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O. Similar results were observed in ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, which lead to increased caspase- 3 activity in breast cancer cells (Cao et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Both {{acquired}} and intrinsic {{drug resistance}} are established clinical problems {{in many areas}} of medicine. This is particularly evident with the growing resistance to platinum chemotherapy agents in cancer treatment programmes. New, alternative treatments for platinum-resistance patients are needed, with comparable potency, no platinum cross- resistance, better safety profiles and which target non-repairable areas of the cell, reducing acquired resistance. This thesis focuses on osmium- and iridium-based organometallic anticancer agents to fill this clinical need. Previous work has validated their potency, safety and activity in platinum-resistant cancers, however, their mechanism of action (MOA) was yet to be identified. Knowing the MOA of new compounds is essential for personalising and stratifying cancer treatment, allowing for better patient selection and prediction of treatment outcomes. Often identifying the biological target of a new therapeutic is not essential. Instead, quantifying the cellular response to that treatment, and identifying cell types which hold beneficial biological properties to optimise compound effects, is more effective. This thesis has applied the principles of systems biology to study the whole cell effect of <b>osmium</b> and iridium <b>compounds</b> in epithelial ovarian cancer. Cells were studied at the transcriptional, translational and structural level to investigate compound response, integrating a selection of these findings using novel statistical modelling. Results propose that these compounds induce oxidative stress in cancer cells, and subsequently damage DNA to exert antiproliferative effects at submicromolar concentrations. This is the first example of studying organometallic compounds using this combination of techniques, and is a promising work flow for future efforts in this area. ...|$|R
