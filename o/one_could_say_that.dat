Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. <b>One</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E

25|$|Rather {{like their}} Olympic counterparts, Soviet rugby players had a fair degree of shamateurism. Both the Olympics and rugby union were officially amateur, {{but this was}} not really the case. For example, the Dinamo clubs were {{sponsored}} and financed by the KGB, but no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> openly that some athletes were full-time shamateurs, and received bonuses for winning including dollars. Masters of Sport were full time, and paid by their sports society. They received 180 rubles each year, plus 30-40 rubles if they were capped for the USSR team paid for by the USSR sports committee. There were frequently unofficial bonuses, and some people could be Masters of Sport for life, meaning that they would receive pay long after their retirement.|$|E

25|$|Cellular automata {{are often}} {{simulated}} on a finite grid {{rather than an}} infinite one. In two dimensions, the universe would be a rectangle instead of an infinite plane. The obvious problem with finite grids is {{how to handle the}} cells on the edges. How they are handled will affect the values of all the cells in the grid. One possible method is to allow the values in those cells to remain constant. Another method is to define neighborhoods differently for these cells. <b>One</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they have fewer neighbors, but then one would also have to define new rules for the cells located on the edges. These cells are usually handled with a toroidal arrangement: when one goes off the top, one comes in at the corresponding position on the bottom, and when one goes off the left, one comes in on the right. (This essentially simulates an infinite periodic tiling, and in the field of partial differential equations is sometimes referred to as periodic boundary conditions.) This can be visualized as taping the left and right edges of the rectangle to form a tube, then taping the top and bottom edges of the tube to form a torus (doughnut shape). Universes of other dimensions are handled similarly. This solves boundary problems with neighborhoods, but another advantage is that it is easily programmable using modular arithmetic functions. For example, in a 1-dimensional cellular automaton like the examples below, the neighborhood of a cell xit is {x'i−1t−1, x'i't−1, x'i+1t−1}, where t is the time step (vertical), and i is the index (horizontal) in one generation.|$|E

In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened.

2500|$|The {{appearance}} of the Count of Chambord provoked a political crisis, which worked {{to the advantage of}} Thiers. He persuaded the republicans that he was the least monarchist of the monarchists, and persuaded the monarchists that he was the least republican of the republicans. On 30 August 1871, the Assembly voted 494 to 94 to change the title of Thiers from Chief of the Executive Power to President of the Republic, under the authority of the National Assembly. It was a remarkable political achievement; the Third Republic had been created with the votes of the anti-republican monarchists.

2500|$|The paper {{steadily}} declined {{over the}} following four years. This phenomenon is described by Râpeanu as owed {{to a loss of}} direction: [...] " [...] no longer enjoyed the same impact, no longer sparked the interest or the polemics of 1903–1906. It brought nothing new to the landscape of Romanian literature. <b>One</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> in parting with Sămănătorul, N. Iorga took its soul with him." [...] Among the last major issues impacting on the journal's history was the peasants' revolt of 1907, which aired the social tensions of the Kingdom and was met with violence by the National Liberal cabinet of Dimitrie Sturdza. According to Sandqvist, traditionalist perspectives [...] "clashed badly with reality" [...] during the events, leading [...] "almost immediately to a regressive approach among many intellectuals [...] who had previously encouraged and endorsed Romania's turn to the West".|$|E
2500|$|Lukács {{restricted}} {{the application of}} the idea to capitalists only, claiming that Marx had considered capitalists as [...] "mere character masks" [...] – meaning that capitalists, as the personifications ("agents") of capital, did not do anything [...] "without making a business out of it", given that their activity consisted of the correct management and calculation of the objective effects of economic laws. Marx himself never simply equated capitalists with their character masks; they were human beings entangled in a certain life predicament, like anybody else. Capitalists became the [...] "personification" [...] of their capital, because they had money which was permanently invested somewhere, and which necessarily had to obtain a certain yield. At most <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> capitalists had more to hide, and that some had personal qualities enabling them to succeed in their function, while others lacked the personal prerequisites. According to Lukács, the character masks of the bourgeoisie express a [...] "necessary false consciousness" [...] about the class consciousness of the proletariat.|$|E

60|$|And just as {{the great}} Liberal {{movement}} which followed the French Revolution made this claim for the liberty and personality of human beings, so it made it for the liberty and personality of nations. It attached indeed to the independence of a nation something of the same wholly transcendental sanctity which humanity has in all legal systems attached {{to the life of}} a man. The grounds were indeed much the same; no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> absolutely <b>that</b> a live man was useless, and no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> absolutely <b>that</b> a variety of national life was useless or must remain useless to the world. Men remembered how often barbarous tribes or strange and alien Scriptures had been called in to revive the blood of decaying empires and civilisations. And this sense of the personality of a nation, as distinct from the personalities of all other nations, did not involve in the case of these old Liberals international bitterness; for it is too often forgotten that friendship demands independence and equality fully as much as war. But in them it led to great international partialities, to a great system, as it were, of adopted countries which made so thorough a Scotchman as Carlyle in love with Germany, and so thorough an Englishman as Browning in love with Italy.|$|R
2500|$|Ion Antonescu and his {{subordinates}} were for long {{divided on the}} issue of the Final Solution, as applied in territories under direct Nazi control from 1941. At an early stage, German attempts to impose the RSHA's direct control over Old Kingdom Jews drew some objections from Mihai Antonescu, but the two sides agreed to a common policy with reference to Soviet Jews. In various of his early 1940s statements, Ion Antonescu favorably mentions the Axis goal of eliminating the Jewish presence in the event of victory. The unrestrained character of some Romanian actions toward Jews alarmed Nazi officials, who demanded a methodical form of extermination. When confronted with German decisions to push back Jews he had expelled before the occupation of Transnistria, Antonescu protested, arguing that he had conformed with Hitler's decisions regarding [...] "eastern Jews". In August 1941, in preparation for the Final Solution's universal application, Hitler remarked: [...] "As for the Jewish question, today in any case <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a man like Antonescu, for example, proceeds much more radically in this manner than we have done until now. But I will not rest or be idle until we too have gone all the way with the Jews." ...|$|E
2500|$|The defense {{case went}} badly and Vanzetti did not testify {{in his own}} defense. During the trial, {{he said that his}} lawyers had opposed putting him on the stand. That same year, defense {{attorney}} Vahey told the governor that Vanzetti had refused his advice to testify. Decades later, a lawyer who assisted Vahey in the defense said that the defense attorneys left the choice to Vanzetti, but warned him that {{it would be difficult to}} prevent the prosecution from using cross examination to challenge the credibility of his character based on his political beliefs. He said that Vanzetti chose not to testify after consulting with Sacco. Herbert Ehrmann, who later joined the defense team, wrote many years later that the dangers of putting Vanzetti on the stand were very real. Another legal analysis of the case faulted the defense for not offering more to the jury by letting Vanzetti testify, concluding that by his remaining silent it [...] "left the jury to decide between the eyewitnesses and the alibi witness without his aid. In these circumstances a verdict of not guilty would have been very unusual". That analysis also claimed that [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the case was closely tried or vigorously fought for the defendant".|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the IWC as {{specified}} in its constitution is [...] "in safeguarding for future generations the great natural resources represented by the whale stocks;" [...] and the original members consisted only of the 15 whale-hunting nations. However, since the late 1970s and early 1980s, many countries which have no previous history of whaling (some of which are landlocked such as Switzerland and Mongolia) have joined the IWC. This shift was first initiated by Sir Peter Scott, the then head of the World Wildlife Fund. Labelling the IWC a [...] "butchers' club", he mounted lobbying campaigns in developed countries {{with support from the}} green lobby and anti whaling block of IWC members to change the composition of the IWC's membership, which was instrumental in obtaining the necessary three-quarters majority vote to implement the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. This campaign triggered the first accusations of vote-buying in IWC. According to Scott's biographer, Elspeth Huxley, China's decision to join was influenced by a World Wildlife Fund promise to provide $1 million to fund a panda reserve. Dr. Michael Tillman, former IWC Commissioner of the United States, said in a radio interview that [...] "there was what we called 'common knowledge,' that a number of countries joined and that their dues and the travel support was reportedly due to conservation groups providing it. So that, in a sense, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the conservation groups set out a strategy that the Japanese copied." ...|$|E
