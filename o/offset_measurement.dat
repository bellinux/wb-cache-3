The satellite motion directions {{at the same time}} length and different time period as well as different time length and different time period are different when simulating and calculating the clock offset data, and the influence on the clock offset fit polynomial error is also different. Especially, the deviation between the clock offset after the correction and actual clock offset is the maximum when the time period for clock <b>offset</b> <b>measurement</b> is asymmetric compared with the moment at the inter-satellite distance change rate of 0. At the actual application of the correction method, the simulation influence on the correction method is reduced for the influence of satellite motion direction and Sagnac effect on the algorithm is contained in the measuring value of T 1 and T 2 [15].

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess {{alternative}} measurements to {{the alpha}} angle {{as a tool}} for distinguishing between symptomatic and asymptomatic cam-type deformities of the femoral head. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 106 individuals (age 20 - 50 years) from a previous study on the alpha angle were analyzed, including 53 femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) patients with cam-type deformities and 53 age-/sex-matched asymptomatic volunteers. On radially reformatted MR images two independent radiologists assessed femoral offset and femoral distance (FD) around the femoral head circumference. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were obtained. RESULTS: The mean offset was smallest in the anterosuperior position for both readers: reader 1 measured 6. 2 [*]±[*] 2. 9 mm (standard deviation) in patients and 7. 3 [*]±[*] 1. 8 mm in volunteers (P[*]=[*] 0. 002, patients vs. volunteers); reader 2 measured 6. 1 [*]±[*] 3. 3 mm in patients and 7. 1 [*]±[*] 2. 9 mm in volunteers (P[*]=[*] 0. 111). The mean FD was highest in the anterosuperior position for reader 1 (patients 3. 3 [*]±[*] 1. 4 mm; volunteers 1. 7 [*]±[*] 2. 2 mm; P < 0. 001) and in the anterior position for reader 2 (patients 3. 1 [*]±[*] 1. 7 mm; volunteers 2. 0 [*]±[*] 1. 5 mm; P[*]=[*] 0. 001). Overall interobserver agreement (ICC) was good (offset 0. 657 /FD 0. 632).

In this study, we present different SAR deformation monitoring schemes to map the mining-induced subsidence and collapse. First, SAR data with different wavelengths, including Cband ERS- 1, C-band Envisat ASAR, and X-band TerraSAR-X data, are used to highlight three mining subsidence stages and their temporal evolutions over Datong mine (China) in the past 20 years. Mining-induced subsidence over a region can be delimited from InSAR deformation maps, where InSAR coherence is lost over the area of peak subsidence. Second, in order to monitor the large-gradient surface deformation caused by underground mining activities, three SAR deformation monitoring schemes are proposed, including a full-resolution interferogram method, a "remove-restore" phase unwrapping method, and a fusion of phase and <b>offset</b> <b>measurements.</b> Then, taking the Datong coalfield as an example, we demonstrate the capabilities of these methods on mapping large-gradient deformation.

The method proposed here enables a precise measurement of the offset while the ADC operates and introduces a minimum disturb to the output result.

The resulting spread spectrum can be easily distinguished by the dc offset and reconstructed in the digital domain with a synchronous demodulation. The use of a digital accumulator extracts the offset. The accumulation time can be many clock periods (like 106) thus permitting an excellent accuracy in the <b>offset</b> <b>measurement.</b> Simulations of the proposed approach at the behavioral level confirm the effectiveness of the method.

A measurement-disturbance-observer (MDO) -based approach is taken as one pos-sible solution for eliminating the dc offset and the additional negative-sequence component due to unbalanced current mea-surement gains in the synchronous coordinate. From the motor parameter sensitivity analysis, an MDO gain selection method is proposed to remove the estimation error resulting from a parame-ter mismatch. At the same time, the positive-sequence component estimation is performed by creating an error signal between a motor model reference and an estimated q-axis rotor flux estab-lished by a permanent magnet in the synchronous coordinate. The compensator utilizes a PI controller that controls the error signal to zero.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Restoration of hip offset (HO), which {{incorporates}} both acetabular (AO) and femoral offset (FO), determines abductor muscle {{function and}} {{is essential to}} prevent adverse outcomes such as impingement, dislocation and wear after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Accurate and reliable assessment of femoral and acetabular offset in preoperative planning is crucial as it suggests appropriate design, size and positioning of prosthetic components. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of native femoral and acetabular <b>offset</b> <b>measurements</b> performed on conventional radiographs with reference to three-dimensional measurements performed on computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with primary end-stage hip osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, pre-operative anterior-posterior (AP) hip radiographs, AP pelvis radiographs and CT scans of a consecutive series of 131 patients (57 males, 74 females, mean age 60 (range: 42 - 79) years, mean body-mass-index (BMI) 27 (range: 19 - 45) kg/m²) with primary end-stage hip OA were measured. To achieve reproducible radiographic projection, patients were positioned according to a standardized protocol and all images were calibrated. Using validated software programs, FO and AO were measured on corresponding radiographs and on CT scans. Interand intra-observer reliability was evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Distributions of <b>offset</b> <b>measurements</b> on corresponding images were compared using paired-samples t-tests. Measurement agreement between corresponding radiographic images and CT was assessed using Pearson’s coefficient of correlation (r) and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: ICCs demonstrated a high inter- and intra-observer reliability for all measured parameters (ICC-range: 0. 89 - 0. 99). In the entire cohort, AP pelvis based FO (40. 1 mm, 95 %CI: 38. 9 - 41. 2 mm) was significantly underestimated compared to CT based FO (45. 3 mm, 95 %CI: 44. 3 - 46. 2 mm, p< 0. 001). There was no difference in mean FO between AP hip radiographs (44. 9 mm, 95 %CI: 43. 8 - 46. 1 mm) and CT scans (p= 0. 431). No difference in acetabular <b>offset</b> <b>measurements</b> was seen on corresponding AP pelvis radiographs (34. 1 mm, 95 %CI: 33. 0 - 35. 3 mm) and CT scans (33. 7 mm, 95 %CI: 32. 9 - 34. 6 mm, p= 0. 329). We observed good agreement between FO measurements on AP hip radiographs and CT (r= 0. 71, p< 0. 001), and AO measurements on AP pelvis radiographs and CT (r= 0. 62, p< 0. 001), respectively. CONCLUSION: Native hip offset of patients with primary end-stage hip osteoarthritis can be accurately and reliably determined on conventional radiographs when assessing femoral offset on AP hip views and acetabular offset on AP pelvis views, respectively. The present findings support the surgeon in pre-operative templating and may improve individual restoration of hip offset in THA without the routine performance of CT.
