[...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there."

500|$|Revolutions spread {{throughout}} Europe in 1848 {{as the result}} of a widespread economic crisis. Throughout the year, Victoria and Albert complained about Foreign Secretary Palmerston's independent foreign policy, which they believed destabilised foreign European powers further. Albert was concerned for many of his royal relatives, a number of whom were deposed. He and Victoria, who gave birth to their daughter Louise during that year, spent some time away from London in the relative safety of Osborne. Although there were sporadic demonstrations in England, no effective revolutionary action took place, and Albert even gained public acclaim when he expressed paternalistic, yet well-meaning and philanthropic, views. In a speech to the Society for the Improvement of the Condition of the Labouring Classes, of which he was President, he expressed his [...] "sympathy and interest for that class of <b>our</b> <b>community</b> who have most of the toil and fewest of the enjoyments of this world".

[...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. <b>Our</b> <b>community</b> is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America.
