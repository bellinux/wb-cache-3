5|$|Albinism was <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) {{along the}} {{coastline}} {{of the southern}} Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism was <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> those areas where the density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|E
5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the lab, but no difference <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E

Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the wild.
