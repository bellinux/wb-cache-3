5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, can result in very {{complicated}} and long lasting waveforms on the cable. Even a simple <b>overvoltage</b> pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the initial}} {{analysis}} is correct, {{there is another}} effect that can happen, known as the <b>overvoltage</b> effect. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the EÂ°cell. This {{may be due to}} kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in kinetic terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, <b>overvoltage).</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical solution and computer simulations of switching transient <b>overvoltages</b> during the disconnection of shunt reactors. The interruption of reactor current provokes excessive <b>overvoltages</b> particularly across the reactor and the circuit breaker grading capacitor. The magnitude of these <b>overvoltages</b> may exceed 2 p. u. which, consequently, may jeopardise the insulation of the reactor and accelerate the ageing of circuit breaker grading capacitors. In this work, the transient <b>overvoltages</b> were computed using ATP/EMTP simulations and analytical {{solution of the}} equivalent circuit during switching. For different switching times the distribution of <b>overvoltages</b> {{and the influence of}} switching angle is presented...|$|R

This switching can cause harmonic <b>overvoltages</b> that might damage some equipment and delay power system restoration. Core saturation on the energisation of a transformer with residual flux is a noticeable factor in harmonic <b>overvoltages.</b> This work uses artificial neural networks (ANN) in order to estimate the temporary <b>overvoltages</b> (TOVs) due to transformer energisation.

40|$|Increased {{penetration}} of solar photovoltaic (PV) can cause significant <b>overvoltages</b> during faults and back-fed fault current into grid while causing miss-operation of protective relaying. Transient data from four single-phase PV inverters was collected during both open-circuit and short circuit transient events.

Test program designs are presented to cover a range of inverter operating conditions and grid configurations. The data was used to plot the <b>overvoltages</b> and overcurrents associated with the transient events.

The investigation emphasizes <b>overvoltages</b> generated at a remote, radially fed transformer terminal, rather than the <b>overvoltages</b> produced at the local substation bus.

40|$|Abstract â This paper {{deals with}} the {{computation}} of switching <b>overvoltages</b> in a 400 -kV XLPE cable system {{that has been in}} service for several years. A joint failure in that cable system and recorded voltage and current wave-forms by the protective equipment that showed significant temporary <b>overvoltages</b> in another cable route have been the reason to analyze the switching surges in this EHV cable with shunt compensation. The cable model set up has been verified by comparison of field measurements and the digital simulations at first step. The switching surges that have been analyzed are 1) the energization, 2) deener-gization and 3) energization and subsequent deenergiza-tion of the 400 -kV cable with the line-side shunt reactor. The <b>overvoltages</b> in the cable have been determined statis-tically by changing circuit-breaker pole closing times according to a distribution function in a statistical manner. It has been shown that in the latter case, 3), critical low-frequency <b>overvoltages</b> may occur, if the already energized cable will be switched off immediately by the malfunction of the protective equipment.
