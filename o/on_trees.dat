5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds, brown above and white below. They have thin, down-pointed, curved bills, which {{they use to}} extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which they use to support themselves vertically <b>on</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} {{arboreal}} land snails. Further {{information concerning the}} habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails have generally been collected while they were crawling <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> or shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E
5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them <b>on</b> <b>trees.</b> These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E

5|$|Despite its slow {{metabolism}} rate, the Sunda slow loris has a high-energy diet. Its slow lifestyle {{may be due}} to {{the energy}} costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants their diets. The largest amount of time is spent eating phloem sap (34.9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing plant parts (31.7%), and fruits (22.5%). It also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects. Gum is taken by licking wounds <b>on</b> <b>trees.</b> They are also known to feed on molluscs, including the giant land snail Achatina fulica, and birds' eggs.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{tales of}} vetalas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, {{are found in}} old Sanskrit folklore. Although most vetala legends have been {{compiled}} in the Baital Pachisi, a prominent story in the Kathasaritsagara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. The vetala is described as an undead creature who, like the bat associated with modern-day vampirism, hangs upside down <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> found on cremation grounds and cemeteries. Pishacha, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing <b>on</b> <b>trees,</b> ferns, and bushes.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between epiphytes and host specifity are known. We investigated {{the relation between}} specific epiphytes and tree fern trunks. Only some epiphytes are frequent or very frequent <b>on</b> <b>tree</b> ferns. Most of the epiphyte species are unspecific on these trunks. Blechnum fragile are the only found exclusively <b>on</b> <b>tree</b> ferns. We also observed different epiphyte communities dependent <b>on</b> the <b>tree</b> fern species and the morphology of the tree trunk...|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found <b>on</b> <b>trees,</b> it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E
5|$|The adult russet sparrow {{is mostly}} a seed-eater, eating the seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, {{such as those of}} the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.|$|E
5|$|The colonies {{are found}} in rotten wood, in the ground, under rocks or stones and in urban areas. The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage <b>on</b> <b>trees,</b> in low {{vegetation}} and into human homes, where they are regarded as pests. These ants eat a variety of foods, including fruits, insects, sucrose, nectar and bird feces. They visit various flowers and attend {{to a variety of}} butterfly larvae. The thorny devil, an Australian lizard, predominantly feeds on Ochetellus workers, and other ant species also prey on them.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions, inhabiting eucalypt woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do not build mounds. Workers are active during the day and night, foraging <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects that workers capture. Nuptial flight occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to their parent nest. Queens tend to look for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. They mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with man when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests <b>on</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E
5|$|Queens {{mate with}} a single male and colonies may {{have more than one}} queen until the workers arrive, where they both exhibit antagonism. It takes around one or two months for an {{individual}} egg to develop into an adult. Colonies range in size, varying between 11,000 individuals to over 300,000. The meat ant is a diurnal species (active throughout most of the day), especially when it is warm. It forages <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> and collect sweet substances such as honeydew and nectar, and also capture insects or collect the remains of animals. A number of predators eat these ants, including the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), numerous species of birds, blindsnakes and spiders. This species is also a competitor of the banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus). Meat ants establish territorial borders with neighbouring colonies and solve disputes through ritualised fighting.|$|E
5|$|The Man-of-War (as it {{is called}} by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees its prey, it flys down head {{foremost}} to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds <b>on</b> <b>Trees,</b> where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} land related taxes, there were other taxes, such as Garden tax from {{compounds}} where, among others, plantain, coconut and arecanut palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well. Tree tax <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> such as palmyrah, margosa and iluppai and Poll tax equivalent to a personal tax from each. Professional tax was collected from members of each caste or guild and commercial taxes consisting of, among others, stamp duty on clothes (clothes could not be sold privately and had to have official stamp), Taraku or levy on items of food, and Port and customs duties. Columbuthurai, which connected the Peninsula with the mainland at Poonakari with its boat services, {{was one of the}} chief port, and there were customs check posts at the sand passes of Pachilaippalai. Elephants from the southern Sinhalese kingdoms and the Vanni region were brought to Jaffna to be sold to foreign buyers. They were shipped abroad from a bay called Urukathurai, which is now called Kayts—a shortened form of Portuguese Caes dos elephantess (Bay of Elephants). Perhaps a peculiarity of Jaffna was the levy of license fee for the cremation of the dead.|$|E
5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} breeds across Europe and Asia east {{to eastern}} Siberia and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, {{but it is}} one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5metres (16ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the willow warbler (P. trochilus) prefers younger trees, while the wood warbler (P. sibilatrix) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent <b>on</b> <b>trees.</b> It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis, so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos are dependent <b>on</b> <b>trees</b> for nesting and {{are vulnerable to}} their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E
