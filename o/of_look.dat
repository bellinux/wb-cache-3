He {{was elected president of}} the Michigan Alpha chapter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity whose membership included a number of his teammates and prominent University of Michigan athletic alumni such as Tom Harmon, Bob Ufer, and Harry Kipke. Chappuis appeared {{on the cover of the}} October 28, 1947 issue <b>of</b> <b>Look</b> magazine which featured pictures of him on the football field and at the fraternity house. In the magazine, Chappuis and his future wife were also featured about the Michigan campus. He expressed an interest in first playing professional football for a few years before going into the porcelain business with his father.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{achieved}} {{another breakthrough}} in 1987, {{when she had}} leading roles in two television miniseries: Fortunes of War, a World War II drama co-starring Kenneth Branagh, and Tutti Frutti, a dark-comedy about a Scottish rock band with Robbie Coltrane. For these performances, Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. The following year, she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC, Thompson, but this was poorly received. In 1989, she and Branagh—who had formed a romantic relationship—starred in a stage revival <b>of</b> <b>Look</b> Back in Anger, directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company. Later that year, the pair starred in a televised version of the play.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the early}} {{problems}} for the Unit was the difficulty in sourcing film stock. At the time, the only wildlife cameramen were amateurs, and the footage wasn't always good enough for broadcast.

Some of Scott's own expedition films were used for early episodes <b>of</b> <b>Look.</b> One particularly outstanding film from 1955, shot by Heinz Sielmann, showed woodpeckers inside a nest hole.|$|E

25|$|While the {{enforcement}} in theory {{could lead to}} a Big Brother-style surveillance society, in practice social convention among the Minds prohibits them from watching, or interfering in, citizens' lives unless requested, or unless they perceive severe risk. The practice of reading a sentient's mind without permission (something the Culture is technologically easily capable of) is also strictly taboo. The whole plot <b>of</b> <b>Look</b> to Windward relies on a Hub Mind not reading an agent's mind (with certain precautions in case this rule gets violated). Minds that do so anyway are considered deviant and shunned by other Minds (see GCU Grey Area). At one point it is said that if the Culture actually had written laws, the sanctity of one's own thoughts against the intrusion of others would be the first on the books (Look To Windward).|$|E

Henrik Fett, the visual effects supervisor <b>of</b> <b>Look</b> Effects, said, [...] "Darren was quite clear on what he wanted and his intent to greatly minimize the use of computer graphics...

Aronofsky filmed both works with a muted palette and a grainy style. Part of this consistent style involves collaborations with frequent partners cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Andrew Weisblum and composer Clint Mansell. Mansell's music is an often important element of the films.|$|E

500|$|Stardust {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most publications, both on its original release {{and for its}} various reissues.

And that's the way Nelson plays them—spare and simple, with a jump band's verve and a storyteller's love of a good tale. By offering these songs, he's displaying the tools of a journeyman musician's trade—worn smooth and polished by constant use—and when he lays them out this way, they kind <b>of</b> <b>look</b> like works of art. Willie Nelson may be acknowledging both his own and country music's debt to Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, but he's also showing these hallowed musical institutions how the country makes their music its own".|$|E

500|$|When {{the third}} single from Look Sharp!, [...] "The Look," [...] became another top 10 single {{in their home}} country, Roxette were still unknown internationally. It was while {{studying}} in Sweden that an American exchange student from Minneapolis, Dean Cushman, heard [...] "The Look" [...] and brought a copy <b>of</b> <b>Look</b> Sharp! home for the 1988 holiday break. He gave the album to a Minneapolis radio station, KDWB 101.3 FM. The station started playing [...] "The Look" [...] and based on positive caller feedback, the song became very popular, quickly spreading to other radio stations. The song became a radio hit before any Roxette product had been commercially released or promoted in the US market. The story was covered by radio, newspapers and TV in the US and in Sweden, with Gessle recently telling this as the story which highlighted {{the beginning of their}} international success.

They lived {{together in a}} small apartment at 36 West 16th Street, off 6th Avenue just north of Greenwich Village. During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the Museum of Modern Art and the cinemas of New York City. He {{was inspired by the}} complex, fluid camerawork of the director Max Ophüls, whose films influenced Kubrick's later visual style, and by the director Elia Kazan, whom he described as America's [...] "best director" [...] at that time, with his ability of [...] "performing miracles" [...] with his actors. Friends began to notice that Kubrick had become obsessed with the art of filmmaking—one friend, David Vaughn, observed that Kubrick would scrutinize the film at the cinema when it went silent, and would go back to reading his paper when people started talking. He also spent many hours reading books on film theory and writing down notes. Sergei Eisenstein's theoretical writings {{had a profound impact on}} Kubrick, and he took a great number of notes from books in the library of Arthur Rothstein, the photographic technical director <b>of</b> <b>Look</b> magazine.|$|E
500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind <b>of</b> <b>look</b> back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|From 1998 to 1999, Sheen starred as Mozart in a {{successful}} revival of Amadeus.

Ben Brantley, chief theatre critic for The New York Times, was particularly vocal in his praise. He noted that [...] "Mr. Sheen elicits a real poetry from the role" [...] and felt that, while watching him, [...] "you start to appreciate the derivation of the term star. This actor is so luminous it's scary!" [...] The Independent found him [...] "quite stunning as Mozart. His fantastically physical performance convinces you of his character's genius and the play catches fire whenever he's on stage." [...] Sheen {{was nominated for a}} Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance and an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actor. In 1999, Sheen explored the role of Jimmy Porter in the National Theatre's production <b>of</b> <b>Look</b> Back in Anger. In 2003, Sheen described the production as [...] "the most enjoyable thing I've ever done ... everything came together". The Daily Mail declared him a [...] "definitive Jimmy Porter... simply exhilarating in his great jazz riffs of speeches, mercurial and irresistible." [...] "Sheen has cornered the market in explosive energy", said The Independent, [...] "but this thrilling performance is his finest yet." [...] The Financial Times noted: [...] "As Jimmy Porter, a role of staggering difficulty in every way, Michael Sheen gives surely the best performance London has yet seen from him ... You hang on every word he utters ... This is a dazzlingly through-the-body performance." [...] He was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and an Evening Standard Award for Best Actor.|$|E
