40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere {{has been a}} tremendous growth in the <b>open-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> industry in current years. Its total net assets currently approximate $ 30 billion, and its activities account for nearly six percent of the overall trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The management {{of the companies that}} constitute this industry is therefore a subject which should be of considerable interest to the three million people who are shareholders in these companies. This subject is investigated by concentrating on four primary areas of interest: (1) management and supervision of the investment company portfolio by the investment company adviser, (2) the relationship of investment company size to the management fee paid the investment adviser, (3) the relationship of investment company size to the operating expenses of the company (exclusive of management fees) and, (4) the relationship of investment company performance to the management fee paid the investment adviser. Correlation analyses are performed to determine these relationships, utilizing data from current prospectuses and annual reports of representative samples of the companies now in existence. These samples are selected through statistical techniques, and conclusions drawn {{on the basis of these}} analyses. The investment company shareholder's recent realization of the inequities in management fee rates, which were discovered by this study, are noted.

40|$|An {{estimate}} of the potential value of using past performance data {{in the selection of}} mutual funds is presented. Empirical results are based on historical returns and information that is readily available in popular press sources. The payoff from obtaining and evaluating past performance data prior to selecting and investing in mutual funds was found to be positive, and in many cases substantial. KEY WORDS: past performance data, mutual fund selection. The first <b>open-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> (mutual fund) in America was formed in 1924. In 1980, the number of mutual funds had grown to 564 (Investment Company Institute, 1987). By 1991, over 3, 200 were in existence (phone call, Investment Company Institute, June 1991). This "explosion " in the number of mutual funds in recent years has had a profound impact upon the financial services sector in several important ways. First, investors now have a wider variety of mutual funds from which to choose 1. Secondly, increased competition within the mutual fund industry has prompted many companies to enhance and upgrade shareholder services. Lastly, growth in the mutual fund industry has facilitated the entrance of smaller-scale investors into the securities investment market. In short, growth has had positive effects on the mutual fund industry. However, {{growth in the number of}} mutual funds has brought challenges. A primary challenge is evaluating and selecting an appropriate fund from among so many. This problem has been recognized, insomuch that there are now numerous sources of mutual fund performance data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of expected inflation on the general level of common stock prices using a structural rather than a reduced-form approach. To this end, an aggregative partial-equilibrium structural econometric model of the U. S. equity market is constructed using quarterly flow-of-funds data. The primary endogenous variable in this model is the Standard and Poor's Index of 500 Common Stock Prices, P. After passing several standard validation exercises he model is used to perform a number of simulation experiments designed o assess the impact of expected inflation on P. To anticipate, we find that increases in expected inflation depress current equity prices by bout the same amount as found in a related study of Modigliani and Cohn: a l 00 basis point increase in expected inflation, holding real interest rates constant, is predicted to lower the general level of equity prices by 7. 8 %. In the course of constructing the structural equity market model equity demand equations are estimated for households, life insurance <b>companies,</b> <b>open-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>companies,</b> property and casualty insurance companies, and state and local government retirement systems.

Assets under management in the mutual fund industry in United States surpassed $ 12. 068 trillion {{by the end of}} April 2008. Mutual funds performance {{is one of the most}} frequently studied topics in investment area in most countries. The reason for this popularity is availability of data and the importance of mutual funds as vehicles for investment in stock market for both individual and institutions. Since mutual funds have become popular the research has also started to include the ways of finding the right mutual funds. Although the price shares and the income from them may go down as well as up but choosing the right mutual funds can have considerable effects on investors ending wealth. The thesis examines the past performance of mutual funds as a criterion for investors' future choices. In particular, it examines if mutual funds which invested in the Swedish stock market. Swedish funds assets have passed the trillion kronor mark in March 2005, and it is rapidly increasing. We started our analysis by the funds attributes influenced the returns. In our study hypotheses are the fund characteristics i. e. popularity growth cost and management variables are included. These attributes are most frequently used by finance academies to simple and multiple regression analysis is used to test these hypotheses. We do not find any strong evidence that the past performance is a guide to future performance. As most of the results studies, our results may be subject to survivorship bias, because we have included only 33 funds in our sample during the last eight years 2000 - 2007. Mostly data is collected from Morningstar Sweden, the Swedish Investment fund association and secondary data from some of the mutual funds annual reports. We analyze the data for last eight years from 2000 - 01 - 01 to 2007 - 12 - 31 and the funds which are invested mostly in Swedish securities. Before and during our thesis different research studies and financial articles were studied relevant to our research thesis. Our research study results shows that the attributes which have some impact on mutual funds returns are risk, fund size, age, fund turnover and management tenure. The results indicate that the hypothesized relationship between mutual funds performance and the explanatory variables are generally upheld.
