5|$|In 1951, Poldek Pfefferberg {{approached}} director Fritz Lang {{and asked}} him to consider making a film about Schindler. Also on Pfefferberg's initiative, in 1964 Schindler received a $20,000 advance from MGM for a proposed film treatment titled To the Last Hour. Neither film was ever made, and Schindler quickly spent the money he received from MGM. He was also approached in the 1960s by MCA of Germany and Walt Disney Productions in Vienna, but again nothing came <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|E
5|$|In recent years, many {{traditional}} houses are being reconstructed and owners lured to come back, thus revitalizing tourism {{as a potential}} revenue source for the local economy. However, some houses continue to degrade from lack of investment, abandonment or inappropriate renovations as local craftsmen are not part <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{silicon carbide}} was studied in several {{research}} programs for high-temperature gas turbines in Europe, Japan and the United States. The components {{were intended to}} replace nickel superalloy turbine blades or nozzle vanes. However, none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> {{were focused}} in Brussels, where he {{constructed}} two large palaces, and Ostende, where a vast colonnaded arcade was built along the seafront {{in an attempt}} to turn the town into a fashionable seaside resort. During Leopold's reign, Belgium hosted five prestigious World Exhibitions, in 1885, 1888, 1894, 1897 and 1905, as well as a major national exhibition in 1880 to mark the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} designs <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> {{have reflected}} {{not only the}} style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a network}} of {{libraries}} with three national libraries, 689 public libraries, 143 higher education libraries and 11 non-specialised libraries as at 1998. The National Library of Serbia {{is the most significant}} <b>of</b> <b>these.</b> <b>Project</b> Rastko founded in 1997 is an Internet library of Serb culture.|$|R
40|$|The Anglican Church and the Danish Missionary Society (DMS) were {{involved}} in aid activities for the Sudanese who fled {{the civil war in}} Sudan, 1992.

5|$|As {{head of the}} Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps in 1941, Somervell {{took charge}} of the {{construction}} of a series of camps to house the large numbers of draftees who entering into the Army. Once again, Somervell was able to deliver vital projects on time. The most enduring <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> was the Pentagon, which is today one of the most recognizable buildings in the world. From 1942 to 1945, Somervell commanded the Army Service Forces, the logistical arm of the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|In {{a partial}} {{reaction}} against the Manzoni years, Birmingham City Council is demolishing {{some of the}} brutalist buildings like the Central Library and has an extensive tower block demolition and renovation programme. There has been much redevelopment in the city centre in recent years, including the award-winning Future Systems' Selfridges building in the Bullring Shopping Centre, the Brindleyplace regeneration project, the Millennium Point science and technology centre, and the refurbishment of the iconic Rotunda building. Funding for many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> {{has come from the}} European Union; the Town Hall for example received £3million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund.|$|E
5|$|Like most US {{diplomatic}} {{posts in}} Africa during the Cold War, a {{primary purpose of}} the embassy was to counter Soviet influence in the region and contain the spread of communism. For a time after the Sino-Soviet split, China was also actively competing for influence in the developing world, including activities in Somalia. Beginning in the 1960s, the US engaged in development projects in Somalia to counter the influence of communism. Staff from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which carried out most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects,</b> comprised a substantial number of the embassy's staff during the next three decades. Educational programs were also given emphasis by the embassy in the years after independence, and there was a sizable Peace Corps presence.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{industries}} use variations <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>project</b> {{stages and}} {{it is not uncommon for}} the stages to be renamed in order to better suit the organization. For example, when working on a brick-and-mortar design and construction, projects will typically progress through stages like pre-planning, conceptual design, schematic design, design development, construction drawings (or contract documents), and construction administration.|$|R
5|$|Steamboats {{operated}} {{briefly on}} the large lakes of the upper basin, contributing {{to the growth of}} towns such as Klamath Falls, Oregon, before they were replaced by railroads in the late 19thcentury. In the 19th and 20thcenturies, the upper basin became a productive agricultural region, and many dams were built to provide irrigation and hydroelectricity. In the 1960s, the Klamath River was targeted by much larger, but ultimately unsuccessful schemes to augment water supplies in other parts of California. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects,</b> the Klamath Diversion, would have reversed the entire flow of the Klamath River to supply farms and urban areas in central and southern California.|$|E
5|$|The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has {{identified}} the NY146 corridor from Riverview Road to Glen Ridge Road as {{in need of}} future improvements. Intersection improvements are scheduled at the NY146/ Aqueduct Road/ Williams Road and NY146/ Riverview Road intersections. This {{part of the project}} will be built in 2008 and is to include new turn lanes at each intersection. To the south, the Rexford Bridge over the Mohawk River and the surrounding roadway will be improved in stages, with completion expected by 2017. The objective <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> is to improve highway capacity and safety along the corridor.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects,</b> IPF {{has been doing}} {{revegetation}} projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s {{as part of an}} abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E

40|$|For Software Applications, the 1990 s was characterised by the {{implementation}} of ERP systems across Multinational organizations. This paper studies some of the lessons learned, {{from the viewpoint of}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>Project</b> implementations on the Organization, the Workplace and the Individuals. A clearer understanding of the human and organizational factors provides a blueprint for a higher success level in <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> in the future, and the leverage effect for continuous improvement for those who use ERP solutions today...|$|R
50|$|The {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> pilot <b>projects</b> commenced in late 2005, {{and they}} were all concluded in 2007 or 2008.|$|R
5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E
5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the royal family were {{similarly}} involved. Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), was commissioned in the Royal Navy and saw action as a turret officer aboard HMS Collingwood at the battle of Jutland but saw no further action in the war, largely because of ill health. Princess Mary, the King's only daughter, visited hospitals and welfare organisations with her mother, assisting with projects to give comfort to British servicemen and assistance to their families. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> was Princess Mary's Christmas Gift Fund, through which £162,000 worth of gifts was sent to all British soldiers and sailors for Christmas 1914. She took an active role in promoting the Girl Guide movement, the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), the Land Girls and in 1918, she took a nursing course and went to work at Great Ormond Street Hospital.|$|E

5|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{combines}} NASA's Space Station Freedom {{project with}} the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module. NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints {{led to the}} merger <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles. It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, {{the completion of the}} US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} was over, the brigade {{was supposed to}} support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for {{the invasion}}, the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs {{they had not been}} originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation's power grid. It was determined that the scale <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion was a difficult process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale. As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.|$|E
