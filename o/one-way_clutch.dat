50|$|If {{they are}} joined at an axis (in parallel), the speeds at this axis must be {{identical}} and the supplied torques add together. (Most electric bicycles are of this type.)

50|$|Most {{of these}} cars are {{otherwise}} free-rolling. Winding them up {{requires them to}} be pushed downwards, engaging the clutch. As the motor is only engaged for winding whilst held down, the complete winding must be completed in one pass, unlike the flywheel motor.

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} control system consists of a valve arrangement and an engine driven pump. The automatic transmission contains a planetary gear set consisting of two sun gears, two sets of three planet pinions contained within a planetary carrier and ring gear. Various speed ratios are obtained by holding or clutching various combinations of elements of the planetary train. This is performed by two bands, two multi-disc clutches and a <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|A torque {{converter}} cannot achieve 100 percent coupling efficiency. The classic three element {{torque converter}} has an efficiency curve that resembles ∩: zero efficiency at stall, generally increasing efficiency during the acceleration phase and low efficiency in the coupling phase. The loss of efficiency as the converter enters the coupling phase {{is a result}} of the turbulence and fluid flow interference generated by the stator, and as previously mentioned, is commonly overcome by mounting the stator on a <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E

The framework of measure differential inclusions allows us to describe systems with state discontinuities.

5000|$|The key {{characteristic}} of a torque converter {{is its ability to}} multiply torque when the output rotational speed is so low that it allows the fluid coming off the curved vanes of the turbine to be deflected off the stator while it is locked against its <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> thus providing the equivalent of a reduction gear. This is a feature beyond that of the simple fluid coupling, which can match rotational speed but does not multiply torque, thus reduces power.|$|E
50|$|In anti-reverse reels, a {{mechanism}} allows line {{to pay out}} while the handle remains stationary. Depending on the drag setting, line may also pay out, as with a running fish, while the angler reels in. Bait casting reels and many modern saltwater fly reels are examples of this design.The mechanism works either with a 'dog' or 'pawl' design that engages into a cog wheel attached to the handle shaft. The latest design is Instant Anti-Reverse, or IAR. This system incorporates a <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> bearing or centrifugal force fly wheel on the handle shaft to restrict handle movement to forward motion only.|$|E
50|$|During {{the stall}} and {{acceleration}} phases, in which torque multiplication occurs, the stator remains stationary {{due to the}} action of its <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b> However, as the torque converter approaches the coupling phase, the energy and volume of the fluid returning from the turbine will gradually decrease, causing pressure on the stator to likewise decrease. Once in the coupling phase, the returning fluid will reverse direction and now rotate {{in the direction of}} the impeller and turbine, an effect which will attempt to forward-rotate the stator. At this point, the stator clutch will release and the impeller, turbine and stator will all (more or less) turn as a unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{had four}} main engines. Each engine {{was connected to}} the gearbox via a hydraulic coupling, which could be filled with oil to transmit power or drained of oil to disconnect that engine from the transmission. <b>One-way</b> <b>clutches</b> prevented rotation of the input shafts when the couplings were drained. The engine outputs were combined in pairs by two sets of differential gearing, and the output shafts from these two gearsets were then combined by a third differential gearset to drive the main output shaft.|$|R
50|$|The 6L80 (and similar 6L90) is a {{six-speed}} {{automatic transmission}} built by General Motors at its Willow Run Transmission plant in Ypsilanti, MI. It {{was introduced in}} late 2005, and is very similar in design to the smaller 6L45/6L50, produced at GM Powertrain in Strasbourg, France. It features clutch to clutch shifting, eliminating the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches</b> used on older transmission designs.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{load capacity}} and durability of the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches</b> with simultaneous reduction of mass-dimensional characteristics is largely governed by improving the calculation {{procedures of the}} stress-strain state of their basic elements. Best operating practices of roller <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches</b> in drive machines show that the outer shell {{is one of the}} most loaded elements that has an impact on the working capacity of clutches as a whole. Although, when working in the drive machine, the outer shell destruction may occur quite often, its stress-strain state is, usually, calculated by the approximate and simplified formulas to calculate the rings of the simple shape with the uniform stress distribution over the cross-sections. To study and define the impact nature of the geometrical parameters of the outer shell on its arising stress and strain, solid-state computer simulation and calculation has been performed in the national T-FLEX CAD software complex by the finite element method. The article proposes to use the influence coefficients to estimate an extent of the impact of different geometrical parameters. During the computational experiment, the geometric parameters were varied in ranges corresponding to the main dimension types of the clutches used in drive machines: the inner diameter of the shell – = 40 - 240 мм; the number of block rollers - = 3 - 5; the relative thickness of the shell – = 0, 06 - 0, 14; the relative thickness of the plate – = 0, 04 - 0, 12; relative to the length of the shell = 0, 20 - 0, 50. It has been found that with changing shell thickness the values of arising stresses and strains decrease, respectively, 2. 05 and 2. 19 times more than with changing plate thickness. Processing of results of computational experiments allowed us to obtain the empirical formulas to calculate a stress-strain state in any combination and in a wide range of changing geometrical parameters of the outer shell. The proposed procedure allows us to raise the reliability and computational accuracy of the stress-strain state of the outer shell of the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches.</b> </p...|$|R
50|$|When a skid developed, {{the wheel}} would stop, {{stopping}} the drum along with it. The flywheel, {{driven by the}} <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> continued to spin. If the relative angle between the drum and flywheel reached 60 degrees, the drum would be driven forward to press on a valve. This released brake fluid into a reservoir, lowering hydraulic pressure, and releasing the brakes. As soon as the drum started spinning again and reached the (slowing) speed of the flywheel, the valve was released and the brakes re-applied. The system could cycle about ten times a second, and could hold the brakes off for up to four seconds in total before the reservoir filled.|$|E
5000|$|The Maxaret {{system had}} four main parts, {{all of which}} weighed only 4.7 pounds and fit within the small {{confines}} of a main landing gear wheel. The system was entirely mechanical, and worked by measuring the relative speed of two spinning disks. The first, the [...] "drum", {{was surrounded by a}} rubber disk and arranged within the aircraft wheel's internal periphery, so that the rubber maintained strong mechanical contact with the wheel. The second, a flywheel, was attached to the drum with a <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b> Normally, with the wheel turning, the wheel would spin the drum, which would spin the flywheel, so that all of the moving parts were spinning at the same speed.|$|E
40|$|A four-degree-of-freedom {{nonlinear}} transverse and {{torsional vibration}} model of spur {{gear transmission system}} for <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> two-shaft assembly was developed, in which the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> was modeled as a piecewise nonlinear spring with discontinuous stiffness, considering the {{factors such as the}} time-varying gear mesh stiffness, static transmission error, and nonlinearity backlash.

Numerical results reveal that the system response involves period- 1 motion, multiperiodic motion, bifurcation, and chaotic motion.

5000|$|The {{ratcheting}} CVT is {{a transmission}} {{that relies on}} static friction {{and is based on}} a set of elements that successively become engaged and then disengaged between the driving system and the driven system, often using oscillating or indexing motion in conjunction with <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches</b> or ratchets that rectify and sum only [...] "forward" [...] motion. The transmission ratio is adjusted by changing linkage geometry within the oscillating elements, so that the summed maximum linkage speed is adjusted, even when the average linkage speed remains constant. Power is transferred from input to output only when the clutch or ratchet is engaged, and therefore when it is locked into a static friction mode where the driving & driven rotating surfaces momentarily rotate together without slippage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} this {{arrangement}} was that the gear ratio between an engine and the output shaft depended on how many engines were driving the transmission. Gear ratio selection was accomplished not by [...] "changing gear" [...] in the conventional sense, but by filling or draining the hydraulic couplings to connect or disconnect the engines from the transmission. With only one hydraulic coupling filled with oil {{and the other three}} engines disconnected and their respective input shafts to the transmission locked by the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches,</b> the single engine drove the output shaft through an effective gear ratio of 4:1. With two engines driving, the effective gear ratio was 2:1; with three engines, 1.33:1; and with all four engines, unity. In other words, the effective gear ratio of the transmission was the inverse of the number of engines driving it.|$|R
30|$|Since the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> has maximum transmittable torque, the transmittable torque of {{the outer}} shaft is limited by torque {{capacity}} of the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b> However walking robots normally require high torque in one direction that gravity works, we deploy wire driven mechanism as the core shaft supports {{the direction of the}} gravity force.|$|E
30|$|The {{problem of}} using the wire driven {{mechanism}} is an elongation of a wire, which decreases mechanical bandwidth. Therefore {{to be able to}} adjust wire tension easily a co-axial tensioner shaft shown in Fig. 13 was devised as the input pulley. The co-axial tensioner shaft has a dual structure made up of a core shaft which passes {{through the center of the}} input axis pulley, and an outer shaft which covers the lower half. Each shaft is connected with a compact roller type <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> (NTN: HF 0612, torque capacity 1.76  Nm). Due to the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> the two shafts turn relative to each other only in the direction which increases wire tension, and thus it is possible to adjust tension of the wire by rotating one of the shafts. The wire which is wound to the core shaft transmit power directly to the motor, but the wire wound to the outer shaft transmit power via <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E

An intermittent motion device is respectively coupled through the first member to the housing and through a <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> to the shaft. The brake also has a second member that is mechanically coupled to the first brake member and to the housing. The intermittent motion device causes the brake to be activated by movement imparted to the first brake member after a preset number of revolutions of the shaft in one direction. The brake is released by rotation of the shaft in an opposite direction whereby torque transmitted through the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> to the first brake member is removed...|$|E
5000|$|Turbo-Hydramatic 425 (and later 325) was an {{automatic}} transmission developed and produced by General Motors. The THM425 was a derivative of the THM400; most parts directly interchange {{and some others}} will interchange with minor modifications. The internal parts spin the opposite direction in the THM425; the helical angle of the planetary gears is [...] "reversed" [...] and the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches</b> freewheel in the opposite direction, for example. The THM425 was developed for the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado and the 1967 Cadillac Eldorado. A lighter-duty transmission known as the THM325 replaced the THM425 in both car lines after the 1978 model year. 1979 and later longitudinal engine front-wheel drive vehicles used the THM325. The THM325 became the THM325-4L with an overdrive added in 1982, but all vehicles using this transmission switched to more-conventional transverse engine mounting in 1986.|$|R

40|$|The human-powered {{self-generator}} {{provides the}} best solution for individuals who need an instantaneous power supply for travel, outdoor, and emergency use, since it is less dependent on weather conditions and occupies less space than other renewable power supplies. However, many commercial portable self-generators that employ hand-cranking are not used as much as expected in daily lives although they have enough output capacity due to their intensive workload. This study proposes a portable human-powered generator {{which is designed to}} obtain mechanical energy from an upper limb pulling motion for improved human motion economy as well as efficient human-mechanical power transfer. A coreless axial-flux permanent magnet machine (APMM) and a flywheel magnet rotor were used in conjunction with a <b>one-way</b> <b>clutched</b> power transmission system in order to obtain effective power from the pulling motion.
