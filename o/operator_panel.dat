50|$|Another {{example was}} the IBM 650 (1953), a decimal machine, {{which had a}} group of ten 10-position {{switches}} on its <b>operator</b> <b>panel</b> which were addressable as a memory word (address 8000) and could be executed as an instruction. Thus setting the switches to 7004000400 and pressing the appropriate button would read the first card in the card reader into memory (op code 70), starting at address 400 and then jump to 400 to begin executing the program on that card.|$|E
50|$|A more {{sophisticated}} {{version of this}} experiment uses marked operons {{to distinguish between the}} two copies of the lac genes and show that the unregulated structural gene(s) is(are) the one(s) next to the mutant <b>operator</b> (<b>panel</b> (g). For example, suppose that one copy is marked by a mutation inactivating lacZ so that it can only produce the LacY protein, while the second copy carries a mutation affecting lacY and can only produce LacZ. In this version, only the copy of the lac operon that is adjacent to the mutant operator is expressed without IPTG. We say that the operator mutation is cis-dominant, it is dominant to wild type but affects only the copy of the operon which is immediately adjacent to it.|$|E

40|$|Touchscreen <b>operator</b> <b>panels</b> {{proved to}} be a {{convenient}} succesor for clasical <b>operator</b> <b>panels</b> for implementing human-machine interfaces (HMIs) in programmable logic controllers (PLC) systems. The paper introduces a new technique for HMIs design in such systems, based on the idea of touchscreens replication. This redundancy allow actions which are not possible within the menus and sub-menus of a single touchscreen. Its strenght is revealed especially in complex systems, where operators can easily be overwhelmed by the huge amount of process information. The technique was applied on a mill tube rolling installation. The results also proved an increase of system security and zero downtime for HMI maintenance activities...|$|R
50|$|Harley Quinn Crazy Train has {{a single}} 20-car train, by far the longest in the park. Each car {{has a single}} row of two seats {{for a total of}} 40 riders. However, the cars are so small that two adults cannot comfortably fit in one car. It also has one of the longest {{stations}} in the park, with an individual entrance gate for every row except the first (the <b>operator</b> <b>panel</b> and computer shed are in the way). Because there is only one train, no block safety system is needed and the station also serves as the main brake run.

40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{deals with}} design, {{realization}} and laboratory commissioning {{of the model}} of keg / tank cleaning station (CIP) in foodstuff industry. The model uses two cleaning liquids – water and lye. There are several different types of valves used in the CIP model. They serves for inlet and outlet of lye or water and for separation of the both liquids branches. The control system offers monitoring of pressure, volume flow, level of the lye, etc. The measuring devises mostly communicate with PLC via industrial net PROFIBUS-DP and PA. The same net PROFIBUS-DP also provides communication between PLC and distributed control system Festo (valve island). Configuration and set up of the Festo valve island is described in the thesis as well. Further the work presents processing of the analogue values from different transmitters and their representation in a <b>operator</b> <b>panel.</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>panel</b> (OP) serves for control and visualization of the cleaning station.
