5|$|Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson {{was then}} hired, but he {{proved to be}} unpopular with Hibs supporters. However, a string <b>of</b> <b>exciting</b> young players emerged, {{including}} Garry O'Connor, Derek Riordan, Kevin Thomson and Scott Brown. These players featured heavily as Hibs eliminated both halves of the Old Firm to reach the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, only to lose 2–0 to Livingston. Williamson departed {{near the end of}} that season to manage Plymouth Argyle and was replaced by Tony Mowbray. Mowbray promised fast-flowing, passing football, with which Hibs finished third in his first season as manager, while Mowbray won the SFWA Manager of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|WWE 2K is {{a series}} that has more than 20 {{professional}} wrestling video games that are currently developed by Visual Concepts and Yuke's, and it was originated from THQ but later published by 2K Sports. These series of games {{are based on the}} professional wrestling promotion WWE, which features the professional wrestling match types, storylines, and playable characters based on WWE programming. The series was originally named SmackDown!, after WWE's own SmackDown television program. The first release in the series was WWF SmackDown! in March 2000, which along with these subsequent titles, remained exclusive to Sony's PlayStation consoles. After the brand extension, the series was retitled SmackDown! vs. Raw in 2004, to indicate the Raw brand was also featured. Within a few years!, the series had expanded to a yearly release cycle for various seventh-generation consoles as well as mobile devices. Yuke's had also released the games in Japan under the name <b>of</b> <b>Exciting</b> Pro Wrestling. However, after SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006, THQ took over as the Japanese publisher and the Japanese releases adopted the western name. The series was later renamed as just simply WWE, starting from 2011 and 2012.|$|E
25|$|Kasha's rule {{dictates}} that the quantum yield of luminescence {{is independent of}} the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>exciting</b> radiation. This occurs because excited molecules usually decay to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state before fluorescence emission takes place. The Kasha–Vavilov rule does not always apply and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, {{would be that the}} fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>exciting</b> radiation.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of surface S 2 - dangling bonds and surface doped ions(Se 2 -, Cu 2 +, and Hg 2 +) on the photoluminescence of Cd 2 +-rich CdS QDs was investigated. A quantitative model was proposed {{to understand the}} complex transfer processes <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> electrons in CdS QDs. The transfer <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> electrons from either the conduction band or the Cd 2 +-related trap-state to the surface S 2 [...] related shallow hole trap-state is effective. However, the trap <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> electrons by surface doped ion trap-states from the Cd 2 +-related trap-state {{is more effective than}} that from the conduction band. The efficiency of trapping electrons from both the conduction band and the Cd 2 +-related trap-state can be quantitatively understood {{with the help of the}} proposed model. The results show that the transfer efficiency <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> electrons is dependent on the location of the energy-level of the relevant surface-related trap-state. The trap <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> electrons by the surface trap-state with energy-level closer to that of the conduction band is more effective, especially for the trap <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> electrons from Cd 2 +-related trap-state.

He continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined Getafe, ushering a new brand <b>of</b> <b>exciting</b> and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the Copa del Rey final.

25|$|Initially, {{the system}} of atoms is at thermal equilibrium, and the {{majority}} of the atoms will be in the ground state, i.e., N1 ≈ N, N2 ≈ N3 ≈ 0. If we now subject the atoms to light of a frequency , the process of optical absorption will excite electrons from the ground state to level 3. This process is called pumping, and does not necessarily always directly involve light absorption; other methods <b>of</b> <b>exciting</b> the laser medium, such as electrical discharge or chemical reactions, may be used. The level 3 is sometimes referred to as the pump level or pump band, and the energy transition E1 → E3 as the pump transition, which is shown as the arrow marked P in the diagram on the right.|$|E
25|$|Franck Sauzée was {{replaced}} as Hibs manager in March 2002 by Bobby Williamson, {{who had previously}} managed Kilmarnock. Hibs recorded five wins from nine matches {{towards the end of}} the 2001–02 season, which ensured that they retained their place in the SPL. Williamson's time in charge was seemingly ‘jinxed’ by conceding late goals. A memorable example of this was when Hibs themselves scored two late goals at Tynecastle to take a 4–2 lead against Hearts on 2 January 2003, only to concede two even later goals by Graham Weir to give Hearts an unlikely 4–4 draw. Despite indifferent results under Williamson, a string <b>of</b> <b>exciting</b> young players including Garry O’Connor, Derek Riordan, Kevin Thomson and Scott Brown started to emerge. These players featured heavily as Hibs eliminated both halves of the Old Firm to reach the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, only to lose 2–0 to Livingston.
