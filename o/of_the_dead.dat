5|$|A Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead.</b> The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the King {{picks up}} with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim {{on the way}} to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk the Paths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> in an effort to {{convince}} the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> to join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, the Paths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. They must also defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Éowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. As it seems they are about to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.|$|E

5|$|Attica is a war-torn city {{under assault}} by the Persian Empire and their pet basilisk, {{and is the}} site of Eurybiades' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog of the Dream God, Morpheus.

Boreas, Zephyros, Euros, and Notos, gods of the north, west, east, and south winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is an underground cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess Eos, the Primordial Fires, and a statue of Triton.

5|$|During the 25th and 26th dynasties, the Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> was updated, {{revised and}} standardised. Spells were {{consistently}} ordered and numbered {{for the first}} time.

In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, the Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated {{towards the end of}} the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity. The last use of the Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.|$|E
