Odour plumes exhausted from broiler sheds interact with the environment, where dispersion and dilution of the odours varies constantly, especially diurnally. The potential for odour impacts is greatest when <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rates are high and/or when atmospheric dispersion and dilution of odour plumes is limited (i. e. during stable conditions). We continuously monitored ventilation rate, on-site weather conditions, atmospheric stability, and estimated odour concentration with an artificial olfaction system.

40|$|A {{study in}} {{experimental}} slatted-system fattening pig units {{was conducted with}} the aim of estimating the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> factor (in ou/s. pig), which can subsequently be used in dispersion models to assess the odour annoyance zone. Dynamic olfactometry measurements carried out at different development stages of pigs showed a logical trend of the mean predicted <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> factor with the pig weight. However, the variation within the same weight class was much larger than variation between classes. Possible causes of such variation were identified as the evolution of ventilation rate during the day and the circadian rhythm of pig. To be able to monitor continuously the daily variation of the odour, an electronic nose was used with suitable regression model calibrated against olfactometric measurements. After appropriate validation check, the electronic nose proved to be convenient, as a complementary tool to dynamic olfactometry, to record the daily variation of the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> factor in the pig barn.

40|$|In Australia, {{factors such}} as local {{planning}} processes, urban encroachment into rural areas and intensification of the poultry industry have increased the potential for odour and dust nuisance. At present, accurate estimates of odour emissions from mechanically ventilated poultry housing systems do not exist for Australian conditions. This has made the poultry industry vulnerable to unsubstantiated criticism. Recently, the Australian poultry industry have made a significant investment in research to obtain accurate estimates of odour, dust and volatile chemical emission rates from typical poultry housing systems. This paper describes the measurement of odour emissions from tunnel ventilated poultry housing systems in different climatic zones in Queensland and Victoria, Australia (humid sub-tropical and Mediterranean respectively) during two seasons (summer and winter). Samples were collected at defined intervals over typical batch production cycles to define the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> profiles. These samples were analysed using dynamic olfactometry according to the Australian Standard 4323. 3 to derive the odour concentration values. Ventilation rates were measured concurrently, allowing the calculation of <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rates.

40|$|Odour {{nuisance}} from agricultural {{activities is}} increasing in densely populated countries like the Netherlands. To develop adequate regulations, a large-scale, government-financed monitoring programme {{was started in}} the mid- 1990 s to establish <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> levels for both conventional and low ammonia emission housing systems for cattle, pigs and poultry. The results indicate that high- and low-odour emission housing are difficult to distinguish {{because of the large}} variation within housing systems. Measurements on different farm locations within the same housing system show both a large variation between locations and within one location (in time). The latter, however, is significantly smaller, which suggests that farm management is an important determinant in <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> that interferes with the effects of housing systems. The current research was aimed at determining the effect of two common ammonia-reducing pig-housing systems on odour emissions compared to conventional housing systems under similar management conditions. The respective reduction principles of these systems are reducing the emitting surface of the manure pit and cooling of manure in the manure pit (both pits beneath slatted floor). Five farms that combined conventional housing with one low-ammonia system (three reduced emitting surface and two manure cooling) were selected for a direct, pair-wise comparison of (olfactometric) <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> measurements. The results show a highly significant effect (p < 0. 01) for two of the three reduced emitting surface systems and for one of the two manure cooling system.

Communities often become more sensitised and vocal about biosolids issues, once they experience odours emanating from a nearby site. Odour impacts from biosolids, including potential human health effects, have been targeted recently by many national and local newspapers, citizens' groups, and regulatory agencies, who have raised significant concerns, ranging from viable disposal methods/sites to outright bans. Many national and local regulatory agencies in the United States are considering biosolids disposal bans in their communities because of misinformation, poor science, and citizen pressure, but primarily because of odour impact concerns. The wastewater industry has a relatively poor understanding of the operations and treatment parameters that influence biosolids <b>odour</b> <b>emissions.</b> Thus, wastewater treatment plants are often unable to control the odour quality of the biosolids that are delivered into communities.

An experiment was conducted with finishing pigs (n = 36) in a 2 × 3 factorial randomized complete block arrangement with 6 treatment combinations in 6 blocks. There were 2 dietary CP levels (low 12 %; high 18 %) and 3 digestible FC levels: (low 95. 5; medium 145. 5; and high 195. 5 g/kg feed, as-fed basis). Pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 57. 7 ± 2. 5 kg were penned individually in partly slatted floor pens. Faeces and urine of each pig accumulated in separate manure pits under the slatted floor. In the 6 th week of the collection period air samples were collected directly above the manure in each pit. Manure samples were taken for manure characteristics. Air samples were analyzed for odour concentration and for hedonic tone and odour intensity. Manure samples were analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFA), indoles, phenoles, sulphurous compounds, ammonium, and total N concentrations. Dietary CP level and FC level did not affect <b>odour</b> <b>emission,</b> odour intensity and hedonic tone but their interaction affected <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> at P = 0. 06. At a high dietary CP level, increased FC level decreased <b>odour</b> <b>emission,</b> while at a low CP level, increased FC level increased <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> from pig manure.

40|$|Feedlots in Australia {{have long}} been {{associated}} with odour, and as such, in the early 1990 's research {{was carried out in}} order to better understand the processes driving the odour generation. Since that time, many practices have been identified as contributing to the odour problem, and feedlot management has changed to minimise the odour emissions. This has resulted in a distinct lack of odour emissions data relating to 'modern' feedlots. Feedlot pad surfaces represent the largest odour emitting source, however, after a rain- fall event, the odour emissions from the effluent ponds increase to a point where it may exceed that of the feedlot pad surface. Despite this, there has been little Australian research carried out to determine and predict the odour emissions from feedlot ponds after an inflow event. This project set out to develop a model to predict the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rate from the effluent ponds at a feedlot after a significant inflow. Odour samples were collected every few days {{for a period of time}} after an inflow at two commercial feedlots in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales, and assessed to determine the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rate. The collected data displayed a similar pattern of <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> to that measured in the early 1990 's, reported by Casey et al (1997). At both feedlots, the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rate from the primary holding pond rose quickly to a peak (454 and 578 ou/s. m 2) within 5 - 8 days, and then declined steadily back to 'normal' levels within 25 - 30 days. A model was developed to reproduce the pattern of odour emissions from the primary holding pond at each feedlot. The model is a two-stage empirical algorithm, and is dependent on the inflow ratio, the 24 hour average ambient temperature experienced during the days of the rainfall event and the number of days since the first day of the rain event. A parameter named 'Peak Day' defines the two stages of the model, and is read from a table developed from the measured temperature data. It is known that the pond condition does impact the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rate (Hobbs et al, 1999); however the current body of research is not conclusive, and not enough pond condition data was collected during the course of the project to permit this model to include pond condition parameters as input. The model was tested with a number of hypothetical scenarios, and was also validated using the data collected by Casey et al (1997). The model was shown to be reasonably robust to moderate changes in parameter values, but failed to accurately reproduce the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> patterns measured in the earlier work. This was attributed to the different management practices of feedlots between the two data sets, and the simplistic nature of the model developed.

The organizers of the 2003 symposium were Section II (Buildings) of the Commission International du Genie Rurale (CIGR), the European Association of Agricultural Engineers (EurAgEng), and the Nordic Association of Agricultural Scientists (NJF). A total of 93 participants from 22 nations got together to share the latest advancement in research and development into the important issues of gaseous emissions from animal production facilities, including odour. They presented 40 papers and 22 posters on various issues concerning gaseous emissions from animal production facilities. This paper describes the major progress in the field of ammonia, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock production. Statements, data and findings are referred to between parentheses (author – page number of the symposium proceedings) ...|$|R
40|$|Composting of {{food waste}} often causes {{problematic}} <b>odour</b> <b>emissions.</b> This project develops recommendations to minimise {{the risk of}} odour problems and to achieve an efficient process and a high and uniform product quality. Three full-scale plants and one experimental reactor were investigated. The results show {{a strong correlation between}} pH and <b>odour</b> <b>emissions,</b> temperature and decomposition rate are also important factors. The main recommendation to reduce odour problems is to control the process so that pH increased rapidly, without increase of temperature, either through ventilation or by addition of compost or wood ash with high pH. Water may contribute to control temperature. Food waste is high energetic and a large amount of energy is released during composting. If energy is used to evaporate water, the compost will be kept cool. The amount of water in food waste is usually not sufficient to allow adequate evaporation and cooling. It should therefore be possible to add water to the process to help control of temperature end pH. The original report, in Swedish, is published at [URL]...|$|R
