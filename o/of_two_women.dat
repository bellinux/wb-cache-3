5|$|Emma Jane Catherine Cobden (28 April 1851– 7 July 1947), {{known as}} Jane Cobden, was a British Liberal {{politician}} who {{was active in}} many radical causes. A daughter of the Victorian reformer and statesman Richard Cobden, she was an early proponent of women's rights, and in 1889 was one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> elected to the inaugural London County Council. Her election was controversial; legal challenges to her eligibility hampered and eventually prevented her from serving as a councillor.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} a hard-hat diver, sent down {{to recover the}} gold and other valuables, found the bodies <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> {{at the foot of}} the saloon staircase, one with her arm around the other. The diver tried to reach them to take a lock of hair or some other {{personal}} item that could be identified by their loved ones, but the restriction of the air line made it impossible. The gold in the Captain's cabin was recovered after much difficulty. While recovering the gold, several sharks that were caught near the wreck were found to contain human bones, remains and jewellery.|$|E

5|$|On March 31, 2009, the Hall of Fame {{announced}} new by-law additions {{which will}} be implemented on January 1, 2010. Starting in 2010, male and female players are considered for induction separately and a maximum <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> can be inducted as players per year. The by-law also clarifies that a builder {{does not need to}} have been a coach, manager or executive to be inducted. Although they remain separate categories, the builders and on-ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of two can be inducted each year. The Board of Directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits.|$|E

25|$|Other than {{applicable}} laws to Muslim women, {{there is}} gender-based {{variation in the}} process of testimony and acceptable forms of evidence in legal matters.

25|$|Peat {{is common}} {{on the islands}} and has {{traditionally}} been exploited as a fuel. Uncontrolled exploitation of this natural resource led to peat slips in 1878 and 1886.

25|$|Soja is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} Baccara formula—consisting of breathy lyrics, lush backing, a disco beat and the striking image <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> (Mateos dressed in black, Mendiola in white) dancing. While drawing lightly on Spanish flamenco song and dance tradition, the formula was very much rooted in 1970s disco music. Soja's song arrangements generally used Mateos as the lead singer while Mendiola contributed backing and refrains.|$|E

In 1998, lonely New Yorker Wally Winthrop is obsessed with King Edward VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson. But Wally's research, including several visits to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, reveals that the couple's life together was not as perfect as she thought. Weaving {{back and forth in}} time, W.E. intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis and Edward, from the early days of their romance to the unraveling of their lives in the decades that followed.|$|E
25|$|Women face {{discrimination}} in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> in family and inheritance law. Polygamy is permitted for men, and men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. A woman can only obtain a divorce {{with the consent of}} her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. With regard to the law of inheritance, the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased's estate must be left to the Qur'anic heirs and generally, female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs.|$|E
25|$|During the summer, French {{newspapers}} {{were filled with}} the story of Henri Pranzini, convicted of the brutal murder <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> and a child. To the outraged public Pranzini represented all that threatened the decent way of life in France. In July and August 1887 Thérèse prayed hard for the conversion of Pranzini, so his soul could be saved, yet Pranzini showed no remorse. At the end of August, the newspapers reported that just as Pranzini's neck was placed on the guillotine, he had grabbed a crucifix and kissed it three times. Thérèse was ecstatic and believed that her prayers had saved him. She continued to pray for Pranzini after his death.|$|E
