5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Brian Bloom was {{the first}} winner of this award for his {{portrayal}} <b>of</b> <b>Dusty</b> Donovan on As the World Turns. The awards ceremony had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award category was originally called Outstanding Young Man or Outstanding Juvenile Male in a Drama Series, and began using its current title in 1991. Years before this category was introduced, networks declined to broadcast the show {{during a time of}} voting integrity rumors and waning interest. Confusion rose around the criteria of the new category due to the varying ages of the nominees. Within the first set of nominees, Bloom became the youngest actor nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award at the time at age 15, while the other actors nominated in the category were over 25. The criteria were later altered, requiring that the actor be aged 25 or below.|$|E

The follow-up to the critical and commercial disappointment of 2003's Solo Star was preceded by Knowles's move from Columbia to Geffen Records in late 2007. Knowles was heavily influenced by Motown girl groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes, and by her mother Tina, a one-time member of the 1960s harmony group The Veltones, who used to play music by the likes <b>of</b> <b>Dusty</b> Springfield and Martha Reeves to her. Knowles decided to distance herself from the teen pop and dance-pop-oriented R sound mainly associated with her previous effort, Solo Star.|$|E
25|$|The Le Sage {{mechanism}} {{also has}} been identified as a significant factor in the behavior <b>of</b> <b>dusty</b> plasma. A.M. Ignatov has shown that an attractive force arises between two dust grains suspended in an isotropic collisionless plasma due to inelastic collisions between ions of the plasma and the grains of dust. This attractive force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between dust grains, and can counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion between dust grains.|$|E

After announcing this to the crowd, Nash was interrupted by Heath Slater to whom he promptly delivered his finisher, effectively turning face. Nash later again appeared on NXT to reunite with members of The Kliq, allowing him to effectively settle all issues with Triple H, embracing him once again. The reunion also turned into a reunion of D-Generation-X and Nash was awarded the title of being an honorary member of the stable. Nash then helped DX take down Damien Sandow.|$|E

He feuded with Antonio Inoki during this Japanese run. After returning to America, Graham and Koloff made an unsuccessful attempt to launch their own wrestling promotion in Southern California. In November 1976, on the invitation <b>of</b> <b>Dusty</b> Rhodes, Graham joined the NWA promotion in Florida, beating Rhodes for the Florida heavyweight title on November 22 at the West Palm Beach Auditorium.

500|$|During its 1986 apparition, Halley's Comet {{became the}} first comet to be {{observed}} in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data {{on the structure of}} a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's [...] "dirty snowball" [...] model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices – such as water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia – and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed <b>of</b> <b>dusty,</b> non-volatile materials, and that {{only a small portion of}} it is icy.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of two-phase flows in which solid spherical particles are distributed in a fluid {{is important in}} areas like environmental pollution, smoke emission from vehicles, emission of effluents from industries, cooling effects of air conditioners, flying ash produced from thermal reactors and formation of raindrops, etc. On {{the basis of these}} applications, Saffman (1962) has formulated the basic equations of motion for fluid carrying small dust particles in which dust particles are uniformly distributed. Using the Saffman (1962) model, Soundalgekar and Gokhale (1984) studied the flow <b>of</b> a <b>dusty</b> gas past an impulsively started infinite vertical plate by employing an implicit finite difference technique. Datta and Mishra (1982) have analyzed the boundary layer flow <b>of</b> a <b>dusty</b> fluid over a semi-infinite flat plate. Later, Das et al. (1992) studied the flow <b>of</b> a <b>dusty</b> gas past a uniformly accelerated horizontal plate. Ganesan and Palani (2004) have obtained the numerical solution for an unsteady free convection flow <b>of</b> a <b>dusty</b> gas past a semi-infinite inclined plate with constant heat flux using an implicit finite difference method. Flow <b>of</b> a <b>dusty</b> gas past an impulsively started semi-infinite vertical plate was studied by Kulandaivel (2010). Vajravelu and Nayfeh (1992) examined hydromagnetic flow <b>of</b> a <b>dusty</b> fluid over a stretching sheet. Recently, Gireesha et al. (2011, 2012, 2013) have obtained the results for heat transfer analysis on dusty fluid flow due to linear stretching with various effects like nonuniform heat source or sink, radiation and viscous dissipation, etc. In this studies, they were analyzed by two types of heating processes namely, surface temperature and heat flux.|$|R
