5|$|On 7 June 2010, Van der Sloot {{reportedly}} {{confessed to}} killing Flores, after hours <b>of</b> <b>interrogation.</b> He initially proclaimed his innocence. According to {{an expert in}} Peruvian law, the confession fit a defense strategy {{of trying to get}} the charge reduced to manslaughter, which is punishable by 6 to 20 years in prison, while a conviction for murder could result in up to 35 years' imprisonment. The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 30 years. Peru does not issue life sentences in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but exceptional circumstances, such as crimes committed under military law. A life sentence can be issued for a murder committed during the commission of a robbery. Peruvian president Alan García Pérez used the case to seek the reinstatement of the death penalty for murder.|$|E

40|$|Interrogations and {{elections}} were two branches of Arabic judicial astrology made available in Latin translation to readers in western Europe from the twelfth century. Through {{an analysis of}} the theory and practice <b>of</b> <b>interrogations</b> {{and elections}}, including the writing of the Jewish astrologer Sahl b. Bishr, this essay considers the extent to which judicial astrology was practiced in the medieval west. Consideration is given to historical examples <b>of</b> <b>interrogations</b> and elections mostly from late medieval English manuscripts. These include the work of John Dunstaple (ca. 1390 – 1453), the musician and astrologer who is known have served at the court of John, duke of Bedford.

25|$|Goa'uld symbiotes are {{serpentine}} lifeforms {{with four}} jaws and glowing yellow eyes. Originally aquatic, mature Goa'uld symbiotes have extensive fins and are powerful swimmers, {{with the ability}} to launch themselves from the water towards prospective hosts. A Goa'uld can burrow into their host through the back of the mouth or the neck, though they prefer the latter because they wish to avoid remembering the look of horror on the host's face. They then enter the brain, take control of the body, and gain total access to the host's memories; thus, the Goa'uld often use symbiote implantation as a means <b>of</b> <b>interrogation</b> that also provides a useful future spy.|$|E

According to the report, there had been dramatically increased in arrests in 1973, with a specific week period. The majority of suspects were university students. These students were arrested within several week period in the Rio area. When arrested and interrogated, the suspects were “submitted to the old methods of physical violence, which sometimes cause death.” The increased in number of suspects stemmed from police report, especially on individual who were jailed before.|$|E

25|$|On 28 June, Gasparotto {{was brought}} in for {{interrogation}} again. This time he admitted to being a benandante, claiming {{that he had been}} too scared {{to do so in the}} previous interrogation lest the witches beat him in punishment. Gasparotto went on to accuse two individuals, one from Gorizia and the other from Chiana, of being witches, and was subsequently released by Montefalco on the proviso that he return for further questioning at a later date. This eventually came about on 26 September, taking place at the monastery of San Francesco in Udine. This time, Gasparotto added an extra element to his tale, claiming that an angel had summoned him to join the benandanti. For Montefalco, the introduction of this element led him to suspect that the actions of Gasparotto were themselves heretical and satanic, and his method <b>of</b> <b>interrogation</b> became openly suggestive, putting forward the idea that the angel was actually a demon in disguise.|$|E
25|$|Despite his militarist {{convictions}} at {{this time}} Collins found the psychological strain caused by {{his involvement in the}} terrorist war increasingly difficult to deal with. His belief in the martial discipline of IRA's campaign had been seriously undermined by the event of the assassination of Norman Hanna, a 28 year old Newry man on the 11 March 1982 in front of his wife and young daughter, who had been targeted because of his former service with the Ulster Defence Regiment, which he had resigned from in 1976. Collins had opposed the targeting of Hanna on the basis that it wasn't of a governmental entity, but had been over-ruled by his superiors, and he had gone along with the operation; his conscience burdened him afterwards about it though. His uneasy state was further augmented by being arrested under anti-terrorism laws on two occasions, the second involving his detention at Gough Barracks in Armagh for a week, where he was subject to extensive sessions <b>of</b> <b>interrogation</b> in 1985 after an IRA mortar attack in Newry, which had claimed the lives of multiple police officers. Collins had not been involved in this operation, but after five days of incessant psychological pressure being exerted by R.U.C. specialist police officers, during which he had not said a word, he mentally broke, and yielded detailed information to the police about the organization. As a result of his arrest he was dismissed from his career with H.M. Customs & Excise Service.|$|E
