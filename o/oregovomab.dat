50|$|<b>Oregovomab</b> (marketed {{under the}} trade name OvaRex) is a mouse {{monoclonal}} antibody it binds to the antigen CA125, a carbohydrate antigen. It {{is designed for}} the treatment of ovarian cancer.|$|E
40|$|To assess <b>oregovomab</b> as {{consolidation}} treatment of advanced ovarian cancer and refine the immuno-therapeutic strategy for subsequent study. Patients and Methods Patients with stage III/IV ovarian cancer {{who had a}} complete clinical response to primary treatment {{were randomly assigned to}} <b>oregovomab</b> or placebo administered at weeks 0, 4, and 8, and every 12 weeks up to 2 years or until recurrence. The primary end-point was time to relapse (TTR). Results One hundred forty-five patients were treated with <b>oregovomab</b> (n 73) or placebo (n 72). For the population overall, median TTR was not different between treatments at 13. 3 months for <b>oregovomab</b> and 10. 3 months for placebo (P. 71). Immune responses were induced in most actively treated patients. This was associated with prolonged TTR. Quality of life was not adversely impacted by treatment. Adverse events were reported with similar frequency in <b>oregovomab</b> and placebo groups, indicating a benign safety profile. A long-term survival follow-up is ongoing. Cox analysis of relapse data identified significant factors: performance status, CA- 125 before third cycle, and baseline CA- 125. Further evaluation identified a subpopulation with favorable prognostic indicators designated as the successful front-line therapy (SFLT) population. For the SFLT population, TTR was 24. 0 months in the <b>oregovomab</b> group compared with 10. 8 months for placebo (unadjusted hazard ratio of 0. 543 [95 % CI, 0. 287 to 1. 025]), a hypothesis-generating observation. Conclusion Consolidation therapy with <b>oregovomab</b> did not significantly improve TTR overall. A set of confirmatory phase III studies has been initiated to determine whether the SFLT population derives benefit from <b>oregovomab</b> treatment.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, several {{improvements}} in treating gynecological malignancies have been achieved. In particular, target therapies, mostly monoclonal antibodies, {{have emerged as}} an attractive option {{for the treatment of}} these malignancies. In fact, various molecular-targeted agents have been developed for a variety of malignancies with the objective to interfere with a precise tumor associated receptor, essential for cancer cell survival or proliferation, blocking its function, of the cancer cells. Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies have been developed to block immune suppression or enhance functions of immune effector cells. So far, several monoclonal antibodies have been tested for clinical efficacy for the treatment of gynecological cancers. Antibodies against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) have been used in different neoplasms such as ovarian and cervical cancer. Catumazumab, a bivalent antibody against CD 3 and EpCAM, is effective in the treatment of neoplastic ascites. Other antibodies are peculiar for specific cancer-associated antigen such as <b>Oregovomab</b> against CA 125 or Farletuzumab against the folate receptor. Here we describe the preclinical and clinical experience gained up to now with monoclonal antibodies in tumors of the female genital tract and trace future therapeutic and research venues...|$|E
40|$|Cytoreductive {{surgery and}} {{chemotherapy}} {{continue to be}} the mainstay of ovarian cancer treatment. However, as mortality from advanced ovarian cancer remains very high, novel therapies are required to be integrated into existing treatment regimens. Immunotherapy represents an alternative and rational therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer based on a body of evidence supporting a protective role of the immune system against these cancers, and on the clinical success of immunotherapy in other malignancies. Whether or not immunotherapy will have a role in the future management of ovarian cancer is too early to tell, but research in this field is active. This review will discuss recent clinical developments of selected immunotherapies for ovarian cancer which fulfil the following criteria: (i) they are antibody-based, (ii) target a distinct immunological pathway, and (iii) have reached the clinical trial stage. Specifically, the focus is on Catumaxomab (anti-EpCAM × anti-CD 3), Abagovomab, <b>Oregovomab</b> (anti-CA 125), Daclizumab (anti-CD 25), Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA- 4), and MXD- 1105 (anti-PD-L 1). Catumaxomab has reached phase III clinical trials and exhibits promise with reports, showing that it can cause a significant and sustained reduction in ascites. Phase I-III clinical trials continue to be conducted on the other antibodies, some of which have had encouraging reports. We will also provide our perspective on the future of immunotherapy for ovarian cancer, and how it may be best employed in treatment regimen...|$|E

40|$|The {{prognosis}} {{for patients with}} ovarian cancer is still poor and more effective therapeutic modalities are needed. (Radio) immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) {{could be one of}} these approaches. Here, we review the status of (radio) immunotherapy using Mabs for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The Pubmed database was searched for clinical trials investigating the effect of (radio) immunotherapy in ovarian cancer published until October 1, 2007. Keywords for the search were: ovarian cancer, monoclonal antibodies, CA 125, gp 38, HER 2, HMFG, MUC 1, TAG 72 and VEGF. A total of 44 trials on immunotherapy with unconjugated Mabs, Mab vaccination and (radio) immunotherapy directed towards the antigens CA 125, gp 38, HER 2, MUC 1, TAG 72 or VEGF in patients with ovarian cancer were found, reviewed and discussed. Out of these trials, 23 studied immunotherapy with unconjugated Mabs, 5 vaccination with Mabs and 16 trials studied (radio) immunotherapy. The lack of large randomized prospective trials with Mabs directed to tumor-associated antigens expressed on ovarian cancer cells preclude any firm conclusion on the potential of Mabs use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. <b>Oregovomab,</b> directed against CA 125, and bevacizumab, targeting VEGF, are two unconjugated Mabs closest to clinical introduction for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Vaccination with Mab ACA 125 seems promising but these findings need to be confirmed in controlled randomized trials. Sole RIT should be investigated with the appropriate radionuclide and a Mab with high affinity for the specific tumor-associated antigen in the appropriate patient group to determine whether it may have a therapeutic effect. Additionally, appending (radio) immunotherapy with anti-TAG 72 or anti-MUC 1 to other treatment strategies such as chemotherapy could also be a strategy worthwhile investigating. The potential of Mabs to complement current treatment paradigms, is encouraging and may bring a significant improvement to the overall therapeutic outcomes currently being achieved in ovarian cancer...|$|E
