5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites, who often made little effort to hide their plans and objectives. These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy,</b> and in discovering Har Dayal's whereabouts. Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When a clear idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> emerged, more earnest and {{elaborate}} plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who {{had arrived in the}} United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E

50|$|By early 2006, <b>the</b> Isomorphic <b>Conspiracy</b> had {{discovered}} that such keyboards also had the same fingering in every tuning, too—or, at least, every tuning <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> <b>Conspiracy</b> came to call the syntonic temperament. This consistency of fingering across tunings, which they called tuning invariance, enables a performer, using an isomorphic keyboard and compatible synthesizer (or software synthesizer), to play a given tonal piece in any {{of a wide range}} <b>of</b> tunings. <b>The</b> <b>Conspiracy</b> turned its attention to identifying the means by which different isomorphic keyboards could be compared, and identified the Wicki/Hayden keyboard as being optimal for the syntonic temperament's wide tuning range.|$|R

5|$|The most {{important}} {{result of the}} Catilinarian conspiracy was that the populares party became discredited. The prior 70 years had witnessed a gradual erosion in senatorial powers.

After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E

5|$|During the Bahia campaign, {{high-ranking}} officers mutinied against Labatut, who {{was taken}} prisoner and {{sent back to}} Rio de Janeiro.

The campaign resumed, and the Portuguese withdrew from Salvador and set sail back to Portugal. On 2 July, the victorious Brazilians entered the city. The Emperor's Battalion returned to Rio de Janeiro, and Luís Alves was later promoted to captain on 22 January 1824.|$|E

Leaving the car to evade Castafiore's singing, Tintin is arrested again and survives another assassination attempt before arrival in Klow on foot. There, he meets the King's aide-de-camp, Colonel Boris; but Boris is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial.

Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

5|$|Cornelio Saavedra, who {{was aware}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy,</b> {{considered}} it a plot by peninsulars to secure political power over the criollo peoples.

There was no violence in the operation, as the criollos forced the rebels to give up just by the sheer force of numbers. Thus, Liniers stayed in office as viceroy. All {{the heads of the}} mutiny were sentenced to prison at Carmen de Patagones, and the militias that took part in it were dissolved. The only peninsular militias remaining were those of Andaluces and Montañeses, who did not join the mutiny; criollos obtained the military command, and the political power of Saavedra increased even more.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this feud, Germanicus became ill and despite the fact Piso had removed himself to the port of Seleucia, he was {{convinced}} that Piso was somehow poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there were signs of black magic in Piso's house with hidden body parts and Germanicus' name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (amicitia). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year. His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tiberius feared the people of Rome knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> against Germanicus, but Tiberius' jealousy and fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive as understood by Tacitus.|$|E
