50|$|Coded postal obliterators are {{a type of}} postmarks {{that had}} an obliterator encoded with a number, letter or letters, or a {{combination}} of these, to identify the post <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> They were introduced in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1843, three years after the first stamp was issued. They became common throughout the nineteenth century but very few remained in use until the twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|Soon, in many countries, various systems {{developed}} {{where the}} obliterator had a code identifying the post <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Most such codes were enclosed within a design of dots, rays, bars or concentric circles or ovals {{to ensure the}} effective cancellation of the stamp. Similar designs without an enclosed code are known as dumb or mute obliterators. Later the duplex canceller with the datestamp {{on the left and}} the obliterator on the right came into common use. Coded obliterators were used throughout the nineteenth century but few persisted to the twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|The {{registration}} of letters as known today {{was introduced in}} 1841 in Great Britain. The letter had to be enclosed within a large sheet of green paper. The green sheet was addressed to the Post Office where the recipient lived. The green sheet was then used as a receipt and was returned to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> after delivery. On 1 July 1858 the green sheet {{was replaced by a}} green silk ribbon and shortly afterwards by a green linen tape. In 1870 the tape was replaced by green string. On the introduction of postal stationery registration envelopes in 1878 the string was replaced by printed blue crossed lines. The blue crossed lines have survived on registered letters to the present day.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} music studio ”Elektronmusikstudion” (EMS) inStockholm was initiated in 1963. It has had several different managers throughout the years. EMS {{soon became a}} rather costly project. Furthermore there have been several conflicts among staff and users wich has contributed to EMS fairly turbulent history. One main conflict concerns the issue wether EMS should be a research facility or a studio for composers. The many different managers of EMS have contributed to a rather unstructured filing of records. To facilitate the understanding of the documents in this archive, and because {{there is very little}} written about EMS history, I’ve included a rather comprehensive description of EMS organizational history. The subject of this one year master’s thesis is to describe and examine difficulties I’ve encountered in the archival process. My main issues comprise the organization and separation of some of the documents, especially those concerning the conception and organization of EMS and also the abundant technical documentation.

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{based on the work of}} {{arranging}} and making an inventory for an archive consisting of records from the Board of Education (Utbildningsnämnden) within the administration of the County Council in Uppsala, Sweden. This archive is kept at the County Councils Archives in Uppsala where I have done the work. I have documented the process and discussed the complex of problems relating to it. In this particular case the issue of limitation of the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and the respect of the fonds, or the principle of provenance, have been of interest. This is due to the fact that the records had been rearranged and mixed with records with other origin related to the Board of Education. Records from the early existence of the board have previously been arranged and an inventory had been made. This earlier work covered the period of 1971 - 1978, when the board of education had a secretariat. The aim of the work was to arrange the records of the board during the period of 1979 - 1997. After this period the board ended being an independent body. With support from theories of respect of fonds my conclusion is that the Board of Education is a coherent <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the fonds during its entire period of existence dur - ing the years 1971 - 1997. I decided to make the first inventory a part of the new one in order to keep a logical continuity of the records and the inventory. Creating a subordinate archive with its own inventory would make the whole seem badly arranged and complicate the finding of records. Based on the respect of fonds I used the previous inventory to a large extent. The knowledge and understanding I gained thanks to the fact that I was able see the complete fonds made me do some changes. The archive consist of files based on journals to a large ex - tent, which makes a large part of the records easy to find. The work in combination with the essay constitutes my one year master’s thesis in archival science...|$|E
