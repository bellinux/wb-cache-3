5|$|For December 7, Colonel John Laurens {{stated that}} “the loss of Morgan's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded”, while John Donaldson, an American cavalryman wrote that “Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & {{among them was}} Major Morris a brave & gallant officer” This {{reference}} was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment, so Donaldson's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan's command, while Laurens' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only. Benson Lossing confirms that “twenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan's Corps”, while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost “16 or 17” wounded. For December 8, David Martin says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded</b> and 15 prisoners. From these sources, the aggregate American loss from December 5–8 would {{appear to have been}} 16 killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded</b> and 24 captured on the 5th; 70 killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded</b> and 15 captured on the 6th; 44 killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded</b> on the 7th and 20 killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded</b> and 15 captured on the 8th. This gives 150 killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded</b> and 54 captured, for a total loss of 204 men.|$|E

Napoleon's losses were 24,000 to 26,000 killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded</b> and included 6,000 to 7,000 captured with an additional 15,000 deserting subsequent to the battle and over the following days.|$|E

To support the attack, a tank squadron from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars and five regiments of artillery {{were assigned to the}} division. The assault had to negotiate both the British and German artillery fire, which killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded</b> several men, including some senior officers. The attackers eventually reached and secured the village. However, every officer or sergeant major {{who took part in the}} attack was killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded.</b>|$|E

5|$|Allied {{casualty}} {{figures for}} the battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured <b>or</b> <b>wounded.</b> Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured. The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed <b>or</b> <b>wounded,</b> together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
