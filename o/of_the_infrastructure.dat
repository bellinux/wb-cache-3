5|$|Cyclone Osea was {{extremely}} destructive {{to some of}} the islands in French Polynesia. Over 700homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. Several roofs were blown off of buildings across the archipelago. On Maupiti, an island with a population of 1,100, about 95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was destroyed. The town hall, twoschools, and an airfield were destroyed. The town hall was originally being used as an emergency shelter, but was later evacuated due to strong winds and was later destroyed. Furthermore, many roadways and highways were blocked due to flooding. In addition, 77homes on the island were destroyed. All but threehomes that belonged to Mormons on the island were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the Government of Canada {{enacted the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which {{provided}} {{public works projects}} in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included {{construction of a new}} registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and {{it was felt that}} there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that hackers gained unauthorized access {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by hackers occurred on 19 September. Apparently hackers gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys from one of the developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the integrity of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E

The storm destroyed weak shacks made by refugees from the mainland, leaving thousands homeless. There were multiple landslides, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> were damaged. More than 400 small watercraft were either damaged or destroyed. In China, dikes and dams were damaged severely, multiple public buildings collapsed, and destroyed large swaths of farmland. Significant wind and rain was also reported in Taiwan. More than 1,600 people died during the storm.|$|E

5|$|On Bora-Bora, {{an island}} {{which had a}} {{population}} of 4,500 at the time, roughly 30% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was destroyed, including 309houses. Hotels were also impacted during the storm. On {{the north side of}} Bora Bora, nearly everything was destroyed, including the village of Vaitape and a local yacht club. Across Vaitape, roads were blocked by fallen trees and telecommunication lines were severed due to high winds. Sevenpeople on the island were reportedly slightly injured. In addition, the islands of Tahaa, Raiatea, and Moorea all sustained damage, though yachts in Raiatea managed to survive unscathed. In another archipelago, 700homes and various public infrastructures were at least somewhat destroyed by Osea. In addition to the impact on infrastructure, banana trees were knocked down due to the winds, especially in mountain gardens. Throughout the impacted region, no deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|Ranchers grazed {{thousands}} of cattle {{on public land}} that would later {{become part of the}} park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched {{at the base of the}} Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lies along a nature trail in the RMD. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer retreat for Levi Manning, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor of Tucson, is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

5|$|The canals faced {{competition}} from the Vale of Neath Railway after 1851, but remained profitable until the early 1880s, {{in the case of}} the Neath Canal, and the 1890s for the Tennant. An unusual aspect of the Tennant's success was that tolls were maintained, although tonnage dropped. Most canals at this time made significant cuts to tolls in an attempt to remain competitive with the railways. After 1883, the Neath Canal carried small amounts of silica and gunpowder, but traffic had virtually ceased by 1921. Navigation on the Neath Canal came to an end in 1934, and on the Tennant Canal soon afterwards. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was maintained as the canals supplied water to local industries.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia Command, returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General Itagaki Seishiro on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> had been destroyed during the war, including electricity and water supply systems, telephone services, {{as well as the}} harbor facilities at the Port of Singapore. There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.|$|E

5|$|After the nationalization, {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started {{going with a}} loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment {{from some of the}} older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while switching from the one supply to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. The depot was expanded in 1952.|$|E
5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E
5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the poor, and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> used to provide for the poor. As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for the poor. In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E
