The thesis consists of five chapters. Chapter one is introductory and provides general introduction {{to the law of}} nature conservation including the history <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas from the perspective of international, European and national law. Chapter two analyses legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas by international law and explains the importance of the most significant international governmental and nongovernmental organizations as well as their role in conservation <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas. Chapter three deals with the law <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas in the European Union and analyses relevant case law of the Court of Justice. Chapter four explains and reviews {{the way in which the}} law promotes the conservation <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas in the Czech Republic. The analysis covers in detail legal regulation <b>of</b> large-area <b>protected</b> areas, i. e. national parks and protected countryside areas. The last chapter focuses on the comparison of the Czech and British large-area protected areas regulation. The aim of this thesis is to provide an outline and analysis of relevant international treaties and programmes promoting the conservation <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas; to describe, review the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>protected</b> area mosaic that has {{evolved in the}} United Kingdom over the past 40 or so years. Experimental matrices {{have been used to}} assist in the analysis of the various types <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas. The trend has been towards the development <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas to serve multiple objectives, although categories <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> area introduced under European legislation are more narrowly defined. There has been a proliferation in the number <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> area in the past ten years; since 1990 six new categories <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> area have been established, two resulting from European directives. Most <b>of</b> the <b>protected</b> areas operate indirectly through the planning system and/or voluntary agreements. However, a distinction is drawn between systems for nature conservation and landscape protection with the former relying more on direct controls (ownership and/or legal force). There is considerable potential overlap <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas. New categories <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> area have often been superimposed upon the existing system without consideration of whether they will result in duplication of effort, expenditure etc. We conclude that there is scope for some rationalization of the system. Ideally this would involve replacing existing protected areas with broader based ones but considerable simplification could be obtained in practice by making the powers of the agencies more flexible and changing the administrative arrangements for managing the various protected areas. ...|$|R

Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs <b>of</b> <b>protecting</b> wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E

Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities.|$|E

40|$|Protected {{areas are}} an {{important}} instrument in the successful long-term preservation of biodiversity; however, despite the continued growth in their number and size, they still cannot prevent biodiversity loss. This article focuses on an analysis <b>of</b> the <b>protected</b> areas <b>of</b> different countries and continents, an analysis of Slovenia's position in relation to European and other countries, and on {{an analysis of the}} correlation between protected areas and other socio-economic indicators. South America stands out with the fastest growth in the area and the coverage <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas in 1990 – 2010, with the largest average size <b>of</b> the <b>protected</b> area, with a maximum total area and the highest share <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas. Europe, however, stands out with the highest number <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas and the smallest average size <b>of</b> the <b>protected</b> area.

In addition to the impact of biodiversity on the establishment <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas, the analysis suggests significant impacts of different social, economic and political factors. The scope of environmental policy increases with economic development and, in this way, the differences in protected areas between countries with high income and low-income countries are even greater...|$|R

Studies that {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} these areas with a focus on preserving the natural habitat define effectiveness as a measure of the influence <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas on total avoided conversion. Changes in the estimated effectiveness are related to local and regional differences, evaluation methods, restriction categories that include the protected areas, and other characteristics.
