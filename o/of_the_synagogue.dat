5|$|The centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> {{originally}} {{contained a}} high wooden bimah, {{but this was}} later replaced with a flat platform covered with expensive marble plates.|$|E
5|$|Designed by the British {{architectural}} firm Gostling & Morris of Bombay, the building's base is of stone masonry while the superstructure is of brick masonry. The external frontage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> is painted turquoise.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil rights}} of Jews were {{restricted}} and their religious privileges threatened. Justinian also interfered {{in the internal affairs}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> and encouraged the Jews to use the Greek Septuagint in their synagogues in Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|A useful {{overview}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue's</b> {{history is}} provided by the recent book edited by Rabbi Raymond Apple.|$|R
50|$|He {{was a life}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United <b>Synagogue</b> and a warden <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Synagogue</b> <b>of</b> London.|$|R
5|$|In 1985, President Giani Zail Singh {{visited the}} site to honour <b>the</b> centennial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue's</b> construction. India Post issued a {{commemorative}} stamp in honour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centennial.|$|R
5|$|The {{collapse}} of the roof, and subsequent destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue,</b> generated widespread concern and criticism among preservationists, who blamed Jacob and Shmuel Spiegel—a charge the family rejected.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the women's {{auxiliary}} was founded; until then, though seating was mixed, {{women had}} little {{say in the}} running <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue.</b> That year the congregation had 110 member families and annual revenues of $9,259.55 (today $). The congregational school, which held classes one day a week, had 15 teachers and 200 students.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 First Roumanian-American {{was one of}} the few congregations on the Lower East Side {{to still}} have its own Talmud Torah. This school had been housed in a small {{building}} on the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> that had formerly served as the church rectory. The congregation was eventually forced to sell the building, but the new owners retained the school's carved sign.|$|E
2500|$|Ground-breaking ceremonies for <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> {{took place}} on February 27, 1956. [...] EMJC began with 115 {{founding}} members. [...] Harry W. Goldin was a co-founder, President, and Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue's</b> board <b>of</b> trustees, and Sidney Feld was a founder and President as well.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Cherasco <b>synagogue</b> is <b>of</b> {{uncertain}} date. A date of 5557 (1797) {{on a stone}} plaque above a stone basin for ritual washing on {{a staircase}} may refer to <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue's</b> construction, or <b>of</b> a renovation.|$|R
25|$|In 1835 Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt {{who ruled}} Jerusalem at the time, {{permitted}} <b>the</b> refurbishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogues</b> {{which had been}} denied since their construction. At the entrance to <b>the</b> Istanbuli <b>Synagogue</b> is a plaque commemorating the restoration.|$|R
5|$|In February 2014, Rabbi Cohen {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} become rabbi of Temple Emanuel Sinai in Worcester, Massachusetts who ratified her contract during a special congregational meeting on March 9, 2014. The vote was near-unanimous in favor of hiring Rabbi Cohen. Ted Riter served as the interim rabbi until a more permanent rabbi was available. Since then, as of August 2016, Rabbi Jeffrey Kurtz-Lendner became the rabbi <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{following}} Goldfarb's retirement, {{the synagogue}} hired {{a series of}} part-time rabbis, including Goldfarb's grandson, Henry D. Michelman, who served as rabbi from 1967 to 1971. Michelman, who would later become the Executive Vice President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Synagogue</b> Council of America, was, like his grandfather, a talented musician, composing music for synagogues and churches, writing scores for television films for ABC, A, CNBC, and PBS, and serving as Chairman of the American Society of Jewish Music.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} by the British architectural firm Gostling & Morris of Bombay. The basement part of the edifice is built in stone masonry and the superstructure is built in brick masonry. The exterior facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> is painted turquoise. The sanctuary within {{the interior of the}} building is in western direction, towards Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Many Modern Orthodox synagogues, {{and many}} synagogues of other Jewish movements, have the Israeli flag with <b>the</b> Star <b>of</b> David {{prominently}} displayed at <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogues</b> near <b>the</b> Ark containing the Torah scrolls.|$|R
5|$|Aaron Wise, {{father of}} Stephen Samuel Wise, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue's</b> {{earliest}} rabbis, from 1874 to 1875. This {{was his first}} rabbinical position in the United States, before moving to Congregation Rodeph Sholom in Manhattan.|$|R
50|$|Honorary Dean Rabbi Herzel Kranz {{wanted the}} {{religious}} school {{to continue to}} be connected to <b>the</b> <b>synagogue,</b> and he called a meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue's</b> board <b>of</b> directors to replace the religious school's board <b>of</b> directors. <b>The</b> religious school's board of directors said Rabbi Kranz had no authority to call for such a meeting.|$|R
5|$|Philip W. Jaffa, ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1928, joined as rabbi in 1935. He {{adopted the}} Reform Judaism's Union Prayer Book and its {{religious}} school curriculum, and added choir {{music to the}} services. That year much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> building was destroyed by a fire, and Jaffa's whole library was lost. The congregation re-built the structure, extensively remodeling the sanctuary, and added a religious school building/classroom annex. Jaffa would serve until 1938.|$|E
5|$|Among several {{projects}} for memorials, Zvi Hecker designed the solemn Page Memorial (1996) with Micha Ullmann and Eyal Weizman. This site-specific memorial commemorates the Jewish community of Kreuzberg, and their Lindenstrasse synagogue {{which was designed}} in 1891 by architects Cremer & Wolffenstein. What was {{once one of the}} largest religious buildings in Berlin, with a capacity of 1800; was ruined by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. On the original floor plan, the benches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> were recreated in concrete, and where the bimah stood, trees are now planted. The designers conceived of the benches as sentences on the pages of the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|Only {{one in five}} Croatian Jews {{survived the}} Holocaust of World War II. Between 1948 and 1952, nearly {{one half of the}} {{surviving}} members of Jewish Community of Zagreb opted for emigration to Israel, and the community dropped to one-tenth of its pre-war membership. The Yugoslav communist regime nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, including the plot in Praška Street. All this, combined with the new regime's general hostility toward religion, made reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> nearly impossible.|$|E
50|$|As <b>of</b> 2016, <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> had a {{membership}} of about 250 families.|$|R
2500|$|Despite <b>the</b> {{possibility}} <b>of</b> synagogue-like spaces {{prior to}} <b>the</b> Revolt, <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> {{emerged as a}} stronghold for Jewish worship upon <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple. For Jews living in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolt, <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> functioned as a [...] "portable system <b>of</b> worship". Within <b>the</b> <b>synagogue,</b> Jews worshipped by way of prayer rather than sacrifices, which had previously served as <b>the</b> main form <b>of</b> worship within <b>the</b> Second Temple.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Stern Thom Fehler Architects, a new {{purpose-built}} synagogue {{building at}} Lichfield Gardens was opened on 8 March 1987 by Chief Rabbi Sir Immanuel Jakobovits and Rabbi Moshe Barron. A rabbi's house was later built on part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue's</b> car park.|$|R
5|$|The synagogue's eight {{valuable}} Torah scrolls {{were saved}} {{due to an}} intervention by Leonardo Grivičić, an entrepreneur and industrialist who lived next door from Mile Budak, a minister in the Ustaša government. He was also close to Poglavnik Ante Pavelić and the Third Reich's ambassador to Croatia, Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. Although Grivičić {{did not have a}} significant political role in the Independent State of Croatia, he was considered trustworthy. On October 9, 1941, he learned about the regime's plan to start the demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> on the following morning. By that evening, Grivičić secretly relayed the information to the synagogue's chief cantor, Grüner, and during the night, the Torah scrolls were moved to safety.|$|E
5|$|With the {{annexation}} of Jerusalem by Egypt in 1831, a new opportunity arose for the Perushim. They petitioned Muhammad Ali regarding the rebuilding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue,</b> but concerns about deviating from longstanding Muslim {{tradition and the}} Pact of Umar (which restricted the repair or construction of non-Muslim houses of worship) meant permission was not forthcoming. However, {{five months after the}} earthquake of May 1834, the prohibition was relaxed and the Sephardim were allowed to carry out repair works to their existing synagogues. This consent gave rise to further efforts by the Ashkenazim to receive authorisation to rebuild theirs.|$|E
5|$|Between 1808 and 1812 {{another group}} of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania. They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled {{in the city of}} Safed to the north. Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound. They were worried, however, that {{descendants}} of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid's followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem. They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim to take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The Hasidim claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land were greater.|$|E
2500|$|Named Chesed-El {{which means}} [...] "Grace <b>of</b> God", <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> was {{completed}} in 1905.|$|R
25|$|In September 1907, the Edmonton Hebrew Association {{also created}} the Edmonton Talmud Torah for the community's five children, and {{purchased}} its first Torah scroll. The Edmonton Talmud Torah would operate out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue's</b> location for over twelve years, {{and later became}} Canada's first Jewish day school.|$|R
2500|$|Originally, the Israeli cabinet {{had planned}} to destroy <b>synagogues</b> in <b>the</b> settlement, but the {{government}} caved in to pressure from religious Jewish organizations and reversed its decision. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogues</b> were destroyed by Palestinian mobs immediately after the evacuation. Abu Abir, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Popular Resistance Committees terrorist organization, commented that [...] "The looting and burning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogues</b> was a great joy...It was in an unplanned expression of happiness that these synagogues were destroyed." [...] Later, in 2007, {{it was reported that}} [...] "The ruins of two large synagogues in Gush Katif, the evacuated Jewish communities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gaza Strip, have been transformed into a military base used by Palestinian groups to fire rockets at Israeli cities and train for attacks against the Jewish state, according to a senior terror leader in Gaza." ...|$|R
25|$|The new synagogue {{was inaugurated}} in 1927. Amram Aburbeh, the {{official}} owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Synagogue,</b> served as its Rabbi. For {{a few years}} he was a resident in an apartment designated {{for him and his}} family {{on the first floor of}} the building until he built a house nearby. The apartment then became the residence of Haim Kobi, the Gabai <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Synagogue,</b> and his family for the next 40 years.|$|E
25|$|The Synagogue Church is a Melkite Greek Catholic Church at the {{traditional}} site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> where Jesus preached (Luke 4).|$|E
25|$|In 1968, the 400th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> {{was celebrated}} in a {{ceremony}} attended by Indira Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|After the Nazis came {{to power}} in 1933, anti-Semitic and {{organized}} and discriminatory laws and dictatorship also came to Hanover, especially targeting Jews. For this reason Israel Alter immigrated in 1935 first to South Africa. He became cantor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>synagogue</b> <b>of</b> Johannesburg, <b>the</b> <b>synagogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Hebrew Congregation. In 1961, Alter immigrated to USA, where he worked as cantor in New York.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>synagogue</b> {{building}} reflects <b>the</b> dual influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern European {{background of}} its founders and the existing local Protestant Christian churches. It shares some features common to <b>the</b> other <b>synagogues</b> built in Sullivan County at that time. On the exterior, the former influence is strongest in the dual turrets on the facade, scaled-down {{versions of a}} common motif <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogues</b> <b>of</b> Eastern Europe. <b>The</b> projecting gallery below them and colored glass in the exterior also reflect those building traditions.|$|R
2500|$|The holy scrolls were {{dragged out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>synagogues</b> and burned. [...] According to the Press, many Jews wearing prayer shawls and talith {{went into the}} fires to save the scrolls, and were all killed. [...] Ezergailis {{disputes}} this, stating that no one entered the flames {{trying to save the}} holy scrolls.|$|R
