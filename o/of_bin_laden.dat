5|$|In-person identification: One or {{two women}} from the compound, {{including}} one of bin Laden's wives, identified bin Laden's body. A wife <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> called him by name during the raid, inadvertently assisting in his identification by U.S. armed forces on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Despite what {{officials}} {{described as}} an extraordinarily concentrated collection effort {{leading up to the}} operation, no U.S. spy agency was ever able to capture a photograph <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> at the compound before the raid or a recording of the voice of the mysterious male figure whose family occupied the structure's top two floors.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} had no Internet or landline telephone service. Its residents burned their refuse, {{unlike their}} neighbors, who set their garbage out for collection. Local residents called the building the Waziristan Haveli, {{because they believed}} the owner was from Waziristan. Following the American raid and killing <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012.|$|E

50|$|Considered {{the eldest}} son <b>of</b> Mohammed <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> the founder <b>of</b> Saudi Binladin Group and a {{half-brother}} <b>of</b> Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was educated at Millfield and acted as the patriarch <b>of</b> the <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> family after the 1967 death of his father. Salem managed the family's extensive investment portfolio and {{was in charge of}} family income distribution. He also oversaw the individual education plans for each of his (half-) brothers and (half-) sisters. Just like his father, he highly valued close relationship <b>of</b> the <b>bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> with the Saudi royal family. He provided means and support to the family during the Mecca uprising of 1979.|$|R
50|$|Omar bin Osama bin Mohammed <b>bin</b> Awad <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> (عمر بن أسامة بن محمد بن عوض بن لادن, ʿUmar bin ʾUsāmah bin Muḥammad bin ʿAwaḍ bin Lādin; born 1981), {{better known}} as Omar <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> is one <b>of</b> the sons <b>of</b> Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and his first wife and first cousin Najwa Ghanem (see <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> family). He is the fourth-eldest son among 20 {{children}} <b>of</b> Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> Older reports have described Omar and his brother Abdallah <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> as nephews or cousins <b>of</b> Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b>|$|R
5|$|On May 11, {{selected}} {{members of}} Congress (the congressional leadership {{and those who}} serve on the House and Senate intelligence, homeland security, judiciary, foreign relations, and armed forces committees) were shown 15 bin Laden photos. In an interview with Eliot Spitzer, Senator Jim Inhofe said {{that three of the}} photos were <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> alive for identification reference. Three other photos were of the burial-at-sea ceremony.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> some {{officials}} from the Bush administration, such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden's hideout. Mukasey said that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to reveal the nickname of bin Laden's courier.|$|E
5|$|Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani {{intelligence}} sources {{stated that the}} U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani walk-in seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse subsequently reported that their sources indicated a walk-in was an extremely valuable asset, though the sources disputed that the walk-in knew the location <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family. The White House denied Hersh's report.|$|E
50|$|American {{officials}} {{have reported that}} the late al Qaeda leader Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> had numerous bodyguards. They reported that the detainees held in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp included at least 30 <b>of</b> <b>Bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> bodyguards.|$|R

5|$|U.S. {{officials}} {{said there were}} 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden. Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors. The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound. Because {{of a lack of}} verifiable information, some of what follows is thinly sourced.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E

25|$|Supporters <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{have also}} pointed to reports {{according}} to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad attacked towns at night or with catapults, and argued {{that he must have}} condoned incidental harm to noncombatants, since it would have been impossible to distinguish them from combatants during such attacks.
