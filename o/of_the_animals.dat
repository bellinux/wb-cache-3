5|$|Ice's pet wallaroo, Bucky, and pet goat, Pancho, {{escaped from}} his Port St. Lucie, Florida home in November 2004. After {{wandering}} around local streets {{for over a}} week, the animals were caught and returned to Ice. He paid a $220 fine for expired pet tags and an undisclosed fine for the escape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> in the spruce-fir forest have ranges {{that extend}} into the balsam fir forest higher up. Warblers are abundant; {{more than ten}} species exist in this forest type. Other common birds include brown-capped chickadees, spruce grouse, and yellow-capped woodpeckers. Mammals include the red {{squirrel}} and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns further enlivened the {{academic}} regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce {{performed by the}} students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Animals,</b> with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, {{more than twenty years}} after he left the Niedermeyer school.|$|E
50|$|The speed cells fire in {{response}} to variations in speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> It was also found that unlike place cells, the speed cells are independent of visual cues. Darkness did not influence <b>the</b> firing rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> Another interesting feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells is that <b>the</b> firing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells is better correlated with <b>the</b> future speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> suggesting that <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> is known in advance by the speed cells.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is divided}} into four {{geographic}} areas. Each animal's area is accompanied by an illustrated board with the name and description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> <b>the</b> specifics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal's</b> enclosure, and <b>the</b> dangers to <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> in its natural environment.|$|R
5000|$|Enclosures {{should be}} built {{keeping in mind}} — firstly, <b>the</b> comfort <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> (including a private shelter), {{secondly}} for <b>the</b> convenience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> keeper, and finally for <b>the</b> viewing comfort <b>of</b> visitors.|$|R
5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> {{in the park}} appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. About three to ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top}} of a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the quake, and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the quake. During the quake, some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and stared at the walls of their enclosures. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the quake.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Animals,</b> Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Animals.</b> The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5|$|The many {{sedimentary}} layers on this coastline {{are rich}} with fossils, the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> and plants {{present in the}} area whose tissues became immersed in deposits of mud which later hardened into rock. At Lyme Regis, for example, geologists have identified 71 layers of rock, each one containing fossils of a different species of ammonite.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} six {{pieces were}} recorded at the Medinah Temple in Chicago, {{performed by the}} Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Levine. Pines of Rome was re-arranged in 1993 by Bruce Coughlin, who reduced the four-movement piece by cutting the second movement and trimming sections of {{the third and fourth}} movements. The piece was recorded on March 28, 1994. The second recording involved Symphony No. 5, Carnival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Animals,</b> and Pomp and Circumstance, on April 25, 1994. Carnival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Animals,</b> Finale uses two pianos played by Gail Niwa and Philip Sabransky. Pomp and Circumstance was arranged by Peter Schickele and features the Chicago Symphony Chorus and soprano soloist Kathleen Battle. The next recording took place on April 24, 1995 for Piano Concerto No. 2 with pianist Yefim Bronfman. On September 28, 1996, The Firebird was the final piece to be recorded; its session lasted for three hours. The piece was arranged using four sections from Stravinsky's 1919 revision of the score.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to {{many animals}} that {{need a place}} to live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. Animals that are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Addax {{are easy}} to hunt due to their slow movements. Roadkill, {{firearms}} for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are highly prized. Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more human settlements and agriculture. Less than 500 individuals are thought {{to exist in the}} wild today, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> being found between the Termit area of Niger, the Bodélé region of western Chad, and the Aoukar in Mauritania.|$|E

50|$|A forever home is <b>the</b> home <b>of</b> an adopter who {{agrees to}} be {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> for its entire life. There are two basic understandings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept. A broad interpretation simply says that <b>the</b> adopter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pet agrees that <b>the</b> <b>animal's</b> well-being is now their personal responsibility for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal's</b> life. If <b>the</b> adopter can no longer keep <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> for any reason, they would need {{to be responsible}} for finding a healthy and happy home for <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> and making sure that <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new home are taking good care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> its life. Should the adopter die before <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> they should have a plan in place for <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> A more restrictive view that some shelters attempt to integrate as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adoption agreement puts conditions on when and why the adopter could arrange to move <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> to a new family. For example, forever home agreements might specify that the adopter will not get rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> for trivial reasons, or that the adopter will always be sure that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> will be permitted should they move to a new residence. Some agreements might specify allergies or violent behavior on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> as reasons allowable for an adopter to relinquish <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|R

5|$|Alligators {{have created}} a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed upon some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> that come to the hole.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> that draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region. Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, a bonus was introduced to reward farmers who retained their best bulls, even though they were not productive. The increase in weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> began with improved grassland. The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of fertilizers and improved pastures such as clover and ryegrass, which not only improved the productivity of existing fields but also transformed the moorland pasture. Vineyards affected by phylloxera were also being returned to pasture.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of federal {{authorities}} before sentencing, Vick agreed to deposit nearly $1 million in an escrow account with attorneys to reimburse others for the costs of caring for the confiscated dogs, {{most of which were}} being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court-appointed specialist. Experts said some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> would require special care {{for the rest of their}} lives. During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.|$|E
5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E
5|$|Cooper, Truman and Brennan visit a {{veterinarian}} connected to Gerard; they find twine there {{of the type}} used to bind Laura. They believe that the bird that clawed her body is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> being treated there, and confiscate the practice's files in order to locate the owners of birds being treated there. They learn that the scratches {{have been caused by}} a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, interrupting Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the shirt is recovered as evidence.|$|E

5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by the responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Emilia Martins' 1998 study {{compared}} the head-bob displays {{from the source}} population on Cuba with these animals on Isla Magueyes. The durations and pauses were longer {{by as much as}} 350% in the feral population. In comparison, the blue iguana of Grand Cayman's head-bob displays differed from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> on Cuba by only about 20%. The rapid change in display structure between the colony of animals on Isla Magueyes and those on Cuba illustrated the potential of small founding population size as a catalyst to evolution with regard to communication or display. In this case the difference was by only six generations at most.|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} {{has been}} done {{in many parts of the}} world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> {{although}} {{prominent in}} literature, are often overlooked as sources for rigorous analysis. When acknowledged, their interpretation {{is restricted to}} <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> archetypal significance and rarely explored beyond <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> their mention. By examining <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> (more specifically canine characterization) as it appears in Ken Kesey's 1962 novel, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," this thesis demonstrates ways that the biological and behavioural elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> used to characterize humans is critical to exposing any given text's underlying sociopolitical commentary - in this instance, the parallels that exist between human civilization and <b>the</b> domestication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> With that in mind, this project combines biological and behavioural research <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> with anarcho-primitive theory and psychology in order to question and reorient the perceived boundaries between humans and animals, {{as well as between}} civilization and wildness. Reading animal characterization from such a perspective is an important way for literary critics to take part in and revise some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emerging conversations in <b>the</b> broader field <b>of</b> <b>Animal</b> Studies...|$|R
