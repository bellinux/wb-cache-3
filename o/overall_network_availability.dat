40|$|Telecommunications {{networks}} need {{to guarantee}} that all node pairs involved in critical service communications are highly available. Here we adopt a novel approach {{to the problem of}} how to provide high levels of availability in an efficient manner. The basic idea is to embed at the physical layer a high availability set of links and nodes (termed the spine) in the network topology to support protection and routing in providing end-to-end availability. We first explore the spine concept through simple topologies illustrating the potential benefits of the approach in improving the <b>overall</b> <b>network</b> <b>availability</b> and the capability to support quality of resilience classes. Then, we study how the structural properties of a network topology can be used to determine heuristics to select a suitable spine and compare this with the case where all network components have the same availability. This is followed by a numerical based study comparing the heuristics with all possible spanning tree based spines for sample topologies. Our results demonstrate how to best design a physical network to support protection methods in achieving high levels of availability efficiently...|$|E

In this paper, we have {{analyzed}} <b>network</b> <b>availability</b> of sensor grids in {{the context}} of criticality of individual nodes in ensuring network connectivity that form such grids. By assuming staircase traversal to adjacent neighbors only, we consider the <b>network</b> <b>availability</b> of a two dimensional grid.

Through the interpretation of the stochastic model we have obtained, the usability of our schemes can be duly verified...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTo improve {{the efficiency of}} communications among unmanned systems, the research focused on the novel use of asymmetric polarized MIMO and <b>network</b> <b>availability.</b> The dissertation objective was to maintain the highest <b>network</b> <b>availability</b> for a mobile ad hoc network with heterogeneous communication capabilities. Using a hybrid dual-polarized Rayleigh fading channel model, asymmetric antenna configurations were studied in simulation for bit error rate and capacity. For a 11 configuration, polarization reciprocity was used to exploit the polarized channel knowledge, thereby maximizing received uplink power. The optimum gains to maximize uplink capacity were also derived for varying channel cross-polarization values. Larger configurations of 21 and 22 were investigated, including overlays of orthogonal space-time block coding, which improved diversity performance in the polarized channels. Extending these link results to realistic scenarios with unmanned systems, a reference point group mobility model including large-scale propagation was proposed to compute the <b>network</b> <b>availability.</b> Another scenario detailed robot exploration of unknown environments, which included large-scale path loss models. While deploying the network, the factors of exploration strategies, signal thresholds and routing were shown to impact the availability metric. Lastly, four extensible formation models were analyzed for their influence on <b>network</b> <b>availability.</b> Civilian, United States Nav...|$|R

We conclude that staircase lattice path traversal offers comparative increase in <b>network</b> <b>availability</b> for small to medium sized sensor grids over Delannoy number based lattice path traversal. The later is a better candidate for large networks especially for wide spatial distribution of sensor nodes. Furthermore Delannoy data relay model offers better resilience to unavailable paths in sensor networks that implement sleep mode for energy conservation...|$|R

The reliability of communication network depends on various components, for example, the reliability of hardware communication devices, the stability of communication protocols and software systems, the availability of sufficient capacity of network resources, and the reliability of network operators. Current research focuses on a specific one of these reliability components. For example, research on fault-tolerant systems targets the reliability of individual communication devices, circuits, and systems. Research on communication protocols targets their stability.

30|$|<b>Network</b> <b>availability</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in streaming data [49], and in-turn affects data availability. In case of high network latency, the incoming data streams from different synchrophasors get delayed or lost, causing applications to perceive them as missing or incomplete. Hence, <b>network</b> <b>availability</b> can be considered an indirect attribute affecting quality. This can be mitigated if the overlying applications are programmed to account for the delays, or if a more lenient waiting time limit is set. However, the second solution is dependent on the kind of applications the synchrophasors cater to. The latency requirements for synchrophasors recommended by the standards are very stringent.|$|R
