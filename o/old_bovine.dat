40|$|The {{determination}} of cellular senescence characteristics {{is fundamental to}} the understanding of ageing and age-related diseases such as cancer. In this context the study of telomeres, the molecular clocks of the cells, and the evaluation of their length represents an alternative model system for studying replicative senescence and living beings ageing. In the present work the mean telomeric length of white blood cells was studied in bovines of different age by FISH and flow cytometry. The results have shown an effective and statistically significative reduction of the relative telomeric length (RTL) in relation to the chronological age of the animals. A greater RTL was found in the new-borns, a reduced RTL was found in the older group (upper to 7 years old) and middle RTLs were found in the other two groups (2 - 3 years <b>old</b> <b>bovines</b> and 11 - 12 months <b>old</b> <b>bovines).</b> However it still remains to be investigated the variability of RTL that has been found among the animals within the same group which has also been shown in other species like humans and may be implicated in different longevity...|$|R

Our objective was to test whether HA was also effective in an IL- 1 damage model and whether this repair was stable and occurred in <b>older</b> <b>bovine</b> cartilage. Design: Bovine cartilage explants from 18 -month-old or 6 -year-old bovines in 10 % serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were exposed to Fn-f or to IL- 1 {{and the ability of}} 1 mg/ml HA of 800 kDa to block damage or promote restoration of proteoglycan (PG) after the damage was measured. The damage phase as well as the exposure to HA were varied. Results: Exposure of exogenous HA decreased Fn-f-mediated damage, but did not decrease IL- 1 β-induced cartilage damage. If explants from 18 -month-old bovines were damaged by a 7 -day exposure to Fn-f or IL- 1 β and then exposed for 7 days to HA, PG was restored. This reparative activity persisted up to 4 weeks after the removal of HA from the culture medium. The restoration of PG did not occur in 0. 1 % serum-free cultures, was less when the exposure to the Fn-f was doubled and failed when exposure to IL- 1 β was doubled. In explants from 6 -year-old bovines damaged with IL- 1 β for 7 days, HA fully restored PG content to normal levels. Conclusions: The reparative activities of HA occur not only in a Fn-f damage model, but also in an IL- 1 damage model and occur with <b>older</b> <b>bovine</b> cartilage...|$|R

40|$|Degeneration of the {{intervertebral}} discs (IVD) is {{a leading}} cause of neck and low back pain. Degeneration begins in the central nucleus pulposus region, leading to loss of IVD osmotic properties. Regeneration approaches include administration of matrix-mimicking scaffolds, cells and/or therapeutic factors. Cell-targeting strategies are likely to improve delivery due to the low cell numbers in the IVD. Single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) that bind IVD cells were isolated for potential delivery of therapeutics to degenerated IVD. The most cell-distal domain of neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM 1) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Phage display technology was used to isolate a human scFv against the recombinant domain by panning a scFv library on the immobilised protein. The isolated scFv bound cultured rat astrocytes, as well as bovine nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells in immunocytochemical studies. The scFv also labelled cells in bovine spinal cord and six-month and two-year <b>old</b> <b>bovine</b> IVD sections by immunohistochemistry.

Several NDT methods including electromagnetic (EM) -based e. g. X-ray and Infrared; ultrasound; and S-waves have been proposed for medical applications. This paper evaluates the viability of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, an EM method for rapid non-destructive evaluation of articular cartilage.

Multivariate statistical analysis-based predictive models relating articular cartilage NIR spectra to these characterising parameters were developed.

We therefore conclude that NIR can be used to determine, nondestructively, the physical and functional characteristics of articular cartilage...|$|E

Cryopreservation of mammalian embryo has great importance for genetic resources conservation, embryo transfer, veterinary and clinical reproductive biotechnology and animal assisted reproductive technologies. Immature oocytes were maturated then fertilized with frozen-thawed bull semen and cultured until blastocyst stage in commercial sequential culture medium for 8 days. Blastocysts were vitrified in two different groups as SSV and classic vitrification and non-vitrified blastocysts were used as control group. After vitrification, vitrified blastocysts were warmed and cultured for 1 day. For this aim, blastocyst viability rate and median cell number were investigated. The blastocyst viability rate that vitrified by classic vitrification (34. 8 %) were found to be lower than those vitrified by SSV (82. 6 %) and control group blastocysts (100 %). However, median cell numbers of vitrified-warmed blastocysts were found higher in SSV (124) than classic vitrification (104). Median cell number of control group was detected as 213. As a result, blastocyst viability rate and median cell number in SSV group was higher than classic vitrification group, there was a significant difference between SSV and classic vitrification group (p< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Prion cell tropism varies {{significantly}} among animal species, {{depending on}} both the agent strain and host-specific factors. For example, prions show high lymphotropism in scrapie infected sheep and vCJD, but little, if any, in sCJD or BSE. In particular, the BSE strain is associated with significant PrP-res accumulation in tonsils, spleen and appendix in humans, whereas it is largely confined to the nervous system in infected cattle. Therefore, {{at least in the}} case of BSE and vCJD, it appears that host properties can influence the accumulation of the infectious agent in lymphoid organs. Mature FDC {{play an important role in}} prion pathogenesis, since neuroinvasion following peripheral challenge is significantly impaired in their absence. The proximity between these FDC and sympathetic nerve endings is known to affect the speed of prion neuroinvasion. In this study, we analysed the mucosal innervation and the interface between nerve fibres and FDC in bovine and human tonsils and in ileal and jejunal bovine Peyer’s patches using a panel of antibodies observed by confocal microscopy. Since differences in the innervation of lymphoid organs depending on age have been reported, we analysed three categories of bovine ages (new born calves, calves less than 12 months <b>old</b> and <b>bovines</b> <b>older</b> than 24 months) and two categories of human ages (patients less than 5 years old and patients older than 25 years). In both species, hypothetical ways of innervation by-passing germinal centre could be postulated: nerve fibres are widely distributed in antigens/cells traffic area (the lamina propria, the interfollicular zone, the suprafollicular dome in Peyer’s patches and the lymphoepithelial area in tonsils). We pointed out that, only in ileal and jejunal Peyer’s patches and in tonsils of <b>bovines</b> <b>older</b> than 24 months, nerve fibres are observed to be in contact with FDC. In contrast, in human tonsils, no nerve fibres established contact with FDC, whatever the age. Thus, innervation of germinal centres can be said to be an age-dependent dynamic process in bovines and a weak innervation of the secondary lymphoid organs could thus be a rate-limiting step to neuroinvasion in humans. This variation could influence the way of neuroinvasion and thus, the differences of susceptibility of bovines and humans to the BSE agent. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{regard to}} BSE and vCJD, the agent tropism for lymphoid tissues is {{completely}} different even if the infectious strain responsible and the way of inoculation are identical. During vCJD, the infectious agent crosses the digestive barrier and multiplies in lymphoid organs, before progressively reaching the brain. Indeed, in vCJD, it accumulates in the ileum, tonsils, spleen and appendix of infected individuals. In contrast, in cattle, the BSE agent has a low affinity for lymphoid tissues and mainly accumulates in the nervous system. During preclinical stages, infectivity, other than that in the peripheral nervous system or central nervous system, is confined in the distal ileum of orally infected cattle. So, it appears that, {{at least in the}} case of BSE and vCJD, host properties can influence the accumulation of the infectious agent in lymphoid organs. Objectives and methods: In this study, we analysed by confocale microscopy the mucosal innervation and the interface between nerve fibres and FDC in bovine and human tonsils using a panel of antibodies. Since differences in the innervation of lymphoid organs depending on species and on age have been reported, we analysed two categories of bovines (calves less than 12 months <b>old</b> and <b>bovines</b> <b>older</b> than 24 months) and two categories of humans (patients less than 5 years old and patients older than 25 years).

The weak innervation of the secondary lymphoid organs could thus be a rate-limiting step to neuroinvasion in humans. This species difference could influence the way of neuroinvasion and thus, the susceptibility of bovines and humans to the BSE agent. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analyses}} of the chemical state of the 16 c residue of the alpha 1 chain of bone collagen were performed on samples from fetal (4 - 6 -month embryo) and mature (2 - 3 year <b>old)</b> <b>bovine</b> animals. All of this residue could be accounted for in terms of three chemical states, in relative amounts which depended upon {{the age of the}} animal. Most of the residue was incorporated into either bifunctional or trifunctional cross-links. Some of it, however, was present as free aldehyde, and the content increased with maturation. This was established by isolating and characterizing the aldehyde-containing peptides generated by tryptic digestion of NaB 3 H 4 -reduced mature bone collagen. We have concluded that the connectivity of COOH-terminal cross-linking in bone collagen fibrils changes with maturation in the following way: at first, each 16 c residue in each of the two alpha 1 chains of the collagen molecule is incorporated into a sheet-like pattern of intermolecular iminium cross-links, which stabilizes the young, nonmineralized fibril as a whole. In time, some of these labile cross-links maturate into pyridinoline while others dissociate back to their precursor form. The latter is likely due to changes in the molecular packing brought about by the mineralization of the collagen fibrils. The resultant reduction in cross-linking connectivity may provide a mechanism for enhancing certain mechanical characteristics of the skeleton of a mature animal...|$|E

Metacarpal bones were dissected aseptically from the fetal calf (Holstein) and all soft tissues were removed. Radiographs were taken to determine the growth plate’s margins and limitations. With an oscillating osteotome, proximal and distal growth plates were cut and retrieved under aseptic conditions. The retrieved growth plate was then sliced. The demineralization process was performed as described by Reddi and Huggins [34]. The harvested growth plates were cleaned of soft tissue and marrow, washed in sterile distilled water with continuous stirring, then washed three times in 95  % ethanol for 15  min, rinsed in ether for 15  min, and finally air-dried overnight. The cleaned and dried growth plates were milled (Universal Mill A- 20; Tekmer Co, Cincinnati, OH, USA) to obtain 400 – 700 -μm granules and then demineralized in 0.6 -N HCl three times for 1  h (50  ml HCl per g of bone). The growth plate powder was rinsed with several changes of sterile distilled water to adjust the pH, three times in 95  % ethanol and once in ether. The growth plate powder was air-dried and stored in sterile plastic containers at 4  °C until being used for implantation. This entire process was performed under sterile conditions (except for the milling) and a sample was cultured to demonstrate that specimens contained no bacterial or fungal contamination.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} i s to re- examine the topic of bone cutting from a micro-structural perspective. For this purpose, a methodology consisting of four major steps was developed: (1) identification of the micro-structural architecture via an automatic methodology for identifying the various microstructures in an optical image taken from (2 -year <b>old)</b> <b>bovine</b> femur cortical bone slice, (2) enhancing bone images at the microstructure level and, later, segregating the micro-constituents of the bone as separate images using MATLAB's artificial intelligence (AI) modules and based on pulsed coupled neural networks (PCNN), (3) assigning mechanical properties for each AI- identified micro-phase in the imagery, and (4) generating an FEM model (DEFORM®) for the simulation of 2 D orthogonal bone cutting the results of which can predict the (macro) cutting forces. These simulated cutting forces, based on accounting for the microstructure constituents of the bone, agree with experimental data reported in the literature.

40|$|During {{preclinical}} {{stages of}} cattle orally infected with {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE), the responsible agent is confined to ileal Peyer's patches (IPP), namely in nerve fibers and in lymph follicles, before reaching the peripheral and central nervous systems. No infectivity {{has been reported in}} other bovine lymphoid organs, including jejunal Peyer's patches (JPP). To determine the potential sites for prion neuroinvasion in IPP, we analyzed the mucosal innervation and the interface between nerve fibers and follicular dendritic cells (FDC), two dramatic influences on neuroinvasion. Bovine IPP were studied at three ages, viz., newborn calves, calves less than 12 months <b>old,</b> and <b>bovines</b> <b>older</b> than 24 months, and the parameters obtained were compared with those of JPP. No differences in innervation patterns between IPP and JPP were found. The major difference observed was that, in calves of less than 12 months, IPP were the major mucosal-associated lymphoid organ that possessed a large number of follicles with extended FDC networks. Using a panel of antibodies, we showed that PP in 24 -month-old bovines were highly innervated at various strategic sites assumed {{to be involved in the}} invasion and replication of the BSE pathogen: the suprafollicular dome, T cell area, and germinal centers. In PP in calves of less than 12 months old, no nerve fibers positive for the neurofilament markers NF-L (70 kDa) and NF-H (200 kDa) were observed in contact with FDC. Thus, in view of the proportion of these protein subunits present in neurofilaments, the innervation of the germinal centers can be said to be an age-dependent dynamic process. This variation in innervation might influence the path of neuroinvasion and, thus, the susceptibility of bovines to the BSE agent. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The physis, or growth plate, is {{a complex}} {{disc-shaped}} cartilage structure {{that is responsible for}} longitudinal bone growth. In this study, a multi-scale computational approach was undertaken to better understand how physiological loads are experienced by chondrocytes embedded inside chondrons when subjected to moderate strain under instantaneous compressive loading of the growth plate. Models of representative samples of compressed bone/growth-plate/bone from a 0. 67 mm thick 4 -month <b>old</b> <b>bovine</b> proximal tibial physis were subjected to a prescribed displacement equal to 20 % of the growth plate thickness. At the macroscale level, the applied compressive deformation resulted in an overall compressive strain across the proliferative-hypertrophic zone of 17 %. The microscale model predicted that chondrocytes sustained compressive height strains of 12 % and 6 % in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones, respectively, in the interior regions of the plate. This pattern was reversed within the outer 300 μm region at the free surface where cells were compressed by 10 % in the proliferative and 26 % in the hypertrophic zones, in agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to study growth plate behavior under compression and illustrates the need for combining computational and experimental methods to better understand the chondrocyte mechanics in the growth plate cartilage. While the current model is relevant to fast dynamic events, such as heel strike in walking, we believe this approach provides new insight into the mechanical factors that regulate bone growth at the cell level and provides a basis for developing models to help interpret experimental results at varying time scales...|$|E
40|$|During normal {{activities}} bone is {{subjected to}} variety of combined mechanical stresses. When bone {{is subjected to}} a cyclical loading, within the bone tissue micro fractures occur which can accumulate with time. The combination of both the bone weakening effects caused by micro fractures accumulation and natural bone resorption can lead to severe stress fractures. Bending is a complex load application mode which takes place when a non-axial, offset force is applied, producing tension {{on one side and}} compression on the other. The purpose of present investigation is to describe the experimental research performed on physiologically wet bovine compact bone specimens in the cyclic three point bending test. Specimens in the form of rectangular beams (45 – 50) ×(4 – 8) ×(2 – 4) mm were machined from the mid-diaphysis of fresh one year <b>old</b> <b>bovine</b> femur. The first series of experiments were conducted with minimum cyclic stress level (σmin) from about 10 MPa to maximum cyclic stress level (σmax) less than 50 % of the ultimate flexural stress (σ*).

Mechanical properties from experimental test data were calculated. The results indicate that relative cyclic strain range increases with increasing the number of loading cycles and this strain range increment has maximum in second load cycle, however relative cyclic strain range increase decreases for each consecutive load cycle.

40|$|Degeneration of the {{intervertebral}} discs (IVD) is {{a leading}} cause of neck and low back pain. While its aetiology is poorly understood, it is known to begin in the central nucleus pulposus region, leading to degradation of the extracellular matrix and loss of the osmotic, and ultimately mechanical, properties of the IVD. Many current treatments for lower back pain alleviate the pain temporarily but do not restore disc function. Biological regeneration approaches under investigation include administration of matrix-mimicking scaffolds, cells and/or therapeutic factors. Cell-targeting strategies are likely to improve the delivery of therapeutic moieties due to the low cell numbers in the IVD. Single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) that bind IVD cells were isolated for potential delivery of therapeutics to restore disc function. Neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM 1) was identified as a potential cell surface marker of IVD cells. The most cell-distal domain of NCAM 1 was cloned and expressed in the Escherichia coli periplasm. Phage display technology was used to isolate a human scFv against the recombinant domain by panning a scFv library on the immobilised protein. Binding of the isolated B 5 scFv was confirmed by ELISA and the scFv bound cultured rat astrocytes, as well as bovine nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells in immunocytochemical studies. The scFv also successfully labelled cells in bovine spinal cord and six-month and two-year <b>old</b> <b>bovine</b> IVD sections by immunohistochemistry. Taken together, these results illustrate the NCAM 1 -binding potential of B 5 scFv and support a role for the scFv in targeting therapeutics to IVD cells for regeneration of the intervertebral disc. It is anticipated that the described scFv will be employed for targeted gene delivery to IVD cells using scFv-functionalised nanoparticles.

Contagious disease was the major cause of mortality at < 6 months, with trauma, accidents and infertility more important in <b>older</b> animals. <b>Bovine</b> respiratory disease (BRD) and diarrhoea were the most common diseases.

The causative pathogens for BRD were harder to identify, with large differences between levels of farmer- and veterinarian- diagnosed disease and higher incidences in North America (around 16 %) than Europe (around 3 %). Analysis of the risk factors for disease and mortality highlighted that closed herds, good hygiene and availability of roughage were consistently associated with improved outcomes. Some common practices were challenged by the results of large, prospective studies. Calf diarrhoea was only weakly associated with good passive transfer of immunity via colostrum, suggesting other control strategies are required.

This study used CMR to assess 23 patients with acromegaly or GHD, before and after treatment of their GH disorder, and 23 healthy controls. Patients with acromegaly demonstrated increased left ventricular mass index (LVMi), end diastolic volume index, stroke volume index and cardiac index, which persisted at one year, despite treatment of underlying disease. Patients with GHD demonstrated LVMi at the bottom (males) or beneath (females) published normal references ranges, which increased with one year of GH replacement. The mechanisms by which GH influences cardiac tissue are poorly understood. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy-regulator enzyme, which interacts with several metabolic hormones. Mutations in AMPK cause arrhythmias and cardiac hypertrophy. AMPK activation may be a mechanism by which GH causes some of its cardiac effects.

A trend towards the same findings was seen in GHRKO mice. This indicates that both GH and IGF-I interact with myocardial AMPK, apparently via different mechanisms.

40|$|Question: The {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) has a limited regenerative potential and {{low back pain}} represents {{a leading cause of}} disability [1]. IVD repair strategies require an appropriate cell source that is able to regenerate the damaged tissue such as progenitor stem cells. Recently, progenitor cells that are positive for the angiopoietin re- ceptor (Tie 2) in the nucleus pulposus were identified [2]. Here we isolated primary cells from bovine IVD and sorted bovine nucleus pulposus progenitor cells (NPPC) for the marker Tie 2. Furthermorewe tested whether Tie 2 expressing cells can differentiate into os- teogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro. Methods: NP cells were obtained from 1 year <b>old</b> <b>bovine</b> tails by sequential digestion with pronase for 1 h and collagenase over- night. Sorted Tie 2 - and Tie 2 + cells were cultured in osteogenic and adipogenic medium for 3 weeks. The formed cell layers from both subpopulations were stained for calcium deposition and fat droplets. Colony forming units were prepared for both cell sus- pensions in methylcellulose-based medium and formed colonies ([10 cells) were analyzed macroscopically after 8 days. Results: After 3 weeks of culture, sorted Tie 2 + cells were able to differentiate into osteocytes and adipocytes as characterized by cal- cium deposition and fat droplet formation. By contrast, Tie 2 - cells generated a weak staining for calcium and no fat droplets were ob- tained (Fig. 1). Sorted Tie 2 - and Tie 2 + subpopulations of cells both formed colonies, however with different morphologies. The colonies formed from Tie 2 + cells were spheroid in shape whereas those from Tie 2 - cells were spread and fibroblastic. Conclusion: Our data showed that Tie 2 + cells of the nucleus pul- posus cells are progenitor-like cells that are able to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Sorting of NPPC for Tie 2 may represent a promising strategy with the potential {{to be used in the}} clinics for treatment of {{intervertebral disc}} damage. References 1.

40|$|Experimental {{results show}} that {{collagen}} ﬁbers exhibit stress relaxation under tension and a highly anisotropic distribution. To further develop the earlier model of Stender [1], the collagen constituent was updated to reﬂect its intrinsic viscoelasticity and anisotropic distribution, and integrated with an existing mixture model with glycosaminoglycans and ground substance matrix. A two-term Prony series expansion of the quasi-linear viscoelastic model was chosen to model the viscoelastic properties of the collagen ﬁbers. Material parameters were determined by using the simplex method to minimize the sum of squared errors between model results and experimental stress relaxation data of tissue in tension. Collagen elastic ﬁber modulus was calculated by ﬁtting to the equilibrium data and viscoelastic parameters were determined by ﬁtting to the relaxation curve. Results of newborn (~ 1 - 3 week <b>old)</b> untreated <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage explants from the patellar femoral groove as well as explants cultured in transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), from both the superﬁcial (~ 0 - 0. 5 mm from the articular surface) and middle (~ 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm from the articular surface) layers were compared {{to examine the effects}} of TGF- β 1. TGF-β 1 has been shown to maintain or even enhance mechanical properties of articular cartilage in compression and tension [2, 3] and this study continues with the hope that it may be used to improve tissue engineering of mature cartilage to better survive implantation in vivo for the successful repair of articular cartilage defects. Results show that TGF-β 1 has a maturational effect on collagen, causing the tissue to become stiffer through an increase in elastic collagen ﬁber modulus and less viscous through shorter relaxation time and less stress relaxation (tissue retained a higher percentage of residual stress). The results of this study further advance the understanding of the effects of location and treatment with TGF-β 1...|$|R

As reductions in schistosomiasis, a water-born parasitic infection, prompt consideration of schistosomiasis elimination, surveillance strategies that can signal reemergence and prevent further lapses in control are needed. We examined the distribution of Schistosoma japonicum, the species that causes schistosomiasis in China, in 53 villages. The villages were located in regions of Sichuan province where schistosomiasis reemergence had been documented by public health authorities. We tested three key reservoirs, humans, cows and water buffalo, and freshwater snails for S. japonicum infection {{in an effort to}} identify high-risk populations and evaluate their ability to signal reemergence. Human and bovine infections were common, detected in 35 villages and 23 villages, respectively, but infected snails were rare, found in only one village. Two commonly used surveillance methods, hospital reports of acute schistosomiasis and surveys for S. japonicum-infected snails, grossly underestimated the number of villages where human infections were present. Schistosomiasis was widespread in the region we studied, highlighting the danger reemergence poses to disease elimination programs. Surveillance systems that monitor high-risk populations such as <b>older</b> adults or <b>bovine</b> owners should be considered to promote detection of reemergence...|$|R
40|$|Neospora caninum e Hammondia heydorni são coccídeos formadores de cistos proximamente relacionados com outros organismos heteroxenos pertencentes ao filo Apicomplexa, como Toxoplasma gondii e Hammondia hammondi. Para saber se o cachorro-do-mato (Cerdocyon thous), um canídeo silvestre comumente encontrado do nordeste da Argentina ao nordeste da América do Sul, pode ser hospedeiro definitivo de N. caninum, exemplares de cachorro-do-mato foram alimentados com tecidos de bovinos e bubalinos naturalmente infectados por N. caninum. As fezes dos cachorros-do-mato foram colhidas e examinadas diariamente para pesquisa de oocistos. No primeiro experimento, {{masseter}} e cérebro (peça inteira dos dois órgãos) colhidos de dois bovinos de aproximadamente dois anos de idade, foram picados, misturados e fornecidos às quatro raposas em dois dias consecutivos. Duas raposas eliminaram oocistos sub-esféricos não esporulados medindo 10 - 13 µm no oitavo e nono dias pós-infecção, respectivamente. Uma das raposas eliminou oocistos por cinco e a outra nove dias. Amostras de DNA extraída dos de oocistos de cada dia de eliminação foram analisadas por PCR com primers grupo-específicos PCR-ITS- 1 e espécie-especificos Nc 5 -NPCR. Todas as amostras foram positivas por PCR-HSP- 70 e PCR-ITS- 1, mas negativas por Nc 5 -NPCR. A sequência de nucleotídeos PCR-ITS- 1 revelou 100 % de identidade com seqüências homólogas de H. Heydorni. Concluímos que H. heydorni também utiliza o cachorro-do-mato (Cerdocyon thous) como hospedeiro definitivo. O cachorro-do-mato é usualmente reportado em contato com rebanhos em diversas regiões do Brasil. Então, é razoável inferir que estes carnívoros possam exercer um importante papel nos ciclos silvestre e doméstico da infecção por H. heydorni. Em um segundo experimento, sete exemplares de cachorro-do-mato (Cerdocyon thous) foram alimentados com tecidos de 3 búfalos (Bubalus bubalis) naturalmente infectados por N. caninum. As fezes das raposas foram analisadas 30 dias antes e trinta depois da infecção experimental e nenhuma das raposas eliminou oocistos N. caninum-like nas fezes. Estes resultados sugerem que o cachorro-do-mato (Cerdocyon thous) não é hospedeiro definitivo de N. caninum, entretanto estudos adicionais são necessários. Neospora caninum and Hammondia heydorni are two cyst forming coccidians {{closely related}} to other apicomplexans, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Hammondia hammondi with a two host life-cycle. To clarify whether crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), a wild carnivore commonly found from northern Argentina to northern South America, can be final hosts of N. caninum, foxes were fed on tissues of cows and water buffaloes naturally infected with N. caninum. Faeces were examined from 30 days before to 30 days after infection. In experiment 1, the whole masseter muscle and brain from two-year <b>old</b> <b>bovines</b> are collected, minced and pooled together for the fox infection. The bovine pooled tissues were equally administered for four fox, in two consecutive days. Two foxes shed unsporulated oocysts subspherical in shape measuring 10 - 13 µm, after eight and nine days post-infection, respectively. One of the foxes eliminated oocysts for five days, while the other fox shed oocysts for nine days. A DNA sample of oocysts detected at each day of oocyst elimination was tested by a PCR carried out employing primers directed to the common toxoplasmatiid 18 S and 5. 8 S coding genes (PCR-ITS- 1). These samples were also submitted to a N. caninum specific gene (Nc- 5 nPCR). All of them were positive by PCR-ITS- 1 and negative by Nc- 5 nPCR. The PCR-ITS- 1 nucleotide sequence revealed 100 % identity with homologous sequences of H. heydorni. In conclusion, {{it is clear that}} H. heydorni also uses the crab-eating fox as a definitive host. The crab-eating fox is usually reported to live in close contact with livestock in several regions of Brazil. Therefore it is reasonable to infer that such carnivores may {{play an important role in}} the sylvatic and domestic cycles of H. heydorni infection. In experiment 2, seven fox consumed tissues from three N. caninum naturally infected water buffaloes. Feaces were examined from 30 days before to 30 days after infection and none fox shed N. caninum-like oocysts. These results suggest that the crab-eating fox cannot be definitive host of N. caninum; however additional studies will be necessary...|$|R
40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} is the {{connective tissue}} which lines the bony ends of diathrodial joints to provide load distribution and frictionless motion. Lubricin, a glycoprotein which concentrates at the superficial {{layer of the}} cartilage, contributes to the low friction coefficient. Mechanical injury to cartilage {{increases the risk of}} osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by degradation of articular cartilage starting with the articular surface. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of injurious compression on the surface mechanical properties of cartilage, and lubricin gene expression and synthesis using an in vitro organ culture model. Furthermore, the role of TGF-P signaling in the induction of lubricin gene expression and protein secretion from cartilage explants following mechanical injury was analyzed. Cartilage disks with intact superficial zone from the patellofemoral grooves of 1 - 2 wk <b>old</b> <b>bovine</b> knees were cultured in either free swelling conditions or subjected to injurious compression using a range of applied strains and strain rates. Mechanical injury was found to elevate the friction coefficient of cartilage. Average surface roughness of cartilage superficial zone was increased by the combination of injury and subsequent oscillating shear motion at the surface superimposed on an applied normal strain. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were conducted sequentially to determine the expression of lubricin and other relevant cartilage genes. Western blotting and ELISA were used to assess protein expression. Lubricin gene expression and secretion increased two days after injury. (cont.) This finding, plus the fact that injury and TGF-f are each known to increase lubricin expression, suggested that the TGF- 3 signaling pathway may be a mechanism through which injury induces lubricin expression. We therefore tested the hypothesis that blocking the TGF-P pathway would suppress the increase in lubricin gene expression and protein secretion caused by injurious compression of cartilage. Indeed, lubricin gene expression and protein secretion were reduced after blocking TGF-f compared to injury alone. Together, these results show that surface damage caused injury and sliding motion can be ameliorated by the presence of lubricin on the cartilage surface. The TGF- 3 pathway is an important mechanism in regulating the increased lubricin gene expression and secretion that result from injury. by Shuodan Chen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The dense {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) within the articular cartilage derives its compressive modulus from the electrostatic and osmotic interactions between highly charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Furthermore, the structural {{integrity of the}} ECM comes from the tightly interwoven collagen network, which accounts for the tensile and shear stiffness of the cartilage. Due to the avascular, aneural, and alymphatic nature of cartilage, its native cells (chondrocytes) have limited regeneration capabilities after injury. Previous investigators discovered that dynamic compressive loading can increase cell biosynthesis in cartilage explants {{as well as in}} hydrogels such as agarose and self-assembling peptides. Also, recent research has revealed that biosynthesis in cartilage explants can be increased by dynamic tissue shear loading as well. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether dynamic tissue shear loading could affect chondrocyte biosynthesis in agarose gels. Chondrocytes from 1 - 2 week <b>old</b> <b>bovine</b> knee cartilage were seeded into 3 % agarose gel slabs, and 2 -mm thick by 4 -mm diameter cylindrical disks were cored from these gels. Groups of disks were maintained in free swelling control culture, or subjected to 5 % static compression control, or 3 % sinusoidal shear strain (0. 1 Hz) superimposed on a 5 % static compressive offset. (cont.) After loading, specimens were examined to measure total GAG concentration and DNA content (cell number) over the days of culture + 24 hours of loading. However, the rate of GAG synthesis using ³⁵S-sulfate and the rate of protein synthesis using ³H-proline were only observed for the 24 hours of loading. We found that on any given day during a time course study, dynamic shear loading caused a statistically significant increase in chondrocyte biosynthesis when compared to the controls. The data suggests that the effect of dynamic shear loading on biosynthesis can be optimized by considering factors such as the state of the cell-gel construct, the supplements added to the culture medium, and the shear loading protocol. In conclusion, the experiments, presented in this study, show that dynamic tissue shear loading, which isolates mechanical deformation from fluid flow, also has the potential to stimulate chondrocyte biosynthesis of GAG and protein in tissue engineered hydrogel scaffolds. by Shuodan Chen.

40|$|Introduction: Articular {{cartilage}} (AC) is a {{low friction}} load bearing material found in synovial joints. The natural repair of damaged tissue is difficult and often requires surgical intervention. With large defects it becomes necessary to match the original tissue geometry. We hypothesized that localized collagen (COL) and/or proteoglycan (PG) remodeling occurs during AC spherical reshaping. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the presence, magnitude and depth dependence of COL and PG remodeling that accompanies AC reshaping. Methods: Full thickness AC blocks (7 x 7 mm 2 surface area) were harvested from the ridges of the patellofemoral groove of immature (1 - 3 week <b>old)</b> <b>bovine</b> knees. The top 0 - 1 mm with intact articular surface was sliced off with a vibrating microtome. A 6 mm diameter disk was punched out of the slice and the most anterior edge was notched to mark directionality. The final sample was a 1 mm thick, 6 mm diameter disk with a notch on the most anterior edge. Samples were either not treated (day 0; D 0) or allowed to free swell overnight in 20 % FBS. Then cultured samples were placed in culture with 20 % FBS in either free swelling (FS), static bending with the articular surface concave (concave) or in static bending with the articular surface convex (convex). Wet-weight and opening angle were measured before and 2 hours after removal from culture. Following culture, samples were cut in half in the anterior posterior direction. One half of each sample was frozen and later analyzed for PG, COL and cell content. The other half was fixed for 24 - 48 hours in 4 % paraformaldehyde; samples were then transferred to 20 % Hexabrix for 24 hours before imaging by micro-computed tomography (μCT) to assess PG distribution. Following μCT, samples were again placed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 - 48 hours and then prepared for qPLM to assess collagen orientation (α), parallelism index (PI), and area fraction of non-birefringent tissue (AFNBR). Variations were assessed by ANOVA with post hoc tests for significant ANOVA (pResults: Four days of spherical bending significantly changed (pDiscussion: Spherical bending reshapes AC into a cup shape. Trends of decreasing α standard deviation (αSD) with depth in concave samples and increasing αSD with depth in convex samples indicate that COL matrix disorganization is associated with regions of compressive strain.

In this study, we constructed a vector with a human interferon-a (hIFN-a) (without secretory signal sequence) gene cassette containing the immediate early promoter of human cytomegalovirus. Stably transfected bovine fetal fibroblasts were obtained by G 418 selection, and hIFN-a transgenic embryos were produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Forty-six transgenic embryos were transplanted into surrogate cows, and five cows (10. 9 %) became pregnant. Two male cloned calves were born. Expression of hIFN-a was detected in transfected bovine fetal fibroblasts, transgenic SCNT embryos, and different tissues from a transgenic SCNT calf at two days <b>old.</b> In transfected <b>bovine</b> fetal fibroblasts, expression of intracellular IFN-a induced resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus infection, increased apoptosis, and induced the expression of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase gene (PKR) and the 29 - 59 -oligoadenylate synthetase gene (29 - 59 OAS), which are IFN-inducible genes with antiviral activity. Analysis by qRT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of PKR, 29 - 59 OAS, and P 53 were significantly increased in wild-type bovine fetal fibroblasts stimulated with extracellular recombinant human IFN-a- 2 b, showing that intracellular IFN-a induces biological functions similar to extracellular IFN-a. In conclusion, expression of intracellular hIFN-a conferred antiviral properties in transfected bovine fetal fibroblasts and did not significantly affect the full development of SCNT embryos.

40|$|Background: Routine {{rapid testing}} for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) has {{highlighted}} {{some problems with}} BSE rapid test performance, the most significant being the number of initially reactive samples and the false positive results on autolyzed tissue. This point is important for BSE active surveillance in risk populations, because tissue autolysis is often unavoidable in routine cases. A robust test suitable for use on field material is therefore needed. To date, very limited information regarding the effect of autolysis on the robustness of rapid tests has been documented; therefore, the National Reference Centre for Animal Encephalopathies (CEA) rapid test laboratory selected 450 autolyzed and negative brain stem samples from fallen stock <b>bovines</b> <b>older</b> than 24 months to assess the specificity of four tests approved for BSE active surveillance: Biorad TeSeE, Enfer TSE version 2. 0, Prionics ® Check LIA, and IDEXX Herd Check BSE Antigen Kit EIA.

50|$|The {{developed}} Neolithic cultures {{belonging to}} the phases Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (10,200 BC) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (7600 to 6000 BC) appeared in the fertile crescent and from there spread eastwards and westwards. Contemporaneously, a grain-grinding culture using the earliest type of sickle blades had replaced the culture of hunters, fishers, and gathering people using stone tools along the Nile. Geological evidence and computer climate modeling studies also suggest that natural climate changes around 8000 BC began to desiccate the extensive pastoral lands of northern Africa, eventually forming the Sahara. Continued desiccation forced the early ancestors of the Egyptians to settle around the Nile more permanently and to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. By about 5500 BC, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed {{into a series of}} inter-related cultures as far south as Sudan, demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badari, which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, stone tools, and use of copper. The <b>oldest</b> known domesticated <b>bovine</b> in Africa are from Fayum dating to around 4400 BC. The Badari cultures was followed by the Naqada culture, which brought a number of technological improvements. As early as the first Naqada Period, Amratia, Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes. By 3300 BC, just before the first Egyptian dynasty, Egypt was divided into two kingdoms, known as Upper Egypt to the south, and Lower Egypt to the north.|$|R
