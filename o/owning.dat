5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as <b>owning</b> {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference.

They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
