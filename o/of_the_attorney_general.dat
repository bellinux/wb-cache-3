5|$|Mullen {{suggests}} that the failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> to challenge either standing or justiciability in the case could have wider implications by lowering the barriers to litigation and also by providing a precedent that people acting in their personal capacities can challenge the validity of primary legislation.|$|E
5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{announced}} his 2008 candidacy for Ohio {{state attorney general}} on June 11, 2008. He was endorsed by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. The vacancy in the office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> {{was created by the}} May 14, 2008, resignation of Marc Dann who was embroiled in a sex scandal. Several leading Republican party contenders such as Montgomery, Jim Petro, DeWine, Maureen O'Connor, and Rob Portman declined to enter the race. Cordray's opponents in the race were Michael Crites (Republican), and Robert M. Owens (Independent). Cordray had a large financial advantage over his opponents with approximately 30 times as much campaign financing as Crites. Crites' campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann—an association The Columbus Dispatch called into question—and promoting himself as having more years of prosecutorial experience. Cordray asserted that he managed the state's money safely despite the turbulence of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Phillips (1832), the Court {{dismissed}} {{a criminal}} action, on the motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General,</b> {{pursuant to the}} district prosecutor's filing of a nolle prosequi motion (a motion by the prosecutor to dismiss the case) in the trial court, even though the nolle prosequi motion was filed after the writ of error issued from the Supreme Court. Phillips has been cited as an early example of judicial recognition of the norm of prosecutorial enforcement discretion and {{as an example of}} mootness (although the Phillips Court did not use that term). The underlying case had involved the prosecution of Zalegman Phillips, a prominent Philadelphia attorney, for interfering with diplomatic immunity, as protected by the Crimes Act of 1790, by filing a lawsuit against a former diplomat. The question certified was whether the provision extended to former diplomats.|$|E
5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|The justices were {{assisted}} by {{a staff of}} over 50 officials, most of whom sat in Westminster Hall but also kept offices at the various Inns of Court. The Chief Clerk was the Custos Brevium, appointed by the crown, but in practice clerking matters were handled by his deputy, as the office was a royal favour rather than a serious judicial appointment. The crown also appointed the court chirographer, the officer responsible for noting final concords and filing records of fines. Another high-ranking clerk was the Clerk of the Outlawries, an under-clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> for England and Wales, who was tasked with recording recognizances to protect {{the interests of the}} King in common law matters. In 1541 his position was replaced with the office of Clerk of the King's Process. Other offices created during the reign of Henry VIII include the Clerk of the Recognizances in 1432, who recorded debts secured by recognizances and the office of Receiver of Debts, who was tasked with receiving and recording money coming into the court via debts and fines, and was first appointed in 1536.|$|E
