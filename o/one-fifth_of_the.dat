5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public health budget.|$|E

With global travel increasing and the population migrating, the geographic distribution has been changing in China.

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E

Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
5|$|After the office-building {{boom of the}} 1980s, the 1990s saw {{an office}} glut that {{resulted}} in numerous vacancies and reduced leasing rates throughout Center City. In 1993 IBM, struggling financially, was shrinking its workforce and consolidating its operations nationwide, and its plans included moving some of its local employees out of the city. Though IBM had initially occupied nearly half of One Commerce Square, by 1993 it was using only <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. In 1996, Maguire Thomas Partners split up, leaving the ownership of Commerce Square to Thomas Properties Group Inc. alone. After the split, Thomas Properties renegotiated mortgage financing of the Commerce Square towers.

5|$|Given {{the losses}} of {{industry}} and jobs, St. Louis has had significant and persistent problems with both crime and perceptions of crime. In 2011 St. Louis was named by U.S. News and World Report as the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of firearm deaths for the metropolitan statistical area was <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city rate.|$|E
