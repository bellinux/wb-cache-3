40|$|As {{shown by}} Rubinstein (1989, AER), in the two-player {{electronic}} mail game, players {{are better off}} if {{the extent to which}} they can check each <b>other’s</b> <b>information,</b> check each <b>other’s</b> <b>information</b> about each <b>other’s</b> <b>information,</b> etc., is limited. This paper investigates to what extent this result extends to the multi-player electronic mail game. It is shown that, contrary to the two-player game, the multi-player game has a plethora of equilibria. If players play inefficient equilibria where they require a specific communication network to be established in order to achieve collective action, then Rubinstein’s results extend. However, contrary to the two-player game, the multi-player game also has equilibria where players find many alternative communication networks sufficient to undertake collective action. If players play such equilibria, then contrary to what is the case in the two-player electronic mail game they can become better off with more information.

40|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} (EC) {{experiments and}} impression formation experiments study {{factors that influence}} evaluation. Despite large overlap between these two research traditions, they often operate in parallel without attention to findings and theories from the other line of research, risking redundancy. We suggest reintegrating EC research into impression formation as the branch of research that investigates the effect of stimulus co-occurrence distinct {{from the effects of}} <b>other</b> relational <b>information.</b> Most learning episodes include stimulus co-occurrence and <b>other</b> relational <b>information</b> (e. g., viewers learn that Batman co-occurs with crime and that he fights crime). Therefore, EC research is important {{to the extent that the}} influence of stimulus co-occurrence on evaluation is not overridden by the effects of <b>other</b> relational <b>information.</b> We review initial evidence suggesting that co-occurrence influences evaluation over and above <b>other</b> relational <b>information,</b> and report two experiments that demonstrate empirical directions for studying the effects of co-occurrence versus <b>other</b> relational <b>information...</b>|$|R

A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little <b>other</b> <b>information</b> exists about it.
