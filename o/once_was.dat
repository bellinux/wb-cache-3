5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} {{organized}} at Monte Ne under {{the sponsorship of}} the Benton County Baptist Association {{as a result of}} a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although it was not as active as it <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> the old filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.|$|E
5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the area that was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting what <b>once</b> <b>was</b> there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred feet from where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} several {{historic}} religious communities in Belgrade, the religious makeup {{of the city is}} relatively homogenous. The Serbian Orthodox community is by far the largest, with 1,475,168 adherents. There are also 31,914 Muslims, 13,720 Roman Catholics, and 3,128 Protestants. There <b>once</b> <b>was</b> a significant Jewish community in Belgrade, but following the World War II Nazi occupation of the city, and subsequent Jewish emigration, their numbers have fallen from over 10,000 to just 295.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, {{there were}} only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the {{population}} reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. Numbers then recovered, and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. But on September 18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. In {{the aftermath of the}} hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. In 2004, the wild population was 30–35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations. The current range of the species is , 0.2% of what it <b>once</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> and, there, untouched by Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir once owned. Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted.|$|E

5|$|Expansion of the {{population}} and settlements in the county continued during the Tudor and more recent periods. Agriculture and coal mining expanded until the 18th century, although other industries declined during the industrial revolution. In modern times {{the population}} has grown, particularly in the seaside towns, notably Weston-super-Mare. Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the acreage of apple orchards is less than it <b>once</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

Prior to Hsu's second attempt to flee, James Brosnahan, Hsu's attorney in California, defended Hsu stating that Hsu's prominence showed {{that he did not}} behave like a fugitive and that Hsu was moving towards a resolution of the matter, including a plan of restitution for victims of Hsu's actions.|$|E

5|$|On January 29, 1913, Calvin Shelverton {{applied for}} a {{building}} permit to construct the Piedmont Park Apartments. The apartments were designed by Leila Ross Wilburn and were decidedly middle-class unlike {{some of the other}} developments in the area. The apartments remained middle-class up until about 1960, and residents included such prominent Atlantans as accounting company president T. C. Dunlap and lawyer J. B. Stewart. In 1913, seven clay courts were built where the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition's Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> Eight more courts were added in 1914 to accommodate the overwhelming demand.|$|E

Also, Crozier is the last goaltender in the NHL to start all of his team's games during the regular season, doing so in 1964–65.|$|E

5|$|The cattle {{industry}} continued to thrive though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various {{regions of the}} state. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce between Texas {{and the rest of}} the U.S. ({{and the rest of the}} world) expanded. As with some other states before, the lumber industry quickly decimated the forests of Texas such that by the early 20th century the major of the forest population in Texas was gone (later conservation efforts restored some of it but never to the level it <b>once</b> <b>was).</b>|$|E
5|$|The fourth Playford, {{father of}} Sir Thomas, {{was born in}} 1861. Unlike his own father and grandfather, who had led lives as soldiers, churchmen and politicians, he became a simple farmer at the Norton Summit {{property}} and was dominated by his wife, Elizabeth. He was, like his forebears, a regular churchgoer, and only <b>once</b> <b>was</b> involved in politics with a short stint on the East Torrens District Council. In comparison, Elizabeth was the local correspondent of The Advertiser, treasurer and chief member of the local Baptist Church, and a teacher. Four children were born to the couple; three daughters and one son, Sir Thomas.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was part}} of a cavalry force commanded by General Averell that pursued Confederate Generals McCausland and Bradley Johnson after the rebels burned the Pennsylvania community of Chambersburg. After multiple skirmishes and Confederate threats to burn more towns, McCausland's two brigades of cavalry were caught in Moorefield, West Virginia. In a surprise attack at dawn on August 6, 1864, Averell captured over 400 Confederates. This ruined General Early's cavalry, and it was never again the dominant force it <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> In this battle, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was held in reserve while five other regiments attacked two rebel camps. Colonel Powell directed portions of the attack.|$|E
