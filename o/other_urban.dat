There are 50 settlements which have been designated city status in England, while the wider United Kingdom has 66.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} growth rate was higher {{during the decade}} of 1981–90 due to increased provision of social, economic and recreational facilities that caused the rural population to migrate to urban areas. The overall growth rate had declined {{over the last two}} decades due to poor returns in agriculture and increased migration of agricultural labourers to <b>other</b> <b>urban</b> centres. The population density of the town is high in the centre and low in the peripheral regions.|$|E

5|$|Filipino and English are the {{official}} languages of the country. Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog, spoken mainly in Metro Manila and <b>other</b> <b>urban</b> regions. Both Filipino and English {{are used in}} government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides {{for the promotion of}} Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages.|$|E
5|$|Kuching, {{like most}} towns in Sarawak, has {{connections}} to <b>other</b> <b>urban</b> centres and settlements by water transport. Between {{the banks of}} Sarawak River, near the city centre, many 'tambang' (traditional roofed wooden sampan) can be seen carrying passengers from one riverbank to another. For those staying along the river banks, it is a short way to getting to the city-proper.

5|$|Many of {{the rebels}} had urban backgrounds, and the {{majority}} of those involved in the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants. In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the urban poor, attempting to gain {{at the expense of the}} local elites. In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled. <b>Other</b> <b>urban</b> rebels were part of the elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds. In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.|$|E
5|$|Morchella importuna is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae {{described}} from North America in 2012. It occurs in gardens, woodchip beds, and <b>other</b> <b>urban</b> settings of northern California and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The fungus has also been reported from Turkey, Spain, France, Switzerland, Canada and China, although it is unknown {{whether this is a}} result of accidental introductions. It is considered a choice edible mushroom. The fruit bodies develop a distinctive ladder-like pattern of pits and ridges on the surface of their conical caps.|$|E
5|$|The {{urban area}} has a {{population}} density of 3035/km2 (7,864/mi²), while the rural and suburban areas have a density of 355.5/km2 (920/mi²). The rural areas {{away from the city}} tend to be scarcely populated, becoming denser near it. During the summer the resident population in the city triples; this seasonal movement from neighbouring cities is due to the draw of the beach and 29.9% of homes had seasonal use in 2001, the highest in Greater Porto. Póvoa de Varzim is the youngest city in the region with a birth rate of 13.665 and mortality rate of 8.330. Unlike <b>other</b> <b>urban</b> areas of greater Porto, it is not a satellite city. Significant commuting occurs only with Vila do Conde, an urban expansion area of Póvoa since the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Joaquín {{purchased}} land on {{the outskirts}} of Guadalajara with the intent of forming a small community made up exclusively by members of LLDM. The land was then sold at reduced prices to church members. The community included most necessities; services provided in Hermosa Provincia included health, education, and <b>other</b> <b>urban</b> services, which were provided in full after six years partly with help that the Church received from municipal and non-municipal authorities. This dependency upon outside assistance to obtain public services ended by 1959 when residents formed the Association of Colonists of Hermosa Provincia, which was used to directly petition the government. Hermosa Provincia received a white flag from the city for being the only neighborhood in the city that has eliminated illiteracy by the early 1970s. Joaquín started missionary efforts in Central America and by the early 1960s, La Luz del Mundo had 64 congregations and 35 missions. By 1964, after his death, the Church had between 20,000 and 30,000 members spread through five countries, including Mexico. The neighborhood became a standard model for the Church which has replicated it in many cities in Mexico and other countries.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs, now {{firmly in}} control of Syria and the Levant, sent {{frequent}} raiding parties deep into Asia Minor, and in 674–678 laid siege to Constantinople itself. The Arab fleet was finally repulsed {{through the use of}} Greek fire, and a thirty-years' truce was signed between the Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate. However, the Anatolian raids continued unabated, and accelerated the demise of classical urban culture, with the inhabitants of many cities either refortifying much smaller areas within the old city walls, or relocating entirely to nearby fortresses. Constantinople itself dropped substantially in size, from 500,000 inhabitants to just 40,000–70,000, and, like <b>other</b> <b>urban</b> centres, it was partly ruralised. The city also lost the free grain shipments in 618, after Egypt fell first to the Persians and then to the Arabs, and public wheat distribution ceased.|$|E
