5|$|Burnside {{was noted}} for his unusual facial hair, joining strips of hair in front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> to his {{mustache}} {{but with the}} chin clean-shaven; the word burnsides was coined to describe this style. The syllables were later reversed to give sideburns.|$|E
5|$|Ruffing {{suffered}} a stroke in 1974, {{at the age of}} 68, which left him paralyzed on his left side. As a result, he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life. This was Ruffing's second stroke, and he also suffered from kidney and heart problems. He contracted skin cancer, necessitating the partial amputation of one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> He died on February 17, 1986, at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, of heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E

25|$|The {{priest of}} Ciempozuelos {{was thrown into}} a corral with {{fighting}} bulls where he was gored into unconsciousness. Afterwards one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> was cut off to imitate the feat of a matador after a successful bullfight.|$|E
25|$|Mr Williamson: Young {{midshipman}} {{taken by}} Aubrey in Worcester and carried to Surprise, where he lost half an {{arm in the}} battle with the Turkish ship Torgud. He loses some toes and tips <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> to frostbite in the southern 60s (south latitude) rounding Cape Horn. Introduced in The Ionian Mission.|$|E
25|$|Then a {{deal was}} signed {{for him to}} defend his crown against Mike Tyson in November 1991. Tyson delayed the fight, {{claiming}} he was injured in training, but was then convicted for the rape of Desiree Washington and sentenced to six years in prison, so the fight did not happen at that time. They fought in 1996 (Holyfield won by a TKO in 11) and a rematch in 1997 (Holyfield won by disqualification in 3, after Tyson bit both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears).</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The what?--the who?--woman!" [...] said Deans, with a sternness {{far beyond}} his usual gravity, {{as soon as}} these {{offensive}} words had struck upon the tympanum <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R

25|$|Van Gogh {{suffered}} from {{some sort of}} seizures or crises, {{and in one of}} these attacks, on December 23, 1888, he cut off a part, or possibly all, <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, {{producer}} Robert H. Justman decided to prank Nimoy. He had partially convinced Nimoy that it would have been preferable to have permanent plastic surgery to point the tips <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> instead of requiring the hour and a half of makeup each day to apply them. It was only when Nimoy began to agree with Justman's suggestion that the producer let on that it was a joke, which Nimoy found amusing. Nimoy became unhappy with his pay during the course of the season, since Shatner was being paid more than he was. But he was asked by the producers to table the discussion until confirmation was received that the series was renewed.|$|E
25|$|Brajanath at once caused coins to {{be struck}} in his own name, but it was now remembered that he was ineligible for the throne, as he had {{suffered}} mutilation of one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> (The Ahom considered their king from divine origin and {{the person of the}} monarch, was sacred, and any noticeable sear or blemish, even a scratch received in play, a pit of small pox, or a wound received in action, operated as a bar to succession). Therefore, Brajanath's son Purandar, then only ten years old, was brought from Silmari, who arrived in time and was acclaimed as sovereign of the Ahom kingdom of Assam, in February 1818 CE. A few days later Biswanath Marangikhowa Gohain, brother of Ruchinath Burhagohain effected the slicing off of Chandrakanta's right ear in order to disqualify him from again sitting on the throne.|$|E
25|$|Such was the Duke's unpopularity by {{this time}} that Felton was widely {{acclaimed}} as a hero by the public. A large number of poems celebrating Felton and justifying his action were published. Copies of written statements Felton carried in his hat during the assassination were also widely circulated. Many of these described Buckingham as effeminate, cowardly and corrupt, and contrasted him with Felton, who was held up {{as an example of}} manliness, courage and virtue. The son of Alexander Gill the Elder was sentenced to a fine of £2000 and the removal <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> after being overheard drinking to the health of Felton, and stating that Buckingham had joined King James I in hell. However, these punishments were remitted after his father and Archbishop Laud appealed to King Charles I. Felton was hanged on 29 November and his body was taken to Portsmouth for public display. However, this proved to be a miscalculation by the authorities as it became an object of veneration by the public.|$|E

500|$|Media reports {{stated that}} Jackson's autopsy {{reported}} one scar beside {{each of his}} nostrils, [...] one scar behind each <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> and two scars on his neck, [...] "probably" [...] from cosmetic surgery, plus cosmetic tattoos on his eyebrows, around his eyes and lips, and on his scalp (at his receding hairline).|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} self-published November 5, 2009, and was made {{available}} through the author's website at www.blownforgood.com and on Amazon.com. Blown for Good was selected as a finalist in the 2009 [...] "Book of the Year Awards", by ForeWord Magazine. The Editor in chief of The Village Voice, Tony Ortega, described the book as a [...] "remarkable account". Ortega noted, [...] "Headley's story provides a damning account of life working for Scientology ..." [...] He concluded the review by commenting, [...] "Perhaps the best service that Headley provides with Blown for Good is giving non-Scientologists the sense of what it's really like to work, {{day in and day}} out, in such a strange organization, from the lowliest laborer mucking out excrement in a Gold Base pond (Headley says shit was coming out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and pores for days) to what kind of luxuries the celebrities and high-ranking members enjoy." ...|$|E
500|$|The South Park creators and animators {{said they}} were still {{developing}} the characters {{and trying to figure}} out the future direction of the show with [...] "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] took a particularly long time to animate due to the large number of people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of the crosshairs in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence [...] "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy [...] Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be", can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with gray hair on the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode [...] "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut", in which he has a full head of hair during a flashback.|$|E

50|$|In {{an attack}} upon an enemy fort at Shimber Berris, Carton de Wiart was shot {{twice in the}} face, losing his eye and also a portion <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 15 May 1915.|$|R
5000|$|Ben Yusuf {{never had}} {{his left eye}} scarred. His {{appearance}} in reality was [...] "Brown color, middle height, thin, little beard, soft voice, black eyes, straight nose, lock of Muhammad falling on the top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> eyebrow joined, wooly hair".|$|R
2500|$|The sailor murders ended {{only after}} the Akiska ran aground and sank near Atlantic City, his last two {{potential}} victims escaping to parts unknown. Panzram then caught a ship to Africa and landed in Luanda, Portuguese Angola. [...] He later claimed that while there, he raped and killed an 11- or 12-year-old boy. In his confession to this murder, he wrote: [...] "His brains were coming out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> when I left him and he will never be any deader." [...] He also claimed that he hired a boat with six rowers, shot the rowers with a German Luger pistol, and threw their bodies to the crocodiles.|$|E
2500|$|Holyfield's rematch with Tyson {{took place}} on June 28, 1997. Known as [...] "The Bite Fight," [...] it went into the annals of boxing {{as one of the}} most bizarre fights in history. The infamous {{incident}} occurred in the third round, when Tyson bit Holyfield on one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and had two points deducted. Referee Mills Lane decided to disqualify Tyson initially, but after Holyfield and the ringside doctor intervened and said Holyfield could continue, he relented and allowed the fight to go on. Tyson bit Holyfield again, this time on the other ear. Tyson's teeth tore off a small section of the top of his opponent's ear, known as the helix, and spat that bit of flesh out onto the canvas.|$|E
2500|$|Slager pursued Scott. Slager then fired {{both of his}} Taser cartridges. [...] He {{continued}} to pursue Scott into [...] a lot behind a pawn shop at 5654 Rivers Avenue, and the two became involved in a physical altercation. [...] Slager then fired his Taser, hitting Scott. Scott fled, and Slager drew his handgun, firing eight rounds at him from behind. The coroner's report stated that Scott was struck {{a total of five}} times: three times in the back, once in the upper buttocks, and once on one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> During Slager's state trial, forensic pathologist Lee Marie Tormos testified that the fatal wound was caused by a bullet that entered Scott's back and struck his lungs and heart. Official autopsy reports have not been released.|$|E
60|$|The clergyman pounced {{upon him}} with a growl of a hyena, and bit a piece out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> Yes, he did, reader. Just imagine a clergyman biting a boy in open daylight! Yet that happens in New York every minute.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like fishing!" [...] cried Jone. [...] "I {{should say}} not," [...] {{and he made}} up such a comical face that even the gilly, who was very polite, had to laugh as he went to take the hook out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't they? Here 's a vain boy who brushes {{his hair}} {{a dozen times}} a day, and quiddles over his collar till he is so tired he can hardly stand," [...] laughed Miss Celia, with a little tweak <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Jackson held {{a lifelong}} belief {{that one of}} his arms was longer than the other, and thus usually held the [...] "longer" [...] arm up to {{equalize}} his circulation. He was described as a [...] "champion sleeper", and occasionally even fell asleep with food in his mouth. A paper presented to the Society of Clinical Psychologists hypothesized that Jackson had Asperger syndrome, although other possible explanations, such as a herniated diaphragm, exist. Indeed, Jackson suffered a number of ailments, for which he sought relief via contemporary practices of his day including hydrotherapy, popular in America at that time, visiting establishments at Oswego, New York (1850) and Round Hill, Massachusetts (1860) although with little evidence of success. Jackson also suffered a significant hearing loss in both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> {{as a result of his}} prior service in the U.S. Army, as an artillery officer.|$|E
2500|$|Emily {{is usually}} shown {{accompanied}} by four black cats. [...] "Sabbath," [...] the newest cat {{to join the}} Strange family, is usually identified by a tear on one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and one bent whisker. [...] "Miles," [...] the most artistic cat {{of the group and}} also the fastest, is identified by his pointy ears, X-mark over his right eye and two pointy whiskers. [...] "Nee Chee," [...] the thinker of the group (also known as the schemer), is identified by the black and white stripes on his tail caused by a chemical spill, as well as three whiskers. [...] "Mystery," [...] the leader of the group and the only female of the four cats, seems to be the closest to Emily, and therefore thought to be the cat that has been with Emily the longest. Mystery is identified by the star on her collar, one curly whisker and occasionally a star on her left eye.|$|E
2500|$|The 2005 series {{began with}} the Ninth Doctor already {{regenerated}} and fully stabilised, with no explanation given. In his first appearance in [...] "Rose", the Doctor looked in a mirror and commented on the size <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> suggesting that the regeneration may have happened shortly prior to the episode, or {{that he has not}} examined his reflection recently. Some draw the conclusion that the Ninth Doctor's appearances in old photographs, without being accompanied by Rose, may suggest that he had been regenerated for some time, but these appearances could have occurred afterwards. Russell T Davies, writer/producer of the new series, stated in Doctor Who Magazine that {{he had no intention of}} showing the regeneration in the series, and that he believed the story of how the Eighth Doctor became the Ninth is best told in other media. In Doctor Who Confidential, Davies revealed his reasoning that, after such a long hiatus, a regeneration in the first episode would not just be confusing for new viewers but lack dramatic impact, as there would be no emotional investment in the character before he was replaced. The circumstances of the Eighth Doctor's regeneration were explored during the 2013 specials, with the revelation of the incarnation played by Hurt that existed between the Doctor's Eighth and Ninth incarnations.|$|E
50|$|Shapter {{underwent}} chemotherapy {{for almost}} two years to treat squamous cell carcinoma. He treated two tumors, one in his neck and one in his back. After four surgeries, he lost “part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> a rhomboid muscle, and 33 lymph nodes.” He is now cancer-free.|$|R
6000|$|It was useless. He couldn't read. He couldn't do anything. The wailing of {{the child}} pierced the drum <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> It was useless, useless! He was a {{prisoner}} for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child's face he shouted: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] demanded Hal as {{he slipped}} a glove off to {{feel of the}} ear.
