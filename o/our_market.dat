40|$|Given {{the world}} wide {{predominance}} of the small to medium sized enterprise (SME) we should consider whether we need to segment and target <b>our</b> <b>marketing</b> knowledge, practice and attitudes towards this business type.

This implies that we should consider how much of <b>our</b> existing <b>marketing</b> knowledge is appropriate to the SME and how much needs to be rethought and adapted. The body of work by colleagues in what could be described as the “marketing entrepreneurship interface” demonstrates both appropriate concerns and potential solutions.

40|$|The {{single family}} home rental market {{has always been}} a very {{significant}} part of <b>our</b> housing <b>market</b> and national economy; however, the fragmentation among “mom and pop” owners has resulted in little centralized data, research or attention focused on this sector.

40|$|It {{comes as}} no {{surprise}} to any of us that businesses are cyclical. At no time in history have <b>our</b> <b>markets</b> demonstrated cyclicality more dramatically than in the last two years. In 2000, our year-over-year revenue growth was 43 % at Pulse and 25 % overall. Then, in 2001, the fields reversed and we experienced a dramatic and prolonged business contraction in <b>our</b> electronics <b>markets</b> and softening demand in <b>our</b> electrical <b>markets</b> driven by weakening global economic conditions. Our entire supply chain – from peer companies to competitors to customers – has been similarly affected. Simply put, AMI Doduco’s business was in a recession in 2001, while Pulse’s business was in a full-scale depression. The entire year felt like the corporate version of “Mr. Toad’s Wil...|$|R

6000|$|One day--one famous {{day last}} January--all <b>our</b> <b>Market</b> {{was thrown into}} a high state of {{excitement}} {{by the appearance of}} no less than three vehicles at our establishment. As me, Jemmy, my daughter, Tug, and Orlando, were sitting in the back-parlor over our dinner (it being Christmas-time, Mr. Crump had treated the ladies to a bottle of port, and was longing {{that there should be a}} mistletoe-bough: at which proposal my little Jemimarann looked as red as a glass of negus):--we had just, I say, finished the port, when, all of a sudden, Tug bellows out, [...] "La, Pa, here's uncle Tuggeridge's housekeeper in a cab!" ...|$|E

[...] "I know the party--they've been {{engineering}} various shady deals in estate and produce, and now, when Winnipeg is getting uncomfortably warm, this is evidently a last coup before they light out across the boundary. The dark man was a clerk in the stock trade--turned out for embezzlement--once, you see. Still, they can't sell until to-morrow, and we might get the night train. No chance of trade hereabout, you say; then, for the credit of <b>our</b> <b>market,</b> if you'll lend me a fresh horse, I'm going right back to Winnipeg with you. Sit down, and finish your dinner; you'll want it before you're through." ...|$|E
60|$|Such a {{deadlock}} {{could not}} be relieved merely by goodwill on either side. When you begin to deflect the course of trade, you deflect it in all directions and for all time in both countries which are parties to the bargain. Your industries in your respective Colonies would have exposed themselves to a more severe competition from British goods in their markets, and would have adjusted themselves on a different basis, in consequence. Some Colonial producers would have made sacrifices in that respect {{for the sake of}} certain advantages which were to be gained by other producers in their country through a favoured entry into <b>our</b> <b>market.</b> That one side of the bargain could be suddenly removed, without inflicting injustice on the other party to the bargain, appears to me an impossibility.|$|E

Here, then, we were {{in the heart of the}} richest wine region in Europe, perhaps in the world. I looked curiously at mine host, to see what effect this fact might have had on him, but he did nor appear to have abused the advantage. He told me there had just been a sale, at which I should have been most welcome; complained that much sour liquor was palmed off on the incredulous as being the pure beverage; and said that others might prefer Johannisberger, but for his part, good hinter-hausen[30] was good enough for him. [...] "Would I try a bottle?" [...] The proposition was not to be declined, and with my dinner I did try a bottle of his oldest and best; and henceforth I declare myself a convert to Rudesheimer hinter-hausen. One cannot drink a gallon of it with impunity, as is the case with some of the French wines; but I feel persuaded it is the very article for <b>our</b> <b>market,</b> to use the vernacular of a true Manhattanese.

Result: difficulty of earning dividend, over-work, over- worry, constant fear of being wound up. Now, there is that about your work that suggests to me you would be happier earning five hundred a year than you ever will be earning two thousand. To pay your dividend--to earn your two thousand--you have to do work that brings you no pleasure in the doing. Content with five hundred, you could afford to do only that work that does give you pleasure. This is not a perfect world, we must remember. In the perfect world the thinker would be worth more than the mere jester. In the perfect world the farmer would be worth more than the stockbroker. In making the exchange I had to write myself down. I earn less money, but get more enjoyment out of life. I {{used to be able}} to afford champagne, but my liver was always wrong, and I dared not drink it.

In short, we have never seen the principles of Free Trade better illustrated. The Shriek, it is now reported, refuses to wear the braces presented to him by our envoy at the time of his coronation five years ago. He is said to have thrown them into the mud. But we have no reason to suppose that this is meant as a blow at our prestige. It may be that after five years of use the little pulleys of the braces no longer work properly. We have ourselves in our personal life known instances of this, and can speak of the sense of irritation occasioned. Even we have thrown on the floor ours.
