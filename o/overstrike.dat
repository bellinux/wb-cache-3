500|$|The EA Partners {{game was}} later officially {{revealed}} at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 as <b>Overstrike.</b> This game was pitched by Ratchet & Clank director Brian Allgeier {{and it has}} a direction {{similar to that of the}} Ratchet & Clank series. The team thought <b>Overstrike</b> would appeal to teenagers. After several play-testing sessions, they realized their game was too simple for teenagers. The company developed many weapons for the game, none of which related to the game's story. The developers retooled the game and changed it to attract older players and make weapons an important part of the game. The game focuses on a co-operative campaign, which the company thought was a popular trend at that time. It was later renamed Fuse and was released worldwide on May 2013. Fuse was one of the lowest-rated games developed by Insomniac, and was another commercial failure, debuting in 37th place in UK in its first week of release. Fuse was considered a learning lesson for Insomniac to understand the type of game they are good at making. The reception to Fuse showed the company it should develop [...] "colorful, playful experience that's loaded with unusual, sometimes silly weapons". Also in 2013, the last Ratchet & Clank Future game, , was released.|$|E
500|$|Boulton helped {{deal with}} the {{shortage}} of silver, persuading the Government to let him <b>overstrike</b> the Bank of England's large stock of Spanish dollars with an English design. [...] The Bank had attempted to circulate the dollars by countermarking the coins on the side showing the Spanish king with a small image of George III, but the public was reluctant to accept them, {{in part due to}} counterfeiting. This attempt inspired the couplet, [...] "The Bank to make their Spanish Dollars pass/Stamped the head of a fool on the neck of an ass." [...] Boulton obliterated the old design in his restriking. Though Boulton was not as successful in defeating counterfeiters as he hoped (high quality fakes arrived at the Bank's offices within days of the issuance), these coins circulated until the Royal Mint again struck large quantities of silver coin in 1816, when Boulton's were withdrawn. He oversaw the final issue of his coppers for Britain in 1806, and a major issue of coppers to circulate only in Ireland. Even as his health failed, he had his servants carry him from Soho House to the Soho Mint, and he sat and watched the machinery,which was kept exceptionally busy in 1808 by the striking of almost 90,000,000 pieces for the East India Company. [...] He wrote, [...] "Of all the mechanical subjects I ever entered upon, there is none in which I ever engaged with so much ardour as that of bringing to perfection the art of coining." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{existence}} of numerous <b>overstrikes</b> helps locate {{the reign of}} Heliokles II {{in relation to other}} Indo-Greek kings. Heliokles overstruck coins of Agathokleia, Strato I, and Hermaeus. Conversely, Amyntas overstruck coins of Heliokles II. These <b>overstrikes</b> would suggest that Heliokles II reigned around 95 - 85 BCE, and was a contemporary of Amyntas and Hermaios ...|$|R
2500|$|Decade 8 {{was formed}} by {{splitting}} the first decade with a dash, placing it between {{the upper and lower}} parts of each sign. That is, a dash appeared in the middle row, displacing the dots of that row {{to the bottom of the}} cell. In the case of first and 3rd characters (from a and c), which did not have dots in the middle row, the dots at the top were displaced to the bottom instead. That is, this decade was equivalent to adding an <b>overstrike</b> to [...]|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} machine was introduced, a [...] "Tech-3" [...] ribbon appeared. It {{essentially}} replaced the cloth ribbon, as it offered typing quality close to the film ribbon but at a use cost comparable to the reusable cloth. Like the cloth ribbon, Tech-3 ribbons incremented {{only a fraction of}} the character width after being struck. Unlike the cloth ribbon, the Tech-3 ribbon provided high quality impressions for several characters from each spot on the one-time-use ribbon. [...] Because characters <b>overstrike</b> each other on a Tech-3 ribbon several times it could not be easily read to discover what had been typed. The Tech-3 ribbon offered equivalent security to the carbon film ribbon, as its impressions were permanent as soon as they were struck. The Tech-3 ribbon was used with the same cover-up tape that worked with the other non-correctable ribbons.|$|E
50|$|One <b>overstrike</b> is known, of a coin of Strato and Agathokleia over a coin of Diomedes. This <b>overstrike</b> could {{indicate}} that Diomedes fought over the central {{areas of the}} Indo-Greek territories with Strato and Agathokleia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Overstrike</b> 9 {{is brought}} to Raven's {{underwater}} Triton Base, where it is revealed that Dalton's suspicions were correct, as Fable was in league with Raven. At the same time, Naya is reunited with her estranged father, Luther, who seeks aids their escape. <b>Overstrike</b> 9 then goes to the base's Fuse core and prepare to detonate it but first {{had to deal with}} Ivan Sovlenko, who purposely injects himself with Fuse to create illusions but they defeat him. <b>Overstrike</b> 9 then escapes the destruction of the base.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Overstrike</b> 9 is next sent to Karakoram {{in search}} of Luther and Fable. But at the same time, Fable betrays Raven, {{revealing}} to be in league with a mysterious organization only known as [...] "the Order". He coerced half of Raven to defect and steal the corrupted Fuse. <b>Overstrike</b> 9 is unable to attempt pursuit. For their failure, the client that hired the team rescinded their contract. However, Naya convinces the team that her father {{might be able to}} help them locate the Fuse and reveals that she had located his safe house in Jodhpur. With Burgess' aid, <b>Overstrike</b> 9 storms Luther's compound at the same time Fable's loyalists assault it. Fighting their way through both way through both Raven factions, <b>Overstrike</b> 9 manages to locate Luther and enlist his aid against Fable.|$|E

50|$|New <b>overstrikes</b> were {{introduced}} by vendors as they produced versions of APL tailored to specific hardware, system features, file systems, and so on. Further, printing terminals and early APL cathode-ray terminals {{were capable of}} displaying arbitrary <b>overstrikes,</b> but as personal computers rapidly replaced terminals as a data-entry device, APL character support was now provided as an APL Character Generator ROM or a soft character set rendered by the display device. With {{the advent of the}} modern PC, APL characters were defined in specific fonts, eliminating the distinction between overstruck characters and standard characters.|$|R
50|$|Sasan (45-50 CE) was an Indo-Scythian king, and {{the nephew}} of Aspavarma, whom he succeeded. As {{indicated}} by coins hoards and <b>overstrikes,</b> Sasan {{is thought to have}} been a contemporary of Kujula Kadphises and Mujatria.|$|R

50|$|<b>Overstrike</b> 9 {{goes into}} space, where Fable was {{deploying}} satellites to fire Fuse-powered missiles {{to create an}} extinction event and force the world into ending conflict, framing Raven as a scapegoat. As a demonstration, Fable wipes out Munich. <b>Overstrike</b> 9 manages to prevent Fable from firing anymore by launched AI-controlled shuttles into destroying the satellites. They then arrive at the last vault of corrupted Fuse. They managed to destroy {{it at the same}} time Fable engages them in a powered exoskeleton. After a vigorous battle, <b>Overstrike</b> 9 is able to vaporize Fable before narrowly escaping the space station's destruction. Then suddenly, their shuttle collides with debris.|$|E

50|$|An overline, overscore, or overbar, is a {{typographical}} {{feature of}} a horizontal line drawn immediately above the text. In mathematical notation, an overline {{has been used}} for a long time as a vinculum, a way of showing that certain symbols belong together. The original use in Ancient Greek was to indicate compositions of Greek letters as Greek numerals. In Latin it indicates Roman numerals multiplied by a thousand and it forms medieval abbreviations (sigla). Marking one or more words with a continuous line above the characters is sometimes called <b>overstriking,</b> though <b>overstriking</b> generally refers to printing one character on top of an already-printed character.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overstriking</b> {{can be used}} to make boldface text by {{printing}} {{the same}} line twice without advancing the paper. It can also be used to make underlined text by printing a line of underscore characters atop the text.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overstrikes</b> of the Kushan ruler Wima Takto on Mujatria coins are known. This, {{together}} with various hoard finds, suggests the contemporaneity of Mujatria with the Kushan ruler Kujula Kadphises, predecessor of Wima Takto, and the Indo-Scythian ruler Sasan.|$|R
