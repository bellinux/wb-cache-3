Garran had been made a Knight Bachelor in 1917 and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1920. Garran attended two Imperial Conferences, accompanying Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in 1923 and in 1930 joining Prime Minister James Scullin and Attorney-General Frank Brennan, chair of the Drafting Committee which prepared drafts <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> on various topics, such as merchant shipping. He also attended the eleventh League of Nations conference that year with them in Geneva, Switzerland.

5|$|On 17 May 1965, {{following}} on {{from the}} cancellation of the BAC TSR-2 supersonic bomber, the British and French governments announced the signing of a pair <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> to cover the two joint projects; one based on the Breguet Aviation Br.121 ECAT ("Tactical Combat Support Trainer") proposal; this would later evolve, after the cancellation of the AFVG, to become the SEPECAT Jaguar. The other was the AFVG, a larger, variable geometry carrier-capable fighter aircraft for the French Navy (Aéronavale) as well as fulfilling interceptor, tactical strike and reconnaissance roles for the RAF. The AFVG was to be jointly developed by BAC and Dassault Aviation, the proposed M45G turbofan engine to power the aircraft was to also be jointly developed by SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1960, McNicoll {{was posted}} to the Naval Board in Canberra as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel. As noted by {{historian}} Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this position {{at a time}} in which recruitment and retention in the Navy particularly lagged behind targets. McNicoll was additionally appointed as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund during this period. Completing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and hoisted his standard aboard , the flagship of the RAN. The Australian government had designated the role of the RAN to be primarily one of anti-submarine warfare, a posture which McNicoll thought unwise. McNicoll argued that surface and air weapons posed a threat equal to that of submarines toward vessels in modern naval warfare. As such, he campaigned for a contemporary aircraft carrier to replace that of HMAS Melbourne. The Army and Air Force opposed McNicoll's stance, and the government ultimately concluded that there was no strategic requirement for a new carrier in light <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> contained in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In any event, McNicoll experienced a particularly demanding tenure as Fleet Commander since the RAN {{was in the process of}} a complete overhaul of its order of battle and, as a consequence, he had to manage the introduction and deployment into service of six Ton-class minesweepers acquired from the Royal Navy, along with the first batch of Westland Wessex helicopters and modernised afloat support capabilities. Furthermore, McNicoll was charged with the responsibility of ensuring Australian naval commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve were met.|$|E

The above 7 categories were studied according to the General Rule for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Bladder Cancer (Japanese Urological Association and Japanese Pathological Society). The result showed that the ratio <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> between the biopsy specimens and the all-layer specimens was 90. 5 % according to growth pattern.

When grading was not based on the lower grade of cells occupying the major portion, but the higher grade of cells occupying the minor portion the ratio <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> was 88. 1 %. The ratio <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> was 76. 2 % according to lymphatic invasion.
