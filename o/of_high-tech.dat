5|$|The station {{consists}} of two side platforms situated under street level, with two mezzanines connecting to the surface. It was designed in the style <b>of</b> <b>high-tech</b> architecture and includes several pieces of public art added during construction and later additions. The transit tunnel opened on September 15, 1990, and was used exclusively by buses until 2009. Along with all other stations in the transit tunnel, University Street station was closed from 2005 to 2007 for a major renovation to accommodate light rail. Link light rail service to the station began on July 18, 2009. Trains and buses serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between light rail trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times.|$|E
