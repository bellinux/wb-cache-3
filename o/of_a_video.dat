5|$|Due to {{the illness}} of Elisabeth Sladen, and her {{subsequent}} death on 19 April 2011, filming {{for the second}} half of the fifth series, which was due to air in the autumn of 2011, was postponed and later cancelled. Filming for three stories of the fifth series had been finished, and thus post-production on these stories was completed. The final series was aired from 3 to 18 October 2011 on CBBC and ended with a tribute to Elisabeth Sladen in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> montage of scenes from the series and Doctor Who.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, it was {{announced}} that Talbot had signed a contract with Data Design Interactive for production <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game on the Wii console. The game was to feature 15 songs from Over the Rainbow, allowing players to sing along with a computer-generated image of Talbot or against other players in a karaoke mode. Talbot re-recorded the album for the game. The game was scheduled for release {{in the first quarter of}} 2009, and is called Connie Talbot: Over the Rainbow. The game has never been released, citing copyright issues on the songs used for it.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to standard usages {{listed in the}} law, the emblem {{has been used in}} various other circumstances. The emblem is displayed, along with the national flag, at {{the beginning and the end}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> clip with the Belarusian anthem My Belarusy, regularly played on Belarusian television. Another use of the emblem is on ballot boxes and campaign mailings used during national and local elections. The emblem also appears on Belarus's border posts.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{large portion}} of today's Internet traffic {{originates}} from streaming and video services. Such services rely on <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> distributed datacenters, powerful content delivery networks (CDN), and multi-level caching. In spite of this infrastructure, storing, indexing, and serving these <b>videos</b> remains <b>a</b> daily engineering challenge that requires increasing efforts {{on the part of}} providers and ISPs. In this paper, we explore how the tags attached to videos by users could help improve this infrastructure, and lead to better performance on a global scale. Our analysis shows that tags can be interpreted as markers <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video's</b> geographic diffusion, with some tags strongly linked to well identified geographic areas. Based on our findings, we demonstrate the potential of tags to help predict distribution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video's</b> views, and present results suggesting that tags can help place videos in globally distributed datacenters. We show in particular that even a simplistic approach based on tags can help predict <b>a</b> minimum <b>of</b> 65. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video's</b> views for <b>a</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>videos,</b> and that <b>a</b> simple tag-based placement strategy is able to improve the hit rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distributed on-line <b>video</b> service by up to 6. 8 % globally over a naive random allocation...|$|R

5|$|Karim {{said the}} {{inspiration}} for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson's role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident, when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, {{which led to the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> sharing site. Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service, and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.|$|E
5|$|The Boys from Baghdad High, {{also known}} as Baghdad High, is a British-American-French {{television}} documentary film. It was first shown in the United Kingdom at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, before airing on BBC Two on 8 January 2008. It also aired in many other countries including France, Australia, the United States, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. It documents the lives of four Iraqi schoolboys of different religious or ethnic backgrounds {{over the course of}} one year in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> diary. The documentary was filmed by the boys themselves, who were given video cameras for the project.|$|E
5|$|The game {{follows the}} five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn {{they are part}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit {{predecessors}} from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.|$|E

5|$|The game of Nim {{running on}} the Nimrod is a {{candidate}} for one of the first video games, as {{it was one of the}} first computer games to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only four years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display, and one year after Bertie the Brain, a computer similar to the Nimrod which played tic-tac-toe at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The Nimrod's use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, The Lone Gunmen summon Mulder and Scully to the headquarters <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game design company after a new virtual reality game, which the Gunmen helped design, is taken over by a bizarre female computer character whose power {{is much more than}} virtual.|$|E
5|$|With the {{announcement}} {{and development of}} the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, speculation spread that an enhanced remake of the original Final Fantasy VII would be released for the PlayStation 3. This conjecture was sparked at the 2005 E3 convention by the release <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> featuring the opening sequence of Final Fantasy VII recreated using the PlayStation 3's graphical capabilities. Throughout the lifespan of the PS3, SquareEnix stated that such a game was not in development. A high definition remake was eventually announced at E3 2015 for the PlayStation 4. The game will be more than a high definition remaster, with director Tetsuya Nomura stating that the game will have changes made to its story and combat system.|$|E

5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Phorce is a remix {{album of}} Super Furry Animals' 2003 record Phantom Power. The remixes had {{previously}} {{appeared on the}} DVD version of Phantom Power—they were re-released as Phantom Phorce on the band's own Placid Casual label {{as a way of}} ensuring the remixers would receive royalties for the tracks. The album features a commentary from the fictional 'Kurt Stern' who appears between songs to discuss the re-recording of Phantom Power under his guidance after being unhappy with the original. First editions of the album came packaged in a case that doubled as a paper model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game arcade cabinet, and included a bonus CD; the Slow Life EP. Critical reaction to Phantom Phorce was generally positive.|$|E
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E
