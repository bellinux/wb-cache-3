5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border.

Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence <b>of</b> <b>older</b> players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E

5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts <b>of</b> <b>older</b> formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E

The study was completed two years later and reported that the main cables had suffered an 8–10% loss of strength.

The acronym DIS comes from Dalnij Istrebitel Soprovozhdenya or long-range escort fighter. Similarly, the MiG-9 designation was intended for the production version of the MiG-3 with the ASh-82 radial engine. This name was reused shortly afterwards for the first Mikoyan-Gurevich jet fighter.|$|E
