5|$|The Prospect Park Zoo {{closed to}} the public in June 1988. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> new homes were found for the {{displaced}} animals in other zoos throughout the US. Demolition was managed by the Parks Department and began in June 1989, commencing what became nearly a five-year, $37 million effort, overrunning initial estimates by two years and $19 million. The exteriors of the Aymar Embury buildings were preserved, but badly deteriorated interiors were gutted, pits and cages were demolished, and new structures were built. The facilities were turned over to the NY Zoological Society in April 1993.|$|E
5|$|In January 1943, Tirpitz {{emerged from}} the lengthy overhaul, after which she was {{transferred}} to Altafjord. Here, she participated in extensive training operations with Scharnhorst and the heavy cruiser , which lasted {{until the middle of}} the year. In early September, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and ten destroyers bombarded the island of Spitzbergen, which served as a British refuelling station. The two battleships destroyed their targets and returned safely to Altenfjord; {{this was the first time}} Tirpitz fired her main guns in anger. On 22–23 September, six British midget submarines attacked Tirpitz while at anchor. Two of the submarines successfully planted explosive charges against the battleship's hull, which did serious damage. Tirpitz had been successfully neutralised. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> a workforce of some 1,000 men effected the needed repairs, which were finished by March 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Japanese to take Port Moresby and their defeat at Midway {{had the effect of}} leaving their base at Tulagi without {{effective}} protection from other Japanese bases. Tulagi was four hours flying time from Rabaul, the nearest large Japanese base. On 7 August 1942, 11,000 U.S. Marines landed on Guadalcanal and 3,000 U.S. Marines landed on Tulagi and nearby islands. The Japanese troops on Tulagi and nearby islands were outnumbered and killed almost to the last man in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo while the U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal captured the airfield at Lunga Point without significant resistance. Thus began the Guadalcanal campaign that resulted in a series of large, combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> which—along with the New Guinea campaign—would decide the fate of Japanese efforts to secure the southern frontier of their empire in the Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Washington's army of 11,000 {{went into}} winter {{quarters}} at Valley Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> the deaths in camp numbered in the thousands, the majority being from disease, compounded {{by lack of}} food and proper clothing, poor shelter, and the extreme cold. Historians' death toll estimates range from 2,000 to over 3,000 men. The British were comfortably quartered in Philadelphia and paid for their supplies in sterling. In contrast, Washington had difficulty procuring supplies from the few farmers in the area who would not accept rapidly depreciating American paper currency, while the woodlands about the valley had soon been exhausted of game. As conditions worsened, Washington was faced {{with the task of}} maintaining morale and discouraging desertion, which had become common by February.|$|E
5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{expulsion}} of the Fatimids from Egypt, al-Ikhshid had his troops occupy all of Syria up to Aleppo, allying himself, as Ibn Tulun had done, with the local tribe of Banu Kilab to strengthen his hold over northern Syria. As governor of Syria, his remit extended to the borderlands (thughur) with the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Thus in 936/7 or 937/8 (most likely in autumn 937) he received an embassy from the Byzantine emperor, Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944), to organize a prisoner exchange. Although {{carried out in the}} name of Caliph al-Radi, it was a special honour and an implicit recognition of al-Ikhshid's autonomy, since correspondence and negotiations for such events were normally directed to the caliph rather than provincial governors. The exchange took place in autumn 938, resulting in the release of 6,300 Muslims for an equivalent number of Byzantine captives. As the Byzantines held 800 more prisoners than the Muslims, these had to be ransomed and were gradually released <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E

After two months based in Australia, Glory returned to Korean operations, where the squadron flew another 689 sorties, with 104 of them flown in one day. In May 1952 the squadron transferred its aircraft to Ocean, and the crews sailed home in Theseus.|$|E

25|$|The last squadron's last Neptune flight {{took place}} in late 1967. In February 1968, No. 11 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Edinburgh where it re-equipped with P-3B Orion {{aircraft}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> dispatching crews to the United States to retrieve the aircraft. From early 1981, the squadron's aircraft were dispatched regularly to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia as part of No. 92 Wing.

25|$|The Earps and Doc Holliday {{were charged}} by Billy Clanton's brother, Ike Clanton, with murder but were {{eventually}} exonerated {{by a local}} judge after a 30-day preliminary hearing and then again by a local grand jury. The so-called cowboy faction allegedly targeted the Earps for assassination <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> {{which led to a}} series of killings and retributions, often with federal and county lawmen supporting different sides of the conflict. The series of battles became known as the Earp Vendetta Ride. The Earps and Doc Holliday left Arizona and the Cowboy element was less of a threat from that point forward.|$|E
25|$|When Member Donald Wakefield Smith's term on the Board expired, Roosevelt put William M. Leiserson (Chairman of the National Mediation Board and a {{conservative}} Democrat) on the NLRB {{in his place}} on July 1, 1939. Leiserson forced Madden to appoint a personnel director and a trial examiner to reduce Witt's power, and unsuccessfully sought Witt's dismissal and {{a significant reduction in}} the Board's legal staff. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> Madden abandoned his formerly expansive interpretation of the NLRA and began switching {{back and forth between the}} liberal position represented by Member Edwin S. Smith and the conservative position advocated by William M. Leiserson.|$|E
25|$|The {{new class}} was largely {{designed}} at Ashford railway works but, {{as a result}} of the unexpected need to redesign and rebuild the SECR K class locomotives at Ashford, Maunsell decided to construct the Z class at Brighton. One result of this change was that the boiler used was of an existing Brighton design, that of the D.E. Marsh C3 class. The resultant design was a three-cylinder locomotive that incorporated Walschaerts outside valve gear, driving the third axle and a custom-built inside gear driving the second. The first of the class emerged from Brighton in March 1929 followed by the remainder <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
