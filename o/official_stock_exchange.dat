2500|$|The VOC {{played a}} crucial role in the rise of {{corporate}}-led globalization, corporate governance, corporate identity, corporate social responsibility, corporate finance, modern entrepreneurship, and financial capitalism. During its golden age, the company made some fundamental institutional innovations in economic and financial history. These financially revolutionary innovations allowed a single company (like the VOC) to mobilize financial resources from a large number of investors and create ventures at a scale that had previously only been possible for monarchs. In the words of Canadian historian and sinologist Timothy Brook, [...] "the Dutch East India Company—the VOC, as it is known—is to corporate capitalism what Benjamin Franklin's kite is to electronics: the beginning of something momentous that could not have been predicted at the time." [...] The birth of the VOC is often considered to be the official beginning of the corporate globalization era with the rise of modern corporations as a powerful socio-politico-economic system In [...] "The Age of Uncertainty" [...] (1977), John Kenneth Galbraith, writes, [...] "The institution that most changes our lives we least understand or, more correctly, seek most elaborately to misunderstand. That is the modern corporation. Week by week, month by month, year by year, it exercises a greater influence on our livelihood and the way we live than unions, universities, politicians, the government." [...] that significantly affect humans lives in every corner of the world today. As the world's first publicly traded company and first listed company (the first company to be ever listed on an <b>official</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchange),</b> the VOC was the first company to issue stock and bonds to the general public. Considered by many experts to be the world's first truly (modern) multinational corporation, the VOC was also the first permanently organized limited-liability joint-stock company, with a permanent capital base. The VOC shareholders were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern corporate governance and corporate finance. The VOC is often considered as the precursor of modern corporations, if not the first truly modern corporation. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. With its pioneering features such as corporate identity (first globally-recognized corporate logo), entrepreneurial spirit, legal personhood, transnational (multinational) operational structure, high and stable profitability, permanent capital (fixed capital stock), freely transferable shares and tradable securities, separation of ownership and management, and limited liability for both shareholders and managers, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for the large-scale business enterprises that now dominate the global economy.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} the article are the {{questions}} concerning the „ethical aspects” of functioning of stock exchange law during partitions of Poland {{and in the first}} years of independent Poland. The analysis covers the period from 1817 (when in Warsaw the first <b>official</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> on Polish territory was created) to 1921 when the first in independent Poland Act about the Organization of Stock Exchanges was passed. In the 19 th century, several stock exchanges were created on Polish territory, from which the most essential were those in: Warsaw, Lvov and Lodz. The stock exchange was (and still is) regarded as one of the key institutions of market economy. Already, even on this account, the stock exchange law constituted the essential reference to economic law. On its basis the important institutions functioned, not only in the area of economy. In this article, the basic records of laws and exchange charters were traced, as well as different – essential for stock exchanges – documents (for instance, ministerial instructions), which set the principles of functioning of those institutions. The principles were considered from ethical norms’ point of view, which established ethics of economic life of that time. I have especially focused my attention on the principles of functioning of stock exchanges, which related to: the main stock organs, members of exchanges, as well as the so-called clientele. The stock exchange law also related to realities of that time, where-for different reasons – common cases of disobedience of the law occured. It should be stressed here, that stock exchange law was shaped on basis of economic legislation of the partitioners and that it was subject to changes along with political, economic and social transformations, which took place on Polish territory in the discussed period...|$|E
