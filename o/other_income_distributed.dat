30|$|Consider next non-earned rural income. If {{we assume}} that non-labor income is {{independent}} of demographic factors, then what is relevant is simply total non-labor <b>income</b> <b>distributed</b> across the observed population. For simplicity and as a first approximation assume that the 2012 amount of transfers and <b>other</b> <b>income</b> is invariant relative {{to the number of}} recipients. Then the effect of demographic factors is what per capita transfers in 2012 would have been with the base period population. Actual non-earned income per capita in 2012 was 801 soles. (171  +  630) Had the rural population remained at the 2004 level, non-earned income would have been 729 soles. 8 In other words outmigration increased per capita non-earned income by 72 soles. To put this another way, the increase in non-earned income to the base period population was 276 soles. Since the observed change in non-earned income per capita between 2004 and 2012 was 348 soles, we estimate that 21 % of that change came from a reduction in the rural population (72 / 348) and 79 % from the direct increase in transfers and <b>other</b> <b>income</b> received by the remaining rural population (276 / 348).|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the optimal dynamic consumption portfolio {{problem in the}} presence of capital gains taxes. It explicitly takes into account limited capital loss deduction and the 3, 000 dollar amount that can be o set against <b>other</b> <b>income.</b> Constantinides (1983) shows that in taxsystems where capital gains and losses are subject to the same taxable treatment, it is is optimal to realize capital losses immediately. We generalize this nding to tax-systems where limited amounts of losses can be used against <b>other</b> <b>income.</b> In such tax-systems, the investment decision becomes substantially more di cult for two reasons. First, the investor has the opportunity of o setting limited amounts of losses against <b>other</b> <b>income.</b> Hence, she has to make a decision on how to use a loss, i. e. whether to o set it against realized capital gains or to potentially postpone the realization of capital gains and o set it against <b>other</b> <b>income.</b> Second, because the tax rate on <b>other</b> <b>income</b> usually exceeds that on capital gains, in our setting it can be optimal to realize capital gains immediately, which prevents investors from getting locked in and helps to keep portfolios diversi ed.
