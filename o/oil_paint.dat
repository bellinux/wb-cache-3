As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower was painted with high quality <b>oil</b> <b>paint,</b> which became the main contributor to {{the deterioration of the}} tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers of paint did not allow the limestone to dry.

5|$|In the Netherlands, a {{particularly}} vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van Eyck was particularly influential {{on the development}} of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation (see Renaissance in the Netherlands). Later, the work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.|$|E

5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of <b>oil</b> <b>paint.</b> Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

5|$|Medieval frescoes used {{to cover}} the {{entirety}} of the church's interior, though only some 70 fragments survive until today. Until 1961, the existence of a medieval mural layer was unknown because the walls were covered with <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> in the 1910s. The medieval frescoes were uncovered and restored between 1970 and 1975 by a team under Dragomir Peshev. The dating of the frescoes is as controversial as that of the church itself. Bozhkov places the painting of the murals in the 12th century, while scholars Bistra Nikolova and V. Mavrodinova believe they were created in the 13th century. According to Nikolova, the mural inscriptions in Medieval Greek (as opposed to Middle Bulgarian) are evidence that the frescoes were painted during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria (1018–1185). At the time, the region of Patalenitsa would have belonged to the Byzantine bishopric centred at Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv).|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of oil painting, oil on panel began to replace tempera as a favoured method of enhancing a church.

25|$|More {{modification}} of the technique occurred in the 18th century, perhaps because {{it was no longer}} done only by the indigenous.

25|$|Van Eyck {{used the}} {{technique}} of applying layer after layer of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour. The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini's world. Van Eyck {{took advantage of the}} longer drying time of <b>oil</b> <b>paint,</b> compared to tempera, to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms. The medium of <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.|$|E
25|$|Returning to {{his studio}} in New York City, Gifford painted {{numerous}} major landscapes from scenes he recorded on his travels.

Those scenes he most favored he then developed into small, finished paintings, then into larger, finished paintings.|$|E
25|$|Almost 60 years later, in 1937, the iconostasis was renovated again {{although}} but the re-painting {{work was}} considered to be of really low artistic quality.

25|$|An Oil sketch or oil {{study is}} an artwork made {{primarily}} in <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> {{in preparation for}} a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or modelli, especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting.
