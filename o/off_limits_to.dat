5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of Mexican control, the bay was put <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> {{settlement}} by the authorities. An empresario granted in 1828 allowed Irish and Mexican immigration. In 1832, the settlement of Aransas City on the bay, was founded by James Power. After {{the development of the}} nearby port Lamar in 1840, Aransas City was deserted by 1846. But Lamar soon met a similar fate, after being burnt to the ground during the American Civil War. The city of Aransas, which was founded on San Jose Island around the same time as Lamar, was also destroyed in the fighting. During the war, the bay was a strategically significant waterway for the transfer of freight, due to its protection from Gulf seas by barrier islands.|$|E

50|$|The refuge {{was formed}} in 2000 after a 1989 order to {{gradually}} close the Jefferson Proving Ground, a World War II era munitions testing facility, which was completed by 1995. The refuge is located north of the historic firing line and surrounds a 1000 acre parcel operated by the Indiana Air National Guard. A zone used for firing tests remains <b>off</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the public due to the prohibitive cost of cleanup.|$|R
50|$|One unique {{aspect to}} the sport of quidditch is the usage of a snitch, a neutral athlete {{as well as a}} referee, to end the game. The snitching game is one of wrestling and running where seekers combat each other as well as the snitch. The snitch is able to defend themself in any way {{possible}} except for climbing buildings and trees. Certain tournaments stipulate actions that are <b>off</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> snitches depending on the circumstances, but generally snitches have a full range of motions.|$|R
50|$|The Kong Karls Land {{archipelago}} {{serves as}} the most important breeding ground for polar bears in Svalbard and Franz Josef Land; therefore, the archipelago is completely <b>off</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> all visitors. Walruses have resting places in the reserve. At Alkefjleet, Brünnich's guillemots have a nesting ground, and also brent geese can be found breeding in the reserve, as can Sabine's and ivory gulls. Other important breeding areas for seabirds include Sjuøyane, Lågøya and Hinlopen Strait. Common animals within the nature reserve is Arctic fox and Svalbard reindeer. A large part of the reserve, including the sea-cliffs, has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding population of 80-90 pairs of ivory gulls.|$|R

At most other times, Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium is open for students to jog around the concourse, run stadium steps, or just sit in the stands, although the actual playing surface is <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> prevent turf damage. The facility only occasionally hosts special events.|$|E

50|$|The {{lower parts}} of the walls of Van Citadel were {{constructed}} of unmortared basalt, while the rest was built from mud-bricks. Such fortresses were used for regional control, {{rather than as a}} defense against foreign armies. The ancient ruins of the fortress support walls constructed during the medieval era. Other cuneiform inscriptions have been found at the site and are typically <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> unless <b>to</b> large tour groups due to vandalism.|$|R
25|$|Inside DEST Tower on Roboworld, the President asks Secretary of Defense Titan for {{a report}} about ships landing on Roboworld's moon, EUЯPSS (pronounced Europass) - a de-militarized zone that Roboworld signed away to {{refugees}} in the M-3 Nebula Federation, making it <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> Roboworld's troops. The President obtains a verbal oath from Colonel Volton to—fight to the death—to protect Roboworld and the M-3 Nebula.|$|E
25|$|Boy Scout Lane, {{sometimes}} written Boyscout Lane, is {{an isolated}} road located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. A number of ghost stories and urban legends have become {{associated with the}} road, including the fictional deaths of a troop of Boy Scouts.

The land surrounding Boy Scout Lane is now privately owned and is <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> the general public.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Bagan {{in its heyday}} is estimated anywhere between 50,000 to 200,000 people. Until the advent of tourism industry in the 1990s, only a few villagers lived in Old Bagan. The rise of tourism has attracted a sizable population to the area. Because Old Bagan is now <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> permanent dwellings, much of the population reside in either New Bagan, south of Old Bagan, or Nyaung-U, north of Old Bagan. The majority of native residents are Bamar.|$|E
5000|$|The governorates in the West Bank {{are grouped}} into three areas per the Oslo II Accord. Area A forms 18% of the West Bank by area, and is {{administered}} by the Palestinian Authority. Area B forms 22% of the West Bank, and is under Palestinian civil control, and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control. Area C, except East Jerusalem, forms 60% of the West Bank, and {{is administered by}} the Israeli Civil Administration, except that the Palestinian Authority provides the education and medical services to the 150,000 Palestinians in the area. 70.3% of Area C (40.5% of the West Bank) is <b>off</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> Palestinian construction and development. These areas include areas under jurisdiction of Israeli settlements, closed military zones, nature reserves and national parks and areas designated by Israel as [...] "state land". There are about 330,000 Israelis living in settlements in Area C, in the Judea and Samaria Area. Although Area C is under martial law, Israelis living there are judged in Israeli civil courts.|$|R

25|$|In 1789, {{both the}} United Kingdom and Spain {{attempted}} {{settlement in the}} Nootka Sound, on Vancouver Island. On 25 October 1790, these two Kingdoms approved the Nootka Sound Convention. The Conventions included provisions recognising that the coasts and islands of South America colonised by Spain {{at the time were}} Spanish, and that areas south of the southernmost settlements were <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> both countries, provided (in a secret article) that no third party settled there either. The conventions were unilaterally repudiated by Spain in 1795 but implicitly revived by the Treaty of Madrid in 1814.|$|E
50|$|Material take <b>off</b> is not <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> {{the amount}} of {{required}} material, but also {{the weight of the}} items taken off.

They play {{some of the same}} games including fill in the missing headline, however many games are <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> due <b>to</b> their visual nature. Frequently the same stories are covered on both Wait Wait and Have I Got News for You. Differences include, listeners calling in to win mini games and a celebrity interview and quiz {{in the middle of the}} show. Wait Wait is more closely related to The News Quiz which is also the inspiration for Have I Got News for You.|$|R
25|$|On 28 August, the {{offensive}} operation was extended, {{with the aim}} of occupying Moung Phine for a week and blocking the intersection of Routes 9 and 23 nine kilometers west of the town. As Moung Phine was the only Pathet Lao-held town in the Laotian panhandle, and served as a communist sanctuary, it was a prime target because it had been <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> air strikes. The renewed operation was facetiously dubbed Junction City Jr. after both the 1967 operation in South Vietnam and the road junction objective.|$|E
25|$|While Rabbi Moshe Feinstein permitted, in principle, {{entry to}} {{some parts of}} the site, most other Haredi rabbis are of the opinion that the Mount is <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> Jews and non-Jews alike. Their {{opinions}} against entering the Temple Mount are based on the current political climate surrounding the Mount, along with the potential danger of entering the hallowed area of the Temple courtyard and the impossibility of fulfilling the ritual requirement of cleansing oneself with the ashes of a red heifer. The boundaries of the areas which are completely forbidden, while having large portions in common, are delineated differently by various rabbinic authorities.|$|E
25|$|While the Horseshoe Falls {{absorbed the}} extra flow, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studied the {{riverbed}} and mechanically bolted and strengthened any faults they found; faults that would, if left untreated, have hastened the retreat of the American Falls. A plan {{to remove the}} huge mound of talus deposited in 1954 was abandoned owing to cost, and in November 1969, the temporary dam was dynamited, restoring flow to the American Falls. Even after these undertakings, Luna Island, the small piece of land between the main waterfall and the Bridal Veil, remained <b>off</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> the public for years owing to fears that it was unstable and could collapse into the gorge.|$|E
5000|$|It landed {{near the}} border area between Beta Regio and Hyndla Regio (within a 150 km radius of [...] ), {{three days after the}} {{touchdown}} of, and 2200 km from Venera 9. Venera 10 measured a surface windspeed of 3.5 m/s. Other measurements included atmospheric pressure at various heights, and temperature, and surface light levels. Venera 10 was the second probe to send back black and white television pictures from the Venusian surface (after Venera 9). Venera 10 photographs showed lava rocks of pancake shape with lava or other weathered rocks in between. Planned 360 degree panoramic pictures could not be taken because, as with Venera 9, one of two camera lens covers failed <b>to</b> come <b>off,</b> <b>limiting</b> pictures <b>to</b> 180 degrees.|$|R
25|$|If {{another team}} signs a {{released}} player {{who had a}} guaranteed contract (as long as the player has cleared waivers), the player's original team is allowed {{to reduce the amount}} of money they still owe the player (and lower their team payroll) by the right of set-off. This is true if the player signs with any professional team—it does not even have to be an NBA team. The amount the original team gets <b>to</b> set <b>off</b> is <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> one-half the difference between the player's new salary and a pro-rated share of the minimum salary for a one-year veteran (if the player is a rookie, then the rookie minimum is used instead).|$|R
50|$|Venera 9 {{measured}} {{clouds that}} were 30 - 40 km thick with bases at 30 - 35 km altitude. It also measured atmospheric chemicals including hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, bromine and iodine. Other measurements included surface pressure of about , temperature of 905 F, and surface light levels {{comparable to those}} at Earth mid-latitudes on a cloudy summer day. Venera 9 was the first probe to send back black and white television pictures from the Venusian surface showing no shadows, no apparent dust in the air, {{and a variety of}} 30 to 40 cm rocks which were not eroded. Planned 360-degree panoramic pictures could not be taken because one of two camera lens covers failed <b>to</b> come <b>off,</b> <b>limiting</b> pictures <b>to</b> 180 degrees.
