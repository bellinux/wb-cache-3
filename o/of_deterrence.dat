40|$|The {{subject of}} this article become {{relevant}} issues <b>of</b> strategic <b>deterrence</b> in the military sphere. The theme of the article is strategic deterrence, as {{the activity of the}} state in the military sphere. The {{purpose of this article is}} to discuss topical issues of the Russian Federation for security in the military sphere through the implementation of measures, which are united by the common concept <b>of</b> strategic <b>deterrence.</b> The article defines the goals, objectives and components <b>of</b> strategic <b>deterrence</b> <b>of</b> the Russian Federation To determine the necessary and sufficient measures which are capable of ensuring the prevention of possible threats and aggressive actions against Russia, it is compared with similar activities of the United States (strategic stability). The work methodology includes: define the conceptual field and a comparative analysis <b>of</b> strategic <b>deterrence</b> and strategic stability. Comparative characteristic is based on the transfer factors (nuclear and precision weapons), objects (military bases, spaceports, polygons) and events <b>of</b> strategic <b>deterrence</b> and strategic stability of their definitions and the features are given. The list of measures (types <b>of)</b> strategic <b>deterrence</b> and strategic stability are highlighted: political, diplomatic, economic, informational and military. Based on the principle of appropriate use of the defensive potential of the state, which assumes the implementation <b>of</b> the strategic <b>deterrence</b> as a complex of measures is necessary: to develop: high–tech sectors of the defense industry, relevant kinds and types of troops, providing strategic <b>deterrence,</b> objects <b>of</b> strategic <b>deterrence,</b> and their readiness strategy and combat use of specialized services and troops. Based on the study of the subject the following conclusions are made: strategic deterrence as a complex of state measures in the military sphere is based on nuclear warhead and vehicle which are possible at this stage, the events <b>of</b> strategic <b>deterrence</b> are carried out in five different directions. In the military sphere, the Russian Federation implements activities <b>of</b> strategic <b>deterrence,</b> aimed at the development of strategic nuclear forces and precision weapons.

25|$|Hanson {{is opposed}} to the Russian {{intervention}} in the Syrian civil war, which he argues {{is a part of}} a bid by Putin to construct an anti-American Russian-Syrian-Iranian-Iraqi alliance that will dominate the Middle East and intimidate the Gulf states. Hanson has made the claim that the primary responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War was not due to Adolf Hitler, but was rather due to the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the French Premier Édouard Daladier who failed to maintain credible threats <b>of</b> <b>deterrence.</b> Hanson has argued Obama has likewise failed to maintain a credible threat <b>of</b> <b>deterrence,</b> and as such, the world {{is on the verge of}} another war comparable to the Second World War. Hanson has predicted that Putin will sometime in the near-future invade one or more of the Baltic states if the United States does not provide more deterrence to Russia.|$|E
25|$|As for his {{political}} views, Archbishop Hannan {{was known to be}} a staunch anti-Communist, {{and was one of the}} leaders of a moderate minority of bishops who opposed the May 3, 1983 pastoral letter of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops entitled , which came out strongly against the notion <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> and advocated a nuclear freeze with the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Mearsheimer's {{first book}} Conventional Deterrence (1983) {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how decisions to start a war depend on the projected outcome of military conflict. In other words, how do decision makers' beliefs about the outcome of war affect the success or failure <b>of</b> <b>deterrence?</b> Mearsheimer's basic argument is that deterrence is likely to work when the potential attacker believes that a successful attack will be unlikely and costly. If the potential attacker, however, has reason to believe the attack will likely succeed and entail low costs, then deterrence is likely to break down. This is now widely accepted to be the way the principle <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> works. Specifically, Mearsheimer argues that the success <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> is determined by the strategy available to the potential attacker. He lays out three strategies. First, a war-of-attrition strategy, which entails a high level of uncertainty about the outcome of war and high costs for the attacker. Second, a limited-aims strategy, which entails fewer risks and lower costs. And, third, a blitzkrieg strategy, which provides a way to defeat the enemy rapidly and decisively, with relatively low costs. For Mearsheimer, failures in the modern battlefield are due mostly to the potential attacker's belief that it can successfully implement a blitzkrieg strategy in which tanks and other mechanized forces are employed swiftly to effect a deep penetration and disrupt the enemy's rear. The other two strategies are unlikely to lead to deterrence failures because they would entail a low probability of success accompanied by high costs (war of attrition) or limited gains and the possibility of the conflict turning into a war of attrition (limited aims). If the attacker has a coherent blitzkrieg strategy available, however, an attack is likely to ensue, as its potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks of starting a war.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, however, Ehrlich famously contradicted {{existing}} {{social science}} literature by seemingly proving the validity <b>of</b> the <b>deterrence</b> argument. Although Ehrlich's study appeared {{to show that}} executing individuals and publicizing said execution resulted in lower crime rates from the 1930s through the 1960s, his findings drew criticism, due to other researchers' inability to replicate the study and its findings. Since the publication of Ehrlich's controversial findings, studies have been increasingly contradictory. As studies' findings become increasingly contradictory, the validity <b>of</b> the <b>deterrence</b> argument has become even more highly contested. In fact, the most recently published article about the validity <b>of</b> the <b>deterrence</b> effect problematizes previous studies, arguing that econometric estimates <b>of</b> execution <b>deterrence</b> are easily manipulated and, by extension, fallible.|$|R

50|$|Nuclear {{ethics is}} {{interested}} in examining policies <b>of</b> nuclear <b>deterrence,</b> nuclear arms control and disarmament, and nuclear energy insofar as they {{are linked to the}} cause or prevention of nuclear warfare. Ethical justifications <b>of</b> nuclear <b>deterrence,</b> for example, emphasize its role in preventing great power nuclear war since the end of World War II. Indeed, some scholars claim that nuclear deterrence seems to be the morally rational response to a nuclear-armed world. Moral condemnation <b>of</b> nuclear <b>deterrence,</b> in contrast, emphasizes the seemingly inevitable violations of human and democratic rights which arise.|$|R

25|$|In {{a series}} of speeches in late 2001 and 2002, Bush {{expanded}} on his view of American foreign policy and global intervention, declaring that the United States should actively support democratic governments around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating the threat of terrorism, and that the United States {{had the right to}} act unilaterally in its own security interests, without the approval of international bodies such as the United Nations. This represented a departure from the Cold War policies <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> and containment under the Truman Doctrine and post–Cold War philosophies such as the Powell Doctrine and the Clinton Doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Reynaud {{returned}} to the cabinet in 1938 as Minister of Finance under Édouard Daladier. The Sudeten Crisis, which began not long after Reynaud was named Minister of Justice, again revealed the divide between Reynaud {{and the rest of}} the Alliance Démocratique; Reynaud adamantly opposed abandoning the Czechs to the Germans, while Flandin felt that allowing Germany to expand eastward would inevitably lead to a conflict with the Soviets that would weaken both. Reynaud publicly made his case, and in response Flandin pamphleted Paris in order to pressure the government to agree to Hitler's demands. Reynaud subsequently left his party to become an independent. However, Reynaud still had the support of Daladier, whose politique de fermeté ("policy of firmness") was very similar to Reynaud's notion <b>of</b> <b>deterrence.</b>|$|E

25|$|Deterrence: Theories <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> {{claim that}} by {{sentencing}} criminals to extremely harsh penalties, {{other people who}} might be considering criminal activities will be so terrified of the consequences that they will choose not to commit crimes out of fear. In reality, most studies show that high incarceration rates either increase crime, have no noticeable effect, or only decrease it by a very small amount. Prisons act as training grounds for criminal activity, form criminal social networks, expose prisoners to further abuse (both from staff and other prisoners), foster anti-social sentiments towards society (law enforcement and corrections personnel in particular), fragment communities, and leave prisoners with criminal records that make it difficult to find legal employment after release. All of these things can result in a higher likelihood of reoffending upon release.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{endophytic}} fungi on the chemical composition of {{plants have been}} known by humans for centuries {{in the form of}} poisoning and disease as well as medicinal uses. Especially noted were impacts on agricultural products and livestock. Recognition and study of the mutualism did not begin in earnest until the 1980s when early studies on the impacts of alkaloids on animal herbivory confirmed their importance as agents <b>of</b> <b>deterrence.</b> Biologists began to characterize the diversity of endophytic mutualists through primitive techniques such as isozyme analysis and measuring the effects of infection on herbivores. Basic descriptive accounts of these previously neglected species of fungus became a major goal for mycologists, and a lot of research focus shifted to associates of the grass family (Poaceae) in particular, because of the large number of species which represent economically important commodities to humans.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, {{detailed}} invasion plans were drawn up by the German military command, such as Operation Tannenbaum, but Switzerland was never attacked. Switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence, economic concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion. Attempts by Switzerland's small Nazi party to effect an Anschluss with Germany failed miserably, {{largely as a result of}} Switzerland's strong sense of national identity and long tradition of direct democracy and civil liberties. The Swiss press vigorously criticized the Third Reich, often infuriating its leadership. In turn, Berlin denounced Switzerland as a medieval remnant and its people renegade Germans. Under General Guisan's central command, the military of Switzerland was mobilized to defend the country from possible foreign intrusion. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders, to a strategy of organized long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the National Redoubt. This controversial strategy was essentially one <b>of</b> <b>deterrence.</b> The idea was to cause huge losses to German forces and render the cost of invading too high. During an invasion, the Swiss Army would cede control of the economic heartland and population centres, but retain control of crucial rail links and passes in the National Redoubt.|$|E

500|$|The Navy {{gradually}} {{developed a}} reputation for having the most highly developed technology of all the U.S. services.

The [...] was the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and was followed by the Nimitz-class supercarriers. Ballistic missile submarines grew ever more deadly and quiet, culminating in the Ohio-class submarines. Rickover had a strong base of support in Congress and in public opinion, and he forced nuclear power to be a high Navy priority, especially for submarines.

HER accounted for 11 per cent of the Ministry of Supply's expenditure between 1946 and 1953. It had bi-partisan and popular support.
