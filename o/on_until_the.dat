5|$|As {{production}} of F-105s had ended, the type was replaced in the Vietnam War by other aircraft, primarily the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. In October 1970, the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Takhli RTAFB, Thailand, the last F-105D unit in Southeast Asia, began {{to return to}} the U.S. The F-105G Wild Weasel versions soldiered <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of the war.

5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> early 19th century, and {{it was not until the}} latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E
5|$|Adnan led a 42-strong platoon {{from the}} Malay Regiment in the defence of Singapore against the invading Japanese. The {{soldiers}} fought at the Battle of Pasir Panjang, at Pasir Panjang Ridge in the Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) area on 12–14 February 1942. Although heavily outnumbered, Adnan refused to surrender and urged {{his men to}} fight <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end. They held off the Japanese troops for two days amid heavy enemy shelling from artillery guns and tanks and chronic shortages of food, medical supplies and ammunition (on {{the last day of}} the battle, Adnan and his men were only left with a few hand grenades and had to fight off the Japanese soldiers with their bayonets and through brutal hand-to-hand combat. Adnan was shot but carried on fighting.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men <b>on,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|By 16:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had {{captured}} No. 2 redoubt, and Chaytor reported capturing buildings and redoubts on the left. After {{a telephone call}} between Chauvel and Chetwode, pressure continued to be exerted and an attack by all units took place at 16:30. The Ottoman garrison held <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> dismounted attackers were within , but by that time, {{there was no doubt}} that the Ottoman garrison was losing the fight, and they began to surrender in small groups. All organised resistance ceased ten minutes later and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered out, while prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and watered at the captured wells. Then Chauvel rode into Magdhaba and gave the order to clear the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|European {{companies}} which bought foreign patents the Wrights {{had received}} sued other manufacturers in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903. In the U.S. the Wrights {{made an agreement}} with the Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots from a legal threat.

5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} breakaway group held <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race. It was on a section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmuller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) {{broke away from the}} lead group to try for the victory. As if the success of the breakaway wasn't enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.|$|E
5|$|Until 1908, revivals of {{the opera}} were given in {{contemporary}} dress, with ladies' costumes executed by couture houses such as Redfern. After that, designers such as Percy Anderson, George Sheringham and Peter Goffin created Victorian costume designs. The 1887 set was designed by Hawes Craven. In the winter of 1940–41, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's scenery and costumes for Pinafore and three other operas were destroyed by German bombs during World War II. The opera was revived in London {{in the summer of}} 1947. It was then included in the D'Oyly Carte repertory in every season from then <b>on,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> company's closure in 1982. The D'Oyly Carte company performed Pinafore before Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family at Windsor Castle on 16 June 1977, during the queen's Silver Jubilee year, the first royal command performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera since 1891.|$|E

5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E
5|$|India {{came out}} to bat with Tendulkar and Sehwag. McGrath opened the bowling for Australia. Tendulkar hit a {{boundary}} off the fourth ball of the over but was dismissed off the next delivery. Ganguly joined Sehwag and the pair scored at a run-a-ball before the former was dismissed by Lee in the tenth over. Kaif, the next man, was dismissed in the same over with the score 59 runs for 3 wickets. Dravid and Sehwag scored steadily from then <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth over, when rain interrupted play with the score at 103 runs. After play resumed, Ponting brought in Australia's spinners, Brad Hogg and Darren Lehmann. Sehwag was more aggressive against both, hitting Lehmann for three consecutive fours and Hogg for a four and six; Dravid played a secondary role to Sehwag, pushing often for singles. They were dismissed in quick succession after making 82 (off 81 balls) and 47 (off 57 balls) respectively. Following that, India began to lose wickets at regular intervals. Except for Yuvraj Singh (24) and Dinesh Mongia (12), {{the rest of the}} players were out for single-digit scores. India were bowled out for 234 runs in 39.2 overs when Zaheer Khan was dismissed by McGrath. Australia won the match by 125 runs, the largest margin of victory by runs in a World Cup final. It was their second successive World Cup trophy and their third overall. Ponting was declared the Man of the match for his 140 not out.|$|E
5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked so strange that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} a home port for cruise ships from Carnival Cruise Lines. The first cruise ship {{to call the}} port home was the Holiday, which left the city in November 2009 so that a larger and newer ship could take its place. The Carnival Fantasy {{operated}} from Mobile from then <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Carnival Elation arrived in May 2010. In early 2011, Carnival announced that despite fully booked cruises, the company would cease operations from Mobile in October 2011. This cessation of cruise service left the city with an annual debt service of around two million dollars related to the terminal. In September 2015, Carnival announced that the Carnival Fantasy was relocating from Miami, Florida to Mobile, Alabama after a five-year absence and would offer four and five night cruises to Mexico that started in November 2016 through November 2017. The four night cruises will visit Cozumel, Mexico while the five night cruises will additionally visit Costa Maya or Progreso. Her first departure from Mobile left on November 9, 2016 on a five night cruise to Cozumel and Progreso. Currently, she is scheduled to sail thru April 2018.|$|E
5|$|The weaker {{members of}} the party—Arnold Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of {{physical}} breakdown, as the long march south began from Bluff Depot towards Mount Hope at 83°30S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, snow blindness and, eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought <b>on</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, {{he had to be}} carried on the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the limits of their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness, led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, and the five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.|$|E
