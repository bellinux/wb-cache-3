5|$|During the search, Andrea (Laurie Holden) confronts Dale {{about her}} {{decision}} {{to stay at the}} CDC and wanting to die on her <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> and his choice to stay with her took that chance away from her. The group finds a small church and dispatch the few walkers inside. As Carol prays for the return of her daughter, Andrea overhears Shane arguing with Lori about his leaving, and she tells him she wants to go with him. Rick, seeing the group starting to break apart, questions his leadership abilities and also prays for guidance.|$|E
5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the helm of the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E

5|$|Empress Shulü Ping, {{who became}} known as Empress Dowager Yingtian {{following}} the death of her husband, was an exceptionally powerful figure both before and after Taizu's death. While the latter was alive, Shulü Ping commanded an army of 200,000 horsemen that was tasked with maintaining order while Taizu led military campaigns abroad. She also led campaigns herself. Following the death of her husband, the Empress rejected the traditional Khitan custom of being buried with him, and elected to cut off her right hand and bury that with the Emperor instead. Shulü Ping then seized full military and civil authority in order to oversee the imperial succession under her <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> The Empress's refusal to kill herself and be buried with Taizu effectively ended the longstanding custom.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{replied to}} Nabis by proposing his <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> under which Sparta and Rome would {{conclude}} a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos {{with all his}} garrisons from the Argolid; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a war indemnity over {{the next eight years}} and not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities. Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that he had enough supplies to withstand a siege. Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city. Flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered {{by the fact that the}} Romans' large shields made missile attacks futile.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{was summoned}} to Karinhall on 18 August 1940, and missed the intense air battle that day, known as The Hardest Day. During the meeting, Göring insisted that, in combat, Bf 109 fighters escort Bf 110s, which could not survive against {{single-engine}} fighters. As high-scoring aces, both Galland and Mölders shared their concerns that close escort of Bf 110s and bombers robbed fighter pilots of their freedom to roam and engage the enemy on their <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> They also pointed {{to the fact that}} German bombers flew at medium altitudes and low speed, the best height area and speed for the manoeuvrability of the Spitfire. Galland resented his pilots having to carry out a task unsuited to their equipment but Göring would not move from his position.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman {{blockade}} quickly {{reduced the}} inhabitants to near starvation, and led {{many of them}} to flee the city. When coupled with the restrictions placed on them by the siege, the inability of Venice to properly supply and guard the city, and the violations of their customary rights and rampant profiteering by Venetian officials, a pro-surrender party was formed and gained strength among the inhabitants. The city's Metropolitan, Symeon, encouraged his flock to resist, but by 1426, with Venice's inability to secure peace on its <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> evident, {{a majority of the}} local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid the pillage accompanying a forcible conquest. Venice's efforts to find allies against the Ottomans also failed, as the other regional potentates either pursued their own course, were themselves antagonistic to the Venetians, or were defeated by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{during the}} Battle of Narva denied the Soviets {{the use of}} Estonia as a {{favorable}} base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. Stavka's hopes of assaulting Finland from Estonia and forcing it into capitulation were diminished. Finnish Chief of Defence Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim repeatedly reminded the German side that in the event their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland {{would be forced to}} make peace even on extremely unfavourable terms. Thus, the prolonged Battle of Narva helped Finland avoid a Soviet occupation, sustained its capacity for resistance and enabled them to enter negotiations for the Moscow Armistice on their <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other animal}} stories that uses words humans use, the feline {{characters}} of the Warriors series use different words for certain concepts and objects in the natural world. The most common terms found within the books are 'Twolegs' (humans), 'kittypets' (house cats), 'monsters' (cars), 'the Thunderpath' (a road) or 'the horseplace' (a stable). The cats also have their <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> for time and measurement, such as sundown or moonhigh representing different times of day according to {{the positions of the}} moon, sun, and stars overhead. The seasons are given names according to the trees and foliage in the forest, with 'newleaf' meaning spring, 'greenleaf' meaning summer, 'leaf-fall' meaning autumn, and 'leaf-bare' meaning winter.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1912 naval law was passed, Britain and Germany {{attempted}} {{to reach a}} compromise with the Haldane Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard Haldane. The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned {{the idea of a}} decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle on its <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> which would render it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact adopt this strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact {{to be used as a}} bargaining chip in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.|$|E
5|$|In 1445, Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{was asked}} to assume the Polish throne vacated upon {{the death of his}} brother Władysław. Casimir was a tough {{negotiator}} and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 on his <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group. He replaced their influence with a power base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was able to resolve a conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor.|$|E

5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him on his <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E
