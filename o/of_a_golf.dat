No other woman competed against men in this tournament until Annika Sörenstam, Suzy Whaley and Michelle Wie almost six decades later. She shot 81 and 84, and missed the cut.

As a result of the political uprisings in Burma, the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund withdrew from the fundraising golf tournament because of Player's unsubstantiated business links with the country. Both Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu accepted Player's position and statements on Burma. Player refused to withdraw as he personally built the golf event from scratch and issued a statement rebutting these claims via his website. The event is now annually staged at the Fancourt Resort as the Gary Player Invitational.|$|E

Many local bus services were diverted to service the new shopping centre upon its opening, but the centre was primarily designed for the age of the automobile with plenty of parking as it was distant from any railway stations. It has since had many upgrades although it remains smaller than other Sydney shopping centres. It is currently owned and operated by Vicinity Centres.

25|$|After {{the horrors}} of the Brisbane Test the MCC got to play another upcountry game played in a rodeo dustbowl. Hutton won the toss, batted and put on 112 with Bill Edrich (74), who seemed to have regained his form, before he was out for 40. Peter May made 69 and Jim Wilson 61, but the last five wickets fell for 26 runs., from 291/5 to 317 all out, with the retired Queensland leg spinner Donald Watt taking 5/56 with help from fellow leggie Kenneth Jenkins (4/44). The innings had reduced the {{makeshift}} wicket to the consistency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> bunker and Hutton allowed it to be rebuilt for the next day. Opener Wilfred Brown top scored with 22 in the Country innings as they collapsed to 95 off 42.1 eight-ball overs with Peter Loader (3/22), Johnny Wardle (2/22), Bob Appleyard (2/18) and Tom Graveney (2/8) sharing the wickets. Hutton put them straight back in again and this time they did better, Brown making 78 and adding 108 for the second wicket with Renald Sippel (45), but Appleyard (7/51) spun his way {{through the rest of the}} batting order with some help from Graveney (2/49). The home team agreed to play past stumps so that the MCC could dismiss them, and the tourists won by an innings and 12 runs. This received some criticism in the Australian press, who forgot that Hutton had sportingly allowed the wicket to be remade.|$|E
