5|$|The {{weaknesses}} of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated to a significant degree by the lack <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> across Yugoslavia which had resulted from two decades of Serb hegemony, and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the lack <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> came too late {{to ensure that the}} VKJ was a cohesive force. Fifth column activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše, but also from the Slovene and ethnic German minorities in the country.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius entered {{diplomatic}} relations with the Croats and Serbs in the Balkans.

5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or that it is necessary for salvation.

40|$|Abstract Frege {{proposed}} his {{doctrine of}} unsaturatedness {{as a solution}} to the problems <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the proposition and the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the sentence. I explain the traditional solution to the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the sentence, as expounded by Mill, which invokes a syncategorematic sign of predication and the connotation and denotation of terms. I streamline this solution and bring it up to date. I contrast this conventionalist theory with Frege’s unsaturatedness theory. I show that Frege’s theory is mystical, ad hoc, ineffective and paradoxical, and that it entails that singular terms cannot be predicates. I argue that the conventionalist account is free of these defects and that it provides a clear and intelligible solution to the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the sentence. I suggest that the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the proposition is spurious. I recommend that the notion of unsaturatedness be extruded from serious debate.

50|$|Voltaire {{reworked}} {{the structure}} of the play in order to fit the classical model of French drama. L'Orphelin de la Chine adheres to the theory <b>of</b> three <b>unities,</b> which codified that dramas should conform to the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> action, <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> time, and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> place. Voltaire's 1753 version of the drama follows the three-act structure and was later expanded to five acts when it was performed by Comedie Francaise in 1755.|$|R
40|$|In "Consciousness and persons", Michael Tye (Tye, M. (2003). Consciousness and persons. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.) {{develops}} and defends a novel {{approach to}} the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> consciousness. Rather than thinking <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> consciousness as involving phenomenal relations between distinct experiences, as standard accounts do, Tye argues that we should regard the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> consciousness as involving relations between the contents of consciousness.

5|$|John Fine, on {{the other}} hand, {{suggests}} that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450–449BC, due to Pericles' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the Aegean.

5|$|After {{the end of}} World War I in 1918, the Habsburgs were deposed and {{the empire}} became four {{independent}} countries, Austria, Hungary, and the newly formed Czechoslovakia and State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Charles and Zita left for exile in Switzerland and later Madeira, where Charles died in 1922. After her husband's death, Zita and her son Otto served as symbols <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> for the exiled dynasty. A devout Roman Catholic, she raised a large family after being widowed {{at the age of}} 29, and never remarried.|$|E
5|$|Andriamasinavalona died in 1710 {{when one}} of his wives, Rasolomananambonitany, {{inadvertently}} pushed him from the elevated bed where they slept. He was buried in the royal tombs located at the Rova of Antananarivo. In opposition to Andriamasinavalona's intentions, after the king's death his sons forsook the concept <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> and instead fought one another in an effort to expand their realms. As a consequence of this decision, Imerina fragmented and was wracked with conflict for 77 years, until the kingdom was once again united during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina (17871810).|$|E

Historically, both groups have seen {{themselves}} as separate communities, {{although there has been}} a greater sense <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> since the 1980s. In 1948, the United National Party government stripped the Indian Tamils of their citizenship. Under the terms of an agreement reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about forty percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and most of the remainder were repatriated to India. By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few months}} after the failed {{offensive}} against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all vestiges <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> and badly weakened Libyan power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, Ahmat Acyl, leader of the Volcan Army, attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{recorded}} The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The {{title is}} {{an allusion to}} lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence <b>of</b> <b>unity.</b> Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.|$|E
50|$|Production of Barney Miller {{deliberately}} {{resembled a}} theatrical play; scenes rarely strayed from the precinct station's squadroom, with its prominent open-barred holding cell, and Miller's adjoining office.

Barney Miller tended to obey two of the three classical <b>unities</b> <b>of</b> drama: <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> place and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> time.

5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment <b>of</b> <b>unity.</b> This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium {{remained}} a constituent {{church of the}} General Council from 18671918. In 1918, following {{the celebration of the}} 400th anniversary of the Reformation, the three Lutheran church bodies of Eastern America (The General Synod, the General SynodSouth, and the General Council) reunited to form the United Lutheran Church in America. This event, while marking a watershed <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> among American Lutherans, also marked the end of the Pennsylvania Ministerium. The ULCA would later join with other American Lutherans, in 1962 in the Lutheran Church in America, and in 1988 in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (which continues to be an active church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium).|$|E

The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E

5|$|This sense <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> was {{represented}} in new media.
