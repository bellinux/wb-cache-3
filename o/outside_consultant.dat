500|$|The Park District team, {{including}} an <b>outside</b> <b>consultant,</b> spent 18 months negotiating {{a contract with}} O'Malley's group. During that time, Laura Foxgrover, a top official in the Park District department directly overseeing the deal, gave birth to O'Malley's child. Prior to working for the Park District, Foxgrover had been an employee of O'Malley as director of operations at the Chicago Firehouse Restaurant. Foxgrover held the title [...] "senior project manager" [...] at the Park District at an annual salary of $94,000. In May 2002, Foxgrover wrote a memo recusing herself from negotiations, without saying why, and never told her superiors she was carrying O'Malley's child. The girl was born in September, 2002.|$|E
500|$|Business {{continued}} to be successful during the late 1990s as other independent bookstores fell by the wayside and companies like Barnes & Noble expanded. Cohen and Meade decided to sell the store to Danny Gainsburg, who was selling his T-shirt business so {{he would be able}} to afford the cost of the store. The co-owners made an agreement with Gainsburg that he would gain control of the store if he was able to function amicably with the rest of the staff. Cohen and Meade set him up in a part-time position to see how he would interact with the employees and sold him an equity stake in the business without informing the other staff members. Gainsburg was pressured to leave by the staff after he kissed an employee on her birthday. The three co-owners agreed that Gainsburg should resign, and Gainsburg received back his initial investment plus a premium. Gainsburg said to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "We all started with good motives, but there was lots of naiveté on all sides." [...] In 2006, a year after the botched sale attempt, Cohen and Meade both decided to hold onto the store as sole co-owners for at least three to five more years and met with an <b>outside</b> <b>consultant</b> to devise an eventual exit strategy.|$|E

2500|$|The floods were {{a result}} of heavy {{rainfall}} caused by Tropical Cyclone Tasha that combined with a trough during the peak of a La Niña Modoki event. The 2010 La Niña Modoki weather pattern, which brings wetter conditions to eastern Australia, was the strongest since 1973. This La Niña event caused a prolonged event of heavy rainfall over Queensland river catchments. Record or near to record sea surface temperatures were recorded off the Queensland coast in late 2010. December 2010 was Queensland's wettest on record, with record-high rainfall totals set in 107 locations for the month. The state's average rainfall level of [...] exceeded the previous record of [...] set in 1975. 2010 was also recorded as the state's wettest spring since 1900 and the Australian continent's third-wettest year. Climate scientist Kevin Trenberth thought climate change was a contributing factor in the unusually high precipitation rates. He attributed a half-degree Celsius rise in ocean temperatures around Australia to global warming which produces extra water vapour and intensifies the monsoon. Other scientists {{say that it is}} too early to draw such a conclusion. Assertions were also made by Professor Hubert Chanson, an expert in dam and reservoir engineering with extensive firsthand knowledge of the Wivenhoe system, that mismanagement of the Wivenhoe Dam might be a contributor to the some flooding in the lower Brisbane valley. While an expert engineer, Michael O'Brien—a senior manager of an ASX-listed resources company and an <b>outside</b> <b>consultant</b> evaluating cause—agrees that [...] "massive releases of water from Wivenhoe Dam on Tuesday, January 11, did indeed produce most of the flooding in the Brisbane River the following afternoon, with a peak in the early hours of Thursday morning, January 13. The dam's releases into the Brisbane River also caused the Bremer River, which winds through the city of Ipswich, and the Lockyer Creek to back up and cause much of the flooding outside Brisbane." [...] This was corroborated by a panel of engineers hired by Insurance Council of Australia. O'Brien also found that the Wivenhoe Dam and Somerset Dam did not hold the maximum capacity they were capable of holding during the crisis period, which would have significantly alleviated flooding. Only one source, Neal Ashkanasy, who specialises in social and organisational psychology (and 35 years ago was involved in the design of Wivenhoe Dam), found fault with these results and instead finds that the dam was operated correctly throughout the time of the storm and the flood that followed, saying the [...] "dam was run with outstanding precision." ...|$|E
