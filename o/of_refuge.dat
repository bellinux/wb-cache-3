5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point <b>of</b> <b>refuge,</b> particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E

The emerging area was called the Southern Extension by this time. Growth south of Oak was very slow until the Southern Exposition was held annually in the area from 1883 to 1887.|$|E
5|$|Young Mallory {{prepared}} for a profession by reading law {{in the office of}} Judge William Marvin. Because of its geographical position, Key West was often sought as a port <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> for ships caught in storms, and was for the same reason near frequent shipwrecks. Marvin was recognized as an authority on maritime law, particularly applied to laws of wreck and salvage, and Mallory argued many admiralty cases before him.

5|$|The Commonwealth's {{struggles with}} the Cossacks were being paid {{attention}} to at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began regarding Cossacks as a potent source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival and neighbor. Russian efforts to destabilize the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often {{raised the possibility of}} a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> for Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there.|$|E

5|$|After the Civil War, the Corps of Engineers {{undertook}} {{a program of}} river and harbor improvements. Raynolds supervised the dredging and improvement of navigation on the Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. He also helped supervise several harbor dredging and construction projects, involving the harbor in Buffalo, New York, the Harbor <b>of</b> <b>Refuge</b> in New Buffalo, Michigan, Erie Harbor in Erie, Pennsylvania, and the river harbors of St. Louis, Missouri and Alton, Illinois. Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area, where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870. Raynolds was promoted to permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Corps of Engineers on March 7, 1867. He then supervised lighthouse construction along the Gulf Coast and in New Jersey where he managed {{the construction of the}} Hereford Inlet Lighthouse in 1874. From May 5 to October 7, 1877, Reynolds led a procession of American engineers to an engineering conference in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal soon {{developed}} {{into its own}} independent record labels and networks. The first Christian metal label was Pure Metal Records, a sublabel <b>of</b> <b>Refuge</b> Records. Soon there appeared other labels such as R.E.X. Records and Intense Records. Fanzines were published in several countries, with Heaven's Metal as {{the first one in}} the US in 1985. During that time almost every Christian record label became interested in Christian metal, and they advertised the newly signed metal bands on their roster on Heaven's Metal since it was the only publication exclusively covering the movement. Soon Heaven's Metal achieved more popularity and became an official, professional publication. Heaven's Metal achieved a dedicated flock of 15,000 readers. Bands' sales usually rose when the ensembles were covered on the magazine. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the more underground Christian metal releases were typically distributed in Christian bookstores, and those as well as the fanzines also traded Christian metal cassette copies with the music fans.|$|E
5|$|Corvinus {{was unwilling}} to break his own truce with Bayezid, having tacit Ottoman backing for his own war in the west. However, he granted his vassal a {{territorial}} gift in Transylvania, comprising the domains of Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă. According to various interpretations, this exchange occurred in or after 1484, and was meant to compensate Stephen {{for the loss of}} his ports. Medievalist Marius Diaconescu dates the lease of Cetatea to 1482, when Corvinus agreed to give Stephen a place <b>of</b> <b>refuge,</b> should Moldavia fall to the Ottomans, while Ciceu only became Stephen's castle in 1489. Both citadels were on land confiscated after conflicts between the Three Nations and Corvinus. Ciceu had been a fief of the Losonczi family, under litigation, while Cetatea had been a special domain of the Voivode of Transylvania, whose last titular owner before Stephen was John Pongrác of Dengeleg.|$|E

5|$|Gathering, {{hunting and}} fishing were still {{essential}} as sources of food and materials such as hide or fur. The forest was also exploited {{as a source of}} building materials such as wood. In addition, wild forest bees were kept there, and the forest {{could be used as a}} place <b>of</b> <b>refuge.</b> Until the 9th century, the population was separated from the main centers of civilization and self-sufficient with primitive, local community and household-based manufacturing. Specialized craftsmen existed only in the fields of iron extraction from ore and processing, and pottery; the few luxury items used were imports. From the 7th century on, modestly decorated ceramics were made with the potter's wheel. 7th– to 9th-century collections of objects have been found in Bonikowo and Bruszczewo, Kościan County (iron spurs, knives, clay containers with some ornamentation) and in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region (weapons and utensils in Pleszów and Mogiła), among other places. Slavic warriors were traditionally armed with spears, bows and wooden shields. Axes were used later, and still swords of the types popular throughout 7th– to 9th-century Europe were also used. Independent of distant powers, the Slavic tribes in Poland lived a relatively undisturbed life, but at the cost of some backwardness in civilization.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially {{at the moment when}} prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Hillary {{moved to}} the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a {{national}} lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, {{with the help of}} Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower <b>of</b> <b>Refuge</b> on Conister Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William.|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{studies show}} that both {{cannibalism}} and intraspecific resource competition can have major effects on population dynamics. Cannibalistic intensity, offspring size, harvesting and refuge availability are important factors affecting the interplay between cannibalism and competition. We studied two populations of the common guppy (Poecilia reticulata) that differed in their cannibalistic voracity as well as offspring size. We manipulated the availability <b>of</b> <b>refuges</b> for juveniles and harvesting intensity of large adults to investigate how these factors influenced {{the dynamics of the}} two populations. Overall population dynamics was mainly affected by the origin of the founder populations and the presence <b>of</b> <b>refuges.</b> The population with a higher cannibalistic propensity and smaller offspring exhibited higher population variability, and the presence <b>of</b> <b>refuges</b> reduced cannibalism and stabilised the dynamics in both populations. Harvest of large cannibalistic females destabilised the dynamics and caused extinctions of several populations without refuges. Both populations displayed cannibal-driven cycles with repression of recruitment when no refuges were present. Cycle periods were shorter with refuges present and the dynamics were more cohort like with synchronised peaks in density of vulnerable juveniles and cannibals. We suggest that increased number <b>of</b> <b>refuging</b> juveniles led to intensified resource competition in the population. The harvest yield was low in the refuge treatments as few females grew large due to resource competition, leading to a small impact of harvesting in these treatments...|$|R

5|$|When RichardII was crowned in 1377, {{he led a}} {{procession}} from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14thcentury and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in StJohn's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in {{the security of the}} Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King HenryIV. In the 15thcentury, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place <b>of</b> <b>refuge.</b> When supporters of the late RichardII attempted a coup, HenryIV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of HenryV (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.|$|E
