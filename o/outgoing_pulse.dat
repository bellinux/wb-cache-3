40|$|The edge {{technique}} {{is a new}} and powerful method for measuring small frequency shifts. Range resolved lidar measurements of winds {{can be made with}} high accuracy and high vertical resolution using the edge technique to measure the Doppler shift of an atmospheric backscattered signal from a pulsed laser. The edge technique can be used at near-infrared or visible wavelengths using well developed solid state lasers and detectors with various edge filters. In the edge technique, the laser frequency is located on the steep slope of the spectral response function of a high resolution optical filter. Due to the steep slope of the edge, very small frequency shifts cause large changes in measured signal. The frequency of the <b>outgoing</b> laser <b>pulse</b> is determined by measuring its location {{on the edge of the}} filter. This is accomplished by sending a small portion of the beam to the edge detection setup where the incoming light is split into two channels - an edge filter and an energy monitor channel. The energy monitor signal is used to normalize the edge filter signal for magnitude. The laser return backscattered from the atmosphere is collected by a telescope and directed through the edge detection setup to determine its frequency (location on the edge) in a similar manner for each range element. The Doppler shift, and thus the wind, is determined from a differential measurement of the frequency of the <b>outgoing</b> laser <b>pulse</b> and the frequency of the laser return backscattered from the atmosphere. We have conducted simulations of the performance of an edge lidar system using an injection seeded pulsed Nd:YAG laser at 1. 06 microns.

50|$|One of {{the effects}} of the pulse {{compression}} technique, is boosting the apparent signal strength as perceived by the radar receiver. The <b>outgoing</b> radar <b>pulses</b> are chirped, that is, the frequency of the carrier is varied within the pulse, much like the sound of a cricket chirping. When the pulse reflects off a target and returns to the receiver, the signal is processed to add a delay as a function of the frequency. This has the effect of 'stacking' the pulse so it seems stronger, but shorter in duration, to further processors. The effect can increase the received signal strength to above that of noise jamming. Similarly, jamming pulses (used in deception jamming) will not typically have the same chirp, so will not benefit from the increase in signal strength.|$|R

40|$|The Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) is an {{airborne}} laser altimeter {{designed to}} quickly and extensively map surface topography {{as well as}} the relative heights of other reflecting surfaces within the laser footprint. Since 1997, this instrument has primarily been used as the airborne simulator for the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission, a spaceborne mission designed to measure tree height, vertical structure and ground topography (including sub-canopy topography). LVIS is capable of operating from 500 m to 10 km above ground level with footprint sizes from 1 to 60 m. Laser footprints can be randomly spaced within the 7 degree telescope field-of-view, constrained only by the operating frequency of the ND:YAG Q-switched laser (500 Hz). A significant innovation of the LVIS altimeter is that all ranging, waveform recording, and range gating are performed using a single digitizer, clock base, and detector. A portion of the <b>outgoing</b> laser <b>pulse</b> is fiber-optically fed into the detector used to collect the return signal and this entire time history of the <b>outgoing</b> and return <b>pulses</b> is digitized at 500 Msamp/sec.

The surface height distribution of all reflecting surfaces within the laser footprint can be determined, for example, tree height and ground elevation. To date, the LVIS system has been used to monitor topographic change at Long Valley caldera, CA, as part of NASA's Topography and Surface Change program, and to map tree structure and sub-canopy topography at the La Selva Biological Research Station in Costa Rica, as part of the pre-launch calibration activities for the VCL mission.

40|$|During {{the core}} {{collapse}} of massive stars, {{the formation of}} the protoneutron star is accompanied by the emission of a significant amount of mass-energy (∼ 0. 3 M_) in the form of neutrinos. This mass-energy loss generates an outward-propagating pressure wave that steepens into a shock near the stellar surface, potentially powering a weak transient associated with an otherwise-failed supernova. We analytically investigate this mass-loss-induced wave generation and propagation. Heuristic arguments provide an accurate estimate of the amount of energy contained in the <b>outgoing</b> sound <b>pulse.</b> We then develop a general formalism for analyzing the response of the star to centrally concentrated mass loss in linear perturbation theory. To build intuition, we apply this formalism to polytropic stellar models, finding qualitative and quantitative agreement with simulations and heuristic arguments. We also apply our results to realistic pre-collapse massive star progenitors (both giants and compact stars). Our analytic results for the sound pulse energy, excitation radius, and steepening in the stellar envelope are in good agreement with full time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations. We show that prior to the sound pulses arrival at the stellar photosphere, the photosphere has already reached velocities ∼ 20 - 100 % of the local sound speed, thus likely modestly decreasing the stellar effective temperature prior to the star disappearing.

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of vegetation structure {{are important for}} {{a large number of}} applications including ecological modeling and carbon budgets. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measures the three-dimensional structure of vegetation using laser beams. Most LiDAR applications today rely on airborne platforms for data acquisitions, which typically record between 1 and 5 “discrete” returns for each <b>outgoing</b> laser <b>pulse.</b> Although airborne LiDAR allows sampling of canopy characteristics at stand and landscape level scales, this method is largely insensitive to below canopy biomass, such as understorey and trunk volumes, as these elements are often occluded by the upper parts of the crown, especially in denser canopies. As a supplement to airborne laser scanning (ALS), a number of recent studies used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for the biomass estimation in spatially confined areas. One such instrument is the Echidna® Validation Instrument (EVI), which is configured to fully digitize the returned energy of an emitted laser pulse to establish a complete profile of the observed vegetation elements. In this study we assess and compare a number of canopy metrics derived from airborne and TLS. Three different experiments were conducted using discrete return ALS data and discrete and full waveform observations derived from the EVI. Although considerable differences were found in the return distribution of both systems, ALS and TLS were both able to accurately determine canopy height (? height r 2 > 0. 90, p < 0. 01).

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{reconstruct}} the vibrational quantum state of molecules excited by a general excitation laser pulse. Unlike existing methods, we do not require the molecules before excitation {{to be in a}} pure state, allowing us to treat the important case of initially thermally excited molecules. Even if only a single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small populations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational state, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the excitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a non-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The measurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the <b>outgoing</b> four-wave mixing <b>pulse</b> at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An important point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of molecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming laser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration laser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are recorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the constant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of the excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have sufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of the same levels. Finally, we discuss the extension of the reconstruction method in this paper to more general situations, hereby presenting the new idea of quantum state reconstruction through perturbations with calibration.
