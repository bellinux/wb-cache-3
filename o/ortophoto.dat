40|$|The {{camera is}} one of the most {{fundamental}} device in Photogrammetry field. Considering the geometry, the cameras can be divided in metric and non-metric. The metric cameras are composed by high quality lenses and are used only for mapping purposes. The digital non-metric camera has been more frequently used in photogrammetric projects, providing advantages like: low cost, if compared with the metric cameras; small size, lighter and easy handling. In this context, this paper presents an updating process of FCT/Unesp base map, using images collected by different sensors. It was adopted aerial images collected by the analogical metric camera Wild RC 10 in 2003 and by the digital non-metric camera Hasselblad H 1 D in 2007. It was also generated an <b>ortophoto</b> of the FCT/Unesp. All the photogrammetric process (phototriangulation, restitution, TIN - Triangulated irregular Network- generation and edition, <b>ortophoto</b> generation) was accomplished in LPS (Leica Photogrammetry Suite) software.

The goal of the paper is to confirm or deny the hypothesis that the precision of the orthophoto increases with each new generation. The theoretical part of the thesis describes the orthophoto, covers its history and the process of production. In the context of the process of the production, we also describe the use of the digital terrain model and present basic information on the Global Navigation Satellite System. Following that is a description of both Slovene horizontal coordinate systems, the older D 48 /GK, and the current D 96 /TM, and their division into sheets on the scale of 1 : 5000. The next section describes the methodology of the selection and measurements of control points. We then define the method of calculating deviations between coordinates measured in the field and coordinates measured on the orthophoto, add the list of input data and describe the equipement and software used. The practical section of the paper describes the process of the selection of <b>ortophoto</b> sheets, chosen for the control of the hypothesis and the selection of control points on the selected <b>ortophoto</b> sheets.

These are located at a relatively low altitude (stouts are close to 2500 m) and they survival from the Little Ice Age can only be explained by its low incoming radiation thanks to its north orientation and the reception of frequent avalanches during winter. We have studied the evolution of these glaciers by aerial photographs and <b>ortophotos</b> since 1956; and more recently the creation of three-dimensional models using terrestrial photogrammetry techniques. The use of aerial photography and <b>ortophotos</b> has shown serious limitations associated to problems of visualization due to shadows; and their acquisition for different times in the year that difficult their comparison. In contrast, photogrammetry techniques offers very good possibilities to monitor changes and improve the resolution {{of many of the}} currently available orthophotos.

For the 2 nd site (IT 4), a pre-existing LC/LU map, derived from photo-interpretation of an <b>ortophoto</b> dated 2006 and in field campaigns dated 2007 - 2008 at 1 : 5000 scale was translated into a corresponding map of GHCs, since {{at this stage of the}} project the development of the 2 nd EODHaM stage of the system for automatic VHR LC/LU maps production is still in progress. o The mapping of LCCS/GHCs maps into Annex 1 habitats for the IT 4 site. In addition, a key is proposed for non-Annex 1 habitat included in the IT 4 Natura 2000 site, which are of great interest to the Users of Mediterranean sites...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{approaches}} a research requested to the LabFSG of the UFSC by the Municipality of São José. The problem appeared from a community {{action of the}} neighborhood of the seashore of the historical {{center of the city}} (from the Antonieta to the Ada beach) against the municipality that resulted in the seizure of the construction of a highway, known as “Beiramar Continental”. The community action alleged that the construction of the highway would commit the quality of the water, besides provoking a damage of the cultural heritage. It fell to the research to prove the truthfulness or not of these allegations in order to allow the municipality to accomplish the works in order {{to improve the quality of}} the citizens ' life, without harming them, without hurting the legislation or still, without blemishing the constructions and the historical monuments. The risings of the pertinent legislation began, in order to evaluate the legal situation concerning to, property right, access to the beach, “terrenos de marinha ” (Brazilian coast lands that are between an parallel line 33 meters from the medium high tide of 1831 and the high tide of 1831), among others. The maps obtained in 1995, was evaluated as well as the group of aerial pictures that originated it. Besides these, it was collected images, corresponding to the area, of the years of 1938, 1956 and 1978. Through ground control points implanted, it was made the rectification of the images above obtaining as product ortophotos of each one of the years. It was also collected maps, which contains the determination of the medium high tide of 1831. As final product, <b>ortophoto</b> maps were generated (of each one of the dates previously mentioned) containing the themes: medium high tide of 1831 and the themes of the 1995 ’s cartography. Simultaneously it grew a research wit...|$|E
40|$|Orthoprojection and {{automatic}} or semiautomatic DEM productions are digital photogrammetrical products that enable two ranges of requirements in close-range survey applied to Architecture and Archaeology, to be connected.. It {{is possible to}} depict both the shape of objects and the thematic data derived from orthoprojection; photographic information in fact enhances documentation as it other details on the masonry typology the kind of facing the decorations the materials and their decay. The non conventional methodology analyzed in this paper, and the consequent <b>ortophotos</b> and stereo-plotting production, {{are based on the}} use of a restrained helium balloon which was equipped with an ad hoc remote-controlled platform. A non-metrical film-based camera was placed inside the platform to acquire nadiral images of overflow areas. The still problematic phases of the application of these methodology will be discussed: the plan of the stereoscopic stripes which is rendered complicated by system instability, the non-metric camera calibration, the surface model generation and their solution according to the morphology of the surveyed area. Finally, the accuracy evaluation of the final orthoimaging will be dealt together with the opportune integration of this kind of work in a multiscale spatial information syste...|$|R
40|$|The use of Geographical Information Systems {{facilitates}} {{spatial analysis}} {{and allows the}} understanding of the evolutionary processes that occurred over the years and have led to the current conditions. Thanks to a comparison between an historical cartographic map with recent <b>ortophotos,</b> it was possible to evaluate the meaningful elements present in an area and their changes over time. A compared analysis, started early 1800, found that the study area, mainly its rural and forestry land, have been affected by deep transformations, due to natural events, human intervention, and changes in natural cycles, that resulted difficult to understand. The historical map represents the entire municipality of Ruoti (Basilicata Region, Southern Italy), traditionally devoted to arboreal cultivation or wood-sheep farming,. The map reports the town and the surrounding area in the Year 1812, showing the main rivers, the land use of the area, the different type of vegetations, expressed with different colors and symbols. The spatial analysis of this study area showed a succession of land use changes, influenced by the modern cultivation techniques, while vegetation changes give variations of the agro-forestry landscape over the years, and cultivation conversion caused a loss of CO 2 fixation value...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{different}} factors potentially affecting {{the size and}} location of large gully systems is explored in two tributary basins of the Tagus River (S Portugal). The hillslopes of these basins, corresponding to tertiary sedimentary formations, are affected by hundreds of large gully systems, varying in extent from somewhat b 200 m 2 to N 3 ha. A study set of 90 gully systems were vectorized from aerial <b>ortophotos</b> and analysed {{in relation to a}} set of potential control variables, obtained by reconstructing the pre-erosion topography. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were combined in order to investigate controls over the general morphometry of these landforms (area, perimeter and sinuosity) and their location in the respective basins. Results indicate that gully systems initiated as bank gullies in response to an incision by the drainage network in both basins and then evolved as a function of upslope contributing area, developing progressively more sinuous outlines as a result of headcut bifurcation. Pre-erosion topographic formwas shown to have only a marginal effect, with results suggesting gully systems have grown essentially throughmassmovements in headcuts and sidewalls, influenced by subsurface water. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
