5|$|Other {{designs of}} the mid-H series {{included}} the He 111 H-7 and H-8. The airframes {{were to be}} rebuilds of the H-3/H-5 variant. Both were designed as night bombers and were to have two Jumo 211F-1s installed. The intention was for the H-8 to be fitted with cable-cutting equipment and barrage ballon deflectors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the wings. The H-7 was never built.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{variation}} in colour over its range, though occasional females are darker overall than average, with markings less prominent or absent. The double drummer is larger and darker overall than the northern double drummer (T.sessiliba); {{the latter has}} a white band on the abdomen, while the former has black markings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> (costa) of the forewing extending past the basal cell.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and Ural owls are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|E
5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E

25|$|On propeller-driven aircraft, it {{is common}} to use bleed air to inflate a rubber boot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> {{breaking}} the ice loose after it has already formed.|$|E
50|$|The OIAV {{would not}} have to achieve {{supersonic}} speeds while ascending. This would minimize drag and put less stress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> spacecraft.. also having the advantage of minimizing vibrations.

50|$|In-flight ice buildups {{are most}} {{frequent}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> wings, tail and engines (including the propellers or fan blades). Lower speed aircraft frequently use pneumatic de-icing boots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of wings and tail for in-flight de-icing. The rubber coverings are periodically inflated, causing ice {{to crack and}} flake off. Once the system is activated by the pilot, the inflation/deflation cycle is automatically controlled. In the past, it was thought such systems can be defeated if they are inflated prematurely; if the pilot did not allow a fairly thick layer of ice to form before inflating the boots, the boots would merely create a gap between <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and <b>the</b> formed ice. Recent research shows “bridging” does not occur with modern boots.|$|R
50|$|The Koolhoven F.K.49 was a {{photographic}} survey aircraft {{built in the}} Netherlands in 1935. It was a high-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with twin engines carried in nacelles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> Usually fitted with fixed, tailwheel undercarriage, a floatplane version was also developed. The aircraft carried an onboard darkroom.|$|R
25|$|The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch {{consists}} of two parts: a -story Neoclassical marble bank building built in 1923 and an eight-story International style annex built in 1949–1951. The original building was designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst, & White; the addition (and later renovation) was done by Minoru Yamasaki. Yamasaki's bold addition was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of Modern architecture.|$|E
25|$|The MiG-21 has a delta wing. The {{sweep angle}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> is 57° with a TsAGI S-12 airfoil. The angle of {{incidence}} is 0° while the dihedral angle is −2°. On the trailing edge there are ailerons with an area of 1.18m², and flaps with an area of 1.87m². In front of the ailerons there are small wing fences.|$|E
25|$|During {{its initial}} descent towards its destination, the {{attendant}} reported {{that one of}} the cabin door's indicators was showing an unlocked condition. Shortly afterwards, the right hand rear door (the baggage door) opened, detached itself from its hinge mounts and became lodged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the right horizontal tailplane. Later reconstruction of the aircraft's flight path from flight recorder evidence indicated that cabin decompression occurred when it was in the vicinity of Market Bosworth.|$|E
50|$|It had 30° of sweep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of its thick (thickness/chord ratio 20%), {{symmetric}} aerofoil, wings, built using {{carbon fibre}} and Kevlar with glassfibre for the spars. The wingtips were rounded, with washout. Elevons controlled both pitch and roll; {{there was no}} vertical stabilizing surface, rudder or separate tailplane.|$|R
50|$|The Tu-160 is a variable-geometry wing {{aircraft}}. The aircraft {{employs a}} fly-by-wire control {{system with a}} blended wing profile, and full-span slats are used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges,</b> with double-slotted flaps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trailing edges. The Tu-160 has a crew of four (pilot, co-pilot, bombardier, and defensive systems operator) in K-36LM ejection seats.|$|R
50|$|The NiD 450 {{was a low}} {{cantilever}} wing aircraft. The wing, built around two duralumin spars and with a thin profile, was trapezoidal in plan out to rounded tips, with sweep only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> Much of <b>the</b> wing surface was formed by thin, smooth radiators for the liquid-cooled engine; the rest was wood-covered with spruce <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|R
25|$|The F/A-18 is a twin engine, mid wing, {{multi-mission}} tactical aircraft. It {{is highly}} maneuverable, owing to its good thrust to weight ratio, digital fly-by-wire control system, and leading-edge extensions (LEX). The LEX allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The trapezoidal wing has a 20-degree sweepback <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span leading-edge flaps and the trailing edge has single-slotted flaps and ailerons {{over the entire}} span.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} ice on {{aircraft}} are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are {{an increase in}} stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.|$|E
25|$|Developed as {{a private}} venture by DFW, {{it was a large}} biplane of {{conventional}} configuration with four engines mounted inside the fuselage, powering propellers on the wings via transmission shafts - two mounted tractor-fashion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the upper wing, and two mounted pusher-fashion on the trailing edge of the lower wing. The DFW R.I was unique, among the Riesenflugzeuge with internally mounted engines, in that each engine drove a separate propeller and was not connected to the other engines or propellers.|$|E

50|$|A deicing boot {{is a type}} of ice {{protection}} system installed on aircraft surfaces to permit a mechanical deicing in flight. Such boots are generally installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of wings and control surfaces (e.g. horizontal and vertical stabilizer) as these areas are most likely to accumulate ice and any contamination could severely affect the aircraft's performance.|$|R
25|$|The wooden, cantilever, two-spar {{wing of the}} U 7 {{was almost}} {{trapezoidal}} in plan, with sweep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> out to ellipsoidal tips. It also thinned outwards in section {{with most of the}} taper on the upper surface, giving some anhedral. Short ailerons extended to the tips. The wing was mounted over the fuselage on six streamlined steel struts; two upright tripods ran from the forward spar to points on the upper and mid fuselage and two inverted V-struts joined the rear spar to the upper fuselage.|$|E
25|$|These {{may reveal}} {{congestion}} and edema (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa, and in 10-15% of cases {{there may be}} a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall. Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied, and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda. Rarely, a neoplasm (tumour) may form <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention. These investigations may be used with contrast media (barium enema) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Aviation Safety Board {{was unable}} to {{determine}} the exact sequence of events which led to this accident. The Board believes, however, that the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that, shortly after lift-off, the aircraft experienced an increase in drag and reduction in lift {{which resulted in a}} stall at low altitude from which recovery was not possible. The most probable cause of the stall was determined to be ice contamination <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and upper surface of the wing. Other possible factors such as a loss of thrust from the number four engine and inappropriate take-off reference speeds may have compounded the effects of the contamination.|$|E
40|$|The {{pockets of}} {{separation}} originating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> {{are surrounded by}} vortex sheets.
