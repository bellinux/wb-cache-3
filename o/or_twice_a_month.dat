25|$|Tobacco was popular, {{both for}} {{personal}} use, and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Each person brought {{at least two}} changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel. Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to clarify the characteristics of growth and development of physique and physical fitness with age, and to determine the influence of the habitual exercise on physique and physical fitness using longitudinal data in adolescent male students. The physique tests (5 items) and sport tests (developed by the Ministry of Education) were administered annually in male students of freshman to senior grade enrolled in F National College of Technology in the period of 1985 - 1989. At the same time, the frequency of their recent exercise enforcement was examined. Students were classified into 4 groups based on the frequency of their exercise enforcement for 3 years: those doing exercise three days or more a week continuously for 3 years (HG), those doing exercise once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> week continuously for 3 years (MG), those doing exercise <b>twice</b> <b>or</b> less <b>a</b> <b>month</b> for 3 years (LG), those doing exercise once of more a week in the first and second grades but doing exercise <b>twice</b> <b>or</b> less <b>a</b> <b>month</b> in the third and fourth grades (IG). The longitudinal data of 384 students classified into 4 groups based on the frequency of their exercise enforcement for 3 years were used for this study. The main results can be summarized as follows: 1) Body linearity and body bulk become greater and muscular power and flexibility develop with age. But, a significant developing tendency with age for static strength is not recognized and endurance declines with age. 2) The continuous exercise enforcement seems to improve muscular power, flexibility and endurance. Further, it is inferred that the regular exercise in three days or more a week facilitates the development of muscular power and prevents from declining of endurance with age. 3) It seems that the interruption of the regular exercise habit increases fat and hinders the development of muscular power, and produced the sudden decline in endurance. 4) The continuous exercise enforcement in three days or more a week is inferred to produce balanced physical growth and development, but the lack of exercise in adolescent seems to bring on unbalanced physical growth and development such as the decline of endurance and the increase of fat...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} urinary incontinence (UI) in female patients (aged >= 3 D 15 years) attending a cystic fibrosis (CF) centre, in whom stress UI could be common, as chronic coughing and sputum production are frequent symptoms associated with progressive lung disease in these patients. Patients and methods An anonymous questionnaire was completed by 176 women with CF (mean age 24. 6 years, sd 5. 8) during routine assessments as outpatients. Results In all, 72 patients (41 %) were classified as never incontinent; occasional UI was reported in 61 women (35 %). Regular UI, occurring <b>twice</b> <b>or</b> more <b>a</b> <b>month</b> {{for at least two}} consecutive months in the last year, was reported in 43 patients (24 %). Regular UI was associated with increasing age and a lower mean (sd) forced expiratory volume/s (of that predicted) than in women with no urinary symptoms, at 26. 9 (6. 5) years and 53. 5 (23. 5) %, and 23. 1 (5. 4) years and 65. 5 (23. 2) %, respectively (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively). All incontinent women recorded stress UI; coughing, laughing and physical activity were associated with UI in 92 %, 33 % and 21 % of the patients, respectively. Conclusion Stress UI is a common symptom in women with CF. As urine loss can be under-reported to the healthcare providers, women should be asked about incontinence as part of their routine follow-up. Pelvic floor muscle exercises are effective in treating stress UI and should be considered for those with CF and regular UI...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{measure the}} unmet need of {{patients}} with regular urinary incontinence (incontinence <b>twice</b> <b>or</b> more <b>a</b> <b>month)</b> treatable by <b>a</b> nurse. DESIGN [...] Self completed postal questionnaire and randomised controlled trial of assessment and intervention by a nurse. SETTING [...] One urban and one rural general practice in Somerset. SUBJECTS [...] 7300 adults randomly selected from 10, 300 aged 35 and over on the combined practice lists. 515 women and 185 men with regular incontinence were offered assessment and treatment, of whom 134 women and 49 men had no intervention for three months (historical controls). They then joined the assessment and treatment programme. INTERVENTION [...] Four sessions of pelvic floor exercises and bladder retraining supervised by non-specialist nurse who had taken a three week course on assessing and treating uncomplicated incontinence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of patients desiring treatment; self reported cure, improvement, or deterioration in continence after three months. RESULTS [...] The questionnaire achieved a 79 % response. Validated responses showed a prevalence of 4. 4 % in men and 16. 4 % in women aged 35 - 64. 315 (45 %) of the 700 patients offered assessment refused it and seven had moved away or died, 64 men and 41 women were referred to their general practitioner. 197 of 292 treated women (68 %) reported cure or improvement compared with seven (5 %) of controls. 22 of the 86 men desiring treatment were suitable for intervention by the nurse. Seventeen were cured or improved compared {{with none of the}} men in the control group. CONCLUSIONS [...] About half the people with regular urinary incontinence took up the offer of treatment (9. 2 % of women and 3. 4 % of men in the study population).

Through vigorous public relations efforts, he connected with high-ranking government officials, insurance executives, industrialists, professionals, politicians, educators, and many other influential people. His circle of friends and contacts extended across Pakistan. He hosted dinners in large hotels not only in Dacca and Chittagong (East Pakistan) but also in Karachi, Lahore and other cities in West Pakistan. Some parties were called [...] "Ladies Nights." [...] Buksh often said, [...] "Without women's cooperation, it is difficult to survive in such an unpopular occupation, let alone make headway." [...] Faizur Razzaque said that [...] "by entertaining acquaintances and friends he cultivated a fine brand of public relations."He was nominated twice as the president of Dacca Insurance Institute. Buksh, being a popular figure in both parts of the country commended a great deal of respects in both private and government circles and wherever he went, everyone regarded him highly. Due to his love for his mother tongue, each year {{on the first day of}} Pohela Boishakh (Bengali New Year) he would invite VIPs and journalists for lunch at his Dacca residence where only Bengali dishes were served. He was a popular Rotarian. [...] "His noble disposition, simplicity in life, unflinching fidelity, and stern sense of duty won love and respect from everyone who came in contact with him." [...] His vast and extensive public relations experience helped expand the reach of the insurance business from the lower-middle class, to the educated sector to, finally, many influential [...] "big guns of the society." [...] These big guns included: S.M. Murshed (Chief Justice, East Pakistan) Abu Sayeed Chowdhury (former president of Bangladesh), Abul Kashem Khan (Industrialist), Mujibur Rahman (Civil servant, insurance executive), Muhammad Shahidullah (Bengali educationist, writer and linguist), Sufia Kamal (poet), Ataur Rahman Khan (lawyer, politician and writer), Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (head, of Alpha Insurance Company, East Pakistan later became Father of the Nation), Tajuddin Ahmed (Politician, later became Prime Minister), Abdus Salam (editor, Bangladesh Observer), and Abdul Jabbar Khan (Speaker Pakistan Assembly).|$|R

[...] She had lost the self-sufficiency that had made roaming about London by herself a pleasurable adventure; and a newly-born fear of what people were saying and thinking about her made her shy even of the few friends she still clung to, so that his visits grew to be of the nature of childish treats to which she found herself looking forward--counting the days. Also, she came to be dependent upon him for the keeping alight within her of that little kindly fire of self-conceit at which we warm our hands in wintry days. It is not good that a young woman should remain for long a stranger to her mirror--above her frocks, indifferent to the angle of her hat. She had met the women superior to feminine vanities. Handsome enough, some of them must once have been; now sunk in slovenliness, uncleanliness, in disrespect to womanhood. It would not be fair to him. The worshipper has his rights.

60|$|What {{has come}} over us English-speaking people? During {{the first half}} of this century tragedies and great tragedians were as common with us as farce and comedy; and it was the same in England. Now we have not a tragedian, I believe, and London, with her fifty shows and theatres, has but three, I think. It is an {{astonishing}} thing, when you come to consider it. Vienna remains upon the ancient basis: there has been no change. She sticks to the former proportions: a number of rollicking comedies, admirably played, every night; and also every night at the Burg Theatre--that wonder of the world for grace and beauty and richness and splendour and costliness--a majestic drama of depth and seriousness, or a standard old tragedy. It is only within the last dozen years that men have learned to do miracles on the stage in the way of grand and enchanting scenic effects; and it is at such a time as this that we have reduced our scenery mainly to different breeds of parlours and varying aspects of furniture and rugs. I think we must have a Burg in New York, and Burg scenery, and a great company like the Burg company. Then, with a tragedy-tonic once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> we shall enjoy the comedies all the better. Comedy keeps the heart sweet; but we all know that there is wholesome refreshment for both mind and heart in an occasional climb among the solemn pomps of the intellectual snow-summits built by Shakespeare and those others.

I {{know that you can}} with difficulty find time to write at all, and thank you all the more. If you knew the real value to us of such letters as you have now sent, containing your impressions and opinions of things in general, men, books, &c., you would be well rewarded for your trouble, I assure you. To myself, I must say to you, such letters are invaluable; they are a real help to me, not only in that they supply information from a very good authority on many questions which I much desire to understand, but even more because I rise up or kneel down after reading them, and think to myself, [...] "how little such men who so think of me really know me; how different I ought to be," [...] and then it is another help to me to try and become by God's grace less unlike what you take me to be. Indeed, you must forgive me for writing thus freely. I live very much alone as far as persons of the same language, modes of thought, &c., are concerned. I see but little (strange as it may seem to you) even of my dear Primate. We are by land four or five miles apart, and meet perhaps once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> for a few minutes to transact some necessary business. His time is, of course, fully occupied; and I never leave this place, very seldom even this little quadrangle, and when other work does not need immediate attention (a state of things at which I have not arrived as yet), there are always a dozen new languages to be taken up, translations to be made, &c. So that when I read a letter which is full of just such matters as I think much of, I naturally long to talk on paper freely with the writer. Were I in England, I know scarcely any place to which I would go sooner than Winchester, Hursley, Otterbourne, and then I should doubtless talk as now I write freely. All that you write of the state of mind generally in England on religious questions is most deeply interesting. What a matter of thankfulness that you can say, [...] "With all the sins and shortcomings that are amongst us, there is an unmistakeable spreading of devotion and the wish to serve God rightly on the part of very many." ...|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile, since {{irritation}} sometimes relieved her, the betrothed of Mr. Mudge {{found herself}} indebted to that admirer for amounts of it perfectly proportioned to her fidelity. She always walked {{with him on}} Sundays, usually in the Regent's Park, and quite often, once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> he took her, in the Strand or thereabouts, to see a piece that was having a run. The productions he always preferred were the really good ones--Shakespeare, Thompson or some funny American thing; which, as it also happened that she hated vulgar plays, gave him ground for what was almost the fondest of his approaches, the theory that their tastes were, blissfully, just the same. He was for ever reminding her of that, rejoicing over it and being affectionate and wise about it. There were times when she wondered {{how in the world}} she could [...] "put up with" [...] him, how she could put up with any man so smugly unconscious of the immensity of her difference. It was just for this difference that, if she was to be liked at all, she wanted to be liked, and if that was not the source of Mr. Mudge's admiration, she asked herself what on earth could be? She was not different only at one point, she was different all round; unless perhaps indeed in being practically human, which her mind just barely recognised that he also was. She would have made tremendous concessions in other quarters: there was no limit for instance to those she would have made to Captain Everard; but what I have named was the most she was prepared to do for Mr. Mudge. It was because he was different that, in the oddest way, she liked as well as deplored him; which was after all a proof that the disparity, should they frankly recognise it, wouldn't necessarily be fatal. She felt that, oleaginous--too oleaginous--as he was, he was somehow comparatively primitive: she had once, during the portion of his time at Cocker's that had overlapped her own, seen him collar a drunken soldier, a big violent man who, having come in with a mate to get a postal-order cashed, had made a grab at the money before his friend could reach it and had so determined, among the hams and cheeses and the lodgers from Thrupp's, immediate and alarming reprisals, a scene of scandal and consternation. Mr. Buckton and the counter-clerk had crouched within the cage, but Mr. Mudge had, with a very quiet but very quick step round the counter, an air of masterful authority she shouldn't soon forget, triumphantly interposed in the scrimmage, parted the combatants and shaken the delinquent in his skin. She had been proud of him at that moment, and had felt that if their affair had not already been settled the neatness of his execution would have left her without resistance.|$|E
