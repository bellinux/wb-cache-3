40|$|In {{order to}} detect and locate partial {{discharge}} (PD) activity within HV cables and in particular cable joints, the feasibility of using a very high frequency (VHF) capacitive coupler technique has been investigated. In addition, an alternative PD <b>off-line</b> <b>test</b> method for cable joints or cable sections within long cable systems has been developed. By energising the joint or a short section of the cable screen only this method {{has the advantage of}} reducing the power supply requirement of the test source. The application of capacitive couplers for this PD <b>off-line</b> <b>test</b> method has been investigated. In order to use this approach there must be an insulation gap between the coupler and the outer sheath of the test cable. The effect of this gap on measured sensitivity has been investigated experimentally and {{through the use of a}} simulation model. Obtained results are in good agreement. Cross-correlation techniques have been implemented to automatically estimate the signal time of flight from different coupler outputs. Methods of calibrating the coupler applied to the alternative PD <b>off-line</b> <b>test</b> method have also been investigated...|$|E

As {{a result of a}} fault analysis two fault detection modules are proposed; A <b>off-line</b> <b>test</b> and a continuous surveillance. The fault detection, needing continues data, and the requirements to the data acquisition is given special attention. The <b>off-line</b> <b>test</b> declares the system, including stand-by components, fault tree prior to beam injection. the test comprises parameter estimation using the sensitivity approach requiring an ADC with better than 7 bit precision and a sampling frequency above 133 kHz.

Repeating three representative GCM sensitivity experiments with this one-dimensional model demonstrates that, to first order, the model reproduces a GCM's sensitivity to imposed changes in parameterization and therefore captures the essential {{physics of the}} GCM.

30|$|The {{formulas}} {{are presented}} in two situations: t 0 (S 1) is exactly the inspection point and t 0 (S 2) is between the inspection points. The t 0 point exhibits a big influence on the expression and the shape of SF and MRL. In fact, whether t 0 is the inspection point has a practical significance. The t 0 as the exact inspection point corresponds to the situation where the DGA condition information has just been collected from an on-line or <b>off-line</b> <b>test,</b> while the t 0 located between two successive inspection points corresponds to {{a situation where the}} condition inspection by either an on-line or <b>off-line</b> <b>test</b> has been done before and the next inspection point has not been reached. Both S 1 and S 2 situations could occur in practice.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmong the {{multiple}} progresses in radioactive ion beam (RIB) manipulation for physics experiments, the beam cooling and bunching in gas-filled RF traps {{has become a}} widely used technique. It is particularly well adapted to precision experiments, such as Penning trap mass spectrometry or collinear laser spectroscopy. At ISOLDE, an rf quadrupole cooler and ion buncher (RFQCB) has been designed and developed to deliver radioactive beams of improved quality among most of the on-line experiments. The results of the first <b>off-line</b> <b>tests</b> have shown that high transmission efficiencies could be achieved with different RIBs of alkali metals, as it was expected. During the later tests that are presented here a special care was dedicated to the reproduction of the on-line experimental conditions of ISOLDE, {{with a wide range}} of different RIBs.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Off-line</b> <b>testing</b> of new tribo-systems for {{sheet metal}} forming {{production}} is an important issue, when new, environmentally benign lubricants are to be introduced. To obtain useful results it is, however, vital to ensure similar conditions as in the production process regarding the main tribo-parameters, which are tool/workpiece normal pressure, sliding length, sliding speed and interface contact temperature. The paper describes a generic methodology for such tests exemplified on an industrial, multistage deep drawing example, where deep drawing is followed by two successive re-drawing operations leading to very high tool/workpiece interface pressure and temperature in the second re-draw. Under such conditions only the best lubricant systems work satisfactory, and the paper shows how the performance of different tribo-systems in production may be predicted by <b>off-line</b> <b>testing</b> combined with numerical modelling {{in order to ensure}} proper test conditions...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the <b>off-line</b> <b>testing</b> the Integrated DWPF Melter System (IDMS) ammonia scrubbers using ammonia supplied from cylinders.

The Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) scrubbers were successful in removing ammonia from the vapor stream to achieve ammonia vapor concentrations far below the 10 ppM vapor exit design basis. In most of the tests, the ammonia concentration in the vapor exit was lower than the detection limit of the analyzers so results are generally reported as < 0. 05 parts per million (ppM). During SRAT scrubber testing, the ammonia concentration was no higher than 2 ppM and during SME testing the ammonia concentration was no higher than 0. 05 m...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, {{we present}} a method of testing digital cir-cuits during normal operation. The {{resources}} used to perform on-line testing are those which are inserted to alleviate the <b>off-line</b> <b>testing</b> problem. The <b>off-line</b> <b>testing</b> resources are modified such that during system operation they can also observe the normal inputs and outputs of a combinational circuit under test. The normal inputs to the circuit under test are compared with test vectors in its test set. When a normal input matches a test vector, the circuit output for such an input is typ-ically compressed into a developing signature. When all of the test vec-tors in the test set have appeared as normal inputs, the signature is read and verified. With this method, {{the length of time}} required for all of the test vec-tors to appear, possibly in some order, among the normal inputs to the circuit under test is of considerable importance. We refer to this as the test latency and give analytical methods for its computation with ver-ification by simulation. We also describe a hardware structure for im-plementing the concurrent test method and identify a number of ap-proaches for reducing test latency.
