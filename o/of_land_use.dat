40|$|International audienceHomogenisation of agrolandscapes {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of {{biodiversity}} loss. Agrolandscapes can be described by the proportion <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and their spatial arrangement. If the proportion <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> has strong implications on the productive performance of farming systems, the spatial arrangement <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> seems to be an important way to improve ecological performances at landscape scale with minor production loss. The objective {{of this study was to}} asses the relative effects of the proportion <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and their spatial arrangement on ecological dynamics. We focused on the conservation of lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) in grassland landscapes. We developed a modelling approach linking grass dynamics in grazed and mown grasslands to lapwing population dynamics. We tested contrasting landscapes composed of different pairs <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> depending on whether they compensate or complement each other. Our results show that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> is the first driver of population dynamics. Spatial arrangement <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> in the landscape is an important although secondary driver of bird population trends. Managing the spatial arrangement <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> could therefore be an important target of conservation policies. We finally discuss the importance of heterogeneity in conciliating production and biodiversity conservation...|$|R
40|$|There is {{empirical}} {{evidence that the}} proportion <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and their spatial arrangement can affect the long-term dynamics of bird species in agro-landscapes (Benton et al. 2003).

Acting on the spatial arrangement <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> to increase the heterogeneity of landscapes without altering the proportion <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> could help to reconcile production and biodiversity in agro-landscapes. Theoretical and empirical studies propose various hypotheses linking landscape characteristics to biodiversity (Brotons et al. 2005).

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>uses</b> {{are what}} <b>land</b> users do. When spatial {{planners}} and other policymakers promote or preclude certain <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> they {{interfere with the}} rights of the users <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> most notably with property. The technical term for what connects <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> planning, and property is land policy. My paper has a simple message: Good land policy provides a diversity <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> with plural property relations. No single kind of property rules fits the purposes of all types <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses.</b> A detached single family house is not like a community garden, nor a highway like a retail chain. Each <b>land</b> <b>use</b> needs its own property “fingerprint. ” In everyday practice, private and common property relations often accommodate a wide variety of demands made by the owners and users <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> Many theories <b>of</b> property and <b>land</b> policy, however, fail to recognize plural property relations. The simple message of my paper seeks to reconcile practice and theory. A polyrational theory of planning and property identifies eight types <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> each type needing its own kind of property rules. The eight types <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> are: insular, opportunistic, kinship, collaborative, corporate, structural, container, and environmental <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> Polyrational land policy makes sure that desirable <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> are enveloped by appropriate property relations...|$|R
