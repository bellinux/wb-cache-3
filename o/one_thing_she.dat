25|$|Esma Sultan, the {{daughter}} of Sultan Abdul Hamid I and aunt of Sultan Abdülmecid I, lived in luxury in her magnificent villa in Istanbul, but still her life passed in sadness because {{she could not have}} the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> wished for most; a child. At length she decided to adopt a child, {{the daughter}} of Gök Bey Gogen who belonged to one of the noble families of the Ubykh tribe of Circassia in the Ottoman Empire, after reaching satisfactory terms with the mother and father, when Rahime was a toddler one year of age. the child was particularly diminutive, delicate and graceful, so she renamed her Perestu, the Persian word for swallow. All the kalfas in Esma Sultan's villa behaved toward this child as though she were a daughter of an Ottoman imperial princess, and indeed her disposition and manners were so lovely that they became devoted to her. In the mean time Princess Esma Sultan carefully arranged the training and education of Perestu. She had three brothers, Mustafa, Hüseyn and Hasan Bey, and two sisters, Fatma Gülcemal Hanım and Mihrifidan Hanım.|$|E

500|$|Scholars have {{wondered}} {{what it was that}} Sycorax did to avoid execution, as described in Act one, Scene two by Prospero: [...] "for <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> did / They [...] would not take her life." [...] Charles Lamb, a Romantic writer fascinated by Shakespeare and his works, and particularly intrigued by this question, found in John Ogilby's [...] "Accurate Description of Africa" [...] (1670) two versions of a story about Emperor Charles V's invasion of Algiers in 1541, relating that a witch (not named in the source text) had advised the commander of the city not to surrender, predicting the destruction of the besieging fleet, which was accomplished nine days later by a [...] "dreadful tempest". The principal version given claims that she was [...] "richly remunerated" [...] but the alternative version, [...] "to palliate the shame and the reproaches that are thrown upon them for making use of a witch," [...] attributes the storm to the prayers of a holy man named Cidy Utica.|$|E
500|$|Sagan {{incorporated}} Kip Thorne's {{study of}} wormhole space travel into the screenplay. The characterization of Dr. Ellie Arroway {{was inspired by}} Dr. Jill Tarter, head of Project Phoenix of the SETI Institute; Jodie Foster researched the lead role by meeting her. Tarter [...] served as a consultant on the story, realistically portraying struggling careers of women scientists from the 1950s to 1970s. The writers debated whether Arroway should have a baby at the film's end. Although Guber was impressed with Sagan and Druyan's treatment, he hired various screenwriters to rewrite the script. New characters were added, one of them [...] a Native American park ranger-turned-astronaut. Guber suggested that Arroway have an estranged teenage son, who he believed would add more depth to the storyline. [...] "Here was a woman consumed {{with the idea that}} there was something out there worth listening to," [...] Guber said, [...] "but the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> could never make contact with was her own child. To me, that's what the film had to be about." [...] Sagan and Druyan disagreed with Guber's idea and it was not incorporated into the storyline. In 1982, Guber took Contact to Warner Bros. Pictures and with the film's development stalled, Sagan started to turn his original idea into a novel, which was published by Simon and Schuster in September 1985. The film adaptation remained in development and Guber eventually vacated his position at Warner Bros. in 1989.|$|E
