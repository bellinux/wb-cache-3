5|$|O'Neill {{made his}} debut for New South Wales {{at the age}} of 18 against South Australia during the 1955–56 season. His lack of {{contribution}} was highlighted against the backdrop of his team's crushing innings victory: O'Neill failed to score a run <b>or</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wicket. New South Wales bowled first and had South Australia at 6/49 when Miller introduced O'Neill's occasional leg spin, presumably to ease the debutant's nerves by bringing him into the game. The home team struck 18 from three overs. O'Neill was listed to bat in the lower middle order but after the top order had made a big start, Miller brought O'Neill up. He came in against the second new ball and was clean bowled. O'Neill was dropped and did not play another match for the season, but had gained invaluable experience.|$|E

25|$|Denton {{was born}} in Wakefield, Yorkshire, and showed promise as a teenager, scoring a half-century in a Colts game in 1892. After three {{friendly}} (but nevertheless first-class) matches for Yorkshire in 1894, he made his Championship debut for the county in Yorkshire's {{final game of the}} season against Somerset, though he did not bat, bowl <b>or</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> catch. The following year, he scored useful runs against Cambridge University and also Lancashire, to establish his place in the side. That year he made a thousand runs for the first time, only once thereafter (in 1898) failing to reach that landmark.|$|E
25|$|He spent another {{winter in}} South Africa, {{this time with}} Northern Transvaal, in 1992/93, but apart from that the {{remainder}} of Newport's career was spent in familiar surroundings with Worcestershire.

Newport retired after the 1999 season, bowing out rather quietly with a National League game in {{which he did not}} bat <b>or</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wicket, with only a single catch.|$|E

Yet Australia, give <b>or</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few minutes, achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E

25|$|Most {{commentators}} associate Jaspers {{with the}} philosophy of existentialism, {{in part because he}} draws largely upon the existentialist roots of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and in part because the theme of individual freedom permeates his work. In Philosophy (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method simply cannot transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, <b>or</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> leap of faith toward what Jaspers calls Transcendence. In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls Existenz, and can finally experience authentic existence.|$|E
