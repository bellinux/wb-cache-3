40|$|SUMMARY- A natural {{endowment}} {{of three}} coast lines with different structures, of numerous rivers coming from mountainous regions and of different climatic conditions has enabled France to develop {{one of the}} first European aquaculture sectors in terms of volume with almost 300 000 tonnes in 1996. This development has been based {{on a wide range of}} species and on a wide range of techniques. Intensive marine fish farming has been developing during the last decade only, after many years of stagnation due to the lack of reliable technology for species adapted to French climate. Techniques of production are very diverse. Although earth ponds and race-ways are used only by 25 % of the marine fish farms, this technique accounts for 40 % of the production. On the contrary, many farms using floating cages are implemented in semi-offshore conditions for seabass and seabream. Most of these enterprises are small scale farms. Different types of cages are used by these farms. The most popular systems are ra fts made of flexible preformed units or circular flexible cages. French aquaculture has given up projects involving heavy and costly <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructures</b> inspired from the oil industry or resulting from the reconversion of cargoes, but has not yet valorised all the possibilities given by the new offshore technologies experienced by the salmon industry.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} structures in offshore engineering has revamped {{the problem of}} Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) during underwater blasts because they enhance the FSI effect and increase the shock resistance of underwater structures. The practical applications of these materials range from warfare to <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and to the deep sea fuel transfer installations ([1],[2]). Nonetheless, the techniques that are usually applied to study the FSI rarely {{make use of the}} true coupling between the fluid dynamic problem and the structural one. Most frequently, the hydrodynamic-pressure approximation proposed by Taylor [3] for plates interacting with ex-plosion waves is included in the structural response ([2], [4]). This takes into account the reflected wave pressure and the damping effect due to the absorption of energy from the structure, but it is still a simplified approach. Only for air explosions, the complete coupling is actually modelled ([5],[6]) and only in 1 D. Here, taking advantage of the Domain Decomposition strategy outlined in [7], a full 3 D FSI investigation is carried out and the computed results highlight the effects of the structural response on the fluid.

Development of a more rational method to interpret results from simple shear tests with cell pressure confinement can reduce costs and improve reliability of <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> This paper addresses a commonly overlooked issue affecting design parameter selection: specimen shape varies from right cylinder to oblique cylinder after loading along a single shearing direction. Thus, horizontal stresses are not always equal to the cell pressure and their magnitude varies throughout the specimen’s lateral surface. An analysis is proposed that accounts for changing specimen geometry and lateral surface area during shearing and for the actual effect of cell pressure during testing. The analysis also describes how the intermediate principal stress can be assessed. Test results for medium dense silica sand are interpreted following de Josselin de Jong’s alternative shearing mechanism hypothesis. Conventional interpretation methods yield conservative design parameters for this soil. Failure states develop when the intermediate principal effective stress is halfway between major and minor principal effective stresses.

Sliding of the sediments on continental slope takes place when the shear stress within sediments exceeds the shear strength thereby causing slope failure. Slope failures are generally controlled by long-term preconditioning factors (e. g., high sedimentation rate, weak layer and oversteepening) and short-term triggering mechanisms (e. g., earthquake, anthropogenic activity). However, the exact causes for the different slope failure styles are still poorly understood. In summary, this thesis investigates preconditioning factors and triggering mechanisms governing slope instabilities of three distinct submarine landslides areas in passive and active continental margin settings. Geotechnical properties of sediments from undeformed, headwall and deposits present different stress histories and shear strengths (undrained and drained shear strength). Geotechnical results are used for infinite slope stability of undeformed sediments under various conditions (undrained and drained, each static and earthquake conditions) to identify the preconditioning factors and quantify the influence of earthquakes as a key factor in slope failing mechanisms.

40|$|The {{new energy}} {{policy of the}} European Union (EU) with the core {{objectives}} of competitiveness, reliability and sustainability, has driven Europe into a transition towards a low carbon & sustainable electricity supply systems. Under the new policy, the European energy systems are pursing two major objectives. First is to shift the focus from national to regional or (perhaps) a European level with {{the ultimate goal of}} introducing regional markets that facilitates cross-border power trades. Second, is to incorporate large renewable energy sources into the power systems to best exploit the energy resources. In this regards, special attention is oriented towards the development of the offshore gird in the North Sea region where offshore wind is abundant and has potential to become major energy source in the area. This thesis looks into transmission expansion planing in the North Sea region. It presents a market based approach to solve a long-term transmission expansion planning for a meshed VSC-HVDC offshore grid that connect regional markets. The main goal here is to determine the grid design that enables harnessing the offshore wind energy most efficiently, at the same time, creating capacity for conducting cross-border power exchange. Development of an offshore grid in the North Sea can encounter various technical, legal and economic barriers. Consequently advanced planning frameworks are required that enables accounting for these issues. The methodology proposed here provides a framework to investigate the impact of each of these factors on the development of <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> More precisely, the contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows:  Static Transmission Expansion Planning framework (STEP) In Chapter 5, I have proposed a multiple time-period static transmission expansion planning framework that is applicable to VSC-HVDC meshed grids. I have shown that the analytical solution to the problem gives the pricing mechanism that expresses the relationship between the electricity price of different zones and the congestion charges associated with the interconnectors between them. It is an extension of the work of Schweppe et al. that has been proven for and applied to VSC-HVDC grids. The proposed formulation includes investment recovery through congestion revenues as an implicit strict equality constraint. It, therefore, computes the expansion plan, such that the investment capital will be fully paid off through congestion revenues {{by the end of the}} chosen lifetime of the infrastructure. The framework determines the topology, transmission capacities and the power flows through the offshore grid, and the resulting distribution of social welfare among the price zones. By combining both flow-constraints and investment recovery-constraints and working with historical market data, the framework can deliver useful results that demonstrate how onshore price zones could benefit from an optimal grid design.  Iterative clustering methods for computation feasibility The optimization framework proposed in Chapter 5 was intended to be driven by historical market-data in the form of hourly regional cost curves. The dimensionality of the search space and the computational intensity of the proposed optimization algorithm make the problem intractable. It was desirable to identify and work with only a subset from the total set of operating states. I developed an iterative algorithm that combines an unsupervised clustering technique with the proposed optimization tool to cope with the computational burden of the large-scale optimization problem. Automatic space transformation and clustering were performed to select a subset of representative hourly operating states. The number of samples in the subset was adjusted in order to match the congestion-induced revenues to that of the full data set. This ensured that essential information was not lost. The framework, thus, balances the need for reasonable computation times against the benefits of a model that allows multiple time-periods (as defined by zonal prices and wind power production combinations) and obtains realistic results. Several clustering algorithms (including K-means) and feature reduction techniques (such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) have been used in investment planning analysis. Their combination has also been explored in literature. However, this is the first time that an unsupervised PCA/clustering technique has been combined with an optimization tool to refine the clustering results.  StaticWind and Transmission Expansion Planning framework (SWTEP) Chapter 6 describes a novel co-optimization wind and transmission expansion framework applicable to VSC-HVDC meshed grids. This is an extension of the static framework presented in Chapter 5 that adds wind to the TEP formulation, while implementing support schemes, which inherently induce a deviation from perfect competition. This results in a fundamental contradiction between the structure of the competitive market and the nature of support policies. The novelty of the work presented in Chapter 6 is that it has limited the market distortion by excluding the support payments from the market clearing process. To do so, I have proposed a formulation that divides the initial investment of the offshore wind infrastructure into subsidized and unsubsidized parts. Thus, the objective of the optimization problem was to maximize sum of incremental social welfare of all regions at all times, minus the aggregated investment cost of offshore transmission infrastructure and the investment cost of building the offshore wind farms that has not been covered through the support payments. The proposed framework enables the impact of implementing two types of feed-in premium support schemes (i. e., generation-based and capacity-based) to be accounted for in the final development of the grid. The goal of this chapter was to investigate the performance of the two feed-in support policies to verify if investment recovery would be fulfilled under a certain support scheme design. In addition, an ‘optimal’ support level and offshore wind support tariff rate were determined. The analytical solution to the optimization problems confirms the complete recovery of the investment cost of transmission infrastructure. In addition, under the assumption that no offshore wind was curtailed, the revenues collected from market sales of offshore wind farms can pay off the unsubsidized part of the wind farm investment, regardless of the payment basis (generation-based or capacity-based).  Dynamic Transmission Expansion Planning framework (DTEP) In Chapter 7, I have proposed a market-based, multiple stage, multi-time period dynamic transmission expansion planning framework for a meshed offshore grid to connect upcoming offshore wind farms to multiple onshore markets. The main contribution of this framework is that it enables accounting for delays in the construction and implementation of <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> including wind farms and transmission systems. Delays can occur mainly due to legal barriers associated with differing permitting criteria in an international context, but also due to market maturity and supply chain issues. The timing of delays in grid, market and wind farm developments are set exogenously in the model. This is an extension of the work presented in Chapter 5 in which the whole offshore grid was assumed to be built in one instant. The final results include the optimal grid topology, transmission capacities, construction timing and the resulting remuneration and distribution of the social welfare increase and financial benefit among the various onshore price zones. The analytical solution to the optimization problem gives the pricing mechanism that is consistent with the AC onshore counterpart. The proposed market mechanism facilitates the integration of a multi-terminal VSC-HVDC offshore grid into the existing AC grid. In addition, the analytical solution confirms the investment recovery through congestion revenues, regardless of the number of investors that are involved. In the case of multiple investors, an independent financial entity is required that collects the transmission revenues from the grid operators and distributes them appropriately amongst the investors. Under this regulatory assumption, the investment recovery of every cable of every interconnector will be completely fulfilled within the desired economic lifetime...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{possibilities}} to implement ‘Building with North Sea Nature’ in <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in the North Sea by providing guidelines for the eco-friendly design of scour protection structures around monopiles in planned wind farms to enhance ecological functioning. The guidelines include specifications on: The type of hard substrate material or products available and how these can potentially enhance ecological functioning (and have added value compared to regular types used); How different types of hard substrates and configurations can be (experimentally) designed to vary spatially, in such a systematic manner that the effect on ecological enhancement can be determined empirically; How the effects of these scour protection structures can be monitored and evaluated; Whether site-specific conditions apply to wind planned farm locations in the Dutch North Sea. Eco-friendly design in this study entails optimising the scour protection of offshore wind farms to enhance its ecological functioning. Enhancement of ecological functioning has been defined as: increasing habitat suitability for species (or communities) occurring naturally in the Dutch North Sea, in particular, for policyrelevant (from a conservation perspective) and endangered species, such as those listed in the EU Habitats Directive, OSPAR or national red lists (see Annex 2 in Bos et al. in prep.). Where previous work has explored the more general possibility for enhancement of ecological functioning in offshore wind farms (van Duren et al. 2016; Smaal et al. in prep.), this study provides explicit steps towards realising an eco-friendly design of scour protection and a practical field experiment to allow for scientific evaluation. From an analysis of physical conditions in the North Sea that influence both biodiversity and scouring mechanisms at wind farm locations, it is concluded that scour protection will be required in most, or all, future offshore wind farms on the Dutch Continental Shelf. It is also concluded that scour protection design could be altered to benefit the ecology, but that new designs will require additional testing for anti-scouring effects. Based on a selection of policy-relevant species for the North Sea, two umbrella species were selected: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis). Focussing design variables and principles on these two umbrella species is expected to result in optimising the habitat for a wide range of native hard substrate biodiversity. Based on existing data from current wind farm scour protection, other artificial hard substrates and natural hard substrates from the North Sea, it is hypothesized that an optimised design of scour protection will yield increased populations of umbrella species or increased native biodiversity in general, including policy-relevant species. Based on available knowledge on ecological principles and expert judgement of North Sea hard substrate ecologists, four design variables for optimised scour protection are defined: 1. Adding larger structures than conventional scour protection to create large holes and crevices, to provide adequate shelter / holes for large mobile species. 2. Adding more small-scale structures than conventional scour protection to create more small-scale holes and crevices but also attachment substrate and settlement substrate. 3. Providing or mimicking natural (biogenic) chemical substrate properties to facilitate species. An example is to provide chalk-rich substrate such as concrete with added chalk, or even natural substrate such as shell material. 4. Active introduction of specimens of target species to enhance establishment of new populations. This is to facilitate recruitment at locations where reproduction by naturally occurring adults is These design variables are made practically applicable by providing example materials and specifications for implementation in the field and, a cost overview is provided for example materials. Combining the above information, this study provides design guidelines for wind farms with optimised scour protection to enhance ecological functioning. In addition it defines a minimum and a standardized approach for deployment and monitoring of a subset of locations to allow for scientific evaluation. The monitoring techniques that are required to do so, are described and a cost estimate for the monitoring is provided. In conclusion, this study provides eco-friendly design principles for scour protection and a first experimental design to implement ‘Building with North Sea Nature’: ecological enhancement by optimising scour protection in offshore wind farms. This is considered as a first step in a process that should result in ‘learning by doing’...|$|E

40|$|Most North Sea states {{consider}} {{the expansion of}} offshore wind energy as substantially contributing towards their renewable energy targets. If current plans are given effect, {{there will be an}} enormous growth of offshore wind energy capacity. Standard practice for wind farms constructed to date has been to provide each wind farm with an individual cable connection to the onshore transmission system (radial connection). A more efficient approach would be to initiate coordinated projects that involve the clustering of wind farms and consequently allow for shared offshore assets. This could lower the costs and reduce the impacts on the marine environment. Although the legal regimes of most North Sea states currently focus on the installation of radial connections, they increasingly consider promoting coordinated development of <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the legal barriers to these coordinated projects and to explore what changes could be made to the current regulatory practices of the North Sea states in order to facilitate the required coordination between wind energy generation and infrastructure development...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{offshore}} wind farms and interconnectors {{are expected to be}} constructed in the North Sea region over the coming decades, creating substantial opportunities for the deployment of integrated network solutions. Creating interconnected offshore grids that combine cross-border links and connections of offshore plants to shore offers multiple economic and environmental advantages for Europe's energy system. However, despite evidence that integrated solutions can be more beneficial than traditional radial connection practices, no such projects have been deployed yet. In this paper we quantify costs and benefits of integrated projects and investigate to which extent the cost-benefit sharing mechanism between participating countries can impede or encourage the development of integrated projects. Three concrete interconnection case studies in the North Sea area are analysed in detail using a national-level power system model. Model outputs are used to compute the net benefit of all involved stakeholders under different allocation schemes. Given the asymmetric distribution of costs and benefits, we recommend to consistently apply the Positive Net Benefit Differential mechanism {{as a starting point for}} negotiations on the financial closure of investments in integrated <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructure...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on a complex {{management}} issue, namely the physical effects of a large-scale offshore sand extraction. For these kinds of issues there is no obvious morphological model available to answer all management questions. Therefore, we aim to answer as many management questions as possible, using a set of existing morphological models parallel to each other. In this way, we can support governments to assess applications for licenses for large-scale sand extraction. We investigate whether this parallel modeling approach is significantly more helpful in addressing the management questions than a single modeling approach. The management questions are translated into quantifiable variables, known as Coastal State Indicators (CSIs). We focus on three coastal user functions: coastal safety and maintenance, <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and navigation. The selected morphological models are assessed on (1) their applicability to the CSIs and (2) the reliability of their predictions. We quantify the predictive power of the models based on these two parameters. We conclude that by using a parallel modeling approach {{it is possible to}} address more management questions effectively in comparison with using just the best single model. The use of this parallel modeling approach increases the predictive power significantly, here 35 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{climate change}} induced by global warming has raised {{concerns}} over safety of coastal and <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> At several {{places in the}} world therefore studies are being made to know the effect of such change on design and operational ocean parameters. This paper is oriented in this direction and its aim is to specify future changes in the design significant wave height (Hs) over a series of locations along the Indian coastline. Thirty-nine sites were selected along the 7000 -km-long Indian coast and design Hs with a return period of 100 years were calculated on the basis of past as well as future wave data of duration 27 years each. The simulation of waves was done by running a numerical wave model forced by wind derived from a modeling experiment called CORDEX. Fitting of data to Generalized Pareto Distribution gave the 100 -year Hs at all 39 locations. The results indicate that the design Hs calculated on the basis of projected data was much higher than the one based on historical data. Such increase was as small as 5 % and as high as 58 % as per the location. The west coast sites showed a higher rise in the Hs value than the east ones...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImportant {{issues for}} energy {{meteorology}} are to assess environmental conditions for normal operating conditions and extreme events {{for the ultimate}} limit state of engineering structures. Autumn and winter storms are a challenge for onshore and <b>offshore</b> energy <b>infrastructure</b> in northern Europe, and sometimes cause damage and disruptions. The incidence of extreme storms has increased over the past 20 years, leading to increased pressure on energy infrastructure. This paper summarizes the events of a storm from October 30 to November 2, 2006 using media reports, government publications, and scientific articles to create {{an overview of the}} meteorology and infrastructure impacts...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{oil and gas}} platforms, {{pipelines}} {{and other}} ancillary <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructure</b> are aging in Australia and current regulatory frameworks favour complete removal {{at the end of}} life. However, evidence indicates that artificial reefs have formed around some of these structures and their removal could cause more harm than good. Furthermore, other perceived social, environmental and economic benefits of a total removal policy may not be warranted. The Australian regulator (NOPSEMA) is currently exploring the possibility of supporting an in situ decommissioning policy, in which alternatives to full removal such as leaving in situ, partial removal or nearby relocation may be adopted if demonstrated to be the preferable approach. This will necessarily involve changes to law and policy but such amendments must be evidence-based. The evidence needed will largely involve the disciplines of engineering and natural sciences, but also fields such as environmental management, economics, social sciences and law. If Australia were to progress an in situ decommissioning policy shift, research will be needed across all of these areas in the specific national context. This paper commences by outlining emergent engineering knowledge, showing the general conservatism of current methodologies available to assess the integrity of decommissioned offshore facilities. Thereafter, the particular legal environment in Australia is explored. This article contributes to the growing body of literature on in situ decommissioning but in setting a multi-disciplinary research agenda takes a more holistic approach. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper assesses {{challenges}} for social impact assessment (SIA) for coastal and <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects, using {{the case study}} of the Tomakomai Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Demonstration Project in Hokkaido, Japan. Interest in SIA and linked concepts such as social licence to operate is growing, yet marine environments also have potential to raise additional complexity in project governance. Drawing on qualitative research conducted in Tomakomai and Japan more widely across the project development and implementation phase, the paper argues that building {{an understanding of the}} social, cultural and historical relationship between the community, industry and the sea is crucial to understanding the neutral or cautiously supportive response of the citizens and stakeholders in Tomakomai to the project. Moreover, effective SIA in coastal regions needs {{to find a way to}} account for - or at least make visible - these complex relations between society and the sea. Based on the findings, it is suggested that developers or policymakers overseeing SIA in coastal regions ought to pay extra attention to the extent to which developments like CCS are viewed by communities as 'new' as opposed to a continuation of existing activities in the sea; to the importance of engagement on monitoring during the project operations phase; and to the non-economic values such as pride and identity which communities and stakeholders may derive from the sea.

50|$|The {{principal}} legislation for decommissioning <b>offshore</b> <b>infrastructure</b> when production ceases is OSPAR Decision 98/3 on Disposal of Disused Offshore Installations. Under OSPAR legislation, only installations that fulfil certain criteria (on {{the grounds of}} safety and/or technical limitations) are eligible for derogation (that is, leaving the structure, or part of, in place on the seabed). All other installations must be totally removed from the seabed. During the next two decades, the industry will begin to decommission many of the installations that have been producing oil and gas for the past forty years. There are approximately 470 installations to be decommissioned, including very large ones with concrete sub-structures, small, large and very large steel platforms, and subsea and floating equipment, {{the vast majority of}} which will have to be totally removed to the shore for dismantling and disposal. Some 10,000 kilometres of pipelines, 15 onshore terminals and around 5,000 wells are also part of the infrastructure planned to be gradually phased out, although some, or parts, of the onshore terminals will remain because they are import points for gas pipelines from Norway and the Netherlands. Decommissioning is a complex process, representing a considerable challenge on many fronts and encompassing technical, economic, environmental, health and safety issues. Expenditure is therefore projected to be £19 billion by 2030, rising to £23 billion by 2040, for existing facilities. New facilities could add another £2-3 billion to the decommissioning cost, raising the total to circa £25 billion.|$|R
