50|$|The next Sunday, April 9, 2017, {{continued}} {{problems from}} overbooking received media coverage {{when a man}} was forcibly removed by law enforcement officers from an overbooked United Airlines flight. After the plane fully boarded, according to reports, the airline asked for four passengers to volunteer their seats in exchange for $800 vouchers so four United crew members could board. After no passengers on the flight voluntarily stepped forward, the airline announced that they would select four passengers at random {{to be removed from}} the <b>overbooked</b> <b>flight.</b> One of the men selected to be removed refused, telling the United crew member that he was a doctor that needed to see patients the following morning, prompting the airline to call security. As seen in videos filmed by other passengers, the man was forcefully pulled from his seat, knocked unconscious and had his bloodied, limp body dragged down the aisle to the exit.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Delta Air Lines began a {{practice}} {{in which they}} overbook some flights, using algorithms {{to determine how many}} seats to overbook based on historical data, and allow passengers checking in for the <b>overbooked</b> <b>flight</b> to state the value of travel vouchers {{they would be willing to}} accept in exchange for taking a later flight. The airline then selects the passengers who will be bumped to a later flight based on the lowest bids. According to the airline, the biggest cost savings from the practice is that it improves on-time flight departures, since gate attendants are not burdened with negotiating with passengers that are considering being bumped from the flight. Among the three major U.S. carriers, Delta had the highest rate of total bumped passengers (96 per 100,000 passengers vs. 95 on United Airlines and 50 on American Airlines), but the lowest rate of involuntarily bumped passengers (3 per 100,000 vs. 5 on American and 11 on United).|$|E
50|$|Delta Air Lines {{increased}} {{the amount of}} compensation supervisors can offer to displaced passengers from $1,350 to $9,950 with gate agents able to offer $2,000, up from $800. American Airlines also enacted a new policy: passengers who have already boarded will never be removed to seat others. Southwest Airlines announced they will no longer <b>overbook</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Summer 1994, Spirit Airlines <b>overbooked</b> <b>flights,</b> and 1,400 customers' {{tickets were}} canceled.

50|$|AirHelp {{represents}} air {{travelers who}} are legally entitled to compensation from an air carrier or airline {{due to a}} delayed, canceled, or <b>overbooked</b> <b>flight.</b> Passengers can assign their claims to AirHelp, which will, in turn, file the necessary paperwork and obtain the compensation from the airlines {{on behalf of the}} client.Should the airline refuse to pay, AirHelp will advance the case by filing suit on behalf of the client and pursue a legal remedy, if the situation warrants such an action. Depending on the laws of the countries that AirHelp is active in, AirHelp takes legal action or facilitates access to local lawyers through AirHelp’s global network of lawyers. Most passengers who are eligible for compensation do not file a claim, mainly because of lack of awareness of their rights under the law. AirHelp seeks to educate air passengers of their rights in addition to providing a service that simplifies the claim filing process. The Know Your Rights section of the AirHelp website is dedicated to explaining the laws that protect air passengers and their various entitlements, should they be eligible for compensation.|$|E
5000|$|Simon {{was also}} the first to suggest that {{airlines}} should provide incentives for travelers to give up their seats on <b>overbooked</b> <b>flights,</b> rather than arbitrarily taking random passengers off the plane (a practice known as [...] "bumping"). Although the airline industry initially rejected it, his plan was later implemented with resounding success, as recounted by Milton Friedman in the foreword to The Ultimate Resource II. Economist James Heins said in 2009 that the practice had added $100 billion to the United States economy in the last 30 years. Simon gave away his idea to federal de-regulators and never received any personal profit from his solution.|$|R
5000|$|Maloway {{introduced}} a Private Member's Bill {{known as the}} [...] "Airline Passenger's Bill of Rights" [...] in February 2009. The bill would require airlines to include hidden fees and taxes in their advertised ticket prices, reimburse passengers who are bumped from <b>overbooked</b> <b>flights</b> by up to $1,200, and provide compensation for passengers who are left stranded on airport tarmacs {{for long periods of}} time. It has won the support of consumer advocacy groups, and Maloway has said that it will force airlines to act more responsibly. [...] The National Airlines Council of Canada has opposed the measure, and has said that it will strengthen protection for travelers under an existing federal initiative.

5000|$|Computers {{also allow}} {{airlines}} to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly {{after making a}} reservation to fly. This allows airlines to <b>overbook</b> their <b>flights</b> enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for [...] "no-shows", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with overbooking on high demand flights can help reduce this figure.

40|$|Passenger demand forecasting, and {{subsequently}} passenger cancellation forecasting, are important components in any airline revenue management (RM) system. Passenger cancellations can potentially lead to flights leaving with empty seats {{and thus to}} loss of revenues. Airlines need accurate cancellation forecasting tools in order to properly compensate for cancellations, or in other words, <b>overbook</b> <b>flights</b> above their physical capacity. At the same time, airlines need to be cautious not to overbook too aggressively. If a <b>flight</b> is still <b>overbooked</b> at time of departure, not all passengers are able to board and those left behind need to be compensated and re-accommodated. This thesis focuses on modelling and forecasting passenger cancellations using the PODS booking simulation tool. Several methods for cancellation forecasting and overbooking are presented and their impacts are tested under different demand, competition and RM strategy settings. All methods are based on time series modeling of historical observations. However, the methods differ {{in terms of the}} data they use and the canceled bookings they compensate for. The potential contribution of Passenger Name Record data (PNR) to more accurate cancellation forecasting is discussed as well. Simulation results indicate that the ticket revenue gains due to cancellation forecasting and overbooking range between 1. 15 % and 4. 16 %, depending on the cancellation forecasting method used and the level of overbooking aggressiveness. However, aggressive overbooking increases the negative effect on revenues due to the costs associated with denied hoardings. Therefore, after taking into account these costs, the net revenue gains range between 0. 06 % and 2. 79 %. For airlines with high cancellation rates, the magnitude of the gains from cancellation forecasting and overbooking is even greater, reaching 3. 59 % in net revenue improvements. by Oren Petraru.

5000|$|The carrier began a steep decline {{during the}} decade, {{just after the}} ″Africanisation″ of the airline, i.e. Africans holding all top positions, was completed. Since that time, <b>overbooked</b> <b>flights</b> became frequent, tickets {{reserved}} for the member states were never paid, and schedules were missed {{to such an extent}} that some flights arrived half a day later or even departed ahead of schedule without any explanation. Losses mounted to FRF 68 million and FRF 6,8 million for 1983 and 1984, respectively; by contrast, the carrier made an FRF 17.6 million ( [...] million) profit during 1985. The number of passengers carried that year was 757,000, a 9.5% increase from the previous year. Largely due to the acquisition of new aircraft or wet-leasing planes from other companies, at early 1985 the carrier had a total debt of [...] million, with approximately a fifth of this amount being unpaid contributions from the member states. Director-general Koffi Aoussou also attributed the losses to the rise in fuel prices (Air Afrique spent [...] million in fuel in 1978 and almost [...] million in 1984), to overstaffing, to the increase in competition (mainly from UTA in the European routes), and to poor performance of the member countries' economies. During 1985, Auxence Ickonga, former head of the Congolese state-owned oil company Hydrocongo, succeeded Ivorian Aoussou Koffi as president and director general of the airline with plans to reduce salaries, shrink the 5,600-strong staff by 515, and to sell a Boeing 747 for [...] million in order to make the company economically viable. By , the debt-to-equity ratio was 8:1, with obligations rising to FRF 1,800 million. At the same time, the fleet comprised three A300s, two Boeing 727s (one chartered from Air France and the other from JAT), two DC-8s and three DC-10s; the Boeing 747 cargo that Ickonga intended to sell to alleviate the financial crisis was acquired by Korean Air Lines for [...] million.|$|R
40|$|Extending {{the concept}} of {{transaction}} compensation The ability to compensate for previous activities, often {{in the case of}} failure or exceptional events, is an important feature of long-running business transactions. In this paper, we present several extensions to existing notions of compensation for business transactions. The extensions are described using a business process modeling language called StAC (Structured Activity Compensation) but are also placed in the context of IBM’s BPBeans (Business Process Beans) enterprise technology. The meaning of the compensation mechanisms is made precise, as are issues of compensation scoping in multilevel transactions. The compensation extensions result in flexible and powerful mechanisms for modeling and implementing long-running business transactions. To compensate is “to make amends for, to make up for. ” 1 In the context of business transactions, a compensation is an action taken when something goes wrong or when there is a change of plan. For example, when an airline has <b>overbooked</b> a <b>flight</b> and too many passengers turn up at the gate, something has gone wrong. The airline needs to take corrective action to resolve the problem. In this case, the airline will typically attempt to encourage some passengers to delay their journey by offering monetary payments. The payments and the rebooking of the flight are a compensation for the inability to seat these passengers on this flight. In this paper, we present some extensions to the standard notion of compensation. We show that these by M. Chessel...|$|R
40|$|Since the "product" of {{an airline}} cannot be stored, {{the value of}} every seat which is left empty upon {{departure}} is lost forever or "spoiled". In order {{to compensate for the}} economic effects of passengers holding a confirmed reservation who fail to show-up, airlines overbook, i. e. accept more reservations than physical seats are available under the assumption that sufficient no-shows will occur. Even though airlines have <b>overbooked</b> their <b>flights</b> intentionally for decades, very few efforts have been made to measure the economic success of overbooking. As revenue maximization becomes more critical to the profitability of an airline, it is even more important to review the balanced tradeoff between denied boardings and spoilage. This thesis outlines the major philosophies of the currently applied overbooking models and illustrates further the common overbooking performance measurement approaches. As all of these models demonstrate significant shortcomings, a new model, the Revenue Achievement Model, is introduced. This new approach is based on a purely economics driven philosophy. Along with the Revenue Achievement Model, the different definitions of spoilage, oversales and other key values for the overbooking performance evaluation are reviewed and defined anew in an attempt to standardize the terminology. It is shown that the Revenue Achievement Model is more consistent with today's overbooking models than other overbooking performance measurement models. It matches the economic objectives of the airlines and shows superior qualities in comparing flights on a single flight level as well as evaluating the aggregate performance for large samples. The proposed methodology enables also to obtain a target performance index which allows a quantification of the objectives of overbooking. Finally, the impact of system overrides by revenue management analysts is analyzed and methods are suggested to evaluate their actions.
