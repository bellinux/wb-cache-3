40|$|Researchers now {{expect to}} have online access to library ca?talogues. But many of the {{resources}} held in libraries are not catalogued at all, or {{are not covered by}} <b>online</b> <b>catalogues.</b> Such resources are increasingly likely to be overlooked by researchers, whatever their potential value for research. This report assesses the progress that has been made {{over the past five years}} in extending the coverage of <b>online</b> <b>catalogues,</b> and priorities for future work. It shows that librarians have devoted considerable efforts to tackling the backlog of uncatalogued material in their collections, and converting to digital and <b>online</b> form <b>catalogues</b> that were originally available only in printed or card catalogue. As a result, it is estimates that 50 % of research collections are now covered by <b>online</b> <b>catalogues,</b> compared with 31 % five years ago. Researchers welcome these developments. Where collections themselves are not available online, remote access to catalogues enables them to prepare for visits to libraries much more effectively than in the past. But much remains to be done before all the material of significant value to researchers that is held in libraries can be readily traced through <b>online</b> <b>catalogues.</b> The report highlights the need to sustain the momentum of recent years in extending the scope of <b>online</b> <b>catalogues,</b> but also to promote examples of good practice and guidelines on issues such as prioritisation, consultation and communication, cataloguing standards, and evaluating impact and benefits. The report also underscores the UK-wide benefits of providing ready access to as full as possible a set of information about the widely-distributed national collection of books and other material of value for research. It calls for a national strategy and programme, using new methods to add to the coverage of <b>online</b> <b>catalogues</b> and datasets, and to enable currently-separate aggregations of bibliographic data to be exploited by both librarians and researchers. Full and accurate <b>online</b> <b>catalogues</b> are an essential underpinning for the co-operative efforts being made between libraries to enhance the quality of the services they provide to researchers across the UK. There is now a need to develop a co-ordinated programme to extend the range and scope of readily-available information about the holdings of libraries. Over the coming months, the RIN, in partnership with its stakeholders, will consider how best to develop and set out such a programme...|$|R

2500|$|There are 98 {{described}} genera of Gracillariidae (see below). A complete checklist {{is available}} of all currently recognised species (de Prins and de Prins 2005). There are many undescribed {{species in the}} tropics {{but there is also}} an <b>online</b> <b>catalogue</b> of Afrotropical described species the South African fauna is quite well known. Although Japanese and Russian authors have recognised additional subfamilies (de Prins and de Prins, 2005), there are three currently recognised subfamilies, Phyllocnistinae of which is likely to be basal. In this subfamily, the primitive genus Prophyllocnistis from Chile feeds on the plant genus Drimys (Winteraceae), and has leaf mines structurally similar in structure to fossils (Davis, 1994) (see [...] "Fossils"). While there have been some recent DNA sequence-based studies of Palaearctic species (Lopez-Vaamonde et al., 2003, 2006), there is need for a satisfactory modern global phylogenetic framework for the subfamilies of Gracillaridae. Some genera are very large, e.g. Acrocercops, Caloptilia, Cameraria, Epicephala and Phyllonorycter.|$|E
40|$|Purpose ? The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects Web 2. 0 has on users' ability to browse <b>online</b> archive <b>catalogues</b> effectively. Design/methodology/approach ? Methods used {{included}} a review of the relevant scholarly literature, content analysis and semi?structured interviews with purposive samples of <b>online</b> <b>catalogues</b> and archive staff, respectively. Findings ? The Web 2. 0 technologies likely to improve browsability were identified. Web 2. 0 use was expected to be low, the results confirmed this. Results from the interviews showed that although Web 2. 0 may improve browsability for certain user groups, more fundamental improvements such as improved catalogue data were expected to be more effective. Interviewees did not see any clear benefits to Web 2. 0 implementation and had struggled to collect data on usage of some of the Web 2. 0 tools they used. Research limitations/implications ? The results provided confirmation of many points made in existing research. Data need to be collected from users if Web 2. 0 use and its effects on browsability are to be understood. At present the effects of Web 2. 0 on the browsability of <b>online</b> <b>catalogues</b> remains unclear. Originality/value ? This paper provides a starting point for further investigation into the effect of Web 2. 0 on the browsability of <b>online</b> <b>catalogues.</b> Web 2. 0 tools which could potentially improve browsability have been identified and a snapshot has been taken of their use across the sample cataloguesPeer reviewe...|$|R
