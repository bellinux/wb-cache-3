5|$|During Tsang's second term, he {{initiated}} modest {{reforms in}} areas of education, environment and food safety. He concluded his term, however, when a local news media uncovered evidence of him receiving favours and hospitality from business tycoons on various occasions. This resulted in further discovery of bribery in Tsang's government; then-Chief Secretary of Administration, Rafael Hui, was convicted <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> 2014.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of the Commonwealth period, he {{continued}} to serve on Parliamentary committees.

5|$|In 1964, Jones' {{political}} career began with his election as a Republican to the West Virginia House of Delegates. He {{was the youngest}} person ever elected to that body. In 1966, he {{was chosen as the}} Republican floor leader in the House. In 1968, Jones announced that he would not seek re-election to his seat, despite facing no opposition. Among the factors influencing his decision was his perception <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> state politics.|$|E
5|$|Amado Boudou, {{who served}} as {{minister}} of economy during Kirchner's first term and vice president during the second, was suspected <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> 2012 case. The Ciccone Calcografica printing company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, but this request was cancelled when businessman Alejandro Vandenbroele bought it. The company received tax breaks to pay its debts, and was selected to print banknotes of the Argentine peso. It is suspected that Vandenbroele is actually a frontman for Boudou, and that he employed his clout as minister of economy to benefit a company that actually belonged to him.|$|E
5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria.|$|E

5|$|Papa Stour is {{the subject}} of a 1299 {{manuscript}} written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland. It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson, who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway. There is a circle of stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> the 1299 document and was later called ‘dominus de Papay’. (The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above.) The remains of Duke Hakon's thirteenth-century house are still visible near Housa Voe.|$|E
5|$|The Keating Five {{were five}} United States Senators accused <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> 1989, igniting a major {{political}} scandal {{as part of the}} larger Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., Chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which was the target of a regulatory investigation by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). The FHLBB subsequently backed off taking action against Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> {{a speech to}} the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, {{shortly after}} {{assuming}} {{the role of}} United States Attorney for Maryland, George Beall opened an investigation <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> Baltimore County, involving public officials, architects, engineering firms, and paving contractors. Beall's target was the current political leadership in Baltimore County. There were rumors that Agnew might be involved, which Beall initially discounted; Agnew had not been county executive since December 1966, and any misdeeds done then would be past the statute of limitations. As part of the investigation, Lester Matz's engineering firm was served with a subpoena for documents, and through his counsel he sought immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. Matz had been kicking back to Agnew {{five percent of the}} value of contracts received through his influence, first county contracts during his term in Towson, and subsequently state contracts while Agnew was governor.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} studied about {{political}} corruption {{and its implications for}} political development. Two perspectives, namely political and political economy, seem to dominate these studies. Both perspectives have provided useful analysis on the causes and impacts <b>of</b> political <b>corruption,</b> but they seem to have neglected the complex institutional contexts of the rise <b>of</b> political <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> democratising societies. By employing the perspective of organisational institutionalism, this paper explores ways in which complex institutional networks play a pivotal role in bringing about political corruption. This study uses two types of qualitative approaches. The first is a literature study, surveying published academic journal articles and books that are concerned with issues of political corruption; and the second uses unpublished raw data from case studies <b>of</b> political <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia. By using Indonesia as a case in point, this paper shows that the rise and growth <b>of</b> political <b>corruption</b> lies <b>in</b> the complex interplay of interactions among dominant institutions and organisations, including state-owned enterprises, parliaments, and political parties. The curbing <b>of</b> political <b>corruption</b> <b>in</b> any democratising society will depend on the existence of a powerful agency <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> eradication. Equipped with a powerful authority, as Indonesia has shown, such an agency is capable of bringing corrupt politicians, bureaucrats, and business people before <b>corruption</b> courts. <b>In</b> Indonesia, the <b>Corruption</b> Eradication Commissio...|$|R
