Due to this reason, from the 1840 s onwards, the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> and roads have determined the urban growth of Auckland (Auckland Council, 2012). Auckland is the biggest and fastest growing city in New Zealand. The major controversies of Auckland however, are its poor <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> and traffic congestion.

Auckland is also surrounded by water, and according to Toy (1977) water is a great asset for urban development. Auckland Transport (2013) indicates that it is necessary to rethink the future of Auckland’s ferry services, in particular the fare structure and ownership of ferry services. It is undeniable that current water transport facilities of Auckland are insufficient.

40|$|Multimodal {{transport}}, that {{is using}} {{two or more}} transport modes for a trip between which a transfer is necessary, seems an interesting approach to solving today's transportation problems {{with respect to the}} deteriorating accessibility of city centres, recurrent congestion, and environmental impact. Combining private transport and public transport in a truly multimodal transport system offers opportunities to capitalise on the strengths of the various systems while avoiding their weaknesses. The requirements for such a multimodal transport system, however, are high. Travellers have {{to be aware of the}} possibilities to change modes and the related benefit. Thus high quality travel information is crucial. Transfers between transport modes and services should be seamless, setting new standards for the design of transfer nodes and for the synchronisation of time-tabled transport services. Multimodal transport requires new organisational and financial arrangements between all actors involved. The most fundamental component of a multimodal transport system, however, is the multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> that consists of <b>networks</b> for private <b>transport,</b> public <b>transport,</b> and <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> services that are part of the multimodal transport system, including of course the transfer possibilities between these networks. This thesis investigates the consequences of multimodal travelling for designing multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> It describes the characteristics of multimodal travel today and assesses its future potential. The analysis focuses on the way <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> are organised in hierarchical network structures and determines the main mechanisms leading to these hierarchical network structures. Furthermore, an analysis is made of the role in a multimodal transport system of <b>transport</b> services <b>other</b> than private <b>transport</b> or public transport.
