50|$|Component-based {{usability}} testing (CBUT) is {{a testing}} approach which aims at empirically testing {{the usability of an}} interaction component. The latter {{is defined as}} an elementary unit <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system,</b> on which behaviour-based evaluation is possible. For this, a component needs to have an independent, and by the user perceivable and controllable state, such as a radio button, a slider or a whole word processor application. The CBUT approach can be regarded as part of component-based software engineering branch of software engineering.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the design of the software component <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Interactive</b> <b>System,</b> which supports the generation of automatic task-oriented help. Help can easily be generated from the abstract formal specification of the associated system without any further effort. The architectural description is obtained in a taskclriven way, where tasks are specified by indicating temporal ordering constraints using operators of a concurrent formal notation. The association of user tasks with software interaction objects, which inherit constraints of related tasks, gives the information to structure task-oriented help in an immediate way. The help given is thus more expressive with a consequent improvement in the usability <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Interactive</b> <b>System...</b>|$|E

40|$|The principled design {{approach}} {{improves the}} quality of user interfaces by ensuring conformance to certain carefully chosen design principles. This involves reasoning about the properties <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system</b> specification. Such specifications usually concentrate on interactive system state and behaviour, and pay {{little attention to the}} presentation. We show that arguments about the properties <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system</b> cannot be relied upon without placing requirements on the presentation mapping. We consider in detail these requirements, {{and the manner in which}} we can verify their satisfaction. Taking this approach, we can prove that a presentation is valid with respect to a given property, and thus extend our reasoning into the perceptual domain of the presentation. 1 Introduction In recent years, the approach of principled design [DFAB 93] has become more widespread in the area of interactive system design.

In this paper, {{we present}} the {{rationale}} and the baseline <b>of</b> <b>a</b> notation {{which can be}} used on its own or as an extension to standard UML to facilitate specification <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system’s</b> global execution context (GEC). The GEC graph is a visual construction consisting <b>of</b> (<b>a)</b> nodes, which represent interaction scenarios, and (b) directed links, which represent scenario relationships designating alternate execution, concurrency, ordering, and set-oriented relationships between two scenario nodes. The technique is particularly useful for specifying adaptable and adaptive behaviours across interaction platforms, contexts of use and target user communities. In the paper, we demonstrate the application of the technique using a file-exchange application which runs on a portable device such as a PDA and implements a lightweight ftp process to connect to a server wirelessly and offer standard ftp functionality (get/put/delete). ...|$|R
