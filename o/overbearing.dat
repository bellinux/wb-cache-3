5|$|Chotiner was in {{many ways}} the most {{interesting}} personality in Nixon's political camp: aggressive, egocentric, a professional among amateurs, brilliant, <b>overbearing,</b> ruthless, engaging, habitually guilty of overkill, constantly enlarging his area of operation.

5|$|Descendants of the mutineers {{and their}} Tahitian consorts live on Pitcairn into the 21st century. The {{generally}} accepted view of Bligh as an <b>overbearing</b> monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh, and a more critical one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Despite its poor {{box office}} returns, The Shawshank Redemption opened to {{generally}} positive reviews. Some reviewers compared {{the film to}} other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in Cell Block 11.

5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} to retain its own {{government}} and political system, but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence.

The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E
5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and <b>overbearing</b> in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{specialised}} in {{two types}} of romantic male leads, which she called Mark I and Mark II. Mark I, with overtones of Mr Rochester, was (in her words) “rude, <b>overbearing,</b> and often a bounder”. Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated, and often a style-icon. Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen's division between lively and gentle) fell into two broad groups: the tall and dashing, mannish type, and the quiet bullied type.|$|E
5|$|Horrible Bosses is a 2011 American black comedy film {{directed}} by Seth Gordon, written by Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, {{based on a}} story by Markowitz.

5|$|Whether playing Dixieland, bebop, or avant-garde jazz, in big bands or {{in small}} groups, Manne's self-professed goal {{was to make the}} music swing. His fellow musicians attested to his {{listening}} appreciatively to those around him and being ultra-sensitive to the needs and the nuances of the music played by the others in the band, his goal being to make themand the music as a wholesound better, rather than calling attention to himself with <b>overbearing</b> solos.|$|E
5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, {{that she must}} stand up to her <b>overbearing</b> father {{just as he had}} done with Phil. When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like {{appendage}} grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house.

Although Susanna endures his mental cruelty, she cannot forgive Edwin for blinding her faithful, mute stableboy (Shashi Malviya) with a whip. Edwin is eliminated during a panther-hunting trip {{with the help of}} Susanna's faithful maid (Usha Uthup), butler (Harish Khanna) and the mute stableboy.|$|E
5|$|The 1961 {{season was}} typical on the field: Jim Brown {{led the league}} in rushing for the fifth {{straight}} season and the team ended with an 8–5–1 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship. During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often <b>overbearing</b> demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence. They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.|$|E
5|$|The film {{primarily}} {{revolves around}} {{the relationship between a}} father and son, in which the father's excessive concern for his son, and interference in his life, leads to the latter harbouring bitterness towards his <b>overbearing</b> father. The film opened to Indian audiences on 9 August 2006. On its way to winning state honors and rave reviews, the film {{went on to win the}} South Filmfare Awards among other prominent awards. The film's success broke several records at the box office during its prime and is one of the highest grossing Telugu films.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews and}} sales estimates ranged from subpar to par. Reviewers praised Kameo graphics as setting {{standards for the}} new console, and noted its vivid color palette. Their criticism focused on the gameplay, in particular its repetition, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and <b>overbearing</b> tutorial. Reviewers found the story and Kameo's character lackluster, but largely liked the other characters and the core morphing concept. They had high praise for the orchestral score and other technical features, apart from the game's camera. Rare released several cosmetic downloadable content packs, and a free online cooperative mode upgrade.|$|E
5|$|The {{season began}} with Coach Taylor failing {{to lead the}} Panthers to another State {{championship}} the year before, creating new pressure for him. Quarterback Matt Saracen's position is threatened {{by the arrival of}} freshman J.D. McCoy, an amazing natural talent who comes from a rich family with an <b>overbearing</b> father, Joe. Matt moves to wide receiver after Taylor names J.D. starting quarterback. Tyra starts dating a cowboy named Cash, leading to complications in her relationship with Landry. Tim and Lyla start dating.

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{eccentric}} member of staff is Alan Statham (Mark Heap), an <b>overbearing,</b> stuttering and pedantic consultant radiologist, whose everyday actions regularly border on insanity. He is desperately and hopelessly {{in love with}} Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood), the 48-year-old head of human resources with an increasingly sardonic attitude. Their relationship is an open secret, with student doctor Boyce (Oliver Chris), often {{using it as a}} weapon against them, bullying Alan constantly. Joanna's human resources staff also use it against her, in particular Kim Alabaster (Sally Bretton), who has a bad attitude towards most of the people she meets, and Naughty Rachel (Katie Lyons), who earned her nickname due to her love of sex. The other HR staff include Harriet Schulenburg (Olivia Colman), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage, and Karen Ball (Lucinda Raikes), who divides her time between doing much of the office's work, trying to attract Martin's affections, and being bullied by Kim and Rachel.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a composite of several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an <b>overbearing</b> matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.|$|E
5|$|They {{set out on}} {{the road}} with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark {{convertible}} with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount).

Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd. They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E
5|$|The Hamdanids' {{success and}} rule over the Abbasid capital lasted for {{little more than}} a year. They lacked funds and were {{politically}} isolated, finding little support among the Caliphate's most powerful vassals, the Samanids of Transoxiana and the Ikhshidids of Egypt. Consequently, when in late 943 a mutiny broke out among their troops (mostly composed of Turks, Daylamites, Carmathians and only a few Arabs) over pay issues, under the leadership of the Turkish general Tuzun, they were forced to quit Baghdad and return to their base, Mosul. Caliph al-Muttaqi now appointed Tuzun as amir al-umara, but the Turk's <b>overbearing</b> manner induced al-Muttaqi to once again seek refuge in the Hamdanid court. The Hamdanid forces under Sayf al-Dawla took the field against Tuzun's army, but were defeated. The Hamdanids now concluded an agreement with Tuzun which allowed them to keep the Jazira and even gave them nominal authority over northern Syria (which at the time was not under Hamdanid control), in exchange for an annual tribute of 3.6 million dirhams.|$|E

25|$|Dawes was {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} help the people of Sierra Leone, but his religious zeal, his opposition to the local Methodist ministers, and what they considered his <b>overbearing</b> nature alienated him from many of the colonists and even from other colonial officials, like Thomas Clarkson.|$|E

25|$|During this time, her {{relationship}} with her daughter, B. D. Hyman, deteriorated when Hyman became a born-again Christian and attempted to persuade Davis to follow suit.
