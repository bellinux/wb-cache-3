25|$|The six-cylinder XJ40s are {{powered by}} the AJ6 inline-six engine, which {{replaced}} the XK6 unit used in earlier XJs. The new unit featured a four-valve, twin <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> design. In 1993, one year before XJ40 production ended, the V12-powered XJ12 and Daimler Double Six models were reintroduced.|$|E
25|$|The H2-H2R {{engine is}} a 998cc inline-4, four-valve, dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> design with a two-speed, centrifigual {{supercharger}}. The supercharger {{is driven by}} a series of gears and shafts connecting the flywheel to a planetary drive, finally spinning a dog-shifted two-speed shaft attached to the impeller. Rider control is throttle by wire.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{downside}} to the 200B was the noise the driver {{would have to}} endure. The 2-litre <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engine could be very loud when pushed up through the rev range, and {{to make matters worse}} there was always plenty of drive line vibration. These issues prompted an exhaustive correction programme to be undertaken by the parent company in Japan, and thankfully later models were somewhat improved.|$|E

25|$|While today some engines rely on {{a single}} {{camshaft}} per cylinder bank, which {{is known as a}} single overhead camshaft (SOHC), most modern engines are driven by a two camshafts per cylinder bank arrangement (one camshaft for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves); such camshaft arrangement is known as a double or dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> (DOHC), thus, a V engine, which has two separate cylinder banks, may have four camshafts (colloquially known as a quad-cam engine).|$|E
25|$|The 204 used a {{front-wheel drive}} layout and was {{launched}} on 20 April 1965 {{with a single}} <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> 1130 cc petrol engine (the maximum allowed for the 6CV 'car tax' class in France). In September 1975, {{less than a year}} before production ceased, it received a more modern petrol engine, now of 1127 cc. Claimed maximum output, which at launch had been 53bhp (39kW), increased to 59bhp (43kW), though there was a marginal reduction in maximum torque.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the camshaft, the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of pushrods and rockers. Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the camshaft to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders. In the past when engines were not as reliable as today this was seen as too much trouble, but in modern gasoline engines the <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> system, where the camshaft is on top of the cylinder head, is quite common.|$|E
50|$|General Motors is the world's largest pushrod engine producer, {{producing}} I4, V6 and V8 pushrod engines. Most {{other companies}} use <b>overhead</b> <b>cams.</b>|$|R

50|$|Unlike 6G74-based engine {{available}} in Japan, the Australian-built V6 still had 24 valves but used a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) design {{instead of a}} more complex and costly double <b>overhead</b> <b>cams</b> (DOHC) design.|$|R
25|$|The 1969 Firebirds. {{received}} a heavy facelift but otherwise continued {{much the same}} as the original 1967 model. It was the final year for the <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> six-cylinder engine in Firebirds and intermediates, and the Firebird convertible (until 1991). Production of the 1969 Firebirds was extended into {{the first three months of}} the 1970 model year (all other 1970 Pontiacs debuted Sept. 18, 1969) due to a decision to delay the introduction of an all-new 1970 Firebird (and Chevrolet Camaro) until Feb. 26, 1970.|$|E
25|$|The Halberstadt D.III {{primarily}} {{differed from}} the D.II version in its substitution of the Argus As.II 90kW (120hp) straight-six engine, which {{differed from the}} usual Mercedes D.II powerplant in having its camshaft in the engine block and using pushrods to operate the overhead valves, rather than having a camshaft running atop all of the cylinders as in a single <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engine. A total of 50 D.III examples were built by Halberstadt, with the first 30 ordered in July 1916 and the last 20 ordered in August 1916.|$|E
25|$|General Motors (GM) {{ordered a}} recall on August 16, 2013, for 292,879 model year 2011 and 2012 Cruze models, {{manufactured}} at the Lordstown, Ohio plant United States. General Motors told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the recall {{was due to}} a potential intermittent loss of brake assist in Cruze models featuring {{the combination of the}} 1.4-liter dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> gasoline turbo engine and the 6T40 FWD automatic transmission. GM said it was aware of 27 alleged low-speed crashes due to brake issues that may include this particular issue, but it reported no injuries.|$|E
50|$|The Suzuki M {{engine family}} is a line of {{automobile}} engines from Suzuki. Ranging in displacement from 1.3 L to 1.8 L, it is a modern engine line with dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cams,</b> 16 valves, and multi-point fuel injection (MPFI).|$|R
5000|$|Ford's modular V8 first {{debuted in}} the all-new 1992 Ford Crown Victoria as a single-overhead-cam (SOHC) setup, {{and then the}} engine really {{displayed}} its power potential with 32 valves, dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cams</b> (DOHC), and [...] in the all-new 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII.|$|R
50|$|The new Superquadro {{engine is}} {{exceptionally}} oversquare, with a bore:stroke ratio of 1.84:1. Whereas previous Ducatis had belt-driven <b>overhead</b> <b>cams,</b> this engine's valvetrain uses gears and chain. The engine {{serves as a}} stressed member, making the Panigale smaller and lighter than a conventionally framed motorcycle.|$|R
25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of valve spring) to close the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying <b>overhead</b> <b>cam,</b> multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 {{the company}} {{was taken over by}} David Brown and moved in with Aston Martin, which he had also bought, in Feltham, Middlesex. The old Staines works at Egham Hythe passed to Petters Limited, in which A.P. Good had {{acquired}} the controlling interest. Production restarted with the last prototypes from W. O. Bentley, the 1948 2.6-Litre with new chassis featuring fully independent suspension. Its new 2580 cc twin <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> straight 6 became the basis for the Aston Martin engines of the 1950s. The engine grew to 3 litres in 1953 and continued to be available until 1958.|$|E
25|$|The more {{powerful}} 6C 1750 (1752cc actual) {{was introduced in}} 1929 in Rome. The car featured {{a top speed of}} 95mph, a chassis designed to flex and undulate over wavy surfaces, as well as sensitive geared-up steering. It was produced in six series between 1929 and 1933. Base model had a single overhead cam; Super Sport and Gran Sport versions had double <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engine (DOHC). Again, a supercharger was available. Most of the cars were sold as rolling chassis and bodied by coachbuilders such as Zagato, and Touring. Additionally, there were 3 examples built with James Young bodywork, one of which {{is a part of the}} permanent collection at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA in original, unrestored condition.|$|E
5000|$|... the Venox's engine {{cylinders}} {{are set in}} a 90° V-twin configuration. It has dual dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cams,</b> four valves per cylinder, and is liquid cooled. All of {{this allows}} the Venox to offer , an improvement of [...] over 250 cruisers like the Honda Rebel.|$|R
50|$|Today most {{automotive}} engines use <b>overhead</b> <b>cams,</b> {{driving a}} flat tappet {{to achieve the}} shortest, lightest weight, and most inelastic path from cam to valve, thereby avoiding elastic elements such as pushrod and rocker arm. Computers have allowed for fairly accurate acceleration modelling of valve-train systems.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a {{naturally}} aspirated 65° V12 with 4 valves per cylinder, dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cams</b> and a variable length intake manifold. It displaced [...] and produced [...] at 7,000 rpm and 568.1 Nm at 5,000 rpm. Bore and stroke measure 88 mm and 75 mm.|$|R
25|$|On its {{launch in}} 1972, the Peugeot 104 was {{offered as a}} compact four-door fastback. Although it had a short, sloping rear end that {{suggested}} a hatchback, there was originally a separate boot/trunk, as on a conventional saloon. Power was provided from a 954cc Douvrin engine called the PSA X engine, an all-aluminium alloy, chain driven <b>overhead</b> <b>cam,</b> with gearbox in the sump, sharing engine oil, which was jointly developed with Renault. This transmission-in-sump arrangement {{was similar to that}} pioneered by the British Motor Corporation in the Mini. It gave good levels of economy and refinement as well as having an impressive chassis which made ride and handling excellent. The engine was mounted leaning backwards, at a 72 degree angle.|$|E
25|$|The Alfetta saloon was {{the base}} for the Alfetta GT, a 2-door, 4-seater {{fastback}} coupé designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign. Introduced in 1974, similarly to the saloon it was initially available only with the 1.8-litre (1,779cc) version of the Alfa DOHC four. These engines featured a chain driven 8-valve twin <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> cylinder head of cross-flow design. For 1976, with the final phasing out of the earlier 105 Series (GT1300 Junior and GT1600 Junior and 2000GTV), the Alfetta GT became a range; the 1.8 was discontinued in favour of the 1.6-litre (1,570cc) Alfetta GT1.6 and 2.0-litre (1,962cc) Alfetta GTV2.0. At the same time some updates were introduced, such as a new front grille with horizontal slats and two series of vents beneath it. The GTV was distinguished from the 1.6 version by twin chrome whiskers in the grille and GTV scripts carved in the ventilation vents on the C-pillar.|$|E

50|$|The 330 Colombo {{engine was}} {{enlarged}} with an 81 mm bore to 4390 cc for 1966's 365 California, retaining single <b>overhead</b> <b>cams</b> and wet sump lubrication. A reworked engine with four camshafts {{was used in}} the GT/4 models.The 365 GTB/4 Daytona was the only 365 engined car featuring dry sump lubrication.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of <b>overhead</b> <b>cams</b> {{is that a}} much longer chain (or belt) is needed to drive the cams than with a camshaft located in the cylinder block, usually a tensioner is also needed. A break in the belt may destroy the engine if pistons touch open valves at top dead center.|$|R
2500|$|The {{engine was}} equally [...] "civilized" [...] as the interior, {{given that it}} was {{provided}} with just one <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> head through the cylinder bank, two chain driven valves per cylinder and three dual Weber carburetors bodies placed {{on top of the}} V, against six versions typically on the sports cars.|$|E
2500|$|... 750 cc and 500 cc {{versions}} of the Revolution engine are used in Harley-Davidson's Street line of light cruisers. These motors, named the Revolution X, use a single <b>overhead</b> <b>cam,</b> screw and locknut valve adjustment, a single internal counterbalancer, and vertically split crankcases; all of these changes making it different from the original Revolution design.|$|E
2500|$|The Sunbeam Malay was a 20-cylinder radial {{aircraft}} engine of [...] capacity manufactured by Sunbeam using five four-cylinder {{blocks from the}} Arab arranged around a central crankshaft. The Malay retained the [...] × [...] bore and stroke of the Arab, {{as well as the}} three valves per cylinder and <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> shafts. Nominally rated at , the Malay was not put into production.|$|E
50|$|The British Racing Motors (BRM) H-16 Formula One engine won the 1966 US Grand Prix with Jim Clark in a Lotus 43. As a racing-car engine it was {{hampered}} {{by a high}} center of gravity, and it was heavy and complex, with gear-driven twin <b>overhead</b> <b>cams</b> for each of four cylinder heads, two gear-coupled crankshafts, and mechanical fuel injection.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{included}} {{a number of}} otherwise advanced features. For instance, the valves were powered by dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cams</b> driven by power shafts {{at the rear of}} the engine. Exhaust ports were arranged to exit toward the middle of the engine, one cylinder bank being the mirror of the other, allowing the piping to be ganged below the engine nacelle.|$|R
50|$|TMAX {{designers}} chose a novel engine configuration: a water-cooled four-stroke horizontal straight-twin (both cylinders pointing forward) {{with four}} valves per cylinder operated by dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cams.</b> Engine vibrations were offset {{not by a}} balance shaft but by reciprocating balancer (i.e., a third 'dummy' piston driven from a central crankpin). By comparison, transmission design was the norm for scooters: a twist-and-go automatic transmission.|$|R
