25|$|The {{last major}} campus {{construction}} overseen by Ross was the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mess</b> Hall.

25|$|The design {{specifications}} for Point Baker included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction {{was used to}} save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces {{were a part of}} the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side.

500|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Saint-Quentin on 2October, No.2 Squadron became the first AFC unit in Europe to see aerial combat when one of its patrols engaged some German two-seaters, which managed to escape. Because the AircoDH.5s in the squadron were handicapped as fighters by engine problems and low speed, the squadron was employed mainly in ground support duties. During the Battle of Cambrai that commenced on 20November 1917, Watt led his pilots on daring low-level bombing and strafing attacks against enemy fortifications and lines of communication. Their loss rate reached 30%, but morale remained high. After visiting the squadron, the Royal Flying Corps' Major General Hugh Trenchard described its airmen as [...] "really magnificent" [...] while Charles Bean, war correspondent and future editor of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914â€“1918, commented on their [...] "remarkably high level of conduct and general tone". Six of Watt's officers were awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during the battle, prompting General Sir William Birdwood to send him a personal message of congratulation on 16December, declaring: [...] "...This is indeed a magnificent record for your squadron, and one of which I am sure everyone of you must rightly be extremely proud; I doubt if it has been beaten anywhere..." [...] By this time, No.2 Squadron had begun converting to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, though it could achieve little in the winter months due to inclement weather.

40|$|Abstract An {{autonomous}} {{and automatic}} home mess-cleanup robot is newly developed in this paper. Thus far, vacuum-cleaners have lightened <b>the</b> burden <b>of</b> household chores but the operational labor that vacuum-cleaners entail {{has been very}} severe. Recently, a cleaning robot was commercialized to solve but it also was not successful because it still had <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> mess-cleanup, which pertained to <b>the</b> clean-up <b>of</b> large trash and <b>the</b> arrangement <b>of</b> newspapers, clothes, etc. Hence, we develop a new home mess-cleanup robot (McBot) to completely overcome this problem. The robot needs the capability for agile navigation and a novel manipulation system for mess-cleanup. The autonomous navigational system has to be controlled for <b>the</b> full scanning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living room and for <b>the</b> precise tracking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desired path. It must be {{also be able to}} recognize the absolute position and orientation of itself and to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>messed</b> object that is to be cleaned up from obstacles that should merely be avoided. The manipulator, which is not needed in a vacuum-cleaning robot, has <b>the</b> functions <b>of</b> distinguishing <b>the</b> large trash that is to be cleaned from <b>the</b> <b>messed</b> objects that are to be arranged. It needs to use its discretion with regard to <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messed</b> objects and to properly carry these objects to the destination.

2500|$|Author Dorothy Hobson has {{described}} Ian and Cindy's relationship as [...] "one {{of the most}} tempestuous in any soap opera". The characters were reunited on-screen in 1992 but the relationship ended in adultery once again when Cindy began an affair with Simon's brother David Wicks, which culminated in Cindy hiring an assassin to shoot Ian in 1996 after he discovered the affair. Michelle Collins who played Cindy commented in 1996, [...] " [...] was not thinking properly when she contacted the hitman, and she is being quite erratic.

[...] More than 18 million viewers tuned in to see Ian gunned-down, which was more than sixty-four per cent of available viewers.

Although Bree tried {{to get on with}} Brooke, the feelings were not mutual and Brooke struggled to accept her sister.

Blampied herself was an only child, but found working alongside Allen reassuring, [...] "I was kind of getting to know Beth in an almost sisterly way at the same time Bree and Brooke were getting to know each other. So it's kind of worked for me." [...] After Vinnie left Brooke for her behaviour towards Bree, he and Bree started an affair, creating a love triangle between the sisters. Bree revealed to Vinnie that her qualifications as a surgeon were dodgy and alerted Brooke. However instead of deepening the rival between the two, it only forced the two closer together. Blampied explained the situation stating; [...] "Instead of throwing Bree under a bus, Brooke decides she quite likes that Bree has a big secret, because it makes her more human â€“ or more like she is ...

2500|$|In his 1958 article Tobin {{also led}} the way in showing how to deal with utility {{maximization}} under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains [...] "One way to get out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumerâ€™s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a personâ€™s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobinâ€™s assumptions we can reformulate the personâ€™s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investorâ€™s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market." ...|$|E
