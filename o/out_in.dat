40|$|Designers of {{embedded}} systems are facing ever tighter constraints on design time. Unfortunately, tools today {{do not provide}} {{the right kind of}} help in the partitioning and mapping of a design onto hardware and software components. The Chinook co-synthesis system is an attempt to provide such a tool for control-dominated embedded system designs. It addresses the automation of the most time-consuming and error-prone tasks in embedded controller design, namely: the synthesis of interface hardware and software needed to integrate system components; the migration of functions between processors or custom logic; and the co-simulation of the design before and after synthesis. This paper describes the principal elements of Chinook and discusses its application to a variety of embedded designs.
