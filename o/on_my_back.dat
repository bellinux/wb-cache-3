25|$|During his {{recovery}} {{at the hospital}} from his wounds suffered in that battle, Ross developed a habit for the morphine administered for pain. Back in the states, the morphine became heroin. This habit became so bad he would sometimes spend $500 {{a day on the}} drug. Ross went to a recovery center and beat his addiction. He gave lectures to high school students about the dangers of drug addiction. His struggle against morphine addiction is the subject of the 1957 film Monkey <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Back.</b>|$|E

500|$|In August 2010, cancer {{survivor}} Cathy Bossi, an on-duty flight attendant for U.S. Airways, was passing through security screening at Charlotte Douglas International Airport {{on the way}} to her next flight. Due to the radiation involved, she reluctantly passed through a full-body scanner. [...] "The T.S.A. Agent told me to put my I.D. on my back," [...] she said. [...] "When I got out of there the agent said because my I.D. was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> I had to go to a personal screening area." [...] During what she described as an [...] "aggressive" [...] pat-down search, security screening personnel forced her to remove and show her prosthetic breast. Their action violated TSA guidelines, which state that agents do not need to touch or inspect a mastectomy prosthetic.|$|E
500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down. At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and slightly to the right.

I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
500|$|... "Intro (Listen To My Drama)" [...] is {{in a minor}} key and {{features}} a string ensemble and synthesizers. In the rap, Ivy Queen sings: [...] "1-9-9-3 was the year that I started, Many have seen my rise and fall I've seen many. Vigilant, I have an angel <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> I have a throne flanked by holy souls." [...] Lyrically, Ivy Queen highlights her position as the queen of reggaeton. [...] "Te Voy A Recordar" [...] (I'm Going To Make You Remember), also in a minor key, also employs a string ensemble and synthesizers. Lyrically, the song describes when the passion in a relationship has been lost. [...] "Me Quiere" [...] (They Like Me) is an R power ballad built on a snapping rhythm. Also in a minor key, it features synthesizers and percussion. In the song, Queen says that people listen to her because they like her. The lyrics reveal that when she wants it smooth she puts on R. Kelly, and when she is discontented she plays Mary J. Blige (both of whom Queen has said {{she would like to}} work with in the future). The song highlights her hip-hop status. [...] "De La Calle" [...] (From the Street) is an R power ballad exploring the love between two people ("love from the street"), with Queen and De La Ghetto reprising their 2006 collaboration on a remix of Luny Tunes' [...] "Noche de Entierro (Nuestro Amor)".|$|E

It was while speaking to a West Indian Negro who was a passenger with me from Southampton, who was returning home to the East Indies from Basutoland with his Basuto wife, I further learned of the horrors of native life in Africa. He related to me in conversation such horrible and pitiable tales that my heart bled within me. Retiring from the conversation to my cabin, all day and the following night I pondered over the subject matter of that conversation, and at midnight, lying flat <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> the vision and thought came to me that I should name the organization the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League. Such a name I thought would embrace the purpose of all black humanity. Thus to the world a name was born, a movement created, and a man became known." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, I was put <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> {{on the floor with}} my arms and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd start over again... I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Michael Strahan's retirement, Tuck was {{promoted}} to starting defensive end. When asked about the pressure of replacing Strahan, Tuck replied [...] "Pressure? No, I'm smart enough to realize there's only one Strahan and there will always only be one Strahan. I'm not trying to replace Michael Strahan. I'm just trying to fill in and {{do my best to}} help this football team win. I'm not pinning that pressure <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> as far as going out there and getting 22 sacks in a season." [...] But Tuck started his 2008 campaign in Michael Strahan-like fashion by sacking Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell in the first play of the season opener. The Giants went on to defeat their division rivals the Washington Redskins 16–7. Tuck followed his exceptional performance in week one with an outstanding performance against the St. Louis Rams. Tuck finished the game with 2.0 sacks and an interception return for a touchdown in a Giants victory in week two. The interception and touchdown marked the first of Tuck's professional career. The touchdown was his first since his junior season at Notre Dame.|$|E

2500|$|However, on 28 July 2008, Tottenham {{confirmed}} {{the sale of}} Keane for £19million (plus a potential £1.3million in performance based compensation). Keane agreed terms with Liverpool shortly afterwards, signing a four-year contract with the Merseyside club. Upon his arrival to Liverpool, Keane said, [...] "I've been a Liverpool fan all my life, going back to when I was {{a kid growing up}} in Dublin, and I always had a Liverpool shirt <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>back.</b> So, to be here now as a Liverpool player is incredible and I couldn't be happier." [...] Following the transfer, Tottenham withdrew their official complaint against Liverpool after the club made a donation to the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation and apologised for their behaviour prior to the deal. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy publicly stated his dissatisfaction, saying he had been forced into transferring the player due to Liverpool's interference. Keane was given the squad number 7, and scored his first goal for Liverpool on 1 October 2008 in a Champions League win against PSV Eindhoven at Anfield. A second Champions League goal quickly followed with Keane scoring the opening goal in Liverpool's 1–1 draw with Atlético Madrid. Premier League goals were less forthcoming but he scored twice for Liverpool against West Bromwich Albion on 8 November. Upon scoring twice after a goalless spell he said: ...|$|E
