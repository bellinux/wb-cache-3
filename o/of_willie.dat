5|$|Ellis {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1974 season, pitching to a 3–8 win-loss record and 4.54 ERA through July 10. Subsequently he won eight consecutive games and nine out of ten, pitching seven completed games in that ten-game stretch. A line drive off of the bat <b>of</b> <b>Willie</b> Montañez fractured the fifth metacarpal bone in Ellis' pitching hand on September 10, prematurely ending his season. Ellis had the seventh best walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio (1.155). The Pirates won the NL East, but they lost the 1974 NLCS three games to one to the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|E
5|$|John Gould {{and other}} early writers {{referred}} to the species as the black-and-white fantail, although did note the current name. However, willie wagtail rapidly became widely accepted sometime after 1916. Wagtail is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins <b>of</b> <b>willie</b> are obscure. The name had been in use colloquially for the pied subspecies of the white wagtail (Motacilla alba) on the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} collection <b>of</b> <b>Willie</b> Nelson materials (1975–1994) {{became part}} of the Wittliff collections of Southwestern Writers, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas. The collection contains lyrics, screenplays, letters, concert programs, tour itineraries, posters, articles, clippings, personal effects, promotional items, souvenirs, and documents. It documents Nelson's IRS troubles and how Farm Aid contributions were used. Most of the material was collected by Nelson's friend Bill Wittliff, who wrote or co-wrote Honeysuckle Rose, Barbarosa and Red Headed Stranger. In 2014, Nelson donated his personal collection to the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. The items include photographs, correspondence, song manuscripts, posters, certificate records, awards, signed books, screenplays, personal items and gifts and tributes from Nelson's fans.|$|E
5|$|Newsom placed {{first in}} the November 4, 2003, general {{election}} in a nine-man field. Newsom received 41.9 {{percent of the vote}} to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 19.6 {{in the first round of}} balloting, but he faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff when many of the city's liberal groups coalesced around Gonzalez. The race was partisan with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported. Democratic leadership felt that they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger. National figures from the Democratic Party, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned on Newsom's behalf. Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez while Newsom received the endorsement <b>of</b> <b>Willie</b> Brown.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Docherty was {{appointed}} manager in 1971 {{and had a}} brief, but successful, time in charge. Docherty lost only three of his 12 matches as manager, but he left the job in late 1972 to become manager of Manchester United. Despite losing 5–0 to England in his first match in charge, Scotland qualified for the 1974 World Cup under the management <b>of</b> <b>Willie</b> Ormond. Scotland performed creditably at the finals, winning against Zaire and drawing against Brazil and Yugoslavia, but were eliminated on goal difference. Ormond suffered from player indiscipline during his tenure, which included an infamous incident where Jimmy Johnstone, after a night out drinking, sat in a rowing boat that was drifting out to sea. Two teammates attempted to rescue Johnstone, but eventually {{he had to be}} retrieved by local fishermen. Ormond left the Scotland job in 1977 to become manager of Hearts.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits for this production are fragmentary like many 1910 Thanhouser productions. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The role <b>of</b> <b>Willie</b> Stone was played by Marie Eline. This film was another example of Eline cast in the role of a boy. Eline's with the first such credit was as a young Italian boy in The Two Roses. Eline would also star as Hans in The Little Hero of Holland. If the cast information provided by the The Monroe News-Star is accurate, it represents the earliest credit of Mignon Anderson for the Thanhouser Company. If it is not, the first known credit for would be four months later in Robert Emmet in March 1911. The film would also be an early credit of William Garwood, who was among the most important actors at Thanhouser. He joined the company in late 1909 and remained until 1911 before returning in 1912. His previous and first credited work with Thanhouser was Jane Eyre.|$|E

Pashen still insists prostitution - and being part <b>of</b> <b>Willie's</b> 'stable' - is okay, as she's making a lot of money, and she likes the men's attention while working, because she feels like someone 'important,' wanted & beautiful. Cora tells Pashen that she, too, was once a prostitute, on the streets. Cora sneaks into Willie's apartment to find records <b>of</b> <b>Willie's</b> bank accounts, which could provide evidence of his illegal activity, but, the materials she takes {{would not be able to}} stand up in court. After this second arrest, Pashen finally decides to take Cora's advice about pursuing modeling, and does a photo-shoot for which she gets paid. She tries to tell Willie she wants out, but, he tells her of his dreams and hopes for her (and for himself), which she's not able to refuse.|$|R
