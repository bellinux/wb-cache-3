40|$|One of the <b>major</b> <b>operating</b> cost <b>items</b> of {{an airline}} company is fuel, which can amount to {{approximately}} 20 % of its overall operating cost. This paper presents a decision support model that determines {{the amount of}} fuel to be uplifted by a plane at each station along its route over a predetermined planning horizon so as to minimise overall fuel costs. The aforementioned fuel management problem is modelled as a multiple period capacitated inventory problem and solved using linear programming. An example application illustrates the applicability of this model to Middle East Airline's (MEA) operations and summarises the dollar savings obtained by applying it over a one week planning horizon.

The observed movements at <b>major</b> <b>items</b> of infrastructure can then be compared to the predicted movements at any time throughout the mining period. The challenges in providing time based predictions are discussed.

40|$|There {{has been}} much work {{regarding}} the deterministic EOQ with partial backordering. The majority of these studies assume no correlation in sales, so independent demands across items is applied in the models. However, it is generally recognized that cross-selling effects between items often appear in real contexts. Thus, incorporating such effects in the inventory model {{in the form of}} correlated demands makes it of more practical relevance. In this paper, the authors address a two-item inventory system where the demand of a minor item is correlated to that of a <b>major</b> <b>item</b> because of cross-selling. We firstly present a two-item EOQ model with identical order cycles, where the unmet demand of the <b>major</b> <b>item</b> can be partially backordered with lost sales whereas the demand of the minor item must be met without stockouts. This model is further extended to fit a more practical case where the order cycle of the <b>major</b> <b>item</b> is an integer multiple of that of the minor item. The optimal solutions of the two models, as well as the inventory decision procedures, are also developed. Comparative analysis on these two EOQ models has been drawn in the computational study which presents some insights into the parameter effect on the optimal inventory policy.
