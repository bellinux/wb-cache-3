25|$|Introduction of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes into}} rapidly dividing cells has been thought {{to slow down}} or arrest tumor growth. Adenoviruses are a commonly utilized vector for this purpose.

25|$|Entry <b>of</b> <b>adenoviruses</b> {{into the}} host cell {{involves}} {{two sets of}} interactions between the virus and the host cell. Most of the action occurs at the vertices. Entry into the host cell is initiated by the knob domain of the fiber protein binding to the cell receptor. The two currently established receptors are: CD46 for the group B human adenovirus serotypes and the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) for all other serotypes. There are some reports suggesting MHC molecules and sialic acid residues functioning in this capacity as well. This {{is followed by a}} secondary interaction, where a motif in the penton base protein interacts with an integrin molecule. It is the co-receptor interaction that stimulates entry of the adenovirus. This co-receptor molecule is αv integrin. Binding to αv integrin results in endocytosis of the virus particle via clathrin-coated pits. Attachment to αv integrin stimulates cell signaling and thus induces actin polymerization resulting in entry of the virion into the host cell within an endosome.|$|E

40|$|Initiation <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> DNA {{replication}} {{in vitro}} occurs on a linearized plasmid DNA containing 3, 327 base pairs <b>of</b> the <b>adenovirus</b> terminal sequence. Various deletions {{have been constructed}} in the plasmid DNA and their template activities examined. Deletions from an internal restriction enzyme cleavage site that retain only 20 base pairs or more <b>of</b> the <b>adenovirus</b> terminal sequence support initiation and limited chain elongation, whereas deletions that leave 14 base pairs or less of the terminal sequence do not. On the other hand, all deletions extending from the very terminus <b>of</b> the <b>adenovirus</b> DNA destroy the template activity. The terminal 20 base pairs <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> DNA contain a sequence A-T-A-A-T-A-T-A-C-C, which is perfectly conserved in the DNAs from different serotypes <b>of</b> human <b>adenovirus.</b> Base changes within the conserved sequence greatly reduce the template activity.

50|$|Titi monkey {{adenovirus}} (TMAdV) is an adenovirus first {{identified in}} a New World titi monkey {{of the genus}} Callicebus, and the virus also infected to at least two humans. It is a large DNA-based virus which can cause death in monkeys, and respiratory illness has been recorded in humans. It was first discovered in Davis, California, at the California National Primate Research Center. The discovery of TMAdV {{was made by the}} laboratory of Charles Chiu and the UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, using a DNA microarray test called the ViroChip that is able to detect all known as well as novel viruses. The virus is genetically different from any other adenovirus, and the origin or reservoir for TMAdV is still unknown. The significance of the discovery {{lies in the fact that}} adenovirus infections have always been thought to be species-specific, and the existence <b>of</b> <b>adenoviruses</b> that can infect both monkeys and humans raises the possibility of zoonotic transmission <b>of</b> <b>adenoviruses.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{replication}} <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> type 5 DNA occurs by discontinuous {{chain propagation}} via short pieces of DNA.

40|$|The {{efficient}} uptake <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> into {{a target}} cell {{is a function}} <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> capsid proteins and their interaction with the host cell. The capsid protein fiber mediates high-affinity attachment <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> to the target cell. Although the cellular receptor(s) for adenovirus is unknown, evidence indicates that a single receptor does not function as the attachment site {{for each of the}} 49 different serotypes <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus.</b> Sequence variation <b>of</b> the fiber ligand, particularly in the C- terminal knob domain, is associated with serotype-specific binding specificity. Additionally, this domain of fiber functions as a major serotype determinant. Fiber involvement in cell targeting and its function as a target of the host immune response make the fiber gene an attractive target for manipulation, both from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> biology and from the perspective <b>of</b> using <b>adenovirus</b> vectors for gene transfer experiments. We have constructed a defective chimeric adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) reporter virus by replacing the Ad 5 fiber gene with the fiber gene from Ad 7 A. Using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, we have characterized this virus with respect to infectivity both in vitro and in vivo. We have also characterized the role of antifiber antibody in the host neutralizing immune response to adenovirus infection. Our studies demonstrate that exchange of fiber is a strategy that will be useful in characterizing receptor tropism for different serotypes <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus.</b> Additionally, the neutralizing immune response to Ad 5 and Ad 7 does not differentiate between two viruses that differ only in their fiber proteins. Therefore, following a primary adenovirus inoculation, antibodies generated against fiber do not constitute a significant fraction of the neutralizing antibody population...|$|R
50|$|RNA {{splicing}} {{was discovered}} in the late 1970s through the study <b>of</b> <b>adenoviruses</b> that invade mammals and replicate inside them. Researchers identified RNA molecules that contained sequences from noncontiguous parts of the virus’s genome.

Using minigenes as a splice reporting vector to explore the effects of RNA splicing regulation naturally followed and remains the major use of minigenes to date.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used group <b>of</b> <b>adenoviruses</b> is serotype 5 (Ad5), whose binding to host cells is initiated by interactions between the cellular coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), and the knob domain of the adenovirus coat protein trimer. CAR is necessary for adenovirus infection. Although expressed widely in epithelial cells, CAR expression in tumours is extremely variable, leading to resistance to Ad5 infection. Retargeting of Ad5 from CAR, to another receptor that is ubiquitously expressed on cancer cells, may overcome this resistance.|$|E

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} potential <b>of</b> oncolytic <b>adenoviruses</b> {{is limited}} by the rate <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> release. Based on the observation that several viruses induce cell death and progeny release by disrupting intracellular calcium homeostasis, we hypothesized that the alteration in intracellular calcium concentration induced by verapamil could improve the rate of virus release and spread, eventually enhancing the antitumoral activity <b>of</b> oncolytic <b>adenoviruses.</b> Our results indicate that verapamil substantially enhanced the release <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> from a variety of cell types resulting in an improved cell-to-cell spread and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the combination of the systemic administration <b>of</b> an oncolytic <b>adenovirus</b> (ICOVIR- 5) with verapamil in vivo greatly improved its antitumoral activity in two different tumor xenograft models without affecting the selectivity of this virus. Overall, our findings indicate that verapamil provides a new, safe, and versatile way to improve the antitumoral potency <b>of</b> oncolytic <b>adenoviruses</b> in the clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|Retrovirus {{infection}} is normally limited to cells {{within a specific}} host range which express a cognate receptor that is recognized by {{the product of the}} env gene. We describe retrovirus infection of cells outside of their normal host range when the {{infection is}} performed in the presence <b>of</b> a replication-defective <b>adenovirus</b> (dl 312). In the presence <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus,</b> several different ecotropic vectors are shown to infect human cell lines (HeLa and PLC/PRF), and a xenotropic vector is shown to infect murine cells (NIH 3 T 3). Infectivity is demonstrated by 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) staining, selection with G 418 for neomycin resistance, and PCR identification of the provirus in infected cells. Infectivity is quantitatively dependent upon both the concentration <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> (10 (6) to 10 (8) PFU/ml) and the concentration of retrovirus. Infection requires the simultaneous presence <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> in the retrovirus infection medium and is not stimulated by preincubation and removal <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> from the cells before retrovirus infection. The presence <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> is shown to enhance the uptake of fluorescently labeled retrovirus particles into cells outside of their normal host range, demonstrating that the adenovirus enhances viral entry into cells {{in the absence of the}} recognized cognate receptor.

40|$|Adeno-associated {{satellite}} virus type 4 {{interferes with the}} replication <b>of</b> its helper <b>adenovirus.</b> No interferon-like soluble substance could be detected in satellite-infected cultures and other DNA- and RNA-containing viruses were not inhibited by coinfection with {{satellite virus}} under conditions which reduced adenovirus yields by more than 90 % in monkey cells. Altering the concentration <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> {{in the presence of}} constant amounts of satellite resulted in a constant degree of interference over a wide range <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> inocula and suggested that adenovirus concentration was not a significant factor in the observed interference. The interference with adenovirus replication was abolished by pretreating satellite preparations with specific antiserum, ultraviolet light or heating at 80 °C for 30 min. This suggested that infectious satellite virus mediated the interference. Satellite virus concentration was found to be a determinant of interference and studies indicated that the amount <b>of</b> interference with <b>adenovirus</b> was directly proportional to the concentration of satellite virus. 8 hr after adenovirus infection, the replication <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> was no longer sensitive to satellite interference. This was true even though the satellite virus was enhanced as effectively as if the cells were infected simultaneously with both viruses. Interference with adenovirus infectivity was accompanied by reduced yields of complement-fixing antigen and of virus particles which suggested that satellite virus interfered with the formation and not the function <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> products. When cells were infected either with adenovirus alone or with adenovirus plus satellite, the same proportion of cells plated as adenovirus infectious centers. However, the number of plaque-forming units <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> formed per cell in the satellite-infected cultures was reduced by approximately 90 %, the same magnitude of reduction noted in whole cultures coinfected with satellite and adenovirus.
