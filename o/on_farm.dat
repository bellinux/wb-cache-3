It was run by the Anglican Nuns, the Order of St Margaret, East Grinstead who remained in charge until 1978 when they left South Africa in protest against apartheid. The Main Block, Boys' House and Priests' House were designed by the diocesan architect F.L.H. Flemming.

5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E

The Auditorium is <b>on</b> <b>Farm</b> Lane and the north bank of the river, in the heart of campus.

The Wharton Center features Broadway plays and other performances, and was the site the 1992 U.S. presidential election debates. The university also has its own hotel/convention center, the Kellogg Center.|$|E
40|$|In Rwanda, trees <b>on</b> <b>farms</b> {{are widely}} {{recognized}} for increasing and diversifying farm productivity while releasing pressure on existing forests. However, {{the motivation of}} rural households to plant trees <b>on</b> <b>farms</b> is often unclear. This study evaluates rural households demographic and socio-economic characteristics, {{as well as their}} attitudes, that influence the presence of trees <b>on</b> <b>farms.</b> Data used in this study were collected from a survey of 480 households across three altitude regions of Rwanda. Binary logistic regression analysis using PASW Statistics was applied to determine relevant predictor variables for the presence of trees <b>on</b> <b>farms.</b> The results show regional variation in explaining the presence of trees <b>on</b> <b>farms.</b> When data from the three regions were analysed together, significant predictor variables comprise the gender of head of the household, the number of salaried members of the households, the amount of farm fuelwood, the number of meals per day, the geographical location of the households and the selling of tree products. The presence of different tree species <b>on</b> <b>farms</b> was driven by economic factors, of which availability of food, firewood, and poles, and total income were most common. The results of the study imply that policy measures that target food security and income diversification in rural areas may, at the same time, enhance tree planting. Moreover, it is concluded that rural development and extension in agriculture should be site specific, to account for biophysical conditions and specific rural household motivations to plant trees <b>on</b> <b>farms...</b>|$|R

25|$|The tariff {{issue was}} pulling the GOP apart. Roosevelt tried to {{postpone}} the issue, but Taft had to meet it head on in 1909 with the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act. Eastern conservatives led by Nelson W. Aldrich wanted high tariffs on manufactured goods (especially woolens), while Midwesterners called for low tariffs. Aldrich tricked them by lowering the tariff <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> products, which outraged the farmers. Insurgent Midwesterners led by George Norris revolted against the conservatives led by Speaker Cannon. The Democrats won control of the House in 1910 as the rift between insurgents and conservatives widened.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels. One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.|$|E

A study done by Brown (1999) found that small mammal population density and diversity did not depend <b>on</b> <b>farming</b> practices, however overall activity was higher <b>on</b> organic <b>farms.</b> It was concluded that more food resources were available to small mammals <b>on</b> organic <b>farms</b> because of the reduction or lack of herbicides and pesticides. Another study conducted by Wickramasinghe et al. (2003) compared bat species and activity. Species activity and foraging were both more than double <b>on</b> organic <b>farms</b> compared to conventional farms. Species richness was also higher <b>on</b> organic <b>farms,</b> and 2 of the sixteen species sighted were found only <b>on</b> organic <b>farms.</b>|$|R

25|$|The two eland {{species are}} now semi-domesticated as their docile dispositions, large {{quantities}} of meat, and resilience in Africa's harsh environments has made them ideal alternatives to cattle in some parts in Africa. In a 2014 comparison between the quality of meat from common eland and cattle, {{it was found that}} the meat from male elands was low-fat and more beneficial for human nutritional health but it lacks the sensory texture and flavor that makes cattle meat so appealing to consumers. In addition to being <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> as exotic lifestock, eland as well as the other species of spiral-horned antelope have also been brought to private game reserves across the planet (in particular parts in North America and Africa) for recreational hunting. Unlike eland however, most of the other species are not as docile or tolerant of humans as they avoid any contact as possible.|$|E
25|$|The WTO is {{attempting}} to complete negotiations on the Doha Development Round, which was launched in 2001 with an explicit focus on developing countries. , {{the future of the}} Doha Round remained uncertain: the work programme lists 21 subjects in which the original deadline of 1 January 2005 was missed, and the round is still incomplete. The conflict between free trade on industrial goods and services but retention of protectionism <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> subsidies to domestic agricultural sector (requested by developed countries) and the substantiation of fair trade on agricultural products (requested by developing countries) remain the major obstacles. This impasse has made it impossible to launch new WTO negotiations beyond the Doha Development Round. As a result, there have been an increasing number of bilateral free trade agreements between governments. As of July 2012, there were various negotiation groups in the WTO system for the current agricultural trade negotiation which is in the condition of stalemate.|$|E
