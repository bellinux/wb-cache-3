The color fastness to washing <b>of</b> the <b>ramie</b> fabrics treated with noble metal nanoparticles was evaluated. The ramie fabrics were washed for 45  min {{in the presence of}} ECE reference detergent at 50  °C under each washing cycle. The color differences (ΔE) <b>of</b> the <b>ramie</b> fabrics before and after washing are shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 5. The visible color difference <b>of</b> silver nanoparticle-treated <b>ramie</b> fabrics after the first washing cycle was found with ΔE of 5.2 (Additional file 1 : Figure S 5). However, the average ΔE value of fabrics treated with silver nanoparticles did not increased notably with further increase in number of washing cycles. Compared with silver nanoparticle-treated ramie fabrics, the gold nanoparticle-treated ramie fabrics showed very good washing color fastness. The average ΔE value of fabrics treated with gold nanoparticles was 2.0 after first washing cycle (Additional file 1 : Figure S 5), which corresponds to the gray scale rating of 4. The color difference of gold nanoparticle-treated fabrics changed slightly and remained stable as the number of washing cycles increased, which indicates that the ramie fabrics colored by in situ synthesized gold nanoparticles exhibited good washing color fastness.|$|R
50|$|Despite its strength, ramie has {{had limited}} {{acceptance}} for textile use.

Spinning the fiber is made difficult by its brittle quality and low elasticity; and weaving is complicated by the hairy surface of the yarn, resulting from lack of cohesion between the fibers.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study investigates the effects of {{electron}} beam(EB) irradiation on the chemical and mor-phological properties <b>of</b> Hansan <b>ramie</b> fiber. Hansan ramie fibers were irradiated with electron beam doses of 0, 1, 3, 5 and 10 kGy. The effect of electron beam irradiation on the chemical components of fibers as well as the surface chemical and morphological properties were investigated using chemical component analysis methods based on TAPPI standards, XPS, and SEM. The results indicate that the surface layers can be removed under suitable EB irradiation doses. Alcohol-benzene extraction and lignin content increases gradually with an increase in EB irradiation and reaching a maximum at an EB dose of 3 kGy, and decreases at 10 kGy. The surface chemical changes measured by XPS corresponded to the chem-ical composition analysis results. The C 1 peak and the O/C ratio decreased with the removal of the multi-layer and pri-mary layer by EB irradiation. The SEM images show the inter-fibrillar structure etched by EB irradiation up to 5 kGy. At 10 kGy, the surface structure <b>of</b> the <b>ramie</b> fiber shows highly aligned and distinctive striations in a longitudinal direction.

Although previous studies have constructed a complex regulatory network model for Arabidopsis in vitro organogenesis, no related study has been reported in ramie. To generate more complete observations of transcriptome content and dynamics during ramie in vitro organogenesis, we constructed a reference transcriptome library and ten digital gene expression (DGE) libraries for illumina sequencing. Approximately 111. 34 million clean reads were obtained for transcriptome and the DGE libraries generated between 13. 5 and 18. 8 million clean reads. De novo assembly produced 43, 222 unigenes and a total of 5, 760 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered.

Furthermore, the auxin and cytokinin related genes have distinct expression patterns in two ramie cultivars with high or extremely low shoot regeneration ability, which has given us a better understanding of the in vitro organogenesis mechanism.
