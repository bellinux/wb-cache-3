40|$|Resume A {{topic of}} the thesis {{presented}} is a problem <b>of</b> <b>evidences</b> used in the civil procedures. This is a very imporant part of a civil procedure, because evidences are - from a practical point of view - the crucial stage of a procedure. Right by means <b>of</b> <b>evidences</b> the Court may obtain factual and material information serving a base for a meritory decision. This work is aimed {{to an analysis of}} the present legislative definition of the various types <b>of</b> <b>evidences,</b> the specific features of them, and a way of an implementation and the following assesment of them made by the Court of Justice. This thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter contains a brief definition of a term <b>of</b> the <b>evidence.</b> The second chapter is structuted in more details. This chapter is engaged in a term <b>of</b> an <b>evidence</b> and the types <b>of</b> <b>evidences.</b> It also specifies a fact, what is a subject <b>of</b> an <b>evidence</b> and which facts do not present a fact <b>of</b> <b>evidences.</b> A base <b>of</b> the third chapter is an analysis of a list of the types <b>of</b> demonstrative <b>evidences</b> as it results the actual legistration. It is also engaged in the problem <b>of</b> an inquiry <b>evidence</b> and an acceptibility of it. In a conclusion of this chapter a inquiring duty of a party of the procedure is mentioned as a special case <b>of</b> the inquire <b>evidence.</b> The fourth chapter represents a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} the Evidence Verification Algorithm (EVA) in this paper, which verifies consistency of life cycles <b>of</b> ev-idences (<b>evidence</b> documents) in workflow diagrams. We used the AIST Workflow Language (AWL) as the syntax for workflow diagrams, which has {{additional information about}} evidences. A workflow diagram of AWL {{is essentially the same}} as a Unified Modeling Language (UML) activity dia-gram. EVA verifies the existence of consistent sequences of flows between the occurrences <b>of</b> <b>evidences</b> in a workflow diagram. It is important to verify consistency of life cycles <b>of</b> <b>evidences,</b> since some defects in the workflow diagram itself can be found by checking inconsistent life cycles <b>of</b> <b>evidences</b> in a workflow diagram...|$|R

5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing to a lack <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling {{of the case and}} deliberate destruction <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E

40|$|MD 5 and SHA- 1 {{cryptographic}} hash algorithms are a standard practice in digital forensics {{that is used}} in the preservation <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> and ensuring the integrity <b>of</b> the digital <b>evidence.</b> Recent studies have shown that both MD 5 and SHA- 1 have vulnerabilities and collisions. Based on this, the use of MD 5 and SHA- 1 hash algorithms in the practice of digital forensics to preserve and ensure the integrity <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> has been questioned in certain instances. Using experimentation, the researcher proves the validity of using either MD 5 or SHA- 1 hashing algorithms to ensure the integrity <b>of</b> seized digital <b>evidence,</b> from the moment of seizure <b>of</b> the <b>evidence,</b> through to eventual presentation and use <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> in court; thus demonstrating that the use of hashing remains a valid forensic methodology to ensure the integrity <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence.</b> Keywords Digital forensics, integrity <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence,</b> hash collisions, MD 5, SHA- 1, manipulation <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence.</b> 1...|$|R
