50|$|Cold sizing, {{like all}} other cold forming processes, has a hot process counterpart. In {{addition}} to semi-finished parts, cold forming may be used on metal stock, sheet, <b>bar,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> stock. Cold sizing can be performed on various metals, both ferrous and non-ferrous, and even materials like polymers and plastics. Sizing is related to other squeezing operations like swaging, coining, hobbing, staking and riveting, thread rolling, and extruding.|$|R

50|$|From 1982 to 1983, the Luxembourg steel {{industry}} was restructured and the Luxembourg government {{invested heavily in}} ARBED, finally owning 42.9% of the company's shares. Furthermore, during the following two decades, ARBED developed its international activities {{as well as its}} production of long steel products (steel <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> produced for a variety of uses such as building and bridge construction) and electric arc furnace steel while reducing its domestic steel-producing operations.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, a novel {{approach}} for optimization of finite element modeling (FEM) of lossy piezoelectric elements has been proposed. Procedure of optimization has consisted in sequential and iterative application of FEM and piezoelectric resonance analysis to complex electric impedance spectra of piezoceramic elements. For validation of proposed optimization procedure, FEM calculations of standard shape piezoelements (disks, shear plates, <b>bars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods)</b> made from porous PZT-type piezoceramics were fulfilled using FEM ANSYS software package...|$|R

5000|$|Busbars are {{produced}} {{in a variety}} of shapes such as flat strips, solid <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> typically copper, brass or aluminium in solid or hollow tubes. Some of these shapes allow heat to dissipate more efficiently due to their high surface area to cross-sectional area ratio. The skin effect makes 50-60 Hz AC busbars more than about 8 mm thickness inefficient, so hollow or flat shapes are prevalent in higher current applications. A hollow section also has higher stiffness than a solid rod of equivalent current-carrying capacity, which allows a greater span between busbar supports in outdoor electrical switchyards.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> to reduce {{surfaces}} and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bars</b> <b>and</b> {{clubs that}} use cover charges {{use them for}} several reasons. In some cases, popular <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> clubs have a {{substantial}} excess demand; patrons are lined up outside the club waiting to get in. In this case, the club can gain additional revenue from customers by requiring an entrance charge. <b>Other</b> <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> clubs use cover charges only on nights when there is live entertainment or a DJ, {{to cover the costs}} of hiring the performers.|$|R

50|$|Lisco {{is among}} the largest {{companies}} in Libya, having an annual production capacity of approximately 1,324,000 tons of liquid steel. Lisco’s operations are primarily supplied by imported iron ore pellets from Brazil, Canada, and Sweden for use as raw materials. Natural gas is used to manufacture sponge iron and hot briquetted iron. Hot-briquetted iron (HBI) became a significant Libyan mineral export since the LISCO II plant began producing it in 1997. About 54% of Lisco’s exports (by weight) in 2000 was HBI. <b>Bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> shipped to Egypt and Tunisia accounted for about 23% of the company’s exports. Lisco has its own captive port with specialized facilities, such as a telescopic ship-loading conveyor for loading HBI into ships. The conveying system extends from the HBI plant to the port, about 1,500 meters away.|$|R
