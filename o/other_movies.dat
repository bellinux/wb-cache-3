5|$|Though {{during the}} 1970s most of Sierra Highway was {{bypassed}} by freeways and expressways, the old two-lane road remained a famous roadway. In 1971, Steven Spielberg {{made his first}} feature-length film, Duel, along Sierra Highway, near Acton. The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck's game. It prominently shows the desert portions of Sierra Highway. With Duels status, one of the trucks used in the film {{is still on the}} road and {{in the process of being}} restored. The current owner has driven the truck along Sierra Highway for nostalgia, enjoying the terrified looks he receives from passing motorists who recognize it. <b>Other</b> <b>movies</b> have since been filmed in the vicinity, including scenes in The Terminator.|$|E

5|$|While Aronofsky's <b>other</b> <b>movies</b> have evoked {{significant}} emotional response, {{they were}} still far from the turmoil aroused by Noah. It was screened {{for the first time}} on March 28, 2014, and despite its PG-13 rating, it has quickly been recognized by Box Office Mojo as one of the most controversial movies of the last 35 years along with such titles as The Passion of the Christ or The Da Vinci Code. Noah has been banned in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Indonesia on religious grounds with other countries following suit.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{also wanted}} the {{lighting}} to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured {{the physics of}} being underwater with Finding Nemo and so for WALL-E, he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's <b>other</b> <b>movies</b> had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, lens flare, and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70mm camera, {{and then trying to}} replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.|$|E
