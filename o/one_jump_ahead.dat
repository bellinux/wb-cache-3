2500|$|... 'Mad Song' {{is often}} {{regarded}} as Blake's first satire. Harold Bloom, who feels {{it is the}} most [...] "Blakean" [...] poem in Poetical Sketches refers to it as an [...] "intellectual satire" [...] on both the concept of mad songs (six of which appeared in Percy's Antiques, which describes madness as being a peculiarly English theme) and the world which the singer seeks to leave. Frye is also an admirer of the poem and argues that [...] "a maddened world of storm and tempest is the objective counterpart of madness in the human mind; and the madman is mad because he is locked up in his own Selfhood or inside, and cannot bear to see anything. In order to have his world a consistently dark one, he is compelled to rush frantically around the spinning earth forever, keeping <b>one</b> <b>jump</b> <b>ahead</b> of the rising sun, unable even to sleep in his everlasting night." [...] Alexander Lincoln likens the poem to 'Song: [...] "How Sweet I roam'd from field to field"' insofar as both deal with [...] "states of mental captivity described from within." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte de Sauve {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as a source}} of the information that led to the execution of Marguerite de Valois's lover Joseph Boniface de La Môle and Annibal de Coconnas for engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the gravely ill Charles IX and the Queen Mother in 1574 with the assistance of Huguenot troops. In 1575, Catherine de' Medici, abetted by her son Henry III, instructed Charlotte to seduce the king's brother, her youngest son, François, Duke of Alençon, with the aim of provoking hostility between the two young men, so that they would not conspire together in the future. Charlotte subsequently became the duke's mistress, creating a rift between the former close friends, as Navarre and Alençon became rivals over Charlotte. According to Marguerite's memoirs: [...] "Charlotte de Sauve treated both of them [...] {{in such a way that}} they became extremely jealous of each other, to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman". Henry of Navarre wrote to a friend: [...] "The court is the strangest I have ever known. We are nearly always ready to cut each other's throat ... All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur [...] and they have forbidden for the third time my mistress [...] to speak to me. They have such a hold on her that she does not dare look at me. I am waiting for a minor battle, for they say they will kill me, and I want to be <b>one</b> <b>jump</b> <b>ahead</b> of them". On one occasion, Henry III had Alençon's papers searched for evidence of political plotting but turned up only a declaration of love from Madame de Sauve.|$|E

Equation (13) guarantees that at least <b>one</b> vehicle must <b>jump</b> <b>ahead</b> in the FA entrance sequence (see Inman 2003). Equation (14) is written to satisfy capacity constraint.

Not all the spare vehicles in the buffer may be released to the FA entrance sequence as seen in Eq. (15). Lastly, Eqs. (16 – 17) present the variable types used in the model.|$|R
50|$|Kirk, {{following}} a logical premise from Spock, surmises {{that the true}} source of Apollo's power {{may be in the}} act of sacrifice, which Apollo admits his race had never considered in all their centuries of forced worship from humans. The chief crew now agree to place Apollo on a planet with humanoid forms, at the approximate level of Earth's 14th century. After a humorous vignette with Kirk and McCoy teasing Spock about whether Apollo's race would have found the unemotional Vulcans to be as worthy of their attention as humans, the story <b>jumps</b> <b>one</b> year <b>ahead,</b> showing Apollo aiding the natives, with the last shot of him looking much younger, and without gray hair.|$|R

He remembered that Jimmy Skunk's old house was near, and he reached it just <b>one</b> <b>jump</b> <b>ahead</b> of Old Man Coyote.|$|E
60|$|I saw him steal a {{chunk of}} moose-meat from Major Dinwiddie’s cache so heavy that he could just keep <b>one</b> <b>jump</b> <b>ahead</b> of Mrs. Dinwiddie’s squaw cook, who was after him with an axe. As he went up the hill, after the squaw gave up, Major Dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his Winchester into the landscape. He emptied his {{magazine}} twice, and never touched that Spot. Then a policeman came along and arrested him for discharging firearms inside the city limits. Major Dinwiddie paid his fine, and Steve and I paid him for the moose-meat {{at the rate of}} a dollar a pound, bones and all. That was what he paid for it. Meat was high that year.|$|E
60|$|We rode through endless {{thickets}} of yellow-pollened cassi--if riding {{it could}} be called; for those fragrant thickets were inhabited by wasps. And such wasps! Great yellow fellows the size of small canary birds, darting through the air with behind them drifting a bunch of legs {{a couple of inches}} long. A stallion abruptly stands on his forelegs and thrusts his hind legs skyward. He withdraws them from the sky long enough to make <b>one</b> wild <b>jump</b> <b>ahead,</b> and then returns them to their index position. It is nothing. His thick hide has merely been punctured by a flaming lance of wasp virility. Then a second and a third stallion, and all the stallions, begin to cavort on their forelegs over the precipitous landscape. Swat! A white-hot poniard penetrates my cheek. Swat again!! I am stabbed in the neck. I am bringing up the rear and getting more than my share. There is no retreat, and the plunging horses ahead, on a precarious trail, promise little safety. My horse overruns Charmian's horse, and that sensitive creature, fresh-stung at the psychological moment, planks one of his hoofs into my horse and the other hoof into me. I thank my stars that he is not steel-shod, and half-arise from the saddle at the impact of another flaming dagger. I am certainly getting more than my share, and so is my poor horse, whose pain and panic are only exceeded by mine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Linear {{recurring}} sequences {{with very}} large periods {{are widely used}} as the basic building block of pseudorandom number generators. In many simulation applications, multiple streams of random numbers are needed, and these multiple streams are normally provided by <b>jumping</b> <b>ahead</b> in the sequence to obtain starting points that are far apart. For maximal-period generators having a large state space, this <b>jumping</b> <b>ahead</b> can be costly in both time and memory usage. We propose a new <b>jump</b> <b>ahead</b> method {{for this kind of}} situation. It requires much less memory than the fastest algorithms proposed earlier, while being approximately as fast (or faster) for generators with a large state space such as the Mersenne twister. ...|$|R
