25|$|Upon landing, the 737 {{collided}} with the twin-engine turboprop, continued down the runway with the turboprop crushed beneath it, exited the runway, and caught fire. All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, {{as well as an}} eventual total of 23 out of the 89 passengers on the Boeing. Rescue workers were on the scene of the fire within minutes and began the evacuation of the plane. Because of the intense fire, three of the 737's six exits could not be used. Neither of the front exits were usable, which caused the front passengers to try to use the <b>overwing</b> exits. However, only one of the <b>overwing</b> exits was usable, which caused a backlog to form. Most of those who died aboard the 737 succumbed to asphyxiation in the post-crash fire.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} an incomplete market model with one traded stock and two correlated Brownian motions W, <b>over(W,</b> ̃). The Brownian motion W drives the stock price, whose volatility and Sharpe ratio are {{adapted to the}} filtration over(F, ̃) {colon equals} (over(F, ̃) t) 0 ≤ t ≤ T generated by <b>over(W,</b> ̃). We show that the projections of the minimal entropy and minimal martingale measures onto over(F, ̃) T are related by an Esscher transform involving the correlation between W, <b>over(W,</b> ̃), and the mean-variance trade-off process. The result leads to a new formula for the marginal exponential utility-based price of an over(F, ̃) T-measurable European claim. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Interseismic tectonic motion {{manifests itself}} as a long (10 ’s to 100 ’s km) {{wavelength}} signal. The magnitude {{and the extent of}} the signal is crucial to understand kinematics of the crustal motion. For two decades, GPS measurements have been the main source of information for observing such a signal. In this study we use Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) observations, which provides better spatial resolution, to monitor tectonic signal <b>overWest</b> Anatolia. The region is characterized by horstgraben morphology which is controlled by oblique-slip normal faults. The faults cause an extension circa 25 - 30 mm/yr in NE-SW direction as observed by sparse GPS network measurements. In our analysis, we have used 42 ERS images acquired between 1992 and 2001 years. We have identified coherent interferograms which would reduce the noise level in the rural areas leading to increased point density. Finally we compare our PSI results with two other GPS studies within the region. The modeled interseismic signal from a recent GPS study ([1]) agrees with the one modeled from that of PSI observations in trend direction. Mathematical Geodesy and Positionin...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a 25 -year {{regional}} {{climate model}} run <b>overWest</b> Africa is evaluated and examined {{with respect to}} causes of interannual rainfall variability related to the West African Monsoon. West African rainfall has been subject to strong interannual and decadal variability throughout the past 50 years. Known driving forces for this variability are large-scale changes in Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs), variability due to global atmospheric circulation changes, like for instance variability related to El Ni˜no-Southern Oscillation, but also regional and local-scale changes in land use and vegetation cover. The interaction of these impact factors with West African synoptic and subsynoptic processes is still not completely understood. One reason for this lack of knowledge is that basic features of West African climate, including the African Easterly Jet (AEJ), African Easterly Waves (AEWs) as well as monsoon dynamics, are very complex multiscale phenomena. Climate modeling in West Africa requires the ability to simulate these effects, {{which can only be}} achieved by mesoscale atmospheric models. Using the regional climate model REMO from the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, a 25 -year dynamical downscaling study was undertaken in order to evaluate a tool, which will then be used for the examination of causes of rainfall variability in West Africa. The model was used on a 0. 5 ◦ grid over North Africa northward of 15 ◦S. The model evaluation leads to some confidence in the reliability of the modeled climate. A detailed examination of composites of selected wet and dry years in the Guinean coast region elucidates the role of SST forcing and external atmospheric forcing for interannual rainfall variability. In general, abundant monsoonal rainfall comes along with warm tropical Atlantic SSTs, enhanced latent heat fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere and stronger surface wind convergence near the Guinean Coast. This is accompanied by large-scale dynamical changes in strength and direction of both the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) over the Indian Ocean and the Subtropical Jet (STJ) over the Near East and the Caucasian region. ...|$|R
25|$|The captain {{escaped from}} the {{aircraft}} through the left sliding window. 18 people {{escaped from the}} aircraft from the left <b>overwing</b> exit. 13 persons got out through the left main boarding door. 4 people jumped from the right service door. The rear jumpseat flight attendant and a passenger died from smoke inhalation in the DC-9's tailcone; the tailcone release was not activated, and later investigation determined that the tailcone release mechanism was mechanically inoperable.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-one Canadians and two Americans died. Many of {{the bodies}} were burned beyond recognition. Almost all {{of the victims were}} in the forward half of the {{aircraft}} between the wings and the cockpit. Some bodies were in the aisles, and some bodies were still in the seats. Two victims were {{in the back of the}} aircraft, even though the passengers were moved forward after the fire had been detected; the disoriented passengers moved beyond the <b>overwing</b> exits and succumbed. The blood samples from the bodies revealed high levels of cyanide, fluoride, and carbon monoxide, chemicals produced by the burning plane.|$|E
25|$|The airline's main fleet, {{comprising}} Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft, {{carry up}} to 156 and 180/186 passengers respectively, depending on layout. A typical Airbus A319 carries approximately 140 passengers {{in a single}} class configuration, but as the airline does not serve meals on its shorter flights, it opted for smaller galleys and had a lavatory installed in unused space {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. The space saved by having smaller galleys allowed for the installation of 156 seats. Due to this seating arrangement, to satisfy safety requirements the airline's Airbus A319 aircraft have two pairs of <b>overwing</b> exits, instead of the standard one-pair configuration found on most Airbus A319 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Sullenberger {{opened the}} cockpit door and ordered evacuation. The crew began {{evacuating}} the passengers through the four <b>overwing</b> window exits and into an inflatable slide/raft deployed {{from the front}} right passenger door (the front left slide failed to operate, so the manual inflation handle was pulled). A panicked passenger opened a rear door, which a flight attendant was unable to reseal. Water was also entering {{a hole in the}} fuselage and through cargo doors that had come open, so as the water rose the attendant urged passengers to move forward by climbing over seats. One passenger was in a wheelchair. Finally, Sullenberger walked the cabin twice to confirm it was empty.|$|E
25|$|Drawing on {{experience}} from the Panavia Tornado, the AMX {{is equipped with}} a hybrid flight control system; a fly-by-wire control system is employed to operate flight control surfaces such as the spoilers, rudder and variable incidence tailplane, while the ailerons and elevators are actuated via a dual-redundant hydraulic system. Manual reversion is provided for the ailerons, elevator and rudder to allow the aircraft to be flown even in the event of complete hydraulic failure; either control system can act independent of one another. The wing is fitted with both leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps and <b>overwing</b> spoilers ahead of the flaps. The spoilers can function as airbrakes and to negate lift; improving take-off and landing performance as well as manoeuvrability during flight.|$|E
500|$|The {{cabin crew}} started the evacuation, {{even before the}} plane {{had come to a}} halt, via both forward galley doors, both rear doors and the {{starboard}} <b>overwing</b> exits. Eighteen passengers escaped via the <b>overwing</b> exits before the fire grew too intense to use that route. The forward port galley door escape slide caught fire before it could be used, but one person jumped from there. 84 people escaped via the starboard galley door. Three of the crew escaped by the emergency cockpit rope. The rear starboard door escape slide had twisted on deployment, so Steward Taylor climbed down to straighten it, leaving stewardess Jane Harrison at the door assisting the passengers. Six passengers escaped via this route before the slide was punctured and deflated. Harrison encouraged the passengers to jump, and pushed out those too frightened to do so. 11 people escaped via this route, and five more escaped via the rear port door before the slide was destroyed. Harrison was last seen alive preparing to jump herself, but then she turned back and disappeared into the burning fuselage in an attempt to save the remaining four female passengers, including a disabled woman and eight-year-old girl. It was these actions which led to the award of the George Cross posthumously [...] to Harrison in recognition of her selfless gallantry. 35 people were injured, and five killed.|$|E

500|$|While superficially {{similar to}} the later F-117, the Have Blue prototypes were smaller aircraft, about one quarter {{the weight of the}} F-117, with a wing sweep of 72.5° and inward-canted {{vertical}} tails (inverse V-tail). Radar-absorbent material (RAM), developed in a Lockheed laboratory, were applied to the aircraft's flat surfaces – for the windscreen, special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics. The aircraft's gross weight of 9,200–12,500lb (4,173–5,669kg) enabled the aircraft to use the landing gear from the Northrop F-5 fighter. The aircraft's powerplants were two [...] General Electric J85-GE-4As of the T-2C Buckeye. Because stealth took precedence above all else, the aircraft was inherently unstable. As a result, a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system was integrated into the aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics. The flight control system was borrowed from the F-16. The <b>overwing</b> engine inlet was covered by a low-RCS grid; during takeoffs, when more air is needed, blow-in doors were constructed at the upper fuselage to admit additional airflow.|$|E

2500|$|British gun {{synchronization}} {{got off to}} a quick {{but rather}} shaky start.

Significantly, getting their synchronized guns to work was considered one of the less pressing matters for No. 56 squadron in March 1917, busy getting their new S.E.5 fighters combat worthy before they went to France, since they had the <b>overwing</b> Lewis to fall back on!

For the A321neo, the additional passenger count is enabled through a rearrangement of the exits. While initial A321neo examples share the same exit door configuration as the A321ceo (four exit doors on each side), future examples will permanently delete doors R2 and L2 (forward of the wings) to permit a maximum configuration of 240 seats with two <b>overwing</b> exits replacing doors R2 and L2, and a relocation of doors R3 and L3 (aft of the wings) four frames back. Less dense configurations will also permit the deactivation of either doors R3 and L3 (replaced with a plug; maximum 195 seat configuration) or both doors R3 and L3 and one <b>overwing</b> exit (replaced with plugs; maximum 165 seat configuration).

2500|$|When the Germans {{switched}} to performing their attacks during nighttime, the Camel proved {{capable of being}} flown at night as well. Accordingly, those aircraft assigned to home defence squadrons were quickly modified with navigation lights in order that they could serve as night fighters. A smaller number of Camels were more extensively reconfigured; on these aircraft, the Vickers machine guns were replaced by <b>overwing</b> Lewis guns and the cockpit was moved rearwards so the pilot could reload the guns. This modification, which {{became known as the}} [...] "Sopwith Comic" [...] allowed the guns to be fired without affecting the pilot's night vision, and allowed the use of new, more effective incendiary ammunition that was considered unsafe to fire from synchronised Vickers guns.|$|E
2500|$|BAC also {{proposed}} clearing the <b>overwing</b> hardpoints for carriage of weapons {{as well as}} drop tanks, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB [...] rockets and [...] of fuel) or [...] bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six [...] bombs or 44 × [...] rockets and 144 × 68mm rockets. The Lightning T.55 was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6. The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. Unfortunately, the Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.|$|E
2500|$|The Lightning F.53, {{otherwise}} known as the Export Lightning, developed as a private venture by BAC; while the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version {{was to have a}} multirole capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.

These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for air-to-ground weaponry, including two [...] bombs or four SNEB rocket pods each carrying 18 68mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.
