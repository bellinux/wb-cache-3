Since the satellites travel at various speeds in their orbits, Saturn arrival time is critical and {{was chosen as}} the design parameter. Arrival times are recommended which afford close satellite encounters and also meet important mission constraints. A design chart illustrates the satellite opportunities as a function of Saturn arrival date. Through the use of such a design chart, the Saturn encounter design process, which will take place according to recommendations by the selected science investigators over the next several years, will be considerably streamlined.

40|$|The DoD needs {{their systems}} to be {{resilient}} {{in the face}} of an ever changing world. To increase resilience in future systems the DoD has created a program called Engineered Resilient Systems. Resilience can be broken down into two parts, mission and platform resilience. Mission resilience is the ability of a system to repel, resist, absorb, and recover from environments and threats that occur on planned missions. Platform resilience is the ability of a system platform to adapt to new missions and new threats. The University of Arkansas department of Industrial Engineering is working for the ERS program researching resilience. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the DoD decided their acquisition decisions need to focus on capability based planning instead of threat based planning. A value-focused thinking multiple objective decision analysis model has been a useful tool for capabilities based assessments. If all performance objectives can be categorized as mission or platform resilience, this extra value above the threshold of the minimum performance can provide mission and platform resilience. This information can be displayed in a value component chart, a floating value component chart, and as a reliance value and <b>opportunity</b> <b>chart.</b> These graphs allow decision makers to consider resilience in the acquisition decision making process...|$|E

The data from energetic particle and plasma measurements are examined {{to obtain the}} position of the OCB for a range of IMF and magnetic disturbance conditions. The Polar observations were taken within two hours of local noon in the spring and fall 1996 and spring 1997. These data were examined for evidence of IMF and solar wind control of the OCB. Some evidence of control was observed in the Polar data. However, the OCB position was found to depend more strongly on the magnetic activity levels than on IMF Bz and solar wind pressure, for example. Examination of the invariant (Λ) and magnetic (λ) latitude of OCB for Bz 3 ̆c 1 gave better results than using the whole data set. For Bz 3 ̆c 1 the OCB Λ ∼ 78. 9 + 0. 38 Bz and examination of the VBz dependence gave Λ ∼ 78. 9 + 1. 023 VBz. The comparison with Kp gave Λ ∼ 80. 2 − 0. 88 Kp.

The book shows that, while there has undeniably been change, there is a surprising degree of continuity in family practices. It casts doubt on claims that families have been subject to a process of dramatic change and provides an alternative account which is based on careful analysis of empirical data. The book presents a unique <b>opportunity</b> to <b>chart</b> the nature of social change in a particular locality over the last 50 years; includes discussions of social and cultural variations in family life, focusing on younger as well as older generations; explores not only what happens within family-households but also what happens within networks of kin across different households and shows the way changing patterns of employment affect kinship networks and how geographical mobility co-exists with the maintenance of strong kinship ties.

40|$|The rapidly {{developing}} {{field of}} transatlantic studies {{has opened up}} new <b>opportunities</b> to <b>chart</b> how ideas fluidly circulated between British and American Romanticism, while also substantially changing in their new American contexts. One such concept was the 2 ̆ 2 book of nature, 2 ̆ 2 {{the idea that the}} physical landscape can be 2 ̆ 2 read 2 ̆ 2 for spiritual meaning as an alternative scripture. While this metaphor was an overarching motif of transatlantic Romanticism, it changed in its new political, national, and aesthetic climate, forging hybridizations of British Romantic concepts of nature. The 1820 s and 1830 s were a particularly fertile period of Anglo-American contact, because these were early decades in the formation of American literary and artistic traditions. The life and career of the landscape painter and poet Thomas Cole (1801 - 1848) provide good examples of transatlantic hybridity: Cole 2 ̆ 7 s views of nature merged his extensive schooling in British Romanticism with specific and local American articulations of landscape. 1 This chapter focuses on Cole 2 ̆ 7 s handling of the book of nature metaphor - best exemplified in one of his most famous landscapes, The Oxbow, - as part of a richly cross-pollinated vision that was indebted to British Romanticism and yet was reinterpreted in distinctively American ways.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{design of}} control charts {{in the presence}} of machine stoppages that are exogenously imposed (as under jidoka practices). Each stoppage creates an opportunity for inspection/repair at reduced cost. We first model a single machine facing opportunities arriving according to a Poisson process, develop the expressions for its operating characteristics and construct the optimization problem for economic design of a control chart. We, then, consider the multiple machine setting where individual machine stoppages may create inspection/repair opportunities for other machines. We develop exact expressions for the cases when all machines are either opportunity-takers or not. On the basis of an approximation for the all-taker case, we then propose an approximate model for the mixed case. In a numerical study, we examine the opportunity taking behavior of machines in both single and multiple machine settings and the impact of such practices on the design of an X̄ - Q C chart.

40|$|This {{collection}} of essays outlines a new political economy. Twenty years after the demise of Soviet state communism, the global recession in which free-market capitalism has plunged the world economy provides a unique <b>opportunity</b> to <b>chart</b> an alternative path. Both the left-wing adulation of centralized statism and the right-wing fetishization of market liberalism {{are part of a}} secular logic that is collapsing under the weight of its own inner contradictions. It is surely no coincidence that the crisis of global capitalism occurs {{at the same time as}} the crisis of secular modernity. Building on the tradition of Catholic social teaching since the groundbreaking encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891), Pope Benedict’s Caritas in veritate is the most radical intervention in contemporary debates on the future of economics, politics, and society. Benedict outlines a Catholic ‘third way’ that combines strict limits on state and market power with a civil economy centered on mutualist businesses, cooperatives, credit unions, and other reciprocal arrangements. By advocating an economic system re-embedded in civil society, the Pope proposes a political economy that transcends the old, secular dichotomies of state vs. market and left vs. right. His call for a civil economy represents a radical ‘middle’ position between an exclusively religious and a strictly secular perspective. Faith can lead to strong notions of the common good and a belief that human behavior, when disciplined and directed, can start to act more charitably. There can also be secular intimations of this: the more faith-inspired practices are successful even on secular terms (e. g. more economic security, more equality, more sustainability, greater civic participation), the easier it will be for secular institutions to adopt elements of such an overarching framework without however embracing its religious basis. Thus, Benedict’s vision for an alternative political economy resonates with people of all faiths and none. ...|$|R
40|$|The Hawaiian Islands, {{because of}} their {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean, act as natural ';barometers' for tsunamis generated along the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is the most seismically active area in the world. A multi-proxy study in the remote Pololu valley on the Big Island provided the first evidence for two trans-Pacific events, namely the 1946 and 1957 Aleutian tsunamis. These were identified using radiometric, stratigraphic, microfossil, pollen and geochemical proxies and were corroborated by historical accounts. The islands have been impacted repeatedly by tsunamis in historical times (inc. the recent 2010 Maule and 2011 Tohoku-oki events), and there is strong archaeological evidence for large events affecting humans in prehistory. However, no geological research has yet been carried out, except for some associated with a palaeoecological study on Kauai. Historical evidence shows that tsunamis emanating from the Pacific Ring of Fire have run up to different elevations on different islands within the island chain depending upon their source. Here there is a possible key to understanding some of the key questions about the magnitude and frequency of tsunamis from various parts of the Pacific. Tsunamis from Japan are large on the SW side of the Big Island, those from Alaska seem to have been large in the NE of the island and so on throughout the island chain. A careful site selection from throughout the islands offers a unique <b>opportunity</b> to <b>chart</b> the palaeotsunami record of the Hawaiian Islands while at the same time matching and enhancing the palaeoseismic record of sources in the Pacific Ring of Fire.

40|$|How is the Dutch {{population}} faring? That is {{the central}} question addressed in The Social State of the Netherlands 2009. In this book we describe the present status of the Netherlands and the Dutch {{in a number of}} key areas of life, and also highlight the changes that have taken place in people's life situation over the last ten years. Have people's incomes improved? Are there more or fewer people in work? And which groups in the population have made the greatest progress or fallen back furthest? Are the educational achievements of young people improving or deteriorating? What about our (unhealthy) habits and lifestyles? How do the Dutch use their time? People's own subjective experiences are also explored. How do Dutch citizens view the future: Do we have confidence in it or are we deeply worried? Is social cohesion in the Netherlands fragmenting? Are some groups in danger of becoming marginalised? Do those in need of help receive proper support? And what about voluntary work and club and society life? By describing all these diverse themes in their mutual relationship, we arrive at an overall picture of the life situation of the Dutch. Naturally, we also devote attention to separate groups - after all, people's capacities, opportunities and preferences for the way they structure their lives differ and are related, causally or otherwise, to their age, sex, {{whether or not they are}} disabled, their ethnic origin and their financial position. The impact of the financial crisis which began in 2008 is also described for those themes for which data were available. And because Europe is coming ever closer and a great deal of government policy is today actually European policy, we indicate in several places how the Dutch compare with their European neighbours. The Social State of the Netherlands (SSN) is part of a long and international research tradition in which an attempt is made using social indicators to monitor the living conditions and quality of life of citizens over time, and to identify trends in these areas.

In December 2004, Congress enacted and the President signed into law the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act of 2004, (HABHRCA 2004). The reauthorization of HABHRCA acknowledged that HABs {{are one of the}} most scientifically complex and economically damaging coastal issues challenging our ability to safeguard the health of our Nation’s coastal ecosystems. The Administration further recognized the importance of HABs as a high priority national issue by specifically calling for the implementation of HABHRCA in the President’s U. S. Ocean Action Plan. HABHRCA 2004 requires four reports to assess and recommend research programs on HABs in U. S. waters. This document comprises two linked reports specifically aimed at improving HAB management and response: the Prediction and Response Report and the follow-up plan, the National Scientific Research, Development, Demonstration, and Technology Transfer (RDDTT) Plan on Reducing Impacts from Harmful Algal Blooms. This document was prepared by the Interagency Working Group on Harmful Algal Blooms, Hypoxia, and Human Health, which was chartered through the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology of the National Science and Technology Council and the Interagency Committee on Ocean Science and Resource Management Integration. This report complements and expands upon HAB-related priorities identified in Charting the Course for Ocean Science in the United States for the Next Decade: An Ocean Research Priorities Plan and Implementation Strategy, recently released by the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology. It draws from the contributions of numerous experts and stakeholders from federal, state, and local governments, academia, industry, and non-governmental organizations through direct contributions, previous reports and planning efforts, a public comment period, and a workshop convened to develop strategies for a HAB management and response plan. Given the importance of the Nation’s coastal ocean, estuaries, and inland waters to our quality of life, our culture, and the economy, it is imperative that we move forward to better understand and mitigate the impacts of HABs which threaten all of our coasts and inland waters.

40|$|The Island of Rottnest is {{commonly}} known to Noongar 1 people as Wadjemup, “place across the river” or from its colonial connections the “Isle of Spirits”. Rottnest is located approximately 18 km {{off the coast}} of Western Australia, near Fremantle, and is world renowned as a tourism precinct. Less well known is its hidden history related to Aboriginal incarceration, dispossession and death. This PhD study includes a film documentary entitled: Wadjemup: Black Prison – White Playground and an exegesis. These two parts examine the Noongar cosmology and spirituality related to the Island and its surrounding landscape and its cultural significance to Noongar knowledge and history. They document the role of the Island as a colonial prison and the traumatic impact on Aboriginal prisoners. Contemporary and proposed approaches to reconciliation via cultural activities, museum exhibits and monuments are also discussed. The documentary and exegesis ask: Can investigation of the history and cultural context of a colonial prison for Aboriginal inmates facilitate production of a film, documenting the memories and trauma, which will significantly assist in the reconciliation processes via museums, monuments and other cultural activities? The study answers this question by investigating seven key areas or themes: cosmology; colonization; resistance; Aboriginal imprisonment; memorialisation and remembrance; tourism; and healing and reconciliation. The research emphasizes the period of Aboriginal incarceration on the Island highlighting the significant repercussions that alienation and dispossession had on Aboriginal families and cultural systems in Western Australia, and the lasting legacy of this on contemporary Aboriginal society. The significance of this research lies in the way it addresses the problems and processes of reconciliation within three levels: structural, theoretical and ideological. The study exposes the Island’s history and unravels the key linkages between critical characteristics and the institutional responses towards reconciliation providing challenges for political practice and history. It engages with a body of literature concerned with the critical analysis of post-colonization {{and the manner in which}} this can engender ethical responses towards colonised and dispossessed members of the community. It utilizes numerous oral histories and interviews, including material drawn from the case study of the Rottnest Island Deaths Group and the discovery of skeletal remains on the Island. By situating the broader public’s views in relation to Aboriginal responses, with film playing a major role, and contextualising these views within theoretical debates this study provides a unique <b>opportunity</b> to <b>chart</b> the linkages between the structural, theoretical and ideological aspects of Indigenous reconciliation and healing...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} a theme of a professionally guided {{volunteering}} which is at present a highly developed, professional, modern and fast growing activity. It is focused particularly on barriers to volunteering in the health and social area. In a theoretical part the author gives attention to information important for a comprehensive view on volunteering, she specifies its legislative embodiment. Next, for example, she introduces a division of voluntary activities from different points of view. Subsequently, she gradually moves in thoughts to characteristics of barriers which the volunteering fumbles with and which make impossible to implement it successfully. She clarifies their manifestations and tries to seek possible solutions. The emphasis is put on the barriers which occur {{on the side of}} social and healthcare facilities. The aim of the practical research is to refer to the barriers to volunteering in the health and social area and to offer possibilities of their elimination. Therefore the first objective is to chart the most frequent barriers to volunteering from the side of social and healthcare institutions in the Czech Republic. The second objective, partial, connected with the first one, is to <b>chart</b> <b>opportunities</b> how to overcome the barriers at the organizations which use the volunteers. The thesis offers two views of the issue. It analyses its findings at organizations which does not have any volunteers but also at those ones which already use their services. The research was realised by a quantitative form. The data were collected by means of an interviewing method and a technique of a semi-structured interview.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2005 Dr. Jim QuinnFor well {{over a hundred years}} Australia's relationship with Asia has been contentious. In contemporary Australia there is still an ongoing debate on Australia's possible place in and relationship with Asia. The debate occurs across the social and political spectrum in Australian society. Over recent decades this debate has been a major policy issue in education policy for both federal and state governments. The argument for the study of Asia in education is not immune from this wider political and social discourse addressing Australia's position and place in Asia. Between 1970 and 2002 there have been four major Reports on Asian studies in Australian Education. The reports: the Auchmuty Report (1970), the FitzGerald Report (1980), the Ingleson Report (1989) and the Jeffrey Report (2002) offer a unique <b>opportunity</b> to <b>chart</b> the development of Asian studies and languages in Australian education {{over an extended period of}} time. The reports provide a unique insight into the state of Asian studies at approximately ten year intervals. Each report offers a detailed account of the contemporary situation, mostly in the universities, of the study of Asia and languages. Each offers explicit policy recommendations to enhance the position of the study of Asia into the future. The recommendations are directed to government, educational authorities, universities and members of the profession. These reports provide the basis for this thesis. For the study of Asia to gain an accepted and permanent place in the curricula in Australian = education and in particular in universities, new approaches to policy development and implementation must occur. The traditional culture of the universities, the European tradition, must be challenged as it presents many barriers, both pedagogical and administrative, to acceptance of the study of Asia. In addition, over the last 15 years, Australian universities are being continually reshaped by a change process instigated by the Federal government. All disciplines have been and are still being affected by these changes. The case for the study of Asia must be framed in such a way that it recognizes and responds to these organizational and financial changes and challenges if the study of Asia is to become a key component of the curricula. The contention of this thesis is that the study of Asia and Asian language must have an accepted and recognized position in Australian education at all levels. The policy advocacy for the study of Asia, while recognizing the pragmatic reasons of improved economic ties and outcomes and political relations should, at the same time, highlight the invaluable learning opportunity that the study of Asia's many and varied histories and cultures provide. The study of Asia, then, would meet the economic and vocational imperatives of present government policy while at the same time contributing to a greater understanding of society. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{responds}} to the draft Queensland Plan, asking where economic growth will come from to lift incomes above the rest of Australia. All boom, no benefit?  from the Centre for Policy Development argues Queensland must chart a new course toward reliable, sustainable and equitably distributed growth – or face a future of fewer jobs and economic disruption. Queensland is at {{a fork in the}} road. The days of easy coal mining revenue are running out, and Queensland’s incomes are yet to match the rest of Australia. In fact, average Queensland household incomes are 5 per cent below the national average. Experience from previous mining booms suggests incomes may fall further behind as the investment phase of the latest mining boom cools. A new era of global growth will challenge the performance of commodity exporting economies. Focusing on economic diversity is now more important because the structure of the global economy is changing rapidly. The transformation underway is unlikely to be smooth. Slowing demand for coal, a new economic growth model in China, and high commodity price volatility are likely to be permanent features of the next phase of global growth. Key findings from the report include: Coal prices have dropped at least 30 per cent from their 2008 highs, and the rest of Asia is unlikely to replace falling Chinese demand. China’s new growth model will reshape Queensland’s economy, since it represents Queensland’s largest export market. Exports to China were Queensland’s largest growth point over the past decade, increasing from $ 1 billion to over $ 9 billion. A tripling in commodity price volatility will challenge Queensland’s less competitive mines and impact government budgets. Agribusiness, tourism, education, health and wealth management are industries forecast to grow rapidly over coming decades, while mining is forecast to grow slower than global GDP. Only 26 per cent of jobs from new mines and related infrastructure are long-term. The draft Queensland Plan shows Queenslanders understand these risks and want to develop a much more diverse economy to prepare for them. The Queensland Plan represents {{a step in the right}} direction toward governing for the future – if it has staying power through multiple election cycles and no gaps in its measures of progress. If Queensland misses this <b>opportunity</b> to <b>chart</b> a new path, it is likely to be forced through a rapid economic transit ion as underperforming industries and their assets become stranded. The report recommends Queensland adopt a new economic strategy that focuses less on attracting capital investment, and more on promoting economic diversity. To capitalise on its natural competitive advantages, Queensland should level the playing field for non-mining industries, establish an endowment fund to manage natural resources, and convene a State Summit to identify growth opportunities.

40|$|In this {{longitudinal}} study, {{the sleep}} electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy infants was quantitatively analysed using power spectral analysis. As EEG is a non-invasive indicator of regional brain activity, the data generated {{from this study}} would provide the <b>opportunity</b> to <b>chart</b> sleep EEG changes of healthy infants in association with brain maturation. Understanding the sleep EEG of healthy infants would also provide a valuable normative dataset {{as a basis for}} association with other developmental measures and discrimination of disease states. A prospective cohort of 34 healthy infants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) at 2 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age along with Bayley III assessment at 24 months of age. The polysomnograms were scored using the current American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria. Representative epochs of Active Sleep (AS) / Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Quiet Sleep (QS) / Non-REM (NREM) were selected across the night and analysed using power spectral analysis. The results of the power spectral analysis was binned into the delta (0. 5 – 3. 9 Hz), theta (4 – 7. 9 Hz), alpha (8 – 10. 9 Hz) and beta (11 – 15 Hz) bands and were visually and quantitatively analysed for maturational changes. Then, the correlation between the sleep EEG power spectra of all sleep stages across the age and the Bayley III scores was computed. The Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) is an interesting disorder to study as infants with PWS are associated with both developmental delays as well as sleep related problems. Similar to healthy infants, the sleep EEG of a retrospective group of 25 infants with PWS was analysed using power spectral analysis at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age. The sleep EEG power spectra of infants with PWS were then graphically and statistically compared with healthy infants. The sleep EEG power spectra of healthy infants changed significantly in the different frequency bands as the infants matured. The emergence of a peak in the beta band in NREM N 2 sleep corresponded with the development of sleep spindles. Maturational changes were also seen in the NREM N 3 stage and in the theta and alpha bands in both AS/REM and QS/NREM. These changes are in keeping with maturation and developmental milestones of healthy infants. Three distinctive correlations were observed between the sleep EEG power spectra and development assessment of healthy infants. At 2 weeks old, the QS beta band power has a significant correlation with adaptive behaviour at 24 months of age. The NREM N 3 beta band power at 6 months of age correlated with Bayley III language score at 24 months of age. At 12 months of age, the NREM N 3 delta power correlated with Bayley III motor score at 24 months of age. The correlation analysis from this study indicate that some developmental outcomes in infants may already be programmed as early 2 weeks old, particularly to infants’ adaptive behaviour skill. The sleep EEG power spectra of infants with PWS lacked significant changes across all sleep stages indicating delayed brain maturation. The lack of change in theta band across the sleep stages {{may be related to the}} attention problems associated with infants with PWS. The high power in NREM N 3 delta band in PWS infants may be related to GABAA receptors that are mapped to the affected PWS chromosome 15 region. The differences between the sleep EEG power spectra of infants with PWS and healthy infants may be related to the delayed brain maturation and neurocognitive symptoms of infants with PWS. This study provides an atlas of healthy infant sleep EEG power spectra in the early years of life, providing a basis for association with other developmental measures and a normative dataset on which disease may be discriminated...|$|R
