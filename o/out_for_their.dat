5|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} ensemble cast, and each lead being singled <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response; some reviewers felt that its dark, humorous premise was explored well, while others felt the jokes were racist, homophobic and misogynistic. A sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, {{was released on}} November 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|England came <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> second innings, {{and with}} Bradman {{predominantly}} reliant on his seamers, Johnson bowled only seven overs {{on the third}} afternoon as the hosts closed at 3/174 from 69 overs. Late in the day, Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80. Washbrook reached stumps unbeaten on 85, and Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.|$|E

5|$|Since 1788, English {{has been}} spoken in Oceania, and Australian English has {{developed}} as a first language {{of the vast majority}} of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being General Australian. The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language. Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are). New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.|$|E

It is also possible that they may have planned to take this route.|$|E
25|$|The 6 side altarpieces, {{despite some}} later interventions, display great {{similarities}} to each other, {{indicating that they}} belong to a common program {{and that they were}} created in the same workshop. There is a certain formality about them – a plain or rectangular design contrasting with the dynamism of the pedestals, of the “tree-trunk” pillars, and of the ornamentation, especially at the top. Beyond the usual principles of design – dignity suiting the House of God, presenting to the faithful one of the possible representations of heaven, and the framing of figures who stand <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> exemplary lives – there are other, more specific ones: the adoption of a common decorative program, a strong emphasis on the parish priest, and the possible eventual participation of a confraternity or brotherhood (probably without any members of high social status or wealth).|$|E
