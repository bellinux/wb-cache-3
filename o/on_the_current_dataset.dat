40|$|Abstract- This paper proposes an {{automated}} system for recognizing palmprints for biometric identification of individuals. Palmprint images are converted {{to the frequency}} domain using 2 D DFT and thereafter bandpass filtered using a log-Gabor filter to extract the phase symmetry information. Classification is done on basis of correlation between training and testing set images. The approach is tested over a data set of 200 images divided into 10 classes and seen to provide 100 % recognition accuracy. A contemporary technique is also implemented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>dataset</b> for comparison of accuracy results...|$|E

30|$|Unlike many {{variation}} studies, which mainly used linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling analyses, chi-square {{was chosen}} {{in this study}} {{as a means to}} statistically evaluate the effect of gender on /dz/ realization. This was mainly due to two reasons. First of all, the number of cases included was too small for an ideal overall LME analysis, and the model failed to converge. Secondly, there were five main realization categories of interest, which would not easily fit into a binary LME analysis. However, in order to check for a potential random subject effect, LME models were run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>dataset</b> by collapsing realizations into two categories, the older variants, including [Z] and [G], and the newer variants, including [L], [D], and [R].

We study the luminosity dispersion in GRB/XRF-associated SNe and compare to local Type Ibc supernovae from the literature.

We propose a new action recognition system by exploiting very deep two-stream ConvNets and Fisher vector representation of iDT features. Specifically, we utilize those successful very deep architectures in images such as GoogLeNet and VGGNet to design the two-stream ConvNets. From our experiments, we see that deeper architectures obtain higher performance for spatial nets. However, for temporal net, deeper archi-tectures could not yield better recognition accuracy.
