50|$|Economic trends can {{influence}} the growth or shrinkage of fiscal deficits in several ways. Increased levels of economic activity generally lead to higher tax revenues, while government expenditures often increase during economic downturns because of higher outlays for social insurance programs such as unemployment benefits.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{counterfeit}} parts have infiltrated {{the defense}} supply chain, which provides replacement parts and sub-systems for deployed systems. This creates {{a significant amount}} of risk. Both government and industry have formulated and implemented various policy initiatives to address the problem, including inspections, penalties and trusted sourcing. However, the problem is still on-going. Additional policies are under consideration, and the unintended effects of policies are not known. To study the problem and potential policy solutions, we present an enterprise simulation model of counterfeit parts intrusion and policy alternatives. The model reflects the defense enterprise, tiers of suppliers, counterfeiters and <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>policy</b> actors. Interactions of these actors and their reactions to events and policies form {{an important part of the}} enterprise system behavior. Policies, their effects and their interactions are detailed in this multi-stakeholder environment...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{implications}} of tax competition between juris-dictions in a neoclassical growth model under the assumption of perfect capital mobility. The government of each jurisdiction solves an optimal taxation prob-lem under commitment, treating the <b>other</b> <b>government’s</b> <b>policies</b> as given. We provide a new theoretical perspective on the dynamic international capital-tax externalities that emerge in this model. In numerical experiments, we find that, {{as a result of}} these externalities, for a range of reasonable parameter values, source-based capital income tax rates are positive in the short and medium run and zero in the long run. We find further that the convergence to zero is highly protracted, in stark contrast to the situation in a closed economy. The latter im-plies that taxes can be higher with capital mobility than without it over many years, in contrast to a widely held consensus...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{asks whether}} trade {{can help to}} achieve the {{employment}} targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. The focus is on Goal 8, which is to "promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. " The theoretical and empirical links between trade and employment are examined to suggest whether trade has a positive or {{negative impact on the}} quantity and quality of employment. At the aggregate level, trade has a positive impact on welfare, which can lead to job creation. However, freer trade causes some sectors and firms to expand and others to shrink. This adjustment process creates both a demand for labor in some sectors and job losses in <b>others.</b> <b>Government</b> <b>policies</b> to cushion the impact of adjustment and facilitate the movement of labor from declining to rising sectors are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This article {{highlights}} the contradictions in government legis-lation that simultaneously see young {{people involved in}} prosti-tution as innocent victims and willing criminals. It challenges the recent victim theory {{that is not only}} contradictory when we look at <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>policy,</b> but by being accepted as the government line on prostitution it has negatively defined young prostitutes as naïve and helpless. This female-focused victim philosophy excludes males and doesn’t account for {{the reality of the situation}} for many girls who don’t see themselves in this passive way. By hiding behind the victim philosophy the government ignores societal factors that deny young people legitimate economic subsistence and sexualise them in the media. The article thus argues for a theory of empowerment for young people in contradiction to the victim philosophy so that they are seen as survivors rather than victims withou...|$|R

40|$|Individuals {{living in}} hot climates face health risks from {{hyperthermia}} due to excessive heat. Heat strain {{is influenced by}} weather exposure and by individual characteristics such as age, sex, body size, and occupation. To explore the population-level drivers of heat strain, we developed a simulation model that scales up individual risks of heat storage (estimated using Myrup and Morgan’s man model “MANMO”) to a large population. Using Australian weather data, we identify high-risk weather conditions together with individual characteristics that {{increase the risk of}} heat stress under these conditions. The model identifies elevated risks in children and the elderly, with females aged 75 and older those most likely to experience heat strain. Risk of heat strain in males does not increase as rapidly with age, but is greatest on hot days with high solar radiation. Although cloudy days are less dangerous for the wider population, older women still have an elevated risk of heat strain on hot cloudy days or when indoors during high temperatures. Simulation models provide a valuable method for exploring population level risks of heat strain, and a tool for evaluating public health and <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>policy</b> interventions...|$|R

5000|$|For Governments: One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} educational strategies for governments is to invest early {{and all the way}} up to upper secondary. Governments can prevent school failure and reduce dropout using two parallel approaches: eliminating education policies and practices that hinder equity; and targeting low performing disadvantaged schools. But education policies need to be aligned with <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>policies,</b> such as housing or welfare, to ensure student success. At this initial educational stage, direct public funding of services is associated with more effective governmental monitoring of early childhood services, advantages of scale, better quality across the country, more effective training for educators and a higher degree of equity in access.|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the link between investment incentives and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in Malawi’s tourism sector and also to question whether these incentives have promoted sustainable development in the country. It finds that investment incentives do not determine FDI in the tourism sector; rather, decisions to invest were largely driven by the the country’s natural resources; the cost of raw materials; the availability of relatively cheap labour; and the inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates. This suggests that the type, nature and quantity of FDI in the tourism sector is shaped by <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>policy</b> such as promoting increased private sector participation rather than by investment incentives per se. It therefore follows that this has implications for Malawi’s sustainable development goals, especially the role of investment incentives in shaping {{the economic and social}} impacts of investment, as well as environmental impacts, which the incentives seem to have affected negatively.
