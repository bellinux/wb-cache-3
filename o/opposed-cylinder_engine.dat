40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{improving}} the engine’s power density, we put forward {{a new type of}} power transmission mechanism which is used for <b>opposed-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> The gas pressure acts on the cam through the piston and push rod, and the spindle rotation of external is driven by the cam. The design of spatial cam work surface is completed by using the enveloping theory of a family of space curves, the force between roller and cam is analyzed using dynamic analysis software. Under the condition of equal number, size and stroke of piston, the new one with larger power density is more compact in structure than the traditional power transmission mechanism, and the reaction force {{on either side of the}} main shaft and the acting force between pistons and cylinders are smaller than those in traditional one, which prolongs the service life of the pistons...|$|E
50|$|Founded {{in early}} 2008, EcoMotors is an American company {{developing}} and commercializing an opposed-piston <b>opposed-cylinder</b> (OPOC) <b>engine</b> {{for use in}} cars, light trucks, commercial vehicles, aerospace, marine, agriculture, auxiliary power units, generators, etc. This engine was promoted to significantly improve fuel efficiency, and substantially reduce production costs when compared to convententional internal combustion engines.|$|R
50|$|The Union {{automobile}} had an eight-horsepower two-cylinder, four-cycle, double <b>opposed-cylinder</b> gasoline <b>engine.</b> The {{engine was}} available in either an air-cooled version or a water-cooled version. The transmission was of the friction type and the final drive by double chain. The body style was a two-seater with a folding collapsible front seat to carry two more passengers, which enabled it to be converted into a four-passenger automobile.|$|R
50|$|The Transavia PL-12 Airtruk is a {{single-engine}} {{agricultural aircraft}} {{designed and built}} by the Transavia Corporation in Australia. The Airtruk is a shoulder-wing strut braced sesquiplane of all-metal construction, with the cockpit mounted above a tractor-location <b>opposed-cylinder</b> air-cooled <b>engine</b> and short pod fuselage with rear door. The engine cowling, rear fuselage and top decking are of fibreglass. It has a tricycle undercarriage, the main units of which are carried on the lower sesquiplane wings. It has twin tail booms with two unconnected tails. Its first flight was on 22 April 1965, and was certified on 10 February 1966.|$|R
5000|$|Lycoming {{is a major}} US {{manufacturer}} of civilian aircraft engines that power over one half of general aviation aircraft. They have developed and currently produce a series of flat-4 and flat-6 aircraft engines, and one flat-8 engine. The configuration is expressed in the engine's model numbers as the letter [...] "O", standing for [...] "opposed" [...] {{in reference to the}} cylinder arrangement. Franklin produced horizontally opposed flat aircraft engines beginning in the 1930s. The Franklin O-335 was used in the Bell 47 light helicopter. Continental Motors continues to manufacture flat-4 and flat-6 air-cooled aircraft engines — their initial model, the Continental A-40, appeared in 1931. Flat engines largely replaced the historically more popular radial engines in small aircraft after World War II because they were less expensive to manufacture. Radial engines have inherently good cooling, but their large frontal area increases drag. It is not difficult to design flat-6 and flat-8 engines from flat-4 designs by adding more cylinder pairs with a new crankshaft. In an air-cooled <b>opposed-cylinder</b> layout <b>engine</b> there can be cooling problems on flat-six designs, with the middle cylinder pairs. The flat-6 is smoother running than a flat-four design. Porsche adapted their 911 6 cylinder horizontally opposed air-cooled engines to become the Porsche PFM 3200 aero engine in late 1985 but, after low sales and a US$75 million investment, production ceased in 1991 - [...] "homebrew" [...] conversions of the Corvair flat-six air-cooled automobile engine have been used for powering examples of the Pietenpol Air Camper homebuilt monoplane aircraft.|$|R
