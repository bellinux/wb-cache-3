500|$|Her next {{appearance}} was in StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, {{where she is}} the central character, and it {{tells the story of}} her further fate, and of the Zerg Swarm as well. Once again a human, Kerrigan is brought by Raynor to a secret research facility run by Valerian Mengsk to determine how much of her skill at controlling Zerg remains from her time as the Queen of Blades. However, the facility is attacked by Dominion forces and while Kerrigan and Valerian manage to escape, Raynor becomes trapped. After returning to look for him, Kerrigan hears Mengsk's announcement that he was captured and executed. To enact revenge against Mengsk, Kerrigan, while traveling through the sector to reunite the Zerg Swarm under her control, is approached by Zeratul. Zeratul tells her to travel to Zerus, the original homeworld of the Zerg, where the primal Zerg are in a constantly evolving state. Kerrigan, initially reluctant, is convinced after Zeratul tells her there she can obtain enough power to move on with her vengeance plans. On Zerus, Kerrigan learns that Amon stole {{a large portion of the}} Zerg from Zerus and bound them to a single overriding will, making them Amon's slaves as part of his plot to destroy both the Zerg and Protoss and remake life in his own image. Kerrigan enters a chrysalis in the first Zerg spawning pool and emerges, transforming again into the primal Queen of Blades. She also realizes that Amon's lingering taint was partially responsible for the crimes she committed during the Brood War. Mengsk contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor was not killed, but is held as a hostage instead, threatening to kill him should she wage war against the Dominion. With help from Valerian and Raynor's Raiders, Kerrigan manages to rescue Raynor, but is rejected by him for renouncing the human self that he worked so hard to restore. Now in full control of the Zerg Swarm once again, Kerrigan launches an attack on the Dominon's main world, Korhal, to defeat Mengsk. She is assisted by Valerian, who convinces her to give an opening for the civilians to escape, and is later assisted by Raynor's forces as well. Confronting Mengsk face to face, Kerrigan is almost defeated when he uses the Xel'naga artifact to attack her, but Raynor stops him, allowing her to kill Mengsk with her own hands. Kerrigan and Raynor make their peace and it is shown that they will always look <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> hinting an everlasting affection between the two. With the Dominion's leader destroyed, Kerrigan bids Raynor and Valerian farewell and starts to prepare herself and her swarm for [...] "the greatest battle they'll ever face".|$|E

But Internet bulletin boards and chat rooms can also provide a medium for the recuperation and performance of forms of hetereosexual masculinity that have become marginalised and rendered unacceptable in the offline world.

The Sammyboy Times – a commercial sex information site aimed primarily at a Singaporean male audience – is such a space. In its members-only forum about sex tourism to the Indonesian island of Batam, Singaporean men escape from the demands of a heteronormative expression of masculinity predicated on the reproduction of the Singaporean state. But Sammyboy provides much more than a space for the expression of an alternative, transgressive masculinity; it also allows the men to produce a localised form of brotherhood in which the men share information and look <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> welfare in their encounters with Batam’s sex workers.

2500|$|Democratic {{ideals of}} {{integration}} for international and European nations are {{as old as}} the modern nation-state. Ancient concepts of European unity were generally undemocratic, and founded on domination, like the Empire of Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, or the Catholic Church controlled by the Pope in Rome. In the Renaissance, medieval trade flourished in organisations like the Hanseatic League, stretching from English towns like Boston and London, to Frankfurt, Stockholm and Riga. These traders developed the lex mercatoria, spreading basic norms of good faith and fair dealing through their business. In 1517, the Protestant Reformation triggered a hundred years of crisis and instability. Martin Luther nailed a list of demands to the church door of Wittenberg, King Henry VIII declared a unilateral split from Rome with the Act of Supremacy 1534, and conflicts flared across the Holy Roman Empire until the Peace of Augsburg 1555 guaranteed each principality the right to its chosen religion (cuius regio, eius religio). This unstable settlement unravelled in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), killing around a quarter of the population in central Europe. The Treaty of Westphalia 1648, which brought peace according to a system of international law inspired by Hugo Grotius, is generally acknowledged as the beginning of the nation-state system. Even then, the English Civil War broke out and only ended with the Glorious Revolution of 1688, by Parliament inviting William and Mary from Hannover to the throne, and passing the Bill of Rights 1689. In 1693 William Penn, a Quaker from London who founded Pennsylvania in North America, argued that to prevent ongoing wars in Europe a [...] "European dyet, or parliament" [...] was needed. The French diplomat, Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre, who worked negotiating the Treaty of Utrecht {{at the end of the}} War of Spanish Succession proposed, through [...] "Perpetual Union", [...] "an everlasting peace in Europe", a project taken up by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant after him.

World War One devastated Europe's society and economy, and the Versailles Treaty failed to establish a workable international system in the League of Nations, any European integration, and imposed punishing terms of reparation payments for the losing countries. After another economic collapse and the rise of fascism led to a Second World War, European civil society was determined to create a lasting union to guarantee world peace through economic, social and political integration.|$|E

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to examine how}} elderly suicide is viewed in Korean novels, against the background that suicide rates are higher among older people in Korean society. Firstly, elderly suicide is caused by loneliness and alienation in some novels. Writers foreground some problems that people, especially elderly people, need to address. For example, not only people with negative personality traits but also people with positive personality traits can commit suicide when they cannot overcome disappointing words from their children; suicide is a greedy act if it is committed because of loneliness and alienation; elderly people need to humbly accept their lives, even though loneliness and alienation are unavoidable. Secondly, Korean novels {{make it clear that}} elderly suicide is closely related to Korean modern history.  Old people experienced psychological trauma as they underwent the Korean War in the 1950 s, the military dictatorship in the 1980 s and the IMF crisis in the 1990 s. When obsessed with a sense of guilt, older people sometimes commit suicide in order to atone for their wrongdoings.  Thirdly, elderly suicide is depicted in positive terms in a novel, while suicide is usually considered to be a negative act. An elderly couple with physical illness commits suicide <b>out</b> of love <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in hopes of reincarnation. This suicide is viewed as resolving the conflict between their daughter and her husband. In examining perspectives on elderly suicide as depicted in Korean novels, this article sheds light on reasons why some elderly people live unsound lives and suggests some solutions...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of how to create communities where people altruistically care <b>for,</b> and look <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> health and well-being is increasingly a central question in academic literature. However, altruism has long been belittled or ignored in the literature in terms of its ability to influence human behaviour. This tendency appears to have been carried over into the management of West Nile Virus (WNV), a sometimes serious disease that has spread throughout North America since first arriving in 1999. Specifically, government health educators have focused only on telling the public how what are referred to here as Community Protective Measures (CPMs) such as the elimination of standing water, can reduce personal risk or protect family members from the disease, rather than explaining how these measures can help protect others in their community as a whole. As a different approach to addressing this issue, this study sought to determine which communities and people (1) were undertaking CPMs out of an altruistic concern for others in their community, or (2) could be encouraged to engage in CPMs by making salient the benefits of these measures to the community. Study results came back positive, those that live in urban areas, and married or widowed people as opposed to singles or divorcees, those with children exhibiting significantly more concern for others about the disease. Additionally, women; married or widowed people; those who have younger children (0 - 18 years old); and those who had certain strong positive feelings about their community, namely knowing people better in the community, being involved in the community, and having a sense that people help <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the community; {{were significantly more likely to}} already be willing to take action against the disease at least partly for the purposes of protecting the health of others. Additionally, albeit not significantly, a trend was noted in this regard with respect to those that rented and those who had children [...] With regard to those who could be encouraged for altruistic reasons to undertake CPMs, such was found to be significantly the case for those not living in an Adult Lifestyle Communities (ALCs); those living in a city, town, or hamlet for a long (11 - 25 years) period of time; younger individuals (18 - 35 years old), and singles or divorcees as opposed to married or widowed individuals. Although not found to be significant, a trend in this regard was found with respect to those that perceived themselves to live in a small- or medium-sized neighbourhoods, urban as opposed to suburban areas, females, renters, and those without children. A pilot study in a community with the characteristics where respondents were found to respond to learning about the community benefits of CPMs, as well as efforts to instill the characteristics of places where people already tend to be altruistically inclined, is recommended. The thesis concludes by discussing how relying upon, and encouraging altruistic tendencies could be applied to a variety of issues ranging from the control of other infectious diseases, to encouraging other health promoting behaviour such as the donation of organs, to addressing wider national as well as global matters like poverty or global climate change. By doing so, health and other planners could potentially take a more holistic, less rational, and advocacy approach to planning that seeks to build community capacity to deal with problems rather than reacting on a problem-by-problem basis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Literacy {{education}} {{is the most important}} part in school education and its efficiency determines the students’ achievements in their future education and career. In 2010, the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) were released, which aimed to provide common standards for K- 12 public school students in the whole country to improve the educational quality in the U. S. The goals of language literacy in CCSS were illustrated from four dimensions: standards for reading, writing, speaking and listening, and language, which was from the micro-perspective of language learning. In CCSS, English Language Arts Reading is emphasized and the teaching aims, teaching contents, language skills, and the function of new technology was proposed to guarantee the quality of the literacy education. In 2011, Chinese National Curriculum Standards (NCS) was released. The goal of NCS for language learning was designed based on three dimensions: knowledge and ability, process and methods, and emotion, attitude, and values, which was from the macro-perspective of language learning. This paper introduced the background of the implementation of the two curriculums, compared the components and goals between the American CCSS and Chinese NCS, as well as the characteristics of each curriculum to try to find <b>out</b> the implications <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} concepts for {{the liquid}} limit and plastic limit of fine-grained soils {{have been in}} use since they were originally defined by Atterberg in 1911, introduced into use by Terzaghi and modified by Casagrande. The liquid limit by fall-cone has been the preferred method since 1975 and is currently described in BS 1377 : Part 2 : (1990). It seems a logical step that the plasticity index should also be determined using the fall-cone. It is at present defined as the mathematical difference between two separate tests:- the current thread rolling plastic limit test and the cone penetrometer liquid limit test, both as described in BS 1377 : Part 2 : (1990). This research, whilst {{taking into account the}} findings of others is empirical in nature. Laboratory testing is carried out by the author to produce data for analysis from samples of natural remoulded UK soils. The initial testing programme involves the determination of cone penetration and undrained shear strength by laboratory shear vane. Determination of plastic limit, (thread-roll method), and liquid limit, (fall-cone method), is also carried <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> soil sample. <b>Other</b> tests include clay content, particle density and dry density. Samples are also prepared and tested for clay mineralogy by x-ray diffraction. A correlation is discovered linking density at the cone penetromer liquid limit with plasticity index. Consequently, additional samples are obtained and tested for index limits and density only. A new method of determining plasticity index from fall cone and density determination is proposed. A survey is conducted whereby volunteers are asked to carry out liquid limit and plastic limit tests on standard soil samples. Additionally, extra weighings are required. Analysis of these data enable a direct comparison to be made between plasticity index determiations produced by the colunteers using both the current method and the proposed new method. It is concluded that the new method, in addition to being faster, gives plasticity test results comparable wioth and more reproducible than results obtained using the current method.
