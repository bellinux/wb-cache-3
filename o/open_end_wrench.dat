50|$|A cone wrench or cone spanner {{is a tool}} used in bicycle {{assembly}} and maintenance to tighten and adjust the cones on a bicycle wheel. Cone wrenches are thinner and lighter than most other <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{that are used to}} work on bicycles. They should be used only for making adjustments to wheel's cones or for other applications such as centering brakes. Using a cone wrench in high torque applications such as loosening outer axle nuts may easily damage the wrench. Cone wrenches are typically about 2 mm thick, compared to approximately 7 mm for a standard open-ended wrench.|$|R

To accomplish the tethering of the sockets to the ratchets, a special design was implemented in which a groove was machined into each socket. Each socket was then fitted with a snap ring that can spin around the machined groove. The snap ring is tethered to {{the handle of the}} ratchet. All <b>open</b> <b>end</b> <b>wrenches</b> are also tethered to the ratchet or to the operator, depending upon the type. Tests were run to ensure that the modified tools meet torque requirements. The design was subsequently approved by Space Safety...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of European Industrial Training [© Emerald]. The definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 0309 - 0590. htm. Purpose - This study examines participant’s response rate on dual style training course evaluation forms. These combine structured and <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> formats. Pencil and paper forms {{have a long history of}} use by trainers in business and commerce and more recently in education. Research methods texts tend to have neglected the issue of response rates with this type of form. Design/methodology/approach - Approximately 2000 course participants attending 28 courses completed evaluation forms. These were designed with a series of structured responses scales followed by a section for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> comments. Findings – It was found the completion rate for the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections was low and thus validity was suspect. Various explanations were offered for this. Subsequently when a redesigned evaluation form was administered to a further 1641 course participants it was found response rates increased dramatically when <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections were placed earlier in the questionnaire. Practical implications – Indicates ways in which course evaluation forms can be redesigned to increase response rates for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections and thus improve the validity of any findings. Originality/value – Provides information about response rates neglected by most methodology texts concerning the design of training evaluation questionnaires which include <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections...|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigated propagation {{characteristics of}} the shock wave driven by a gaseous detonation wave emerging from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of a cylindrical detonation tube. In the present study, we visualized the shock wave and exhaust flowfields using a shadowgraph optical system and we obtained peak overpressure in the tube axial direction and the continuous shape transformation of shock waves around the tube <b>open</b> <b>end.</b> We also obtained overpressure histories of the shock wave using piezo-pressure transducers within 201 m from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube. We normalized and classified these results by four regions using non-dimensional pressure and distance which are independent of variety of mixture and tube diameter. In {{the vicinity of the}} <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube, the shock wave is nearly planar and does not significantly attenuate, and the peak overpressure maintains approximately C–J pressure. Subsequently, the shock wave attenuates rapidly, transforming from quasi-spherical to spherical. Farther from the tube <b>open</b> <b>end,</b> the shock wave propagates with approximately sound characteristic so that the peak overpressure decreases proportional to 1 /r. Eventually, the shock wave begins to attenuate more rapidly than ideal sound attenuation, which {{may be due to the}} viscous effect...|$|R
