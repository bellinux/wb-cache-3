50|$|The {{injection}} of fuel or the quantity of injected fuel has a decisive influence on engine starting, idling, power and emissions. The engine ECU is programmed ("mapped") with relevant data to where the fuel rack position has an equivalent signal {{for the amount of}} fuel being injected. The driver requests the torque or engine speed requirements via accelerator pedal potentiometer thereby sending a signal to the engine ECU which then, depending on its mapping and data collected from various sensors, calculates in real time the quantity of injected fuel required, thus altering the fuel rack to the required position.The driver can also input additional commands such as idle speed increase to compensate e.g. for PTO operation which can be either variably set or has a preset speed which can be recalled. The road speed function can be used to evaluate vehicle speed and possibly activate a speed limiter (Heavy Vehicles), or maintain or restore a set speed (cruise control). Further functions can include exhaust brake operation which, when activated, will result in the fuel pump rack position being set to zero delivery or idle. The engine ECU can also interface with various <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems</b> e.g. traction control and carry out self monitoring duties and self diagnostic functions to keep the system working at an optimal level. To ensure the safe operation in case of failure, the limp home mode functions are also integrated into the system, e.g. should the pump speed sensor fail the ECU can use an alternator speed signal function for engine RPMs counter as a backup signal.|$|E

40|$|Ultra Low Carbon Vehicles (ULCVs) include fully {{electric}} and hybrid vehicles utilising various combinations of battery systems and hydrogen based technologies. ULCVs offer many organisations with large vehicle fleets {{an opportunity to}} reduce the cost of their operations. One of the major concerns regarding the operation of ULCVs is uncertainties relating to the ongoing cost of vehicles due to issues such as replacement of major parts e. g. traction batteries, and ensuring the vehicles’ lifespan is maximised. Telematic monitoring equipment is widely used in fleet vehicles but is rarely used to its full potential and does not match the benefits exhibited by remote condition monitoring systems used in other sectors.

Optimized heat exchangers, representing an advance in the state-of-the-art in heat exchanger design, were developed to transfer heat between the orbiter Freon coolant loops and five <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems.</b> Flash evaporation was selected as a highly efficient and responsive means for cooling the Orbiter Freon loops during ascent and entry.

40|$|In recent years, a {{focus of}} {{aerospace}} engineering design has been the development of advanced design methodologies and frameworks to account for increasingly complex and integrated vehicles. Techniques such as parametric modeling, global vehicle analyses, and interdisciplinary data sharing have been employed {{in an attempt to}} improve the design process. The {{purpose of this study is}} to introduce a new approach to integrated vehicle design known as the top-down design methodology. In the top-down design methodology, the main idea is to relate design changes on the vehicle system and sub-system level to a set of over-arching performance and customer requirements.

40|$|Small, {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{are expanding}} {{the capabilities of}} aircraft systems. However, a gap exists in the size and capability of aircraft: no aircraft smaller than 10 kilograms are capable of flight faster than 100 meters per second. A small, fast aircraft requires a propulsion system which is both miniature and high-power, requirements which current UAV propulsion technologies do not meet. To meet this need, a slow-burning solid rocket motor has been developed. Such motors require slow-burning solid propellants with tailorable burn rate. This thesis reports experimental results and combustion theory for a slow-burning solid propellant. It also describes a rocket motor designed to use this propellant, and the manufacturing process used to produce it. This propellant burns slowly enough for the low-thrust, long-endurance needs of UAV propulsion. Its burn rate can be predictably tailored by addition of the burn rate suppressant oxamide. Further, this thesis presents a concept for a small, fast aircraft designed around this novel propulsion technology. The motor integrates elegantly into the aircraft's structure, and compact thermal protection system insulates <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems</b> from the heat of combustion. These results demonstrate the feasibility slow-burning rocket propulsion systems, and their application to small aircraft. It should be possible for small, rocket-propelled UAVs to sustain powered, transonic flight for several minutes. With this technology, kilogram-scale UAVs could be able to quickly deploy over tens of kilometers, and fly joint missions alongside manned fighter jets. by Matthew T. Vernacchia. Thesis: S.

40|$|AbstractLegislation on vehicle {{emissions}} {{continues to}} become more stringent {{in an effort to}} minimise the impact of internal combustion engines on the environment. One area of significant concern in this respect is that of the cold-start; the thermal efficiency of the internal combustion engine is significantly lower at cold-start than when the vehicle reaches steady state temperatures owing to sub-optimal lubricant and component temperatures. The drive for thermal efficiency (of both the internal combustion engine and of the vehicle as a whole) has led to a variety of solutions being trialled to assess their merits and effects on <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems</b> during this warm-up phase (and implemented where appropriate). The approaches have a common theme of attempting to reduce energy losses so that systems and components reach their intended operating temperature range as soon as possible after engine start. In the case of the engine, this is primarily focused on the lubricant system. Lubricant viscosity is highly sensitive to temperature and the increased viscosity at low temperatures results in higher frictional and pumping losses than would be observed at the target operating temperature. The approaches used to tackle the problem include the use of phase change materials (to reduce the cool-down rate during a period following engine running) [1, 2] and the use of thermal barrier coatings in an attempt to insulate the cylinder bore and prevent heat loss (thus increasing the amount of energy utilised as brake work [3]). A range of system alterations have also been trialled including diversion systems on the lubricant circuit to reduce thermal losses. Presented here is a critical review of the research into vehicle thermal management during the cold-start phase which has been driven by a desire to improve both engine and overall vehicle engine efficiency. The review includes both system developments and material selection issues and the role the two fields have to play in tackling this critical issue...|$|E
40|$|Early in the {{development}} of the Space Shuttle, it became clear that NASA needed a method of deploying and retrieving payloads from the payload bay. The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) was developed to fill this need. The 50 foot long robotic arm is an anthropomorphic design consisting of three electromechanical joints, six degrees of freedom, and two boom segments. Its composite boom construction provided a light weight solution needed for space operations. Additionally, a method of capturing payloads with the arm was required and a unique End Effector was developed using an electromechanical snare mechanism. The SRMS is operated using a Displays and Controls Panel and hand controllers located within the aft crew compartment of the shuttle. Although the SRMS was originally conceived to deploy and retrieve payloads, its generic capabilities allowed it to perform many other functions not originally conceived of. Over the years it has been used for deploying and retrieving constrained and free flying payloads, maneuvering and supporting EVA astronauts, satellite repair, International Space Station construction, and as a viewing aid for on-orbit International Space Station operations. After the Columbia accident, a robotically compatible Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was developed and used in conjunction with the SRMS to scan the Thermal Protection System (TPS) of the shuttle. These scans ensure there is not a breach of the TPS prior to shuttle re-entry. Ground operations and pre mission simulation, analysis and planning played a major role in the success of the SRMS program. A Systems Engineering Simulator (SES) was developed to provide a utility complimentary to open loop engineering simulations. This system provided a closed-loop real-time pilot-driven simulation giving visual feedback, display and control panel interaction, and integration with <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems,</b> such as GN&C. It has been useful for many more applications than traditional training. Evolution of the simulations, guided by the Math Model Working Group, showed the utility of input from multiple modeling groups with a structured forum for discussion.

Over the years, upgrades and enhancements were implemented to increase the capability, performance and safety of the SRMS. The history and evolution of the SRMS program provided many lessons learned that can be used for future space robotic systems...|$|E
