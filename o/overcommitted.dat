5|$|The third {{series of}} Spooks was {{produced}} by Kudos Film and Television for the BBC. Much of the production crew from the first two series returned. New crew members were brought in with the requirement that they were fans of the series and have ambition, {{so that they can}} understand Spooks. Andrew Woodhead was the series producer, with Jane Featherstone, Simon Crawford Collins and Gareth Neame as executive producers. Collins, who was the producer for the first two series, had to step back to executive producer, as he was <b>overcommitted</b> producing Kudos crime series Hustle. Woodhead replaced him as he was accustomed to the show, but also added more vitality to the show. Christopher Aird was the assistant producer. The third series included five writers. Howard Brenton wrote the first, second and eighth episodes. Rupert Walters wrote the third and ninth episodes. Ben Richards wrote the fourth, sixth and tenth episodes. Richards previously wrote the ninth episode of series two, and accepted the offer to return. His script in the second series was his first script for television; he found writing easier as time went by. Raymond Khoury wrote the seventh episode. Series creator David Wolstencroft wrote the fifth episode. Wolstencroft was poised to write the next episode, but found himself committed to other projects.|$|E
25|$|The railway mania was a {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} huge number of railway schemes were put forward, when investors imagined that huge gains on investment were certain. Investors <b>overcommitted</b> themselves, and many lost substantial sums; money became scarce even for respectable schemes as subscribers simply had no money to pay calls on their shares. At the same time labour and material prices escalated substantially.|$|E
2500|$|Effort-Reward Imbalance Model: This model {{focuses on}} the {{reciprocal}} relationship between efforts and rewards at work. [...] "More specifically, the ERI Model claims that work characterized by both high efforts and low rewards represents a reciprocity deficit between high ‘costs’ and low ‘gains’, which could elicit negative emotions in exposed employees. The accompanying feelings may cause sustained strain reactions. So, working hard without receiving adequate appreciation or being treated fairly are examples of a stressful imbalance. Another assumption of the ERI Model concerns individual differences {{in the experience of}} effort-reward imbalance. It is assumed that employees characterized by a motivational pattern of excessive job-related commitment and a high need for approval (i.e., overcommitment) will respond with more strain reactions to an effort-reward imbalance, in comparison with less <b>overcommitted</b> people." ...|$|E
50|$|Calendars {{are also}} used to help people manage their {{personal}} schedules, time and activities, particularly when individuals have numerous work, school, and family commitments. People frequently use multiple systems, and may keep both a business and family calendar to help prevent them from <b>overcommitting</b> their time.|$|R

50|$|The {{planning}} fallacy {{describes how}} {{people tend to}} not consciously think through the future in detail. This leads people to <b>overcommit</b> to different events in the future. They then realize as the events become closer that they cannot possibly complete all of the tasks that they had planned. This can {{be due to the}} events overlapping, or not having the time to fully commit to all of their previous plans.|$|R
50|$|In December 2016, the Transport Secretary {{announced}} {{his decision to}} privatise the line.

50|$|A {{number of}} small {{specialist}} sportscar companies started up in post-war France, {{and two of the}} most significant were those of Amédée Gordini, and Charles Deutsch/René Bonnet. <b>Overcommitted</b> in 1949, the 1500cc Gordinis didn’t make the start, but two new DB cars were present - one driven by the team owners themselves.|$|E
50|$|Balancing: When all programmers {{within the}} team have been {{assigned}} tasks, a comparison is made between the estimated time of the tasks and the load factor. Then the tasks are balanced out among the programmers. If a programmer is <b>overcommitted,</b> other programmers must take over some {{of his or her}} tasks and vice versa.|$|E

The results show that sulfate pollution in groundwater of Jiaozuo Area is serious; industrial pollution is the main reason for sulfate pollution in groundwater; sewage irrigation and <b>overcommitting</b> fertilizers are the important reason for the sulfate pollution in groundwater; mine drainage and the overexploitation of groundwater can accelerate the sulfate pollution in groundwater...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Contemporary superscalar processors, {{designed}} with a one-size-fitsall philosophy, grossly <b>overcommit</b> significant portions of datapath resources that remain unnecessarily activated {{in the course}} of program execution. We present a simple scheme for selectively activating regions within the register file and the reorder buffer for reducing leakage as well as dynamic power dissipation. Our techniques result in power savings in excess of 60 % in these components, on the average with no performance loss. ...|$|R
50|$|Lancaster's party {{wins the}} {{parliamentary}} election. Fallon becomes Chancellor and Graham's to head MI6. Gabriel delivers Madeline to Graham as a defector and they stage {{an apology for}} Lancaster's affair to get Fallon to <b>overcommit,</b> then take him down when he moves to withdraw {{some of the money}} in Zurich. Gabriel tries to recruit Keller to join either him or MI6 on his recommendation, but Keller's uninterested and Orsati believes the invitation impolitic.|$|R

50|$|The main {{campus is}} located on Ramsgate Road, Broadstairs. In September 2011 the college had hoped to move into {{purpose-built}} buildings at Millennium Way, Westwood {{on the outskirts of}} the town, but due to the LSC building program being <b>overcommitted</b> the planned move never occurred. The college is currently refurbishing existing buildings to provide better facilities for students. In September 2012, Thanet College was renamed to East Kent College.|$|E
5000|$|The staged {{event-driven}} architecture (SEDA) {{refers to}} an approach to software architecture that decomposes a complex, event-driven application into a set of stages connected by queues. It avoids the high overhead associated with [...] (i.e. locking, unlocking, and polling for locks), and decouples event and thread scheduling from application logic. By performing admission control on each event queue, the service can be well-conditioned to load, preventing resources from being <b>overcommitted</b> when demand exceeds service capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Although Ludendorff had {{intended}} [...] to be {{a prelude to}} a decisive offensive (...) to defeat the British forces further north, he made the error of reinforcing merely tactical success by moving reserves from Flanders to the Aisne, whereas Foch and Haig did not <b>overcommit</b> reserves to the Aisne. Ludendorff sought to extend [...] westward with Operation , intending to draw yet more Allied reserves south, widen the German salient and link with the German salient at Amiens.|$|R
50|$|In December 1271, Edward and {{his troops}} saw some action when they {{repelled}} {{an attack by}} Baibars on the city of Acre. Baibars eventually abandoned his siege of Tripoli, but the exact reason is not known. Contemporary accounts state that Edward's attacks on Baibars' interior lines forced him to abandon the siege. Some modern observers reject this interpretation, saying he instead abandoned it to avoid <b>overcommitting</b> himself in one direction {{due to a lack}} of intelligence on the Crusaders' true capabilities.|$|R
5000|$|Individuals can use timeboxing for {{personal}} tasks, as well. This technique utilizes a reduced scale of time (e.g., thirty minutes {{instead of a}} week) and deliverables (e.g., chores instead of a component of a business project). Personal timeboxing is said to help curb perfectionist tendencies (by setting a firm time and not <b>overcommitting</b> to a task). It is also suggested that personal time boxing can create an increased pressure for an individual which will lead to better creativity and focus towards a task.|$|R
50|$|Several unfortunate {{incidents}} intervened; {{the prototype}} was damaged {{in a rough}} arrested landing trial, and when repaired a month later was again damaged in a collision with a training aircraft. Once repaired again, the prototype was accepted by the Navy. However, by this time Vought was heavily <b>overcommitted</b> to other contracts, especially for the F4U Corsair fighter, and had no production capacity. It was arranged that Consolidated-Vultee would produce the aircraft (as the TBY), but this {{had to wait until}} the new production facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania was complete, which took until late 1943.|$|E
50|$|His next {{work for}} Image Comics, with Mike Huddleston on art duties, was Butcher Baker: The Righteous Maker. The {{critically}} acclaimed series ended with issue #8, {{which was published}} on August 15, 2012, ten months after issue #7, a delay that Casey stated was due to Huddleston's having <b>overcommitted</b> himself. Huddleston responded to Casey's public statement by stating that the delay was caused by his need to take over work {{in order to make}} sufficient money, as Butcher Baker was not lucrative enough for him to avoid doing so. Huddleston further explained that he apologized to Casey and to fans for the delay.|$|E
50|$|By late 1960, it {{was clear}} that no British Government {{department}} was prepared to provide full financing for the programme, and that neither would any of Britain's allies across the Commonwealth of Nations be prepared to make major contributions {{in order to meet the}} shortfall. Most Commonwealth members either lacked the resources to spare in order to participate, or lacked interest in doing so. Canada was already <b>overcommitted</b> to its existing space-related scientific commitments, while Australia reportedly lacked interest in the programme beyond supporting operations at Woomera; accordingly, the prospects for a joint programme to develop and operate the Black Knight were very dim.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} at 08:30, Japanese air attacks resumed, {{with no more than}} nine {{aircraft}} attacking at a time. The same targets as the previous day were attacked, and also the Government House in Agana and several villages. That evening, a Japanese invasion fleet of four heavy cruisers, four destroyers, two gunboats, six submarine chasers, two minesweepers and two destroyer tenders left Saipan for Guam. A mistake in their intelligence gathering had caused the Japanese to <b>overcommit</b> resources and attack Guam with disproportionate force.|$|R

We're both <b>overcommitted.</b> Byron's a good friend and I tried to do what I could for him, so I said I would do this book.

2500|$|One of Ali's {{greatest}} tricks {{was to make}} opponents <b>overcommit</b> {{by pulling}} straight backward from punches. Disciplined, world-class boxers chased Ali and threw themselves off balance attempting to hit him because {{he seemed to be}} an open target, only missing and leaving themselves exposed to Ali's counter punches, usually a chopping right. Slow motion replays show that this was precisely the way Sonny Liston was hit and apparently knocked out by Ali in their second fight. Ali often flaunted his movement by dancing the [...] "Ali Shuffle", a sort of center-ring jig. Ali's early style was so unusual that he was initially discounted because he reminded boxing writers of a lightweight, and it was assumed he would be vulnerable to big hitters like Sonny Liston.|$|R
