Inflammation is still considered the pivotal inducer of both components of joint damage. Results of recent animal studies suggested a prominent contribution of osteoclastic bone resorption that could be dissociated from inflammation. RANKL and its natural decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG), play key roles in <b>osteoclast</b> <b>activation.</b> In a group of patients with early RA not treated with disease-modifying drugs, we tested the hypothesis that <b>osteoclast</b> <b>activation,</b> reflected by the serum OPG:RANKL ratio at baseline, is negatively associated with progression of bone damage, independent of inflammation. OPG and RANKL levels, together with a parameter of inflammation (first-year time-averaged erythrocyte sedimentation rate [tESR]), were measured in 92 patients with newly diagnosed early active RA who were participants in a randomized study. The tESR and the OPG:RANKL ratio were evaluated for the ability to predict 5 -year radiographic progression of joint damage. The first-year tESR and the OPG:RANKL ratio, as measured at baseline, independently predicted 5 -year radiographic progression of joint damage (both P <or = 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction and objectives: coeliac disease (CD) affects around 1 - 2 % of {{the world}} population. Most {{patients}} are now diagnosed when adults, suffering the consequences of an impaired bone mineralization. This review aims to provide an updated discussion {{on the relationship between}} low bone mineral density (BMD), osteopenia and osteoporosis, and CD. Methods: a PubMed search restricted to the last 15 years was conducted. Sources cited in the results were also reviewed to identify potential sources of information. Results: low BMD affects up to 75 % of celiac patients, and can be found at any age, independently of positive serological markers and presence of digestive symptoms. The prevalence of CD among osteoporotic patients is also significantly increased. Two theories try to explain this origin of low BMD: Micronutrients malabsorption (including calcium and vitamin D) determined by villous atrophy has been related to secondary hyperparathyroidism and incapacity to achieve the potential bone mass peak; chronic inflammation was also related with RANKL secretion, <b>osteoclasts</b> <b>activation</b> and increased bone resorption. As a consequence, celiac patients have a risk for bone fractures that exceed 40 % that of matched non-affected population. Treatment of low BMD in CD comprises gluten-free diet, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and biphosphonates, although its effects on CD have not been specifically assessed. Conclusions: up to 75 % of celiac patients and 40 % of that diagnosed in adulthood present a low BMD and a variable increase in the risk of bone fractures.

The pathophysiological mechanism underlying ONJ {{has not been}} fully elucidated. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the role of RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling pathway and, in parallel, to evaluate angiogenic and matrix mineralization processes in jaw bone necrotic samples obtained from bisphosphonate-treated subjects with established ONJ. Necrotic bone samples and native bone samples were processed for Light and Field Emission in Lens Scanning Electron Microscope (FEISEM) analyses, for Real-Time RT-PCR to evaluate the gene expression of TNFRSF 11 A (RANK), TNFSF 11 (RANKL), and TNFSF 11 B (OPG) and for immunohistochemical analyses of VEGF and BSP expression. Morphological analyses performed by Light microscope and FEISEM show empty osteocytic lacunae and alteration of lamellar organization with degradation of the mineralized bone matrix in necrotic bone samples. A significant increase in TNFRSF 11 A, TNFSF 11, TRAF 6 and NFAT 2 gene expression, and a reduction of TNFSF 11 B gene transcription level compared is also showed in necrotic bone compared to control samples. No significant difference of VEGF expression is evidenced, while lower BSP expression in necrotic bone compared to healthy samples is found. Even if the pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-associated ONJ remains unknown, a link between oral pathogens and its development seems to exist. We suppose lipopolysaccharide produced by bacteria colonizing and infecting necrotic bone and the surrounding viable area could trigger RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling pathway and, in this context, <b>osteoclasts</b> <b>activation</b> could be considered as a protective strategy carried out by the host bone tissue to delimitate the necrotic area and to counteract infection...|$|R
40|$|Mineralized {{collagen}} composites are {{of interest}} {{because they have the}} potential to provide a bone-like scaffold that stimulates the natural processes of resorption and remodeling. Working towards this goal, our group has previously shown that the nanostructure of bone can be reproduced using a polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process, which enables intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen with hydroxyapatite to be achieved. This prior work used polyaspartic acid (pASP), a simple mimic for acidic non-collagenous proteins, to generate nanodroplets/nanoparticles of an amorphous mineral precursor which can infiltrate the interstices of type-I collagen fibrils. In this study we show that osteopontin (OPN) can similarly serve as a process-directing agent for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen, even though OPN is generally considered a mineralization inhibitor. We also found that inclusion of OPN in the mineralization process promotes the interaction of mouse marrow-derived osteoclasts with PILP-remineralized bone that was previously demineralized, as measured by actin ring formation. While <b>osteoclast</b> <b>activation</b> occurred when pASP was used as the process-directing agent, using OPN resulted in a dramatic effect on <b>osteoclast</b> <b>activation,</b> presumably because of the inherent arginine–glycine–aspartate acid ligands of OPN.
