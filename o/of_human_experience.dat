40|$|Abstract — There are {{at least}} two kinds of methods of {{designing}} (computational) verb proportional-integral-derivative(PID) controllers. The first one is to generalize fuzzy PID controllers by substituting “BE ” in fuzzy control rules with non-static computational verbs. The second one is to directly construct evolving functions <b>of</b> verbs in <b>human</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> dynamic processes. These methods will lead to different architectures of verb PID controllers because computational verb theory can be used in different situations where adjectives or noun phrases have different computational interpretations. Three examples of these computational interpretations of nouns are crisp, fuzzy and probabilistic. Correspondingly, a PID controller can be designed based on crisp or fuzzy representations <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experiences.</b> If the dynamic aspects <b>of</b> these <b>human</b> <b>experiences</b> are emphasized explicitly, the resulting design principle must take advantage o...|$|R

25|$|It is {{the form}} that allows a writer the {{greatest}} opportunity to explore human experience....For that reason, reading a novel is potentially a significant act. Because {{there are so many}} varieties <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience,</b> so many kinds of interaction between humans, and so many ways of creating patterns in the novel that can’t be created in a short story, a play, a poem or a movie. The novel, simply, offers more opportunities for a reader to understand the world better, including the world of artistic creation. That sounds pretty grand, but I think it’s true.|$|E
25|$|In one of Kant's major works, the Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, 1781), he {{attempted}} to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and {{to move beyond the}} failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics. Kant wanted {{to put an end to}} an era of futile and speculative theories <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience,</b> while resisting the skepticism of thinkers such as David Hume. Kant regarded himself as ending and showing the way beyond the impasse which modern philosophy had led to between rationalists and empiricists, and is widely held to have synthesized these two early modern traditions in his thought.|$|E
25|$|After her First Communion {{at the age}} of nine, she practised {{in secret}} severe {{corporal}} mortification, until rheumatic fever confined her to bed for four years. At the end of this period, having made a vow to the Blessed Virgin to consecrate herself to religious life, she was instantly restored to perfect health. In recognition of this favor, she added the name Mary to her baptismal name of Margaret. According to her later account of her life, she had visions of Jesus Christ, which she thought were a normal part <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> and continued to practice austerity.|$|E

25|$|His leading {{views on}} {{democracy}} included: “First, Dewey believed {{that democracy is}} an ethical ideal rather than merely a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making...Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society”. This helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jacques Lacan {{approached}} psychoanalysis through linguistics and literature. Lacan {{believed that}} Freud's essential {{work had been}} done prior to 1905 and concerned the interpretation of dreams, neurotic symptoms, and slips, which had been based on a revolutionary way of understanding language {{and its relation to}} experience and subjectivity, and that ego psychology and object relations theory were based upon misreadings of Freud's work. For Lacan, the determinative dimension <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> is neither the self (as in ego psychology) nor relations with others (as in object relations theory), but language. Lacan saw desire as more important than need and considered it necessarily ungratifiable.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomena}} {{for which}} Plato had to account were of three kinds, ethical, epistemological, and ontological. In {{each of these}} spheres there had been developed {{by the end of}} the fifth century doctrines so extremely paradoxical that there seemed to be no possibility of reconciling them with one another or any one of them with the observable facts <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience.</b> The dialogues of Plato, I believe, will furnish evidence to show that he considered it necessary to find a single hypothesis which would at once solve the problems of these several spheres and also create a rationally unified cosmos by establishing the connection among the separate phases of experience.|$|E

25|$|Juvenal claims as his purview, {{the entire}} gamut <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> {{since the dawn}} of history. Quintilian – {{in the context of a}} {{discussion}} of literary genres appropriate for an oratorical education - claimed that, unlike so many literary and artistic forms adopted from Greek models, “satire at least is all ours” (satura quidem tota nostra est). At least in the view of Quintillian, earlier Greek satiric verse (e.g. that of Hipponax) or even Latin satiric prose (e.g. that of Petronius) did not constitute satura, per se. Roman Satura was a formal literary genre rather than being simply clever, humorous critique in no particular format.|$|E
25|$|Postmodern psychotherapies such as {{narrative}} {{therapy and}} coherence therapy did not impose definitions {{of mental health}} and illness, but rather saw the goal of therapy as something constructed by the client and therapist in a social context. Systemic therapy also developed, which focuses on family and group dynamics—and transpersonal psychology, which focuses on the spiritual facet <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience.</b> Other orientations developed {{in the last three}} decades include feminist therapy, brief therapy, somatic psychology, expressive therapy, applied positive psychology and the human givens approach. A survey of over 2,500 US therapists in 2006 revealed the most utilized models of therapy and the ten most influential therapists of the previous quarter-century.|$|E
25|$|During reincarnation {{consciousness}} {{tries to}} liberate {{itself from the}} burden of collected impressions. Yet, since it tries to achieve this by associating itself with impressions opposite from the previously accumulated ones, it gets further entangled in accumulating fresh impressions. Thus the soul experiences itself in a seemingly endless succession of human lives, as {{a man or a}} woman, as rich or poor, strong or weak, beautiful or ugly, black or white, in various places, religions, castes etc. It is only after numerous apparent births and deaths, that the range <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> starts to get exhausted. In this way the soul starts dissociating itself from the gross world, enabling its consciousness to become aware of the subtle sphere.|$|E

25|$|Some scientists, such as Stephen Jay Gould, {{consider}} {{science and}} religion to be two compatible and complementary fields, with authorities in distinct areas <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience,</b> so-called non-overlapping magisteria. This view is also held by many theologians, who believe that ultimate origins and meaning are addressed by religion, but favor verifiable scientific explanations of natural phenomena over those of creationist beliefs. Other scientists, such as Richard Dawkins, reject the non-overlapping magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts {{as a source of}} truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the scientific consensus is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{religion}} {{are based on}} different aspects <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience.</b> In science, explanations {{must be based on}} evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science {{and religion}} are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.|$|E
25|$|Passion {{begins with}} a long {{introductory}} foray into the Western philosophical tradition of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger {{that is at the}} heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion {{is at the heart of}} this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E
