5|$|As CAS, Williams had {{to contend}} with serious {{challenges}} to the RAAF's continued existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According to Williams, only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>in</b> the Army and Navy. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.|$|E

Twenty five years later the 47th would once again guard this bridge during World War II. The regiment remained here until given orders to return home in mid-summer 1919. Before his departure from Europe, Middleton was summoned {{to report to the}} Third Army Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>in</b> Koblenz. Here he was informed that he and other senior officers were being assigned to Camp Benning, Georgia to form the first faculty of the Infantry School that was being established there. Middleton sailed out of Brest in mid-July, met his wife in New York, and together they traveled to Columbus, Georgia by way of Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Implicit in the {{decision}} to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them. Lacking open, thinly-populated areas, British officials considered locations overseas. The preferred site was the American Pacific Proving Grounds. A request to use it was sent to the American Joint Chiefs <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 1950, but no reply was received until October 1950, when the Americans turned down the request. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. Penney spoke to Omond Solandt, the chairman of the Canadian Defence Research Board, and they arranged for a joint feasibility study.|$|E

An actual military coup was undertaken on 24thMarch 1982 by the sitting Army chief <b>of</b> <b>staff.</b> <b>In</b> the 1980s, Bangladesh pioneered {{the formation of the}} South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and hosted its first summit in Dhaka.

5|$|When Air Chief Marshal Burnett {{completed}} his term in 1942, Williams was once more {{considered for the}} role of CAS. This was vetoed by Prime Minister John Curtin and the appointment unexpectedly went to acting Air Commodore George Jones.

Instead Williams was posted to Washington, D.C. as the RAAF's representative to the Combined Chiefs <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>in</b> the United States, and remained there {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|After the Machtergreifung (NSDAP {{seizure of}} power) in January 1933, the relief fund was {{repurposed}} to provide general accident and property insurance, so Bormann resigned from its administration.

Bormann also served as personal secretary to Hess from 4 July 1933 until May 1941. Hess' department was responsible for settling disputes within the party and acted as an intermediary between {{the party and the}} state regarding policy decisions and legislation. Bormann used his position to create an extensive bureaucracy and involve himself in as much of the decision-making as possible. On 10 October 1933 Hitler named Bormann Reichsleiter (national leader – the highest party rank) of the NSDAP, and in November he was named Reichstag deputy. By June 1934, Bormann was gaining acceptance into Hitler's inner circle and accompanied him everywhere, providing briefings and summaries of events and requests.|$|E

From 1948 to 1951, he served as chairman of the council of the Festival of Britain, helping to organise and promote the event.

Ismay accepted the position, but resigned after only six months to become the first Secretary General of NATO in 1952. He served in this role until 1957, and helped establish and define the position. After retiring from NATO, Ismay wrote his memoirs, The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay, served on a variety of corporate boards, and co-chaired the Ismay–Jacob Committee, which reorganised the Ministry of Defence once again. He died on 17 December 1965, at his home Wormington Grange, Gloucestershire.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Tang {{slipped out of}} the city, however, the entire Nanking Garrison Force was rapidly {{disintegrating}} with some units in open flight. Furthermore, contact had already been lost with many units who thus never received Tang's message and continued to hold their positions as ordered, though even those that did receive it had little luck at slipping through the Japanese lines. China's 66th and 83rd Corps made a bid to evade the Japanese as planned through a gap to the east but immediately ran into their own minefield. After that they were attacked in flight by Japanese units and lost two divisional chiefs <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>in</b> combat. Though the two corps had started the battle at least 11,000 men strong, only 600 of them escaped Nanking. Near dawn on December 13 a portion of China's 74th Corps was also annihilated in a bid to break through Japanese lines along the Yangtze River south of Nanking.|$|E
