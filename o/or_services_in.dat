25|$|Largely {{due to the}} {{population}} exodus from St. Louis City, dating to the 1920s and accelerating through the 1950s, St. Louis government leaders made several attempts at consolidating government <b>or</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> the region. Among the earliest of these was an attempt in 1926, fostered by a state constitutional amendment, which allowed a Board of Freeholders to create a plan in which the city would annex all of St. Louis County. While the plan passed among city voters {{by a margin of}} seven to one, it failed in the county by three to one, and a 1930 constitutional amendment allowing consolidation of only some services also failed, largely due to its overwhelming rejection by county voters. Only after World War II would more efforts be made toward consolidation of services.|$|E

500|$|Advertisements {{are used}} to attract {{customers}} to a business’ products <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, they are also making statements regarding race, social class, gender, values, and [...] family. They not only describe these social categories, they prescribe behaviors or show one {{how it is that}} they should act in accordance with social ideals or norms. According to Belk and Pollay, “not only do [...] show us the ideal life, they instruct us [...] how to live.” Through targeting specific groups of people for products and services, advertisements both reflect changes of social norms and are changers of social norms regarding acceptable behavior. Some argue that the image of family only plays a symbolic role by reflecting the current cultural values. Advertisements may not only reflect changes in social norms, but also be asserting that such behavior is acceptable. As a result, sociologists have challenged the public to study ads containing images of the family not just as marketing messages but also as vehicles for behavior and attitudes towards society.|$|E
