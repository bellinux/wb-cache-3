50|$|In North America, semaphores were {{employed}} as train <b>order</b> <b>signals,</b> {{with the purpose}} of indicating to engineers whether they should stop to receive a telegraphed order. It was common for train <b>order</b> <b>signals</b> to point the arm straight down to indicate 'proceed'. Train <b>order</b> <b>signals</b> were typically located at the station building, with a tall common post mounting signal arms facing in opposing directions.|$|R

50|$|A {{contributing}} factor was {{the failure of}} the express engineman to properly observe the train <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> at Shepherdsville. However the system (in which all signals were held in the stop position until an approaching train, within 600 yards of the signal sounded four short blasts to request the signal be cleared) was unworkable since, if the engineman fails to see the clearing of the signal, then he is required to stop at the signal; but high-speed trains such as the Flyer required considerably more distance than 600 yards to come to a halt.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the {{semaphore}} at Lebanon Station parking lot is unknown; however it is representative of a typical train order semaphore, which was used to convey different messages to an approaching train by changing the positioning of the arm. The train <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> had three color and blade positions, Green (vertical) indicating no orders, Yellow (diagonal 45 degrees) indicating pick up orders while moving, and Red (horizontal) indicating stop and sign for orders after reading them as verification with the block operator, who controlled the signal. The signal was built by the Union Switch and Signal of Swissvale Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. It is a donation from the Lebanon Kiwanis Club.|$|E
5000|$|... "The synchro control {{transformer}} receives the <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> which indicates electrically what {{the position of}} the load should be. The rotor of the synchro {{control transformer}} is turned by the response shaft, which is geared to the load and so indicates what {{the position of the}} load actually is. The synchro compares the actual load position with the ordered position; and, if the two do not agree, it generates an alternating-current signal which is transmitted to the amplifier. The angular difference between the two positions is called the error, and the signal to the amplifier is the error signal. The error signal indicates by its electrical characteristics the size and direction of the error. If no error exists, the system is said to be in correspondence and the error signal is zero." ...|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} signals can include Train <b>Order</b> <b>signals,</b> manual block signals or signals {{governing}} special safety appliances such as slide fences, non-interlocked sidings, road crossings, etc. These {{are much less}} common than the three standard types.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we explore a simple method for {{reducing}} the bit rate needed for transmitting and storing Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA). The HOA B-format signals are simply encoded using Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) {{as if they were}} individual mono signals. Wave field simulations show that by allocating more bits to the lower <b>order</b> <b>signals</b> than the higher the resulting error is very low in the sweet spot, but increases as function of distance from the center. Encoding the higher <b>order</b> <b>signals</b> with a low bit rate does not lead to a reduced audio quality. The spatial information is improved when higher-order channels are included, even if these are encoded with a low bit rate...|$|R
5000|$|Train {{orders were}} {{issued by the}} {{dispatcher}} responsible for the portion of railroad concerned. They were conveyed to operators at outlying stations along the railroad via telegraph or telephone. The receiving operators would copy the order onto onionskin (multiple-copy) forms designed for that purpose, and would repeat the order back to the dispatcher. This permitted the dispatcher and other operators concerned to confirm the accuracy or the order. As each operator correctly repeated the order, the dispatcher would give a complete time, along with the initials of the designated railroad official for that territory. After the order was completed, it was delivered by the operator to the concerned trains as they arrived or passed the delivery point. The operating timetable indicated locations at which train crews could expect to receive train orders. If that same timetable did not require that a train receive a [...] "Clearance Form A" [...] before departing, then a train <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> of some type was provided to advise train crews whether or not train orders were to be delivered. Delivery was accomplished by hand, if the train stopped, or posted trackside to be grabbed by a crew member while the train continued to move past the station. With the latter, the paper order {{was placed in a}} train order fork or hoop, either held by the operator as the train passed or mounted at trackside.|$|E
40|$|Taking {{into account}} that {{transaction}} prices are realized at the bid or the ask price, we propose a probabilistic neural network model and a Bayesian rule to predict the incoming <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> of a stock and its probability using the buy-sell trade indicator or trade direction sign. We consider {{that if there is}} any private information to be inferred from trade, agents can use a trade equation to form an expectation about the future trade based on the trade and quote revision history. In addition, we use it to analyse the classification and forecasting capacity of various discrete regression and probabilistic neural network models to estimate the probability of an incoming <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> by means of statistical and economic criteria. Our results indicate that the probabilistic neural network classifies and predicts slightly better than linear, Probit and MLP models for short forecast horizons, among other statistical criteria, and reversed trades with respect to the economic assessment of the negotiation for both short and long forecast horizons.

The iterations lead to a performance gain only if a suitable mapping of the bits to the complex transmit symbols is chosen. We investigate properties of mappings and compare different methods to find mappings optimized for arbitrary, high <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> constellations...|$|E

40|$|The book {{tries to}} briefly {{introduce}} the diverse literatures {{in the field}} of fractional <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> processing which is becoming an emerging topic among an interdisciplinary community of researchers. This book is aimed at postgraduate and beginning level research scholars who would like to work {{in the field of}} Fractional <b>Order</b> <b>Signal</b> processing (FOSP). The readers should have preliminary knowledge about basic signal processing techniques. Prerequisite knowledge of fractional calculus is not essential and is exposited at relevant places in connection to the appropriate signal processing topics. Basic signal processing techniques like filtering, estimation, system identification, etc. in the light of fractional order calculus are presented along with relevant application areas. The readers can easily extend these concepts to varied disciplines like image or speech processing, pattern recognition, time series forecasting, financial data analysis and modeling, traffic modeling in communication channels, optics, biomedical signal processing, electrochemical applications and many more. Adequate references are provided in each category so that the researchers can delve deeper into each area and broaden their horizon of understanding. Available MATLAB tools to simulate FOSP theories are also introduced so that the readers can apply the theoretical concepts right-away and gain practical insight in the specific domain...|$|E

In this paper, we evaluate mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) estimation techniques, namely the classical FFT and linear prediction based implemen-tations and an implementation based on the more recent MVDR spectral estimator. The performance of these meth-ods are evaluated in genre classification using a probabilis-tic classifier based on Gaussian Mixture models. MFCCs based on fixed <b>order,</b> <b>signal</b> independent linear prediction and MVDR spectral estimators did not exhibit any statisti-cally significant improvement over MFCCs based on the sim-pler FFT. 1...|$|E
30|$|With {{respect to}} {{solutions}} of global phase-shifting values among interferograms, Farrell and Player proposed a method based on Lissajous figure fitting [8]. Brug proposed a method based on {{calculation of the}} correlation between two images [9]. Goldberg and Bokor, et al., proposed a method based on single-point Fourier transform [10], which calculates global phase-shifting by comparing the changes in power of the carrier frequency between two interferograms. However, all interference signals have limited length; carrier frequency {{is not a single}} frequency; spectral leakage may occur on the +[*] 1 (or −[*] 1) <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> frequency spectrum. Calculated the power change in a single frequency, alone, cannot comprehensively reflect the change in the global phase-shifting and cause the loss of calculation precision. Guo and Rong, et al., proposed an Energy-minimum Fourier Transform algorithm (EMFT) [11]. This method attempts to locate the best range of +[*] 1 (or −[*] 1) <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> frequency spectrum from the power spectrum, and therefore can increase the calculation precision for global phase-shifting under the same conditions. However, the interferograms from the measurements are affected by a variety of factors such as the effect of interferograms apodization, the uneven background, the signal envelope and the random noise. As a result, spectral aliasing may occur between the sideband of +[*] 1 (or −[*] 1) order spectrum and zero <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> frequency spectrum. This issue significantly reduces the precision of the calculation results, especially when the carrier frequency is low. Therefore, some methods for zero order spectrum elimination or suppression were proposed [12, 13]. In recent years, methods with Hilbert Transform (HT) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), aided by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) have been used to suppress the unevenness of background [14 – 16]. On one hand, this issue reduces the robustness of the algorithms; on the other hand, because the generation of interferograms are constraint by the detector and hardware configuration, the choice of carrier frequency is not unlimited. In order to resolve this problem, Vishnyakov and Levin, et al., proposed a method to first do subtraction between two interferograms and then perform the Fourier Transform. This can effectively avoid the spectral aliasing and preserve relatively high calculation precision even when the carrier frequency is low [17, 18]. However, under this method, three interferograms are required for calculation, which limits its applicability.|$|E
40|$|In {{the cell}} the second {{messenger}} cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP mediate {{a wide variety}} of external signals. Both signaling molecules are degraded by the superfamily of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) consisting of more than 50 different isoforms. Several of these PDEs are implicated in disease processes inspiring the quest for and synthesis of selective PDE inhibitors, that unfortunately have led to very mixed successes in clinical trials. This may be partially caused by their pharmacological action. Accumulating data suggests that small differences between different PDE isoforms may already result in specific tissue distributions, cellular localization and different involvement in higher <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> protein complexes. The role of PDEs in these higher <b>order</b> <b>signal</b> protein complexes has only been marginally addressed, as no screening methodology is available to address this in a more comprehensive way. Affinity based chemical proteomics is a relatively new tool to identify specific protein-protein interactions. Here, to study the interactome of PDEs, we synthesized a broad spectrum PDE-capturing resin based on the non-selective PDE inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX). Chemical proteomics characterization of this resin in HeLa cell lysates led to the capture of several different PDEs. Combining the IBMX-resin with in-solution competition with the available more selective PDE inhibitors, cilostamide and papaverine, allowed us to selectively probe the interactome of PDE 3 A in HeLa cells. Besides known interactors such as the family of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins, PDE 3 A was found to associate with a PP 2 A complex composed of a regulatory, scaffold and catalytic subunit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Polyspectra {{are related}} to Fourier {{transforms}} of moment or cumulant functions of any <b>order</b> of random <b>signals.</b> They {{play an important role}} in many problems of signal analysis and processing. However, there are only a few statistical models giving explicitly the expression of polyspectra. <b>Ordered</b> <b>signals</b> are signals for which the explicit expression of the moment functions requires that the time instants appearing in these moments are put in an increasing order. There are many examples of such signals, the best known being the random telegraph signal constructed from a Poisson process. Some of these examples are presented and analyzed. The origin of the ordering structure is related with the point that real time is an oriented variable making a difference between past and future. This especially appears in Markov processes. The calculation of polyspectra is difficult because ordering is not adapted to Fourier analysis. By an appropriate grouping of various terms, the explicit expression of spectral moment functions is obtained. It shows in particular that many <b>ordered</b> <b>signals</b> present a normal density on the normal manifolds of the frequency domain and another contribution on the stationary manifold that is explicitly calculated. The analysis of the structure of this expression allows us to discuss some relationships with normal distribution, central limit theorem, and time reversibility.

This signal originates in the coupling of the free electron fluctuation to the quadruple moment of the temperature anisotropy.
