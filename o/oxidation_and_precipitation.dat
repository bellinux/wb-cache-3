40|$|Continuous iron {{oxidation}} {{and removal}} of jarosite precipitates from solution at low pH, ambient temperature and pressure was successfully demonstrated with a two-stage airlift bioreactor (ALBR) system. The ALBR system, comprising of two ALBRs, {{each with its}} own settler, was operated for iron <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> at room temperature with a mixed culture of mesophilic iron oxidisers. The two-stage reactor design allowed optimization of the overall reactor kinetics by facilitating the growth of two distinct groups of iron oxidizers at low (430 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) and high (517 mV) redox potential in the two reactors, respectively. The influent with pH 1. 5 contained (g L− 1) 15 Fe 2 +, 1. 5 Cu, 1. 5 Ni, nutrients and trace elements. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was decreased stepwise to evaluate process performance. With the lowest HRTs (8 h in ALBR 1 and 10 h in ALBR 2), the overall iron <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> rates of the two-stage system were 0. 75 ± 0. 02 g L− 1 h− 1 and 0. 15 ± 0. 01 g L− 1 h− 1, respectively and overall iron <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> of 94 ± 3 % and 18 ± 1 %, respectively. The percent of influent Fe, S, Cu and Ni removed as precipitates from settlers were 30. 9 %, 16. 7 %, 1. 1 % and 0. 2 %, respectively. The precipitates were predominately comprised of (> 95 %) jarosite with potassium jarosite being the dominant form, followed by hydronium, ammonium and sodium jarosites. In conclusion, the two-stage ALBR system allowed efficient iron <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> of the oxidised iron as well settling jarosite with only minor loss of Cu and Ni via co-precipitation. The process demonstrated performance that is promising for a variety of hydrometallurgical process flow sheets, where it allows iron removal from ferrous solutions without chemical addition and with negligible base metal co-precipitation losses...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. The <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> of iron are key {{reactions}} {{in the treatment}} of hydrometallurgical waste water and acid mine drainage (AMD) by the high density sludge process (HDS). The removal of other pollutants by adsorption and coprecipitation using this technique depends on the nature and the process by which iron is removed. Although this technique is cheap and easy to operate and therefore the most common method by which hydrometallurgical waste water is treated, there are some problems inherent in this technique. Such problems include; the formation of gelatinous sludge which is difficult to dewater, the low solids density resulting in considerable water losses and a large land area for sludge disposal, the instability of the sludge thus requiring post neutralisation stabilisation and the formation of the solids as mixed sludge, thus diminishing chances for waste material recovery, reuse or recycle. In view of the above problems, the objectives of the present study were; to gain more understanding of the <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> reactions of iron through investigating the effect of pH on the oxidation rate and on the chemical and physical characteristics of the iron precipitates, to make an inference on the mechanisms by which iron precipitates are formed and finally to investigate the effect of seeding on the <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> of iron. To achieve the set objectives, experiments were carried out in a 4 L perspex batch reactor. The reactor was fitted with four equally spaced buffles and a draft tube to maximise mixing. Ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) was added as FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O at initial concentrations of 200 mg/L and oxidised using air. pH control was achieved by titration with either 0. 1 M NaOH or 0. 1 M H 2 SO 4 through a custom made Hitech Micro Systems controller. The reactions were carried out at pH levels 6. 0, 8. 0, 9. 0 and 10. 0. Three types of materials (recycled solids, natural haematite and natural goethite) at three concentration levels (Cs = 1. 0, 0. 5 and 0. 1) were used as seed material in the seeded experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{rates of}} Fe(II) <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> from {{groundwater}} are highly pH dependent. Elevated levels of dissolved CO 2 can depress pH and cause difficulty in removing dissolved Fe and associated metals during treatment of ferruginous water. This paper demonstrates interdependent changes in pH, dissolved inorganic C species, and Fe(II) oxidation rates that {{occur as a}} result of the removal (degassing) of CO 2 during aeration of waters discharged from abandoned coal mines. The results of field monitoring of aeration cascades at a treatment facility as well as batchwise aeration experiments conducted using net alkaline and net acidic waters in the UK are combined with geochemical modelling to demonstrate the spatial and temporal evolution of the discharge water chemistry. The aeration cascades removed approximately 67 % of the dissolved CO 2 initially present but varying the design did not affect the concentration of Fe(II) leaving the treatment ponds. Continued removal of the residual CO 2 by mechanical aeration increased pH by as much as 2 units and resulted in large increases in the rates of Fe(II) <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Effective exsolution of CO 2 led to a reduction in the required lime dose for removal of remaining Fe(II), a very important factor with regard to increasing the sustainability of treatment practices. An important ancillary finding for passive treatment is that varying the design of the cascades had little impact on the rate of CO 2 removal at the flow rates measured...|$|E

30|$|The {{oxidation}} {{mechanisms of}} green rusts have been extensively studied. This reaction can imply transformations via solution, i.e., dissolution, <b>oxidation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> {{of the resulting}} ferric oxy-hydroxides, lepidocrocite, and goethite [18, 19]. Otherwise, a solid-state oxidation of green rusts involving both the conversion of FeII to FeIII inside the crystal lattice and the charge-compensating loss of protons is also possible [19 – 22]. The latter mechanism especially occurs when high oxidation rate is imposed, for example, by reaction with some soluble oxidizers such as H 2 O 2. The resulting ferric products, named as ‘exGR-Fe(III)’ or as ‘ferric green rust’, keep the same apparent morphology as the initial green rusts; only local disorders at nanometric scale are induced, {{as indicated by the}} disappearance or the large decrease of (00 l) lines in diffraction patterns [19, 21, 22].|$|E

Acoustic oscillations are currently widely used in various industrial sectors, including water treatment, metallurgy, chemical and food industry, equipment manufacturing and medicine. When materials are affected by acoustic fields, physical-chemical processes begin.

30|$|According to {{previous}} investigators, e.g., [7, 10], {{the mechanism of}} formation of Mn rock varnishes involves multiple steps: (1) accumulation of externally derived clay-bearing dust on a rock surface [10], (2) transport of Mn to the rock surface in solution within rain/fog droplets, and (3) <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> of Mn oxide cementing previously unconsolidated clay into a heterogeneous nanophase mixture. Step 1 was recently bolstered by the observation that anticorrelated Mn and Si electron microprobe analyses for desert varnish have a common Mn-free end-member regardless of {{the composition of the}} varnished rock [24]. Regarding step 2, one may question whether Mn is derived locally from the host rock or externally via atmospheric transportation [8]. In this study we report the presence of hematite, titanite, and rutile in the Seneca sandstone, which may all serve as internal reservoirs of Mn. However, to within the sensitivity of our compositional imaging we find no evidence for solution transportation of Mn in the sandstone. Based upon rare earth element fractionation observed in desert varnish {{it has been argued that}} the degree of element fractionation observed is inconsistent with isochemical leaching and reprecipitation within the same rock [26]. Therefore, the source of Mn must be delivered to the rock surface externally via atmospheric transport and surface leaching/dissolution of airborne dust grains. The final step 3 requires <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> of Mn either by a physiochemical process under acidic oxidized conditions in rainwater [26] or via microbially assisted oxidation as favored by other investigators [7, 11, 27]. The microstructural imagery collected on the Smithsonian Castle varnish offers no evidence for microbial entombment in Mn oxide, and the organisms observed on the surface (Fig.  14) grew upon the varnish and therefore may not be related to Mn oxidizing microbes. Apart from local compositional heterogeneity discussed above, another factor to consider regarding the likelihood of varnish development is stone roughness. Rougher areas provide increased surface area for condensation and therefore deposition of atmospheric dust. However, no systematic associations between surface roughness and rock varnish have been noted on the building stone and gateposts.|$|E

The ooids consist mainly of hematite with minor boehmite and anatase, whereas in the matrix boehmite prevails on hematite, kaolinite and anatase. In the void fillings in the matrix there is a Ca-fluorocarbonate having a Ce/Ce* of 5. 8.

The matrix exhibits a large positive Ce-anomaly whereas the ooids have negative Ce-anomaly. The Ce fractionation between the textural components can be explained assuming: (1) Ce <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> cerianite <b>precipitation</b> in the uppermost part of the deposits; (2) scavenging of REE from Ce-depleted percolating solutions by the iron oxide, inducing both REE-enrichment and Ce-negative anomalies in ooids; (3) remobilization of cerium as fluoride complex, as a consequence of more acidic conditions in the uppermost part of the deposit, <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> of Ce 3 + as fluorocarbonate mineral toward the carbonate bedrock barrier, at alkaline pH.

Temporal variation in surface acidity would have been controlled by the availability of liquid water, and as such, low-pH fluids could be a natural consequence of the aridification of the martian surface. Finally, because iron oxidation at Meridiani would have generated large amounts of gaseous H_ 2, ultimately derived from the reduction of H_ 2 O, we conclude that surface geochemical processes would have affected the redox state of the early martian atmosphere...|$|R

The results suggest that: (i) for the pH range of natural waters (> 4. 5), the high volumetric expansion of Fe 0 during <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation</b> dictates that Fe 0 should be mixed with a non-expansive material; (ii) naturally occurring solute precipitates have a negligible impact on permeability loss compared to Fe 0 expansive corrosion; and (iii) the proliferation of H 2 metabolizing bacteria may contribute to alleviate permeability loss. As a consequence, it is suggested that more emphasis must be placed on future work with regard to considering the Fe 0 PRB system as a physical (size-exclusion) water filter device...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the atmospheric dispersion of pollution by computing the emission, transport and removal of idealized insoluble gaseous and water-soluble aerosol tracers, tagged by the continent of origin. We simulated a period of 50 yr (1960 – 2010), using the ECHAM 5 /MESSy 1 atmospheric chemistry (EMAC) general circulation model. The model accounts for anthropogenic, biogenic and biomass burning sources, removal of trace gases through OH <b>oxidation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation,</b> sedimentation and deposition of aerosols. The model is shown to reproduce the observed spatial features of the NAO, moisture transports and precipitation. During high NAO phase seasons the axis of maximum westerly North American trace gas transports extends relatively far to the north and east over Europe. The NAO phase is significantly correlated with North American insoluble gas and soluble aerosol tracer concentrations over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean and across northern Europe, and with European trace gases and aerosols over Africa and north of the Arctic circle. We find a strong anti-correlation between the phase of the NAO and European pollutant gas concentration over western and central Europe...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present data from a novel vertical flow mine water treatment system, demonstrate how these data can be used to generate sizing formulae for this technology, and present a comparison between the size of system based on these formulae and those of conventionally designed passive systems. The paper focuses on passive treatment of circum-neutral ferruginous mine waters bearing up to 50 mg l− 1 of iron in either ferrous or ferric form. The Vertical Flow Reactor (VFR) operates by passing mine water down through an accreting bed of ochre, the ochre bed being responsible for the intensification of iron removal by self-filtration and/or autocatalytic iron <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Key to the design and operation of the VFR system is the decrease in permeability in this ochre bed over time. The paper demonstrates that the VFR system can remove iron at many times the 10 g/m 2 /day removal rate – an often employed figure for the sizing of aerobic settling ponds and wetlands. The paper demonstrates that VFRs are viable and novel passive treatment system for mine waters with a smaller footprint than conventional systems...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metals {{released}} {{by a number}} of industrial processes are major pollutants in marine, ground, industrial and even treated wastewaters. Lead is widely used in many industrial applications such as storage battery manufacturing, printing, pigments, fuels, photographic materials and explosive manufacturing. Lead is highly toxic as its presence in drinking water above the permissible limit (5 ng/mL) causes adverse health effects such as anemia, encephalopathy, hepatitis and nephritic syndrome. Conventionally, the following methods are employed for the removal of heavy metals from effluents such as <b>oxidation</b> <b>and</b> reduction, <b>precipitation,</b> filtration, electrochemical treatment, evaporation. The alternative method is discovered which is biosorption, refers to a physic-chemical binding of metal ions to biomass. It can be considered as an alternative technology for industrial wastewater treatment, The biosorption rate largely depends on parameters such as pH, initial biomass concentration and temperature. In this study, the biosorption of lead (Pb 2 +) from simulated waste water using Aspergillus niger was investigated. The biosorption process was carried out in a shake flask at different initial pH and biomass concentration. Results from experiment shows, among the different initial pH used, percentage of biosorption was highest is at pH 4. 0 (77. 99 %) and for the experiment conducted at different initial biomass concentration, the highest percent of biosorption was obtained by using 20 mg/l (40. 58 %) biomass. From the results also, it was observed that, the percentage of biosorption is directly proportional to the biomass concentration. Autho...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} {{pollutants}} from the groundwater using permeable reactive barriers is a novel in-situ groundwater remediation technology. The most relevant decontamination processes used are chemical reduction, <b>oxidation,</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>and</b> sorption, for which examples are given. Some common organic pollutants are halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic and nitroaromatic compounds {{which can be treated}} in reactive barriers successfully. Lead, chromium and, in particular, uranium are dealt with in great detail among inorganic pollutants because of their occurrence in many European countries. Construction methods for cut-off walls and reactive barriers exhibit similar features. Apart from conventional methods, drilling, deep soil mixing, jet technology, arrays of wells, injected systems and biobarriers are applied to construct permeable reactive barriers. Permeable reactive barriers bear great potential for the future in remediation engineering. (orig.)

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in nanotechnology and analytic instrumentation allow biogeochemical processes between microbes, metals and minerals to be probed at remarkable levels of complexity, sensitivity, space and time. One {{of the dominant}} trends in geomicrobiology is the detailed characterization and application of biogenic minerals whose characteristic features are at the nanometer scale {{in at least one}} dimension. It is therefore important to understand – and ultimately exploit – the unique properties and behavior {{of a wide range of}} nanoscale biogenic materials. Central to this trend are the development and application of effective analytic techniques for characterizing the structural and chemical properties of biogenic minerals with (sub) nanometer spatial resolution. Microbes in the subsurface are involved, directly or indirectly, in a plethora of activities such as metal reduction <b>and</b> <b>oxidation,</b> mineral <b>precipitation</b> <b>and</b> dissolution. These innate capacities of subsurface microbes are often exploited for in situ remediation of contaminated sites. During subsurface bioremediation of uranium-contaminated sites, indigenous metal and sulfate-reducing bacteria may produce biogenic minerals such as mackinawite (FeS) which could potentially drive abiotic uranium reduction. In this work, the propensity of well-characterized biogenic mackinawite to abiotically reduce U(VI) was tested using a suite of electron microscopy and synchrotron based spectroscopy techniques. High-resolution electron microscopy confirmed the formation of nanoparticulate uraninite [UO 2] on the surface of biogenic mackinawite, which was further confirmed with bulk X-ray absorption spectroscopy that revealed the molecular coordination environment of uraninite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that U(IV) reduction was coupled to the oxidation of S 2 - and not structural Fe(II) within the biogenic mackinawite. The combination of rigorous nano- and bulk-scale characterization provides insights into such biogeochemical processes, that occur during subsurface biostimulation, that are not always possible with bulk-scale analyses alone...|$|R
