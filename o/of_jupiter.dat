The Temple <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> Optimus Maximus Capitolinus {{is the most important}} of the temples. It was built in 509 BC and was nearly as large as the Parthenon.

5|$|Aries {{contains}} several {{stars with}} extrasolar planets. HIP 14810, a G5 type star, is orbited by three giant planets (those {{more than ten}} times the mass of Earth). HD 12661, like HIP 14810, is a G-type main sequence star, slightly larger than the Sun, with two orbiting planets. One planet is 2.3 times the mass <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter,</b> {{and the other is}} 1.57 times the mass <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> HD 20367 is a G0 type star, approximately the size of the Sun, with one orbiting planet. The planet, discovered in 2002, has a mass 1.07 times that <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> and orbits every 500 days.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is the {{outermost}} {{of the four}} Galilean moons <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> It orbits {{at a distance of}} approximately 1880000km (26.3 times the 71492km radius <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> itself). This is significantly larger than the orbital radius1070000kmof the next-closest Galilean satellite, Ganymede. As a result of this relatively distant orbit, Callisto does not participate in the mean-motion resonance—in which the three inner Galilean satellites are locked—and probably never has.|$|E

40|$|Attention {{is given}} to the effect of changes in the dynamic {{pressure}} of the solar wind on the structure of a centrifugally driven planetary wind from Jupiter. It is suggested that dynamic pressure variations can induce a transition between a super-Alfvenic wind and a sub-Alfvenic wind breeze on Jupiter's dayside. This could possibly account for the observed large-scale changes in the structure <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter's</b> outer magnetosphere. An attempt is then made to conceptually merge planetary wind models <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter's</b> outer magnetosphere with reconnection models <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter's</b> outer magnetosphere...|$|R

5|$|Jupiter trojans have orbits with radii between 5.05 and 5.35AU (the mean {{semi-major axis}} is 5.2±0.15AU), and are {{distributed}} throughout elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points; each swarm stretches for about 26° along the orbit <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter,</b> amounting {{to a total}} distance of about 2.5AU. The width of the swarms approximately equals two Hill's radii, which in the case <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> amounts to about 0.6AU. Many <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> trojans have large orbital inclinations relative to Jupiter's orbital plane—up to 40°.|$|E

5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> and that the planet's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> Its surface gravity {{is likely to be}} about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely to be much more than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> is outside that of Earth, the phase angle <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°.

5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface.

Assuming a composition similar to that <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter</b> and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter)</b> and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter).</b> The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12. Likewise, the temperature of the planet is assumed to be 1650 K, far hotter than Jupiter's, which is assumed to be 124 K (not considering its internal heat and atmosphere).|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is {{the only}} known {{exoplanet}} in the orbit of host star MOA-2009-BLG-387L. The planet {{is estimated to be}} 2.6 times the mass <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> However, because knowledge of the exact parameters of the planet are tied to the host star's parameters, and the host star's parameters are not well-constrained, uncertainty places MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass between 1.0 and 6.7 times that <b>of</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> The planet is estimated to orbit its host star every 1970 days at a distance of 1.8 AU, some 1.8 times the mean distance between Earth and the Sun.
