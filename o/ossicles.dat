5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The <b>ossicles</b> (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three <b>ossicles</b> develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the <b>ossicles</b> will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three <b>ossicles</b> and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The <b>ossicles</b> are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The <b>ossicles</b> are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, <b>ossicles</b> that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and <b>ossicles.</b> Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of an intra-articular <b>ossicle</b> is not {{rare in the}} knee, with reports suggesting the existence of meniscal osscile. There are also reports describing the attachment of the posterolateral bundle of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) to an accessory <b>ossicle.</b> However, despite an extensive search of the English literature {{we did not find}} much written about an intrasubstance <b>ossicle</b> in the ACL.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a case of}} stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor hallucis longus tendon associated with the plantar capsular accessory <b>ossicle</b> at the interphalangeal joint of the great toe, which was confirmed by intraoperative observation and was successfully treated with surgical resection of the <b>ossicle.</b> As the plantar capsular accessory <b>ossicle</b> was not visible radiographically {{due to the lack}} of ossification, ultrasonography was helpful for diagnosing this disorder...|$|R
5|$|The {{round window}} {{allows for the}} fluid within the inner ear to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear. The <b>ossicles</b> help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the <b>ossicles</b> (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{this order}} have {{distinctive}} pedicellariae, {{consisting of a}} short stalk with three skeletal <b>ossicles.</b> They tend to have robust bodies and have tube feet with flat-tipped suckers usually arranged in four rows.

40|$|A {{study of}} <b>ossicle</b> {{variation}} in Cucumariidae {{coming from the}} Weddell Sea (antarctica), the specimens ranging from 4 to 70 mm long, confirms that Heterocucumis steineni (Ludwig, 1898), Heterocucumis antarctica (Vaney, 1906) and Heterocucumis godfroyi (Vaney, 1914) represent different stages of a single species: H. steineni. A study of Heterocucumis steineni, H. denticulata (Ekman, 1927) and Staurocucumis liouvillei (Vaney, 1914) shows that the main <b>ossicle</b> change occurs early when specimens are 20 mm long or even less.

5000|$|Type 2: Triangular or {{heart-shaped}} <b>ossicle</b> measuring up to 12 mm, {{which represents}} a secondary ossification center {{connected to the}} navicular tuberosity by a 1-2 mm layer of fibrocartilage or hyaline cartilage. Portions of the posterior tibialis tendon sometimes insert onto the accessory <b>ossicle,</b> which can cause dysfunction, and therefore, symptoms.|$|R
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for starfish is ancient, {{dating back to}} the Ordovician around 450 million years ago, but it is rather poor, as starfish tend to {{disintegrate}} after death. Only the <b>ossicles</b> and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.|$|E
5|$|The three <b>ossicles</b> {{transmit}} {{sound from}} the outer ear to the inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta {{was covered}} in armor formed from bony masses {{embedded}} in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down {{the top of the}} neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, the skin {{was covered in}} small, bony nodules (<b>ossicles),</b> which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over the hips, the <b>ossicles</b> and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again {{along the side of the}} body until they stopped just before the hips. Behind the hips, flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single row on each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in two parallel rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the lower row pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of each pair of cervical spines and each pair of caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail.|$|E
30|$|In total, 2620 radiographs were {{separately}} {{evaluated for}} the presence of accessory navicular, noting the age of first appearance and the age of <b>ossicle</b> fusion, if applicable. Results were then compared, and radiographs without consensus on {{the presence or absence of}} a true accessory navicular were evaluated by the senior author to determine if a true <b>ossicle</b> was present. For all subjects found to have an accessory navicular, their study charts were examined to determine the presence of symptoms related to foot pain that may be attributed to the presence of a symptomatic accessory navicular. For each subject, the shortest distance from the <b>ossicle</b> to the navicular was measured at the time of presentation. In addition, the width and height of each <b>ossicle</b> at the time of presentation was measured and the area calculated using an ellipse as a model.|$|R
40|$|Meniscal <b>ossicle,</b> or bone {{within the}} {{substance}} of meniscus, is a rare entity and commonly confused with a loose body both clinically and radiologically.

40|$|Calcaneus secundarius is an {{accessory}} <b>ossicle</b> of the anterior calcaneal facet identified {{in up to}} 5 % of the population. Calcaneus secundarius rarely leads to symptoms, but its presence may generate pain around the ankle. The purpose of this case report is to describe this atypical accessory <b>ossicle,</b> which can mimic a calcaneonavicular coalition, and to explain the clinical approach to reach a diagnosis and determine treatment. The authors report {{the case of a}} 13 -year-old girl who sustained several lateral sprains of the right ankle and had local chronic pain. Clinical findings were consistent with calcaneonavicular coalition but radiographic examinations revealed a calcaneus secundarius. The location of this <b>ossicle</b> may limit the range of motion of the subtalar joint, mimicking a calcaneonavicular coalition. Surgical excision of this bulky accessory <b>ossicle</b> was performed, and this treatment fully resolved the pain and improved subtalar motion...|$|R
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three <b>ossicles</b> bones {{transmit}} this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to {{teardrop}} shaped, and possess sharp ridges {{that rise}} distally. Some scutes {{were long and}} had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis. One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was {{from the edge of}} the pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small <b>ossicles</b> fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E
5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} the neck), {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small <b>ossicles</b> (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the <b>ossicles</b> is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} the dodo {{differed}} much {{from those of}} other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly {{twice as long as}} the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated {{along the length of the}} beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven <b>ossicles</b> (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian <b>ossicles)</b> connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

40|$|Os peroneum is an {{accessory}} <b>ossicle</b> {{located within the}} peroneus longus tendon. The painful os peroneum syndrome (POPS) results from {{a wide spectrum of}} conditions, including fractures, diastases, and other causes. POPS can result in tenosynovitis or discontinuity of the peroneus longus tendon with a clinical presentation of pain in the lateral aspect of the midfoot. Authors report a typical case of POPS, illustrating this entity through different imaging methods (radiographs, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging). We emphasize the prevalence of this <b>ossicle</b> and discuss painful complications...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} progenitor {{cells from}} the stromal system of the fibrous dysplastic marrow of patients with McCune-Albright Syndrome. Analysis of the Gsalpha gene from individual colonies provided direct evidence {{for the presence of}} two different genotypes within single fibrous dysplastic lesions: marrow stromal cells containing two normal Gsalpha alleles, and those containing one normal allele and an allele with an activating mutation. Transplantation of clonal populations of normal cells into the subcutis of immunocompromised mice resulted in normal <b>ossicle</b> formation. In contrast, transplantation of clonal populations of mutant cells always led to the loss of transplanted {{cells from the}} transplantation site and no <b>ossicle</b> formation. However, transplantation of a mixture of normal and mutant cells reproduced an abnormal ectopic <b>ossicle</b> recapitulating human fibrous dysplasia and providing an in vivo cellular model of this disease. These results provide experimental evidence for the necessity of both normal and mutant cells in the development of McCune-Albright Syndrome fibrous dysplastic lesions in bone...|$|R

25|$|Adhesive {{otitis media}} {{occurs when a}} thin {{retracted}} ear drum becomes sucked into the middle-ear space and stuck (i.e., adherent) to the <b>ossicles</b> and other bones of the middle ear.|$|E
30|$|This <b>ossicle</b> {{is located}} between the anteromedial {{aspect of the}} calcaneus, the cuboid, the talar head and the tarsal navicular. The {{incidence}} of the os calcaneus secundarium has been reported between 0.6 and 7  % [21]. This rare <b>ossicle</b> is difficult to detect radiographically due to overlying structures, but can be visualised on CT. The os calcaneus secundarium has not {{been shown to have}} any clinical significance [21]. However, its location makes it difficult to differentiate from a fracture of the anterosuperior calcaneal process [22]. MRI may be useful to detect bone marrow oedema related to a fracture in this location.|$|R

40|$|Due {{to changes}} in ambient {{pressure}} and to the gas-exchange processes in the middle ear (ME) cavity, the ear is subject to ultra-low-frequency pressure variations, which are many orders of magnitude larger than the loudest acoustic pressures. Little quantitative data exist on how ME mechanics deals with these large quasi-static pressure changes {{and because of this}} lack of data, only few efforts could be made to incorporate quasi-static behavior into computer models. When designing and modeling <b>ossicle</b> prostheses and implantable ME hearing aids, the effects of large <b>ossicle</b> movements caused by quasi-static pressures should be taken into account. We investigated the response of the ME to slowly varying pressures by measuring the displacement of the umbo and the stapes in rabbit with a heterodyne interferometer with position decoder. Displacement versus pressure curves were obtained at linear pressure change rates between 200  Pa/s and 1. 5  kPa/s, with amplitude ± 2. 5  kPa. The change in stapes position associated with a pressure change is independent of pressure change rate (34  μm peak-to-peak at ± 2. 5  kPa). The stapes displacement versus pressure curves are highly nonlinear and level off for pressures beyond ± 1  kPa. Stapes motion shows no measurable hysteresis at 1. 5  kPa/s, which demonstrates that the annular ligament has little viscoelasticity. Hysteresis increases strongly at the lowest pressure change rates. The stapes moves in phase with the umbo and with pressure, but the sense of rotation of the hysteresis loop of stapes is phase inversed. Stapes motion is not a simple lever ratio mimic of umbo motion, but is the consequence of complex changes in <b>ossicle</b> joints and <b>ossicle</b> position. The change in umbo position produced by a ± 2. 5  kPa pressure change decreases with increasing rate from 165  μm at 200  Pa/s to 118  μm at 1. 5  kPa/s. Umbo motion already shows significant hysteresis at 1. 5  kPa/s, but hysteresis increases further as pressure change rate decreases. We conclude that in the quasi-static regime, <b>ossicle</b> movement is not only governed by viscoelasticity, but that other effects become dominant as pressure change rate decreases below 1  kPa/s. The increasing hysteresis can be caused by increasing friction as speed of movement decreases, and incorporating speed-dependent friction coefficients will be essential to generate realistic models of <b>ossicle</b> movements at slow pressure change rates...|$|R
