5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the {{neighborhood}} of <b>other</b> <b>material</b> around its orbit.|$|E
5|$|Cardinal Rodrigo Borja {{was elected}} {{unanimously}} on the 4th ballot as Pope Alexander VI. The election is notorious for allegations that Borja bought {{the votes of}} his electors, promising them lucrative appointments and <b>other</b> <b>material</b> gifts—a practice known as simony. Concerns about this conclave led Pope Julius II to create stronger rules against simony in 1503.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} regard {{other species}} as valid as well, for example P.erlenbergensis. Such works, however, ignore Moser (2003), the publication {{that shows the}} type series of P.engelhardti to be diagnostic, and <b>other</b> <b>material</b> to be referable to it.|$|E

Research on Ocepeia {{has been carried out}} by French and Moroccan researchers led by Dr. Emmanuel Gheerbrant of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Ocepeia fossils have been recovered from the Grand Daoui, Meraa El Arech, and Sidi Chennane quarries, with the latter bearing the most complete specimens. Some of the original material was collected on-site as early as 1997, while <b>other</b> <b>material</b> was obtained from fossil dealers.|$|E
5|$|Aside from fossils clearly {{belonging}} to Plateosaurus, {{there is much}} prosauropod material from the German Knollenmergel in museum collections, most of it labeled as Plateosaurus, that {{does not belong to}} the type species and possibly not to Plateosaurus at all. Some of this material is not diagnostic; <b>other</b> <b>material</b> has been recognized to be different, but was never sufficiently described.|$|E

5|$|Churches were {{primarily}} responsible for financing Civilian Public Service, providing for the men's food, clothes, and <b>other</b> <b>material</b> needs. The churches also provided and paid for the camp director. The men received an allowance of between $2.50 and $5.00 monthly for personal needs. When jobs were available in surrounding farms and communities, those willing to work beyond their regular CPS jobs could earn extra spending money. The federal government spent $1.3 million on the CPS program. The men performed $6 million of unpaid labor in return.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaur that {{is known}} from fossils {{uncovered}} in modern-day Portugal. It may represent a species of Supersaurus. The only species is Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis, first described by José Bonaparte and Octávio Mateus in 1999 for vertebrae and some <b>other</b> <b>material</b> from the Lourinhã Formation. Although the precise age of the formation is not known, it can be dated around the early Tithonian of the Late Jurassic.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris is {{a fossil}} primate from the Miocene of India and Pakistan {{in the family}} Sivaladapidae. Two species are now recognized: I.himalayensis from Haritalyangar, India (about 9 million years old) and I.kamlialensis from the Pothohar Plateau, Pakistan (15.2 million years old). <b>Other</b> <b>material</b> from the Potwar Plateau (16.8 and 15.2 million years old) may {{represent}} an additional, unnamed species. Body mass estimates range from about 2kg (4.4lb) for the smaller I.kamlialensis to over 4kg (8.8lb) for the larger I.himalayensis.|$|E

5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or <b>other</b> <b>material)</b> gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E

5|$|The {{first ten}} {{chapters}} {{are not entirely}} a direct translation of the Vangelo; Leland offers his own commentary and notes {{on a number of}} passages, and Chapter VII is Leland's incorporation of other Italian folklore material. Medievalist Robert Mathiesen contends that the Vangelo manuscript actually represents even less of Aradia, arguing that only Chapters I, II, and the first half of Chapter IV match Leland's description of the manuscript's contents, and suggests that the <b>other</b> <b>material</b> came from different texts collected by Leland through Maddalena.|$|E
5|$|The rolls {{were written}} in Latin until 1733, except {{for a short time}} around 1650. During the reign of Henry II, a {{duplicate}} copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the Chancellor, and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created {{at the same time as}} the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor. The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except for the occasional addition of a private charter or <b>other</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5|$|The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis {{was widely}} read, {{and helped to}} create public {{consciousness}} of female homosexuality. The sexologists' claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor {{should be considered a}} criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any <b>other</b> <b>material</b> to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture.|$|E
