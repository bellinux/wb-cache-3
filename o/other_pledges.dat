NBC chose Shari Lewis to fill the slot on the schedule.|$|E
5000|$|The fervor of {{the early}} days in the reorganized militias wore off in the long grind of an eight-year war. Now the right to elect their own {{officers}} was used to demand that the men not serve away from their state. Men evaded service, bought substitutes to go for them as in the old days, {{and had to be}} bribed with higher and higher bounties to join the effort - which is why Jefferson and Samuel Adams called them so expensive. As wartime inflation devalued the currency, <b>other</b> <b>pledges</b> had to be offered, including land grants and the promise of [...] "a healthy slave" [...] {{at the end of the}} war. Some men would take a bounty and not show up. Or they would show up for a while, desert, and then, when they felt the need for another bounty, sign up again in a different place. ... This practice was common enough to have its own technical term - [...] "bounty jumping".|$|E

5000|$|Randy {{goes to the}} {{fraternity}} house and is inadvertently pledged into the group {{with the help of}} a large amount of alcohol. In the hospital, Cartman is ready to give up and accept that he and the rest of the gang are bigots, but Kyle refuses to accept this and is resolute in his position that Jenner is not a nice person. Randy and the <b>other</b> <b>pledges</b> shame Kyle by waking him to a room full of pigs painted with the word [...] "biggit". After a dream where Cartman is simultaneously Tom Brady, Roger Goodell and Bill Belichick, with Brady evading consequences for his actions during the Deflategate scandal, Cartman pledges to Butters that he will get the better of Principal. After a brutal hazing, Kyle asks Stan to make Randy and his PC gang stop assaulting him. When Butters tells Cartman that Kyle is now the main target of the PC fraternity members, Cartman vows retribution. Cartman and others mount an assault on {{the fraternity}} house, but Kyle interrupts it, publicly calling Jenner a hero and brave. Everyone applauds Kyle, and a clip from the 2015 ESPY Awards is shown. The boys begrudgingly admit that political correctness is not going away any time soon, as Kyle observes that the only person who seems to have emerged victorious from this recent conflict is Cartman.|$|E
40|$|Citation: Holroyd, Hartley Bowen. A brief {{outline of}} {{forestry}}. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1903. Introduction: The science of forestry treats of the care, purpose and utilization, of the forested {{areas of the}} earth, together with the best means of regenerating the forested areas. AT one time {{the greater part of}} the earth was covered with a sylva differing in variety according to the climate and soil of the several countries. Through the careIess and injudicious utilization of these areas, they became greatly reduced and the soil in many cases greatly deteriorated. With this factor came the necessity of action toward a more economical use of the resources given us by nature. So the science of forestry, in its different branches, gradually grew into prominence. The various questions arising under forestry have been economically and scientifically dealt with for many years in India, Germany, Switzerland and England but it is only of later years that the science of forestry has shown a marked development in the United States. In order to obtain the most economical results, the control of forests should, with a few exceptions, be {{under the supervision of the}} government. In state forestry the interests of the private individual are brought into harmony with the interests of the community as a whole and both derive a mutual benefit. This is exemplified in case of protection forests which are maintained on account of their influence upon the welfare of the community of a large expanse of country. For example, forests which are maintained to prevent denudation, land-slips, to prevent erosion and the silting up of fertile lands at the foot of hills, as a protection where shifting sand occurs, and the preservation and regulation of the water supply in springs and rivers. State forests are considered as a suitable source of public revenue as the income is regular, sustained and safe, and it is a source of income, the payment of which, is not a burden upon the people. They also act in the capacity of a reserve fund which is available for the security of bonds or <b>other</b> <b>pledges.</b> Forestry is the more profitable when conducted on large areas, requiring therefore a larger outlay of capital, which only in exceptional cases is at the disposal of the individual. The state, we suppose, lasts forever and the cost of utilizing the forests will be reimbursed even after the lapse of considerable time even if the rate of interest be small on the capital invested...|$|E
