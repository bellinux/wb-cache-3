The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page</b> when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page.</b> These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines.

Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page</b> to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E

25|$|One {{of the few}} {{commercial}} {{developers to}} join the contest was Dave Raggett at Hewlett-Packard in Bristol, England. He created a browser called Arena. HP had a convention that an employee could engage in related, useful, but not official work for 10 percent {{of his or her}} job time. Dave spent his 10 percent time, plus a lot of evenings and weekends, on Arena. He was convinced that hypertext Web pages could be much more exciting, like magazine pages rather than textbook pages, and that HTML could be used to position not just text <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page</b> but pictures, tables, and other features. He used Arena to demonstrate all these things, and to experiment with different ways of reading and interpreting both valid and incorrectly written HTML pages.|$|E
500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the published script of Viet Rock, Richard Schechner says, [...] "performance, action, and event are the key terms of our theatre – and these terms are not literary." [...] In the 1950s, Off-off Broadway theaters began experimenting with non-traditional theater roles, blurring the lines between playwright, director, and actor. [...] The playwright's job was not just to put words <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page,</b> but to create a theatrical experience based on a central idea. [...] By 1967, theaters such as The Living Theatre, La MaMa E.T.C. and The Open Theatre were actively devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space, rather than following a traditional script.|$|E

[...] The page layouts are also sparse, sometimes limited to a single, small panel <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page,</b> sometimes up to seven or eight.

500|$|Stockhausen, {{along with}} John Cage, {{is one of}} the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in {{penetrating}} the popular consciousness ( [...] ; [...] ). The Beatles included his face on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [...] This reflects his influence on the band's own avant-garde experiments as well as the general fame and notoriety he had achieved by that time (1967). In particular, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (1967) and [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page</b> on the official Stockhausen web site (...) [...] Perhaps the most caustic remark about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham.

500|$|The {{pages with}} the text have been ruled with a blind stylus or similar tool, leaving just an {{impression}} in the vellum. [...] It can be shown that this was done for each gathering with just two sets of lines, ruled on the outermost and innermost pages, requiring a very firm impression to carry the marks through to the sheets behind. [...] Impressed lines mark the vertical edges of the text area, {{and there is an}} outer pair of lines. [...] Each line of text is ruled, only as far as the inner vertical lines, and there are prick marks where the horizontal lines meet the verticals. [...] The book begins with 19 lines <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page,</b> but at folio 42 changes to 20 lines per page, requiring the re-ruling of some pages. [...] This change was evidently a departure from the original plan, and may have been caused by a shortage of the very fine vellum, as two different sorts are used, though the change does not coincide exactly with the change in the number of lines.|$|E
500|$|Critic Robert Christgau, {{writing in}} Esquire of Pleasures of the Harbor in May 1968, did not {{consider}} this new direction a good turn. While describing Ochs as [...] "unquestionably a nice guy", {{he went on to}} say, [...] "too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave [...] his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand were webbed." [...] "Pleasures of the Harbor", Christgau continued, [...] "epitomizes the decadence that has infected pop since Sgt. Pepper. [...] gaudy musical settings ... inspire nostalgia for the three-chord strum." [...] With an ironic sense of humor, Ochs included Christgau's [...] "webbed hand" [...] comment in his 1968 songbook The War is Over <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>page</b> titled [...] "The Critics Raved", opposite a full-page picture of Ochs standing in a large metal garbage can. Despite his sense of humor, Ochs was unhappy that his work was not receiving the critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped for. Still, Ochs would joke on the back cover of Greatest Hits that there were 50 Phil Ochs fans ("50 fans can't be wrong!"), a sarcastic reference to an Elvis Presley album that bragged of 50 million Elvis fans.|$|E
