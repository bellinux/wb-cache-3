5|$|Before the British Raj, {{indigenous}} schools provided elementary education. Till 1892, {{the city}} had only one middle school. The first private school, CAV High School, {{was set up by}} Arya Samaj in 1918. Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, one of Asia's biggest agricultural universities was the first university established in Hisar, in 1971. Other universities located in the city are Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, Lala Lajpat Rai University <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> and Animal Sciences and Shanti Niketan Vidyapeeth, Hisar. Commercial and private pilot license training is provided by the Haryana Institute of Civil Aviation (HICA) from Hisar Airport built in 1965.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, UPCA {{requested}} Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos {{to allow}} the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals. However, UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea. A survey {{found that there was}} very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on 20 November 1972, Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units. New colleges and research centers were created over the next few years, while the College <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine was likewise transferred to UPLB from UP Diliman.|$|E

5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, it falls into the category <b>of</b> <b>veterinary</b> medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E
5|$|The base {{tuition fee}} per unit in UPLB is ₱1,000 (US$23). As with all UP constituents, UPLB {{implements}} the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP). Under the program, students with annual family incomes between ₱1,000,000 (US$23,000) and ₱500,000 (US$11,500) are charged the base tuition fee, while those with annual family incomes above ₱1,000,000 are charged ₱1,500 (US$35) per unit. Students with annual family incomes between ₱500,000 and ₱135,000 (US$3,110) are charged ₱600 (US$14) per unit; {{those who have}} between ₱135,000 and ₱80,000 (US$1,840) are charged ₱300 (US$7); while those who have below ₱80,000 are not charged any fees.

5|$|The {{following}} year the college was officially integrated as A welcomed its first African American student. More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make {{membership in the}} Corps of Cadets voluntary. The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected to students and professors, to attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A University. He remained at Texas A and, in 1970, became the first African American to receive a D.V.M. degree from the College <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine.|$|E
5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri was {{discovered}} during {{a survey of}} the endoparasites of Florida marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) by John Kinsella from 1970 to 1972, and is one of several new parasite species in this study, which was done because there were no previous comprehensive studies of the endoparasites of the species. Together with Danny Pence, Kinsella described the worm in a 1987 paper as Capillaria forresteri; the specific name honors Donald J. Forrester of the College <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine, University of Florida. Kinsella and Pence described it as one of many species of Capillaria, a large and taxonomically difficult genus. They suggested that it may be closest to some other small species that live in the digestive systems of mammals, such as the very similar C.putorii, which is found in a variety of carnivorans in North America and Europe. In 1982, Moravec had placed Capillaria putorii and a number of related species in a separate genus, Aonchotheca, and in 1999 Pisanu and Bain transferred Capillaria forresteri and various other species to that genus from Capillaria. Thus, the species is now known as Aonchotheca forresteri.|$|E
5|$|Susianna Kentikian {{was born}} in Yerevan, Armenian SSR, the {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>veterinary</b> doctor Levon Kentikian and his wife Makruhi. At the age of five, she left Armenia {{with her parents and}} her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1992, the family first moved to Berlin, Germany and stayed at asylum seekers' homes. However, due to the violence at these facilities and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to Moldova and later to Russia, where Kentikian went to school {{for a short period of}} time. The family returned to Germany in 1996 and relocated in Hamburg, again living in government facilities for asylum seekers. Kentikian's residence status remained uncertain for almost a decade. Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion. Her family received a permanent residence permit in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.|$|E

25|$|Aspiring veterinarians {{can earn}} {{several types of}} degrees, differing by country and {{involving}} undergraduate or graduate education. In the United States, schools award the Doctor <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine degree (DVM). This degree is also awarded in Bangladesh, Canada, Ethiopia, Hungary, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Tobago and Trinidad. Other countries offer a degree equivalent to the North American DVM. In the United Kingdom and countries which have adopted the undergraduate system of higher education, a bachelor's degree is equivalent to a DVM (after {{five or six years}} of study). In the US, a four-year DVM degree such as Bachelor <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Science, Bachelor <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine or Bachelor <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine and Surgery follows a four-year undergraduate degree (eight years of study after high school). In Ireland, the Veterinary Medicine Programme at the University College Dublin awards the Bachelor <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine (MVB). At the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, the degree awarded is the Bachelor <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine & Surgery (BVMS). Some veterinary schools offer a degree enabling the recipient to practice veterinary medicine in their home country but does not permit the individual to take a licensing examination abroad; for example, veterinary schools in Afghanistan offer only the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. Although Ethiopia awards a Doctor <b>of</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine degree, it is not recognized in the US or Western Europe.|$|E
