5|$|Other {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 1715, this time by the knight René Jacob de Tigné {{and a team of}} French engineers. There were several different plans, including building a coastal battery and a redoubt. <b>Other</b> <b>plans</b> included building a four-bastioned fort, or combining all three (fort, battery and redoubt) for the defence of the island.|$|E
5|$|Tecumseh was sunk on 5 August {{during the}} Battle of Mobile Bay when she struck a mine. The ship capsized and rests upside down {{northwest}} of Fort Morgan. The Smithsonian Institution surveyed her wreck in 1967 {{with the intent}} of raising it, but ultimately decided against the project when proffered funding was withdrawn. Several <b>other</b> <b>plans</b> to raise the wreck have been made, but all have fallen through.|$|E
5|$|The {{railway station}} would be {{developed}} into an 'interchange' with local buses and trains. The upgrade {{would provide a}} new platform, footbridge and new station buildings. Outside the station a new road bridge from Midland Road over the railway line is also planned with a new footbridge to reach the new development. <b>Other</b> <b>plans</b> to include {{the development of the}} High Street, Shelley Road and the north of the town areas are also being considered.|$|E

5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. <b>Other</b> <b>plans</b> suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{was set up}} in October 1838 to investigate the viability of a causeway at the site. On 16 February 1839 plans which had been prepared by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for <b>other</b> <b>plans</b> and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.|$|E

5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and <b>other,</b> <b>plans</b> were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Shoghi Effendi {{launched}} a seven-year {{plan for the}} Bahá'ís of North America, followed by another in 1946. In 1953, he launched the first international plan, the Ten Year World Crusade. This plan included extremely ambitious goals {{for the expansion of}} Bahá'í communities and institutions, the translation of Bahá'í texts into several new languages, and the sending of Bahá'í pioneers into previously unreached nations. He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by <b>other</b> <b>plans</b> {{under the direction of the}} Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then {{launched a}} nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bahá'í community.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{has been}} having drug-like {{withdrawals}} since Lois decided to wean him. He becomes so desperate {{that when he}} and Lois are at the park, he jumps on a woman breastfeeding her baby and greedily suckles on her, but is pulled off by Lois. One night, he then tries to milk Lois in her sleep. He pumps her breasts and succeeds, but spills and desperately tries licking it up. Stewie realizes how pathetic he is and accepts his weaning. He comes to Brian and informs {{that he is now}} off breast milk, but Lois has <b>other</b> <b>plans.</b> Lois allows Stewie to be breastfed again, thus delighting him.|$|E

5|$|Only {{four days}} after {{returning}} from the Moscow Conference, Ismay left England again for the Cairo Conference and Teheran Conference with Churchill. One major source of conflict at the Cairo Conference was an American proposal to appoint an overall commander for the strategic bombing of Germany. Ismay and the British were strongly opposed, and Ismay wrote a long paper against the idea, which became the basis of British policy on the subject. At Teheran, Ismay helped to argue the case for Operation Overlord, but immediately after the conference he developed bronchitis and returned to England by ship, scrapping his <b>other</b> <b>plans</b> for the trip.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>plans</b> for {{memorials}} {{included a}} garden of remembrance at the BDP firm's studio in Bristol, a published anthology of Yeates' work and an annual landscape design prize named after her for students of the University of Gloucestershire. BDP announced it would dedicate a charity cycle ride between its offices on its 50th anniversary, with proceeds to go to charities selected by her family. Yeates left behind an estate valued at £47,000, which included money set aside to purchase a home with Reardon. As she had not written a will, the sum was inherited by her parents.|$|E
5|$|The Joker is {{alternatively}} {{depicted as}} sexual and asexual. In The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker is seductive toward Batman; {{it is uncertain}} if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believes that the Joker is capable of a romantic relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from <b>other</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many <b>other</b> <b>plans</b> this too fell by the wayside.|$|E
5|$|Although Mdina was {{no longer}} the capital city, the Order still {{strengthened}} the city's defences, and gradually upgraded its medieval walls into a gunpowder fortress. In the 1540s, during the magistracy of Juan de Homedes y Coscon, two bastions were built on the corners of the city's land front. The central De Redin Bastion was built by Grand Master Martin de Redin in the mid-17th century. The city was damaged during the 1693 Sicily earthquake, and repairs were made {{over the course of the}} 18th century. During the rebuilding, the city's entrance was replaced by a larger gate by the architect Charles François de Mondion in 1724, and the last modifications were made in 1746, when Despuig Bastion was completed. There were <b>other</b> <b>plans</b> to strengthen the city but these were not implemented as the Order focused on the fortifications at the harbour area.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} {{has been}} proposed, contingent upon {{the allocation of}} funding. This includes {{the second phase of}} the Silicon Valley extension, which would bring the system to downtown San Jose and Santa Clara. Plans have long been floated for an extension from Dublin to Livermore, which would cost approximately $1.2 billion and run 5.5 miles (8.9 km) along interstate 580 to Isabel Avenue. The BART board could vote in spring 2018 on this project, which would be completed in 2026. <b>Other</b> <b>plans</b> have included an extension to Hercules, a line along the Interstate Highway 680 corridor, and a fourth set of rail tracks through Oakland. At least four infill stations such as Irvington and Calaveras on existing lines have been proposed. With the Transbay Tube nearing capacity, long-range plans included a new four-bore Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay that would run parallel and south of the existing tunnel and emerge at the Transbay Transit Terminal to connect to Caltrain and the future California High Speed Rail system. The four-bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for BART and two tunnels for conventional/high-speed rail. The BART system and conventional U.S. rail use different and incompatible rail gauges and different loading gauges.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the {{concession}} for passenger transport between Voss and Granvin was transferred from NSB's bus division to HSD and Bergen–Hardanger–Voss Billag. At the same time, {{the number of}} weekly services increased from 14 to 34. This was largely {{a result of the}} 1975 declaration by Hordaland County Council to support the closure of the line. In 1980, the railway had 60,000 passengers. A halt was opened at Mala in 1981, but then all passenger traffic was terminated on 2 June 1985. Class 64 had remained in use until the end, and there existed no political desire to invest in new rolling stock. Freight transport was retained, at first using El9, and later shunting locomotives {{because of the lack of}} maintenance. From 1 March 1989, all transport on the line was terminated. NSB wanted to renovate the line and continue operations. Among the plans were to transport metal from the smelters in Hardanger via the Hardanger Line to Continental Europe. This would have required the axle load to be increased. <b>Other</b> <b>plans</b> were to extend some of the departures of the Bergen Commuter Rail from Voss to Granvin or operate commercially profitable tourist trains similar to the service provided on the Flåm Line.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, Walker spoke by {{telephone}} with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command, in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter {{and said the}} most serious threat was along {{the boundary between the}} U.S. 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with <b>other</b> <b>plans</b> of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the U.S. 2nd Division and ordered a coordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E
5|$|The UERL {{became part}} of London Transport in 1933, but the focus {{remained}} on high quality design. Under Pick, Holden's attention to detail and idea of integrated design extended to all parts of London's transport network, from designing bus and tram shelters to {{a new type of}} six-wheeled omnibus. In the late 1930s, Holden designed replacement stations at Highgate, East Finchley and Finchley Central and new stations at Elstree South and Bushey Heath for the Northern line's Northern Heights plan. Holden's designs incorporated sculpture relevant to the local history of a number of stations: Dick Whittington for Highgate, a Roman centurion at Elstree South and an archer for East Finchley. Much of the project was postponed shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was later cancelled. Only East Finchley station was completed in full with Highgate in part; the <b>other</b> <b>plans</b> were scrapped. East Finchley station is located on an embankment and the platforms are accessed from below. Making use of the station's air-rights, Holden provided staff office space spanning above the tracks accessed through semi-circular glazed stairways from the platforms. Eric Aumonier provided the statue The Archer, a prominent feature of the station.|$|E
