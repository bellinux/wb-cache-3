5|$|In {{supporting}} the war effort, India was left vulnerable to hostile action from Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived in Kabul in October 1915, with obvious strategic purpose. Habibullah Khan abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, {{in the face}} of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the Ottoman Sultan. Despite this, localised actions along the frontier still took place and included Operations in the Tochi (1914–15), <b>Operations</b> <b>against</b> the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis (1915), Kalat Operations (1915–16), Mohmand Blockade (1916–17), <b>Operations</b> <b>against</b> the Mahsuds (1917) and <b>Operations</b> <b>against</b> the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918).|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Tiridates, {{backed by}} his brother, {{refused to go}} to Rome, and even engaged in <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> those Armenians whom he deemed were loyal to Rome. Tension mounted and finally, {{in the early spring}} of 58, war broke out.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1942, Hiei {{departed}} Truk Lagoon Naval Base {{with the}} Third Battleship Division to support carrier <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> Rabaul and Kavieng.

On 1 March, following carrier <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> Darwin and Java (in the Dutch East Indies), Hiei, Kirishima and —which were acting as escorts for the carrier task force—engaged the destroyer , with Hiei firing 210 14-inch and seventy 6-inch shells.

5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly aware of this arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war in August 1914, Bruix was assigned to protect troop convoys from French North Africa to France before she was transferred to the Atlantic to support Allied <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> the German colony of Kamerun in September.

5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were more useful in <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> the Austro-Hungarians. After the war, the anemic Italian economy could not support significant naval construction programs.

5|$|In 1780, {{approximately}} 5,500 French soldiers {{landed in}} Rhode Island to assist their American allies in <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> British-controlled New York City. Following {{the arrival of}} dispatches from France that included the possibility {{of support from the}} French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse, Washington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in besieging New York, or in military <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> a British army operating in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay, where Cornwallis had taken command of the army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, Henry Clinton, was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he began to do in Yorktown, Virginia. Cornwallis' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by the Marquis de Lafayette.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, {{under the}} control of the Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), the TDR-1 was {{deployed}} operationally to the South Pacific for <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> the Japanese. TDR-1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron (Special Air Task Group 1) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft, and the first operational mission took place on September 27, conducting bombing <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> Japanese ships. Despite this success, the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft, due to a combination of continued technical problems, the aircraft failing to live up to expectations, and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan. The final mission was flown on October 27, with 50 drones having been expended on operations, 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets, without loss to the pilots of STAG-1.|$|E
5|$|In July, in {{an attempt}} to salvage what {{remained}} of Yugoslavia, the JNA forces were involved in <b>operations</b> <b>against</b> predominantly Croat areas.
