[...] First week sales nearly doubled those of DecembeRadio. [...] The album cover {{was the product of}} a spontaneous suggestion from the band's manager on the day of a photoshoot. [...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We went down there, took off <b>our</b> <b>shoes,</b> rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while we got our picture taken. It's a good thing we did it because when we got the pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1842, two LDS missionaries, {{one of whom was}} Charles Wesley Wandell, were preaching in the area. Although {{forbidden}} by her Presbyterian preacher, James recorded that she [...] "had a desire to hear them. I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel." [...] James was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the following Sunday, and later acquainted many friends and family members with her new beliefs as well. A year later, James and eight other members of her family, including her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law- decided to move from their home in Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois, in order to live among other members of their new faith. The group of nine began their journey with other Latter Day Saints under the direction of Wandell, but got separated from the group at Buffalo, New York when they couldn't afford to pay the train fare from New York to Ohio. James and her family traveled the remainder of their journey (approximately 800 miles) on foot. In her Life Sketch, recorded in 1893, James recalled that [...] "We walked until <b>our</b> <b>shoes</b> were worn out, and our feet became sore and cracked open and bled until you could see the whole print of our feet with blood on the ground." [...] When James and her family arrived in Nauvoo, they were welcomed by Joseph Smith himself. Over the next year, her mother and siblings would establish their own homes. James, however, lived with the Joseph Smith family in Nauvoo until Smith's assassination in 1846.|$|E

On the night of December 8, Carson, a naval {{lieutenant}} named Beale, and an Indian scout left Kearny to bring reinforcements from San Diego, [...] away. Carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise, and walked barefoot through the desert. Carson wrote in his Memoirs: [...] "Finally got through, but had the misfortune to lose <b>our</b> <b>shoes.</b> Had to travel over a country covered with prickly pear and rocks, barefoot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Franklin {{had only}} gone a short {{distance}} towards Fort Enterprise when four voyageurs — Michel Terohaute, Jean Baptiste Belanger, Perrault, and Fontano — said {{they were unable to}} continue and asked to return to Hood and Richardson's camp. Franklin agreed. He staggered on towards Fort Enterprise with his five remaining companions, growing weaker and weaker. No game was to be found, even if any of them had been strong enough to hold a rifle, and recounting the story, Franklin made a comment which would become famous: [...] "There was no tripe de roche, so we drank tea and ate some of <b>our</b> <b>shoes</b> for supper." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like we do now, and we never had <b>our</b> <b>shoes</b> off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E

60|$|The {{rain had}} ceased, {{but the air}} was raw and the sky gray, and I was very tired, and those eight miles {{stretched}} out like a rubber string. Night fell before we had passed over half the road, which lay {{for the most part}} down the flat along the Chilcoot River. In fact, we crossed this stream again and again. In places there were bridges, but most of the crossings were fords where it was necessary to wade through the icy water above <b>our</b> <b>shoe</b> tops. <b>Our</b> legs, numb and weary, threw off this chill with greater pain each time. As the night fell we could only see the footpath by the dim shine of its surface patted smooth by the moccasined feet of the Indian packers. At last I walked with a sort of mechanical action which was dependent on my subconscious will. There was nothing else to do but to go through. The doctor was a better walker than I. His long legs had more reach as well as greater endurance. Nevertheless he admitted being about as tired as ever in his life.|$|R

While many people believe that their used clothes {{donations}} are distributed free of charge to the needy in the Third World, the trade in second-hand clothes is actually an international business. In addition to commercial clothes collectors, sorters, and interim dealers, thousands of street dealers in Africa live off the sale of second-hand clothes and shoes. They have to know which shoes are in fashion on the streets at the time, the various types of customers and the styles that are in demand by them, when and where these customers {{are most likely to be}} found, how to best approach them, and what they are willing to pay. This specialized expert knowledge is the basis of a successful livelihood.
