5|$|Georgia {{began its}} first {{possession}} with a 25-yard kickoff return, {{but failed to}} earn a first down in the face <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> Hokie defensive effort. Georgia punter Gordon Ely-Kelso kicked a 56-yard punt following the Virginia Tech defensive stop. A breakdown in special teams coverage by Georgia allowed Virginia Tech kick returner Eddie Royal to break free, returning the kick 56yards {{back to the original}} line of scrimmage. As a result of the excellent field position provided by the return, Virginia Tech was able to drive the remaining 30yards to the end zone. Branden Ore earned his second touchdown of the game, making the score 14–3 with 6:13 remaining on the clock.|$|E
5|$|Sean Glennon's four {{turnovers}} tied {{a career-high}} for interceptions and brought his season interception mark to 11. He completed 13ofhis26passes for 94yards and a completion percentage of 50%. The passing total of 94yards was the second-lowest total {{in the entire}} season, coming behind only a November 4 game in Miami where Glennon passed for just 86yards in the face <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> defense. In a statistic unusual for the 2006 season, Glennon {{was not the only}} Tech player to complete a pass. Wide receiver Eddie Royal's 53-yard TD pass made him just the third Virginia Tech player to complete a pass during the 2006 season. The play on which Royal made his throw, a lateral WR pass, had been attempted once previously in the season during a 38–27 loss to Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains {{a layer of}} keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E

25|$|A nail is a horn-like {{envelope}} {{covering the}} tips of the fingers and toes in most primates and a few other mammals. Nails are similar to claws in other animals. Fingernails and toenails are made <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> protective protein called alpha-keratin. This protein is also found in the hooves and horns of different animals.|$|E
25|$|The spinal discs are {{composed}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> spongiform ring of cartilage ("anulus fibrosus") {{with a more}} malleable center ("nucleus pulposus"). The discs separate the vertebrae, thereby allowing room for the nerve roots to properly exit through the spaces between the vertebrae. The discs cushion the spine from compressive forces, but are weak to pressure applied during rotational movements. That is why a person who bends to one side, at a bad angle to pick something up, may more likely herniate a spinal disc than a person jumping from a ladder and landing on their feet.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{high-profile}} murders and gangsters {{moving into the}} West Coast, combined with the recall of Mayor Frank L. Shaw because of corruption charges related to organized crime, caused law enforcement to stop accommodating the Mafia. In the late 1930s, California Attorney General Earl Warren took command <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> assault on Dragna's empire, most notably shutting down the gambling ships run by Anthony Cornero. On February 14, 1950, the California Commission on Organized Crime singled out Dragna {{as the head of}} a crime syndicate that controlled crime in Southern California. Soon after, several of his family members were arrested for the bombing of Mickey Cohen's home. Dragna fled the state and was wanted for questioning. He later surrendered, and was questioned in the Kefauver hearings along with Roselli and Bompensiero, but denied all accusations against him. Dragna's family however, remain strong throughout the early 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Zhou's {{political}} {{fate was}} subject to rife speculation in the lead-up to the 16th Party Congress held {{in the fall of}} 2002. Widely regarded as a rising political star, Zhou was said to be a leading candidate for Vice-Premier or entry into the top ranks of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei). The central government was also in need <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> and uncompromising figure to take reins of China's security system in the post-9/11 global security paradigm. With his quasi-military style training in the oil sector and a reputation for being able to make tough decisions, Zhou got the nod to become Minister of Public Security in December 2002. He also earned a series of powerful posts in the party and government within the span of a few months, including membership in the Politburo, State Councilor, Deputy Zhengfawei Secretary, First Political Commissar of the People's Armed Police (China's paramilitary police force), and Secretary of the party's Central Secretariat (the party's internal policy execution and coordination body).|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Walter Smith had been {{appointed}} manager, Scotland had dropped to a record low position in the FIFA World Rankings. Smith was credited with creating a [...] "club atmosphere" [...] within the national squad. Scotland performed well {{in the early stages}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> UEFA Euro 2008 qualification group, but Smith resigned from the Scotland job in January 2007 to manage Rangers. Alex McLeish was hired to replace Smith. Scotland continued to pursue qualification for Euro 2008 under McLeish, but were eliminated after losing against Italy in the final match. McLeish left the Scotland job soon afterwards, to manage Birmingham City. Despite failing to qualify for a tournament, the improved results under both Smith and McLeish lifted Scotland to 13th place in the world rankings.|$|E
500|$|Bonass {{completed}} the 1939–40 season with QPR in the wartime league, which although not regarded as competitive was certainly taken seriously: against Chelsea in December, he was stretchered {{off with a}} suspected broken leg, victim <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> tackle [...] "like many others in this pacy, no-quarter struggle" [...] where the [...] "war of words between rival fan factions on the terrace reminded [...] of the Glasgow Rangers–Celtic match". He played some 30 times for QPR thereafter, and guested {{for a number of}} clubs including Aldershot, Brentford, Chesterfield, Fulham, Luton Town, Southampton, Watford and York. Bonass served with the Metropolitan Police as a War Reserve Constable for four years, and apart from his war-related duties, played for their football team, scored as the Police Professionals beat the Police Amateurs 5–2 in September 1942, and also represented the national police team.|$|E

500|$|The early {{reputation}} of the force was shaped by journalistic accounts published in the 1880s and 1890s, followed by various biographical accounts written by retired officers. The initial press response to the mounted police was mixed, particularly among Liberal newspapers, and focused on what the historian Michael Dawson describes as accounts of [...] "inefficiency, irresolution and impropriety" [...] within the new organisation. In contrast, police memoirs promoted an image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> but fair force, focused on maintaining order in the wilderness. Quite quickly, however, a more heroic, romantic tone came to dominate newspaper accounts and a powerful myth was built up around the mounted police. This was reinforced by {{events such as the}} mounted police's Musical Ride, performed {{for the first time in}} 1887, which entertained the crowds with cavalry charges and displays with lances.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Alligator gar have gills, {{but unlike}} {{other species of}} fish, with few exceptions, {{they also have a}} highly vascularized swim bladder lung that {{supplements}} gill respiration. The bladder not only provides buoyancy but also enables them to breathe in air which is why they are able to inhabit bodies of water in which most other fishes would die of suffocation. [...] The swim bladder is connected to their foregut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the surface, an action that is seen quite frequently on lakes in the southern United States during the hot summer months. [...] The scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales; their bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are diamond-shaped, often with serrated edges, and composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of ganoin which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel, making them nearly impenetrable.|$|E
50|$|This {{was seen}} as an imaginative policy, since, if {{properly}} implemented, it could achieve virtually all of the government's objectives for a better performing, more efficient railway without the expense or controversy of renationalising the assets. At the Labour Party conference in September 1998, Prescott declared {{that he was going to}} carry out <b>a</b> 'spring clean <b>of</b> the regulators', which many commentators realised meant the appointment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tougher,</b> more interventionist replacement for Swift.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{psychologists have}} argued that a separate, sport-specific {{definitions}} of mental toughness should be developed. They have highlighted that the attributes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mentally <b>tough</b> athlete in one sport may differ greatly from the attributes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mentally <b>tough</b> athlete in <b>a</b> different sport. Differences have been hypothesized {{between male and female}} athletes, as well as between [...] "team sport" [...] and [...] "individual sport" [...] athletes, but to date, little empirical evidence has shown what these differences are.|$|R

500|$|On {{reaching}} Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, {{and requested}} that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was {{informed by the}} Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. [...] Then, {{with the help of}} the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. [...] In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, in Chile, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. [...] After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice Rumples.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the songs}} on A Lesson in Romantics were written while touring after Warped Tour. The songs are about: [...] "being in a {{relationship}} while you're on the road, and the different hardships that come with that." [...] Unlike the band's EP, the album was [...] "more put together" [...] and [...] "more organized", according to Garcia. Sanders thought it stood up [...] "pretty well" [...] to the EP, noting that it was [...] "just as catchy [...] ", but [...] "more powerful." [...] "Jamie All Over" [...] was originally recorded by Kid Named Chicago, Lancaster's previous band. Sanders claimed the song was [...] "kind <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> one to choose" [...] because the band {{had a lot of}} new material to choose from, but felt [...] "pretty happy" [...] with its inclusion. [...] "When I Get Home, You're So Dead" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs the band wrote. According to Garcia, the final track was called [...] "You Be the Anchor That Keeps My Feet on the Ground, I'll Be the Wings That Keep Your Heart in the Clouds" [...] because the band was [...] "trying to be poetic".|$|E
