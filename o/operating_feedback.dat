Despite their recognition {{as one of the}} main cornerstones for safety, one can wonder if lessons from both incidents and major accidents are or were satisfactory learned and implemented. These difficulties lead some companies to particularly poorly react to signs that herald an accident. In this paper, we will address several cases in varions high-risk industries that highlighted some failures in their <b>operating</b> <b>feedback</b> Systems. After ïdentifying some of their organisational weaknesses, we will argue about what we assume is foundation of this flaw: the lack of "culture of accidents "...|$|E

40|$|International audienceReliability {{importance}} measures {{providing information}} {{about the importance of}} components on the system performance (reliability, maintainability, safety, or any performance metrics of interest) have been widely used in reliability studies and risk analysis. In this paper, the differential importance measure (DIM) introduced recently for use in risk-informed decision-making is extended to Markov reliability models. This allows to qualify the relative contribution of a component (or a group of components), as well as a state (or a group of states) on the total variation of system performance. The estimation of DIM at steady state from the <b>operating</b> <b>feedback</b> data by using perturbation analysis is also investigated. A numerical example of a dynamic system is finally introduced to illustrate the use of DIM, as well as the advantages of proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|FOREWORD <b>Operating</b> {{experience}} <b>feedback</b> programmes {{have been}} extensively {{developed over the}} past few years at various levels within the nuclear community, such as at nuclear power plants, utility headquarters, industry groups, research institutes and national regulatory bodies, and by such international organizations as the Interna tional Atomic Energy Agency, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and, more recently, the World Association of Nuclear Operators. The usefulness of <b>operating</b> experience <b>feedback</b> programmes has thus increasingly been recognized. Accurate monitoring of the performance of any technical system always requires an on-line feedback loop capable of reacting to any disturbance in order to constantly adjust the output of the system to the set point. Operating experience feed back programmes are expected to play a similar role, by helping in the timely correc tion of management policy to permanently meet plant targets.

40|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{empirical}} evidence that feedback from radio AGN active galactic nuclei regulates {{the growth of}} the most massive galaxies, we are far from understanding how this <b>feedback</b> cycle <b>operates.</b> <b>Feedback</b> models generally require an AGN to be fueled by cooled or cooling gas, with accretion of cooled gas being favored by current theory and observations. However, there is little direct evidence of hot gas cooling to low temperatures. I will discuss how X-ray observations at high spatial and spectral resolution, as could be provided by an X-ray Surveyor mission, can be used to probe feedback between a radio AGN and its hot atmosphere. My primary focus will be on thermally unstable cooling of the hot gas, but I will also consider aspects of energy transfer to the gas...|$|R
40|$|The {{open-loop}} input-output {{dynamics and}} the noise dynamics of a feedback controlled linear system perturbed by coloured noise admitting a Markov representation are identified in state variable form using a two-stage algorithm. This system is equivalent to an augmented system driven by white noise. First the input-output dynamics are identified through a stochastic approximation algorithm using superimposed white noise. Subtracting the model output from the system output yields correlated residuals which are then used to identify the noise dynamics using stochastic realization theory. An innovations representation is obtained that {{is equivalent to the}} above defined augmented system. The two stages are combined by a judicious coordinate transformation. The method can be applied on an <b>operating</b> <b>feedback</b> controlled process, regardless {{of the structure of the}} unknown suboptimal regulator. Anglai...|$|E
40|$|How ironic that, in humankind’s {{quest for}} sustainability, so little {{attention}} {{is given to}} the biospheric life support system upon which the human species depends. Since natural systems cannot speak to human society, a continuously <b>operating</b> <b>feedback</b> loop is essential for providing information about a natural system’s condition in time to take corrective action when necessary. Investigators must replicate the important cause/effects pathways of natural systems. Biomonitoring is surveillance undertaken to ensure that previously established quality control conditions are being met. Surveillance is the systematic and orderly gathering of data to determine what is happening, but without a prior commitment to initiate remedial action if quality control conditions do not remain within an acceptable range. In order to take remedial action before severe damage has occurred, sampling must be sufficiently frequent and the results quickly available to provide an early warning of deleterious conditions. Micro- and mesocosms are not miniature ecosystems, but rather systems of lesser complexity that provide useful information on selected ecosystem attributes. Their design, study, and extrapolation to larger, multivariate ecosystems require considerable professional judgment. Properly used, micro- and mesocosms provide evidence for decision making that can prevent or diminish damage to larger natural systems for which they act as surrogates...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of deindustrialization and desurbanization, Romanian cities are confronted with issues related to natural {{demographic}} decline and out-migration, inducing apparently opposite, but complementary phenomena: slow-burn shrinkage and urban sprawl, which create peripheralisation processes {{both inside and outside}} the cities. The current approach acknowledges urban shrinkage within {{the context of}} post-communist transformations, but also as a “natural” process in the (adaptive) life cycle of cities. In this context, the study aims to explore the interdependencies between the causes and effects of shrinkage, on the one hand, and the <b>operating</b> <b>feedback</b> mechanisms which might lead to adaptation, on the other. It highlights the changes incurred by the territorial (un) balance combining the spatial analysis of urban shrinkage in relation to the diffused structures imposed by sub-urbanization or metropolisation processes. Using multi-criteria and time series analysis methods, the aim of the assessment is to determine and analyse the significant correlations and trends taking into account relevant demographic, social–economic as well as infrastructural and environmental indicators, in order to describe typologies of urban shrinkage in Romania and their adaptation potential. The results are interpreted in correlation with the need for sustainable strategies and planning, in order to tackle the issue of urban shrinkage in Romania...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{nuclear power}} plants, {{probabilistic}} risk assessment insights contribute {{to achieve a}} safe design and operation. In this context, the decision-making process must be robust and uncertainties {{must be taken into}} account and controlled. In general, the uncertainties in a nuclear probabilistic risk assessment context can be categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. The epistemic uncertainty, which can be subdivided into parameter and model uncertainties, is recognized to have an important impact on actual results of probabilistic risk assessment. Traditionally, the approach of an epistemic uncertainty analysis in nuclear probabilistic risk assessment often relies on the probabilistic approach in which parameter uncertainty is treated by using an assigned probability distribution, e. g. the log-normal one, and model uncertainty can be taken into account through sensitivity studies. Such an approach has been recognized in several recent researchs to present limitations regarding the impacts of assigning probability distribution in case of rare <b>operating</b> <b>feedback</b> data. In order to overcome such a limitation, in this article we propose a comprehensive approach for uncertainty analysis from the parameter and model uncertainties modeling to the final step of the decision-making process using the Dempster-Shafer theory, which is recognized to be more general than the probabilistic approach. We also show that the traditional probabilistic approach, currently used in probabilistic risk assessment practice, can be totally integrated in this framework. Finally, the proposed framework is illustrated and compared with the traditional approach through a practical example from EDF Nuclear Power Plants probabilistic risk assessment application. Some discussions and conclusions for industrial probabilistic risk assessment contexts will be given...|$|E

In the first stage, we identified the secondary data for measuring TF-MA and TF-MI published from the LPI of the World Bank (source: [URL] The LPI comprises six items: (1) the efficiency of customs and border staff, (2) quality of trade and transport infrastructures including sea port, airport, road and rail, (3) ease of arranging competitively priced shipments, (4) competence {{and quality of the}} logistics services, (5) ability to track and trace, and (6) frequency that shipments reach consignees within the expected delivery times. The first two items (i.e., TF-MA 01 and TF-MA 02) were adopted as the measurement items of TF-MA and the remaining four items (i.e., TF-MI 01, TF-MI 02, TF-MI 03, and TF-MI 04) were adopted as the measurement items of TF-MI.

The main objective of the information system is to develop communication, cooperation and sharing of operating experience amongst the national nuclear regulatory authorities participating in EU Clearinghouse network. The CH-OEF {{is essential for the}} preparation and dissemination of the quarterly reports on NPP events. These reports are published every three months and are intended to be complementary to other international reporting systems, containing mainly recent information publicly available. Only events that are considered to be likely to have lessons applicable to EU NPPs or with a real or potential impact on nuclear safety are addressed in the reports. The CH-OEF is a fundamental tool for their preparation, providing specific features for a more efficient sharing of information as well as for facilitating the related discussion and decision making.

40|$|The {{asymptotic}} {{properties of}} discrete time stochastic systems <b>operating</b> under <b>feedback</b> is addressed. It {{is assumed that}} a Markov chain $ Phi$ evolving on Euclidean space exists, and that the input and output processes appear as functions of $ Phi$.

A condition called local stochastic controllability, a generalization {{of the concept of}} controllability from linear system theory, is introduced and is shown to be sufficient to ensure that the first objective is met. The second objective is explored by introducing a notion of convergence for stochastic systems and investigating the behavior of the invariant probabilities corresponding to a convergent sequence of stochastic systems.
