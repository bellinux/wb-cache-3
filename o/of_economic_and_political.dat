5|$|During the Late Mycenaean period (1400–1200 BC), Mycenaean vessels/pottery {{exhibited}} similarities spanning {{a significant}} {{area of the}} Eastern Mediterranean (i.e., from the Levant to Sicily) and possibly reflecting a form <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> union centered at Mycenae. However, the pottery of Crete during this time remained distinct indicating a degree of autonomy on the island. The Mycenaean Greeks produced in large quantities a variety of diversely-styled vessels such as stirrup jars, large bowls, alabastron, krater and stemmed cups (or kylikes) resembling champagne glasses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the occupation, the Allies {{controlled}} traffic between the zones to manage the flow of refugees and prevent the escape of former Nazi officials and intelligence officers. These controls were gradually lifted in the Western zones, but were tightened between Western and Soviet zones in 1946 to stem a flow <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> refugees from the Soviet zone. Between October 1945 and June 1946, 1.6million Germans left the Soviet zone for the west.|$|E
5|$|Some {{opposition}} parties supported the protests' plans, while {{others did not}} explicitly call for demonstration. However, they demanded deep reforms and changes similar to those by the youth. Before the start of protests, the government introduced a number <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> concessions. The protests started with a sit-in in solidarity with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 {{in the vicinity of}} the Egyptian embassy in the capital, Manama ten days before the 'Day of Rage'. On the eve of 14 February, security forces dispersed hundreds of protesters south of Manama.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} no major hostility {{as a result of}} the {{division}} of loyalty between the royalty and the nobility. In the same year, an English merchant, W.H. Read, controlled Sultan Ali's royal seal in exchange for a promise to liquidate his debts. Read had been an active supporter of Sultan Ali's claims for recognition as the legitimate ruler of Johor and the state's revenue, with the Temenggong as his vassal. As a result <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> pressure from these traders, the Governor did consider granting a formal recognition to Sultan Ali as the legitimate ruler of Johor, but in the process, he received a strong protest from the Temenggong and his young son, Abu Bakar.|$|E
5|$|The Platine War {{ended in}} 1852 with the Allied {{victory at the}} Battle of Caseros, for some time {{establishing}} Brazilian hegemony over much of South America. The war ushered a period <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> stability in the Empire of Brazil. With Rosas gone, Argentina began a political process which {{would result in a}} more unified state. However, the end of the Platine war did not completely resolve issues within the Platine region. Turmoil continued in subsequent years, with internal disputes among political factions in Uruguay, a long civil war in Argentina, and an emergent Paraguay asserting its claims. Two more major international wars (see:Paraguayan War) followed during the next two decades, sparked by territorial ambitions and conflicts over influence.|$|E
5|$|This {{same period}} <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> uncertainty, however, {{produced}} an unsurpassed literary flowering in England. The {{first signs of}} a new literary movement had appeared {{at the end of}} the second decade of Elizabeth's reign, with John Lyly's Euphues and Edmund Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender in 1578. During the 1590s, some of the great names of English literature entered their maturity, including William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. During this period and into the Jacobean era that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks. The notion of a great Elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.|$|E

5|$|The Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most {{powerful}} institution. It delegates {{some of its}} powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo {{when it is not}} in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to centralise power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The current President of the Socialist Republic, Trương Tấn Sang, was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held 1996. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing Lê Khả Phiêu from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu's rule.|$|E

The Bolsheviks believed that this required a new international to foment revolution in Europe and around the world.|$|E
