It {{is based on}} the DCT operator proposed in Kovac and Ranganathan, 1995. Speed-up is obtained by using multimedia oriented subword parallelism (SWP). Rather than operating on a single pixel, the SWP-based DCT operator performs parallel computations on multiple pixels packed in word size input registers so that the performance of the operator is increased. Special emphasis is made to increase the coordination between pixel sizes and subword sizes to maximize resource utilization rate. Rather than using classical subword sizes (8, 16, and 32 bits), multimedia oriented subword sizes (8, 10, 12, and 16 bits) are used in the proposed DCT operator. The proposed SWP DCT <b>operator</b> <b>unit</b> {{can be used as a}} coprocessor for multimedia applications...|$|E

40|$|The Swedish Armed Forces {{have entered}} a {{transition}} phase, departing {{from a traditional}} late 20 th century national defence structure to another, adaptable to situated demands, implying more efficient use of resources. The transformation blueprint is the Network-Based Defence (NBD) vision. Several crucial functions and capacities have to be verified as proof of concept. The transition includes the development of experiment test-beds, “demonstrators”, for the verification and validation of concepts, command method design and technical solutions. The NBD vision relies on situated or situation-oriented activity systems (SitSysts), an abstraction for mission-specific tailoring of capacities and organizations. Prerequisite for such systems, {{in accordance with the}} general development in society, are physical and immaterial “Mission Related Services” (MRS), being the interfaces between clients (<b>operators,</b> <b>unit</b> commanders) and suppliers (other <b>operators,</b> <b>units,</b> agencies) that will promote flexible combinations of resources. An analysis of the NBD concept has led to a command system and MRS design method, an adaptation of the Rational Unified Process (RUPTM) method (framework), also incorporating current Swedish experiences. A possible further step is to embed the method in future new planning and control tools or services. The article describes the transition principles, the theory behind the method design, the analytic process, and the MRS methodology...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the {{multimedia}} domain, {{the performance of}} different computationally intensive applications can be enhanced by executing them on operating units which are suitable for low precision pixel data. Subword parallelism (SWP) {{is one of the}} techniques which can be used to design arithmetic operators for the parallel processing of pixel data. However in conventional SWP operators, the lack of coordination between subwords and pixel sizes results in the under utilization of the hardware resources. In this paper, a SWP motion estimation (ME) operator is proposed for multimedia applications. The computational units in this operator are designed based upon multimedia oriented subword sizes rather than classical subword sizes. Due to the better coordination between pixels and subword sizes, the SWP ME operator utilizes the available resources more efficiently which ultimately increases the overall performance of the processor for multimedia applications. The proposed SWP ME <b>operator</b> <b>unit</b> {{can be used as a}} co-processor for real-time multimedia applications...|$|E
40|$|In rig constructions two nev designs {{have been}} {{introduced}} apart from the conventional hoisting system. The first one is the Maritime Hydraulics A. S RamRig© drilling concept, based on hydraulic cylinders as actuators powered by up to 3. 4 MW of hydraulic power in a closed loop hydraulic system. This synthesis of the well-known technology allows {{for the use of}} integrated active and passive heave compensation, as well as the storing and reuse of energy from the lowering phase of an operation. The RamRig concept makes mechanical brakes and clutches obsolete, since hoisting and lowering of the load is controlled solely by the closed loop hydraulics. This decreases the number of critical mechanical components in the hoisting system to a minimum. Safe handling and emergency shut down of extreme amounts of hydraulic power is taking care of by cartridge valves, which make rerouting of hydraulic power possible with minor losses of transferred effect. The second is a new land rig concept based on a patented rack & pinion drive system with a new generation of rigs which can instantly switch between the workover, drilling and the snubbing operations. The new rig concept has a direct drive, thus no drill line. The mobilization time is reduced as the rig has fewer truck loads, a faster rig up and a higher automation level. One land rig currently under construction will be the world’s first single <b>operator</b> <b>unit,</b> with a full pipe handling capability and a fully automated control system. The rig is fully equipped with the 250 T top drive which can be used for the rotation and snubbing, the purpose designed snubbing slips and other features supporting the multifunctional well operations.

40|$|In a {{specialized}} social services, {{there is a}} risk of lack of holistic approach to clients with complex problems. To reduce this risk, it is important to cooperate with other professions to get a complete picture of the client's complex situation. The study aims to investigate how social workers on the current unit within {{a specialized}} social work can experience how the work, with a holistic approach and collaboration in order to provide clients with complex problems, is done in practice. The study focuses {{on the extent to which}} social workers feel that collaboration occurs and in what form it takes, how the work on policies and procedures are implemented and followed. The study also aims to identify the obstacles and possibilities of collaboration, and how administrators receive comprehensive view of clients with complex problems and how they go about initiating cooperation. The collection of data have been made through individual interviews with five social workers from a economic support unit in a medium-sized municipality in northern Sweden. The analysis of the empirical material made by conventional content analysis, where the four themes showed in the material. These themes are varied forms of cooperation - individual and overall, policies and procedures, obstacles and opportunitets, as well as social workers degree of discretion to see the client's life situation and initiate cooperation based on the needs they see. The result shows that it is very different how social workers are working on the current unit, to get a holistic view and how they interact with other units and interaction operators. It is up to the individual social worker whether he uses his discretion to create a holistic approach. However, there are several factors that affect the discretion and the client relationship, and affect the ability to interact with others and to follow the procedures that are in operation. The main conclusion is that it is very important that everyone who works with a client is on board. Clients with complex problems can often have several professions that interact in a network around the client. It is enough that a single <b>operator,</b> <b>unit</b> or agency not understand, or want to cooperate, to the client not will get the support he needs. ...|$|E
