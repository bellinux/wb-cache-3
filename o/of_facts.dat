5|$|Under {{the first}} sub-heading, a public {{authority}} {{will be considered}} as having acted illegally {{if there is no}} legal basis for the action carried out or the decision made (simple ultra vires), or, more specifically, if the authority has made an error concerning a jurisdictional or precedent fact. A precedent fact error is made when an authority comes to a conclusion in the absence <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> that must objectively exist, or in the presence <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> that must not exist, before it has the power to act or decide.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E
50|$|Answers to {{questions}} <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{are determined by}} a trier <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> such as a jury, or a judge. In many jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, appellate courts generally do not consider appeals based on errors <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> (errors in answering a question <b>of</b> <b>fact).</b> Rather, the findings <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> the first venue are usually given great deference by appellate courts.|$|R

50|$|While {{questions}} <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{are resolved}} by a trier <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> {{which in the}} common law system is often a jury, questions of law are always resolved by a judge or equivalent.

5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E
5|$|In Demosthenes's initial {{judicial}} orations, {{the influence}} of both Lysias and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed. Most of his extant speeches for private cases—written early in his career—show glimpses of talent: a powerful intellectual drive, masterly selection (and omission) <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> and a confident assertion of the justice of his case, all ensuring the dominance of his viewpoint over his rival. However, {{at this early stage}} of his career, his writing was not yet remarkable for its subtlety, verbal precision and variety of effects.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting <b>of</b> <b>facts.</b> He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E
50|$|An {{extinguishment}} may be by matter <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and by {{matter of}} law. If a creditor receives satisfaction and full payment of a debt and the creditor releases the debtor, {{then that is}} express extinguishment by matter <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> If a person is renting land and subsequently becomes the owner of that same land by purchase or descent, the rent is extinguished through implied extinguishment by matter <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|R

5|$|On May 24, 1942, Rockwell {{was seeking}} {{approval}} for a poster design at The Pentagon because the Artists Guild had designated that he advocate for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. Robert Patterson, who was then United States Undersecretary of War, suggested revisions. On the same day, he visited with Thomas Mabry of the Graphic Division of the War Department's Office <b>of</b> <b>Facts</b> and Figures, which coordinated war-themed posters and billboards. Mabry relayed the need for Four Freedoms artwork. Rockwell returned home pondering the Atlantic Charter, which had incorporated the Four Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Political Economy, {{the first}} edition {{published}} in 1883, {{was one of the}} most widely used textbooks of the 19th century as a component of the American Science Series. Robert Solow criticized the third edition (1888) for being devoid <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> figures, and mostly full of off-the-cuff judgments on the practices and capacities of Native Americans and immigrants, but generally embodying the state of the art of economics at the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination <b>of</b> <b>facts.</b> Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E
40|$|Barbara Shapiro's A Culture <b>of</b> <b>Fact</b> {{argued that}} a fact-orientated culture emerged in seventeenth-century England. Fact, {{formerly}} a legal category, was absorbed by a range of other discourses and became a crucial component of the epistemological shifts of the period. The {{question of how the}} culture <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> altered the articulation of the related concept of error has not been investigated. This thesis analyses the changing concept of error against the emergence of the culture <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> arguing for a shift from the personified and allegorised representation of error to a status as the particularised counterpart and opposite to the establishment <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> The epistemological, religious, and cultural contexts informing notions of error and its particularisation are established. This particularisation is exemplified in the introduction by an account of the incorporation of the language <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> into the titles of texts concerning error. The chapters build on the critically established narrative of the permeation of evidential concerns surrounding matters <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> into drama, pioneered by Lorna Hutson, to examine plays and non-dramatic literary texts which offer perspectives on error as a mistake in matter <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Plays engage with the contexts of error, the conventions <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> and stage how mishandling these conventions results in error. Poems by Spenser and Fletcher, and masques by Middleton and Campion reflect the shifting status of Protestant Truth, a key context of error, and its consequences for the representation of error. Jonson addresses error in forms scrutinised by seventeenth-century cultura animi authors and considers how they engender factual errors; whilst Ford and Brome, reacting to specific medical subgenres of error writing, conceived of error’s utility in a curative theatre. These playwrights unite a cultural concern with error as a specific sense of being mistaken in matters <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> with drama’s historical prerogative to exploit error in plots which may reflect a seventeenth-century recognition of error’s utility in the pursuit <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R
5000|$|In law, a {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> {{also known as}} a point <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> is {{a question}} that must be answered by reference to facts and evidence as well as inferences arising from those facts. Such a question is distinct from a question of law, which must be answered by applying relevant legal principles. The answer to a question <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> (a [...] "finding of fact") usually depends on particular circumstances or factual situations.|$|R
50|$|Mistakes <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{was rarely}} an {{adequate}} defense at common law. In the United States, 37 states have ruled out mistake <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{as a defense}} to charges of attempt. Mistakes of law have proved a more successful defense.|$|R
5|$|The most {{significant}} author to discuss Philip the Arab and Christianity is Eusebius, {{who served as}} bishop of Caesarea in Roman Palestine from ca. 314 to his death in 339. Eusebius' major work is the Historia Ecclesiastica, written in several editions dating from ca. 300 to 325. The Historia is not an attempt at a full history of the Church in the classical style, but rather a collection <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> addressing six topics in Christian history from the Apostolic times to the late 3rd century: (1) lists of bishops of major sees; (2) Christian teachers and their writings; (3) heresies; (4) the tribulations of the Jews; (5) the persecutions of Christians by pagan authorities; and (6) the martyrs. His Vita Constantini, written between Constantine's death in 337 and Eusebius' own death in 339, {{is a combination of}} eulogistic encomium and continuation of the Historia (the two separate documents were combined and distributed by Eusebius' successor in the see of Caesarea, Acacius).|$|E
5|$|The {{reference}} {{must state}} {{the questions on}} which the Tribunal's opinion is required in a form which allows, as far as possible, answers to be given in the affirmative or the negative. There must also be a concise statement <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> and documents must be included, as are necessary to enable the Tribunal to decide the questions referred. During the hearing of a reference, the procedure in proceedings before the Court of Appeal applies. The President of Singapore is treated as the appellant and all other parties as respondents. However, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence. The proceedings of the Tribunal, except for the hearing for directions, are held in open court. No party to any proceedings is ordered to pay any costs, and no court fees are payable in respect of any proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
