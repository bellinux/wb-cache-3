Longitudinal cohort study. 16 General Practice surgeries across South-East London. 803 adults (70 % male, mean age 71 years) contributing up to 7 follow-up points. Ongoing reporting of symptoms, health care costs, and quality of life. At baseline, 27 % of the sample screened positive for symptoms of depression and anxiety, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The probability of scoring above the cut-off throughout the follow-up was 71. 5 % (p< 0. 001) for those screening positive at baseline, and for those screening negative, the probability of scoring below the cut-off throughout the follow-up was 97. 6 % (p< 0. 001). Total health care costs were 39 % higher during follow-up for those screening positive (p< 0. 05). Quality of life as measured by the SF- 12 was lower on the mental component during follow-up for those screening positive (- 0. 75, CI - 1. 53 to 0. 03, p = 0. 059), and significantly lower on the physical component (- 4. 99, CI - 6. 23 to -. 376, p< 0. 001). A <b>one-off</b> <b>measure</b> for depression and anxiety symptoms in CHD predicts future symptoms, costs, and quality of life over the subsequent three-years. These findings suggest symptoms of depression and anxiety in CHD persist throughout long periods and are detrimental to a patient's quality of life, whilst incurring higher health care costs for primary and secondary care services. Screening for these symptoms at the primary care level is important to identify and manage patients at risk of the negative effects of this comorbidity. Implementation of screening, and possible collaborative care strategies and interventions that help mitigate this risk should be the ongoing focus of researchers and policy-makers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues in}} favour of a reform of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) that makes the system more {{responsive}} to unexpected price shocks. The paper proposed rules based mechanism for withdrawing and injecting allowances from the market based on price trends. Key points: Following the 2008 economic recession, the price of European Union Allowances (EUAs) unsurprisingly dropped, following a fall in demand. However the low price has persisted despite mild economic growth within Europe {{since the beginning of}} the crisis. Policy regulators are currently unable to respond to unforeseen changes in economic circumstances, technology advancement and complementary policies that generate downward price pressure. The decision by the European Commission to temporarily withdraw 900 million EUAs from the market will have little impact on the long term market price expectation. Other <b>one-off</b> <b>measures</b> would also leave the system vulnerable, addressing the symptoms but not the cause of structural weakness in the system. What is needed is a responsiveness mechanism that enables the European Commission to respond to unanticipated shocks. This ‘rules-based reserve management mechanism’ would have a double trigger system in place. A price trend ‘trigger’ to determine when intervention would be needed, and a volume ‘trigger’, that would determine the amount of EUAs to inject or withdraw. This would encourage self-adjusting behaviour from market participants, anticipating an intervention by looking at the price trend over the specified period, thus acting in their own interest to buy, sell or banking their EUAs in advance of an intervention. This behaviour would help regulate the supply-demand balance of the market which would effectively limit the need for an intervention to exceptional circumstances...|$|R
40|$|The budget elasticities derived in {{this study}} {{indicate}} that a 1 % deviation of GDP from the long-term growth potential causes a purely cyclical change of 0. 38 % of GDP in Austria's budget balance. The predominance of progressive income taxation in Austria is reflected in the estimated elasticity of direct taxes on households to average income of 1. 3. We expected the elasticity of direct taxes on enterprises to gross operating surplus to come to 1, since the corporate income tax is a proportional tax; the computation result of 0. 9 confirms our assumption. The elasticity of indirect taxes to private consumption of 0. 97 documents both the high share of proportional taxes and the impact of specific taxes, while the elasticity values of social security contributions and pension insurance contributions to average income (0. 99 and 1) reveal the close correlation of these budget categories with the macroeconomic base variable. The elasticity of unemployment benefits to the number of unemployed persons of 0. 9 results from the rising average duration of unemployment. Between 2000 and 2004, the general government's structural budget balance (i. e. the budget balance adjusted for cyclical effects and <b>one-off</b> <b>measures)</b> improved from — 2. 1 % to — 0. 9 % of trend GDP. The development of the structural budget balance in Austria is above all shaped by discretionary measures based on legislative changes.

40|$|This study {{examines}} inter-linkages between the financing {{and development of}} Arab power sectors. These sectors are now operating in a difficult global financial market characterised by investors' retrenchment and risk aversion. This market has also {{moved away from the}} notion of a struggle between private and public finance, towards a strategy that emphasises the co-ordination of public, private, and multilateral players, to ensure successful delivery of services. Consequently, the current modus operandi in funding power projects worldwide is 'hybrid forms of co-operation'. Recently, Arab power sectors have witnessed the entry of private sponsors and financiers, both domestic and foreign, as a result of two policy responses. Firstly, power sector regulations were adjusted to allow private operators to participate in power generation. Secondly, the reform and development of Arab financial sectors allowed an expansion of participation by Arab banks, the use of new instruments, and the entry of new players. Though the change is not overwhelming quantitatively, it allowed private power to make a palpable contribution to the expansion of power generation capacity. Arab power infrastructure will also benefit from a number of intra-regional power pools and grid inter-connection projects, whose financing has been led by multilateral regional funds. Thus, there is a case for pursuing policies that build on the region’s strength and match the current emphasis on resource pooling, namely: strengthening regional co-operation; maintaining flexibility about the range of sponsors allowed to operate; furthering financial development. Conversely, power sector financing should shift away from an emphasis on supply shortages, towards managing demand and addressing operational and qualitative deficiencies. Similarly, sectoral reforms should be comprehensive enough to deal with underlying social and political dimensions. Given the embryonic state of regional reforms and of international experiences, financial problems will neither be solved quickly nor by <b>one-off</b> <b>measures</b> of price correction or asset sale...|$|R

It assesses the risk of budgetary losses for the French government due to unexpected developments in the different parameters used for the calculation of the lump sums. Stress tests show that these risks are very limited, especially with the perspective of an increase in the contribution period that will apply to all pension schemes.

"Competition law-ization" concerns the institutional structure of EU regulation.

Overall, the proposals can be seen as going in the direction of competition law-ization, but unbundling is criticized as a <b>one-off</b> structural <b>measure</b> that is incapable of giving rise to a permanent structure of rights that can be conducive to more effective regulation...|$|R
40|$|Twice a year, in June and December, the National Bank of Belgium {{publishes the}} {{macroeconomic}} projections for the Belgian economy {{for the current}} and the following year. The current projections are an update of the projections for 2004 and 2005 published last June. These projections make up the national component of the broad macroeconomic projection exercise conducted within the Eurosystem; the ECB publishes the aggregated results of this exercise for the euro area economy. At the current juncture, real GDP growth in the world’s leading economies is projected to remain robust in 2005, after having reached a peak in 2004. Compared to June, the Eurosystem has revised its projections for 2004 slightly upwards and still expects an acceleration in 2005, albeit at a more modest pace. Since the actual performance was better than expected, real GDP growth in Belgium has been revised upwards by 0. 4 p. p. in 2004; it is now expected to accelerate from 1. 3 p. c. in 2003 to 2. 7 p. c. in 2004 and to stabilise at 2. 5 p. c. in 2005, as the pace of growth is decelerating somewhat. It is still outstripping euro area growth, partly owing to stronger private consumption. Having significantly reduced their savings ratio in 2003 and 2004, individuals will gradually be able to rely on an improvement in their purchasing power, largely due to a better employment outlook. Job creation is expected to total 62, 000 jobs over the period 2004 - 2005 while, following a slight fall in 2004, {{the unemployment rate is}} likely to remain unchanged, at 7. 8 p. c., in 2005. Also, while exports will continue to benefit from robust external demand, the recovery should gradually extend to business investment in a context of strengthening demand, strong profitability and a sound financial environment. On the whole, economic growth should thus be more balanced. Compared to the June projection, headline inflation is expected to be higher, especially in 2005 when it is likely to accelerate to 2. 2 p. c., {{as a result of the}} increase in oil prices. Underlying inflation excluding energy, unprocessed food and administrative prices is projected to remain moderate due to limited wage increases and subdued pressures from import prices, notwithstanding the high level of commodity prices. Despite a more favourable economic environment, the general government balance is expected to revert from a surplus of 0. 3 p. c. of GDP in 2003 to a deficit of 0. 3 p. c. in 2004 and 0. 4 p. c. in 2005, mainly owing to the disappearance of <b>one-off</b> <b>measures.</b> The latter projection is nevertheless noticeably more favourable than in June.

40|$|Stage Three of the European Monetary Union (EMU) {{will start}} on January 1, 1999. The new {{currency}} area, {{for which the}} name "Euroland" has been coined, will comprise 11 countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. The project of a single currency has enhanced economic convergence among the participating countries to some degree, but differences {{with respect to the}} business cycle have remained pronounced. This can also be expected for EMU. A single monetary policy for Euroland will not affect regions uniformly, given the substantial differences between the participating countries with respect to, for example, institutional arrangements in financial markets and in labor markets, the public share in the economy or the structure of production. It is often argued that monetary policy in Europe is currently too tight; consequently, the upswing is at risk or even deflation is around the corner. This view is not supported by the facts. Various indicators suggest that monetary policy is actually quite easy. Given that European short-term interest rates are bound to converge around summer at a historically low level and key interest rates will hardly be raised substantially in the immediate future, monetary policy will remain loose for the time being. This policy increasingly bears some risk of accelerating inflation. In any event, there is no risk of outright deflation in Euroland. It is still an open question whether the European Central Bank (ECB) will use a monetary aggregate as an intermediate target (monetary targeting) or try to directly adjust monetary policy to (forecasted) inflationary developments (inflation targeting). Empirical work suggests that money demand in Euroland is sufficiently stable to pursue monetary targeting. Even if instability were to occur in the transition period and right after the introduction of the euro, this would not necessarily imply the superiority of inflation targeting because under such circumstances the reliability of inflation forecasts is reduced as well. The advantage of implementing the monetary targeting strategy that had proved to be successful in Germany would be that it allows the ECB to gain some of the Bundesbank's reputation. In 1997 public deficits in all countries of Euroland were kept within the limit of 3 percent of GDP set in the Maastricht Treaty. However, further consolidation is necessary in most countries {{in order to meet the}} obligations of the Stability and Growth Pact. Ultimately, the fiscal positions have to be sustainable in the long term. A rough calculation suggests that at present only a few of the prospective EMU countries have a sustainable fiscal position. In addition, fiscal policy seems to be less sustainable because in some countries <b>one-off</b> <b>measures</b> contributed significantly to the reduction of the 1997 deficits. After EMU is established, bilateral exchange rates as possible shock absorber cease to exist and other mechanisms of adjusting to a negative (external) shock are necessary in order to prevent unemployment from rising. The most important adjustment mechanism left is flexibility of wages. It would be counterproductive to increasingly negotiate wage settlements at the European level. Against the background of the rising need for differentiation, decisions that affect employment should, to the contrary, be more and more decentralized. [...] ...|$|R

These hypotheses concern (i) the composition of the consolidation programme, (ii) its size and persistence, (iii) the gravity of the debt situation, (iv) the influence of the international macroeconomic environment, (v) the role of labour and product market institutions and institutional reform, (vi) the ideological orientation of the government, and (vii) the role of strict fiscal rules. We add a new hypothesis emphasizing the influence of public sector efficiency. We also improve on the literature methodologically by controlling for <b>one-off</b> budgetary <b>measures.</b> Consolidation programmes imply a stronger reduction of the public debt ratio when they mainly rely on spending cuts (except public investment), are large but of short duration, take place when growth in the international economy is high and interest rates are low, are accompanied by product market deregulation, are adopted by left-wing governments, are embedded in a regime of strict and wide fiscal rules, and are executed by highly efficient administrations. Public sector efficiency is important also for the composition hypothesis. Government wage bill cuts do not contribute to lower public debt ratios when public sector efficiency is high. On the hypothesis that consolidation is more likely to succeed in a situation of fiscal emergency, our evidence is mixed. Finally, we find no evidence that labour market deregulation contributes to a reduction of the public debt ratio during consolidation periods. public debt, fiscal consolidation, fiscal policy composition, fiscal rules, labour and product market institutions, government efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The forward {{march of}} biobanking creates {{the need for}} an {{alternative}} approach to biobank governance. Biobanking encourages medical advancement by making the conduct of health-related research more efficient, by minimising physical harms to participants, and by facilitating personalised medicine and greater understandings of disease. Nonetheless, its characteristics that distinguish it from general health-related research often give rise to many ethical and social issues. For example, multiple and unexpected uses of biobank resources can render conventional informed consent inadequate for safeguarding participants and maintaining public trust and confidence. Also, because the size of a biobank cohort is normally large, biobanking usually requires considerable management resources and this can mean that biobanks can likely be financially dependent upon for-profit entities. This dependency can cause concern among participants and publics about commercial exploitation. These issues suggest that a new approach to biobank governance is required to address them. Indeed, their complexity and the sheer longevity of biobanking itself also suggest that it is relatively feasible and coherent to address them by focusing on a relationship between participants and biobankers. This involves many aspects of interaction and reflects an element of continuity, which is crucial to biobanking success, as opposed to <b>one-off</b> <b>measures.</b> Consequently, with the aim of addressing issues that arise from biobanking, this thesis offers an analysis of the participant-biobanker relationship that can deal with these issues. Such a relationship constitutes an authentic research relationship in biobanking (“ARR”). Based on this premise, the main research question of my thesis is to ask: What form of research relationship is appropriate for effective and ethical biobanking practices? Three sub-questions are raised to solve this top-level research question. They start with a normative question of why the ARR proposed in this thesis is desirable for biobanking. The next sub-question asks what this ARR should look like from a conceptual perspective. For a practical respect on my proposals, the last sub-question concerns {{the ways in which the}} ARR can be fostered in practice. To address these research questions, my thesis first establishes the main characteristics of the proposed ARR as the fundamental notion thereof. These main characteristics are used to answer the first sub-question. For the second sub-question, the thesis suggests that the ARR should be based on the concept of partnership, as opposed to solidarity, mainly because partnership can exhibit the main characteristics of the ARR – as argued – and can also be prescribed in a governance manner. The thesis then uses partnership as a basis for proposing the key features of the ARR, which are deemed to be a conceptual framework for the ARR. To answer the last sub-question, the thesis uses this conceptual framework to propose a partnership model for biobank governance that can be used to develop the ARR in practice. My original contribution is to propose a novel approach to an ARR, and this ARR is based on the concept of partnership. In other words, my thesis argues that the pursuit of the ARR, which looks like a partnership relationship, is an important element of biobanking success. In this respect, my thesis is about a sociologically informed role for partnership in biobank governance. It also provides a nuanced epistemological grounding for a participant-biobanker relationship in both conceptual and practical ways. From a philosophical perspective, my thesis proposes an ethical framework for biobank governance that perceives partnership as a virtuous trait for biobankers and provides rules for acquiring this trait through biobanking practices. Notably, it is argued that this partnership is not – nor need it be – the legal paradigm of partnership, which fundamentally refers to for-profit business association. While law might have a role to play in facilitating the development of the ARR, it cannot prescribe the ARR nor should it attempt to do so...|$|R
40|$|The {{product of}} a {{remarkable}} series of compromises, ASIO’s new powers should only operate for three years, unless there’s compelling reason to extend them, writes George WilliamsTHE ASIO bill is an extraordinary law for an extraordinary time. It can be justified only as a temporary response to the threat to our security posed by terrorism and is akin to the one-off laws passed in Australia during world wars I and II. The legislation will lapse after three years {{and should not be}} re-enacted unless there remains a high security threat. In this form, the bill does not create a long-term precedent for law enforcement and intelligence gathering in Australia. The bill was introduced in March 2002, six months after the September 11 attacks. As introduced, it was unpassable and would not have been out of place in Augusto Pinochet 2 ̆ 7 s Chile. In its final form, the bill reflects the bipartisan recommendations of two key parliamentary inquiries. It also contains numerous amendments from the 15 months of debate in what {{has been one of the}} most intensive exercises of parliamentary scrutiny seen in Australia. Under the revised bill, Australians may be questioned by ASIO for 24 hours over a one-week period. They then must be released, but can be questioned again (perhaps soon afterwards) if a new warrant can be justified by fresh information. The regime does not apply to young children and detainees will have access to a lawyer of their choice, unless the lawyer poses a security risk. The possibility of a 10 -year-old child being detained and strip-searched in secret has been removed. Further safeguards also have been included. A person can be held and questioned only when ordered by a judge, and the questioning will be before a retired judge. The questioning must be videotaped and the whole process will be subject to the ongoing scrutiny of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who is effectively the ombudsman for ASIO. These additional protections in the hands of independent people blunt some of the worst excesses of the original bill. Whether they will enable the bill to survive any High Court challenge is less clear. The original bill was one of the worst introduced into the federal parliament. The amendments made by all parties have made a significant difference. Although the bill will still not satisfy those who argue against greater powers for ASIO, I believe that the right decision was made to pass the amended version as a <b>one-off</b> security <b>measure.</b> After September 11 and the Bali attack, national laws are needed to better protect the Australian people and to fulfil our international obligations to fight terrorism. The bill can be justified in giving ASIO the power to question people about terrorism. It is true that the bill goes further than this and important reservations remain. But as a product of parliamentary compromise, it is a remarkable achievement. It is also a powerful example of the need to retain the Senate as an effective house of review. Australians need to be vigilant to ensure that the new powers are not abused. The safeguards in the bill cannot replace ongoing media and public scrutiny. Parliament also has a significant continuing role. In two and a half years, the parliamentary joint committee on ASIO will review the legislation. This will be a key step in determining whether it should be re-enacted. The bill scraped over the line on this occasion. There would need to be a compelling justification for it to do so again.
