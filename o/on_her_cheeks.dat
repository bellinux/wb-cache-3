25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E
500|$|Ellen became {{something}} of a tourist attraction for Turville. She was visited by journalists, medical professionals, religious personnel and the [...] "plain curious" [...] from across the country, many of whom donated money to Ellen's family {{to be allowed to}} see her. Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the [...] "supply" [...] began to run out. A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit: Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs like those of a dead child, almost ice cold... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances... her eyes and cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death... but although there was no colour <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.|$|E

60|$|She hesitated--more {{markedly}} this time--and the blush became deeper <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> I groaned aloud.|$|E
60|$|She rose, as I rose--with {{the tears}} in her eyes, and the blush <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dutton's lip quivered, her eye-lids trembled too, and {{a couple}} of tears fell <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mistress Charity was visibly embarrassed. She began {{mechanically}} to rub {{the black}} stain <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him heavily as she put back her hair. Suddenly he put his finger-tips <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|R

60|$|Before his passion, Paul's {{grave and}} steadfast silence gained an added dignity. Adrea, {{with a red}} spot burning <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> sailed between the two.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} see," [...] she replied, with tears <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and her brows knitting, [...] "how it shames and, ah!--disgraces me--AH TISHU!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{kissed her}} hair, her eyes, her lips; {{her skin was}} {{fragrant}} as the flowers of spring, the tears <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> glistened like morning dew.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perfect idiot," [...] {{she agreed}} warmly, {{looking at me}} {{straight}} with her wide-open, earnest eyes and the dimple of a smile <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} stand the look of his eyes, and she cast hers down. He saw the {{exquisite}} shadow of <b>her</b> eyelashes <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|R
