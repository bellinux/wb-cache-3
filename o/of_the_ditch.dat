5|$|Despite heavy weathering, {{the ditch}} is still visible in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep. A 330-yard stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are {{considered}} the best preserved remains. In 1997, a segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> 150-yard long in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> remains unprotected.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{identifiable}} periods of medieval activity at Buckton Castle: the initial construction phase, {{which resulted in}} the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> and the building of the curtain wall and gatehouse; the re-cutting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> and further building work behind the curtain wall; and finally deliberate demolition (slighting). The castle is first mentioned in 1360, and little datable material has been recovered from the site four sherds of Pennine Gritty Ware broadly dated to the late 12th century.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fort}} was {{handed over to}} the Maltese government, it was {{initially}} abandoned but it later became a container depot for raw material arriving in Malta. In 1976, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> near the Left Ravelin was filled in, and St. Dominic Demi-Bastion was breached {{to make way for a}} new road.|$|E

40|$|An archaeological {{evaluation}} {{was undertaken}} by Cotswold Archaeology in October 2014 at land west of Cheltenham Road, Evesham, Worcestershire. Twenty-two trenches were excavated. A field system, consisting of ditches enclosing furrowed fields, {{was recorded in}} <b>the</b> south-east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site. Whilst two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> contained small, abraded sherds of probable Roman pottery, and <b>the</b> alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> matched that <b>of</b> a Roman settlement revealed previously to <b>the</b> south-east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site, other <b>ditches</b> in <b>the</b> same system contained post-medieval artefacts. Therefore, <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field system remains in question, although no other Roman features or artefacts were revealed to suggest that Roman settlement per se continued into the proposed development site...|$|R
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests {{that the purpose of the}} earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|The {{dearth of}} {{artefacts}} recovered from Buckton Castle, {{and the lack}} of finely finished stonework, might indicate that the site was never finished, however the re-cutting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> suggests either an extended period of occupancy of abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport Ditch. The complex of defences also included Southport Ditch which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acuña. On that map which is held by the British Museum, the ditch is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. It was a large trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion to the Flat Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, the ditch was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a pump house. After World War I and reclamation of land, the Ragged Staff Gates were opened to vehicular traffic. Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a remnant of the western portion of the Southport Ditch, and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern remnant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Royalists {{occupied}} the low-lying moor, behind a drainage ditch that Rupert noted {{as an effective}} obstacle to a cavalry charge. There is some dispute over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> {{at the time of}} the battle. Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non-existent on the Royalists' right wing. On the other hand, a near-contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert's chief engineer, Bernard de Gomme, shows the ditch in its present-day alignment. It is generally accepted that the ditch was at least less of an obstacle on the Royalist right.|$|E
5|$|With {{sites such}} as Danebury {{where there is no}} modern {{habitation}} or built environment, extensive excavations can be undertaken to establish the general layout. The modern settlement of Mellor extends over the Iron Age hill fort, which restricts archaeological investigation. A geophysical survey was performed to establish the extent of the settlement; methods such as magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar were successful in identifying the eastern and northern sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> encircling the site. Excavations have been concentrated around the Old Vicarage. By 2004 there were 43trenches, 14trial trenches, and 17test pits. The investigation of the site has revealed two ditches. While the external ditch encloses a larger area, it has smaller dimensions than the internal ditch.|$|E
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down the line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where}} the original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E

In <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area the percolating water is fresh due to <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> "Binnenbedijkte Maas", one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few real freshwater lakes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deltaic region.

5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E
