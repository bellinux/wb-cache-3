50|$|Although {{the modern}} nail file only {{appeared}} {{at the end of}} the 19th century, evidence of nail file-like tools exist even further back in history. Marie Antoinette was known for her obsession with the lime à <b>ongles,</b> which was a nail file-like tool made of pumice stone. When her perfectly shaped nails were seen, it became the latest female trend in the French Court of Versailles. The pumice stone was carved into a pencil like shape, which was used to trim and shape the edges of the nail. This tool would not be disposed after use, but would be hand washed by the maids and placed by the bathtub to be used again.|$|E
50|$|Some {{consider}} Mallarmé {{one of the}} French poets {{most difficult}} to translate into English. The difficulty {{is due in part}} to the complex, multilayered nature of much of his work, but also to the important role that the sound of the words, rather than their meaning, plays in his poetry. When recited in French, his poems allow alternative meanings which are not evident on reading the work on the page. For example, Mallarmés Sonnet en -yx opens with the phrase ses purs <b>ongles</b> (her pure nails), whose first syllables when spoken aloud sound very similar to the words cest pur son (its pure sound). Indeed, the pure sound aspect of his poetry has been the subject of musical analysis and has inspired musical compositions. These phonetic ambiguities are very difficult to reproduce in a translation which must be faithful to the meaning of the words.|$|E

5000|$|In French {{heraldry}} the canette or anet {{is a small}} duck (French: canard), shown without feet. According to Théodore Veyrin-Forrer la canette représente la canne ou le canard; si {{elle est}} dépourvue du bec et des pattes, elle devient une merlette. ("The canette represents the duck or drake; if she is deprived of beak and feet she becomes a merlette"). In French un merle, from Latin merula, is a male blackbird, {{a member of the}} thrush family. A merlette in common parlance is a female blackbird, but in heraldic terminology is defined as une figure représentant une canette mornée ("a figure representing a little female duck 'blunted'"). Une cane is a female duck (male canard, [...] "drake") and une canette, the diminutive form, is [...] " [...] a little female duck". The verb morner in ancient French means [...] "to blunt", in heraldic terminology the verbal adjective morné(e) means: sans langue, sans dents, sans <b>ongles</b> et des oiseaux sans bec ni serres ("without tongue, without teeth, without nails and birds without beak or claws"). English heraldry uses the terms [...] "armed" [...] and [...] "langued" [...] for the teeth, claws and tongue of heraldic beasts, thus mornée might be translated as [...] "dis-armed". Thus the English [...] "martlet" [...] is not the same heraldic creature as the French [...] "merlette".|$|E

A partir dessa exposição, pretendemos relacionar os significados e as interpretações atribuídos a ela à leitura que se fez da obra mallarmeana do século XIX ao final do século XX; por fim, tentaremos propor uma compreensão do aparecimento desta palavra no poema de acordo com a crítica mais recente que se tem feito da obra de Mallarmé. The aim of {{this study}} is to present some {{meanings}} of the word ‘ptyx’, which first appeared in Mallarmé’s poem Ses purs <b>ongles</b> très haut dédiant leur onyx (known in Brazil as the Sonnet in ix), and which has been fascinating generations of readers and interpreters of Mallarmé. After presenting the meanings, the objective is to relate them and the interpretations of the word to the reading of Mallarmé’s work from the 19 th-century to the end of the 20 th- century. Then, the purpose is to present an interpretation of the word ptyx in the poem according to the newest criticism about Mallarmé’s work...|$|E
