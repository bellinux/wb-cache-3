It {{will be used to}} determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer {{is an active}} microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90° and the <b>outer</b> <b>beam</b> makes an incidence angle of 57.60° on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for <b>outer</b> <b>beam</b> respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.|$|E

A novel state-space model for studying free and forced transverse vibrations of sandwich beams, made of two <b>outer</b> elastic <b>beams</b> of the same length, continuously joined by an inner shear-type viscoelastic layer, is presented. The proposed technique enables one to consider: i) inhomogeneous systems; ii) any boundary conditions; and iii) rate-dependent constitutive laws for the inner layer, which can be represented either through Generalised Maxwell's model or Laguerre's Polynomial Approximation. For the viscoelastic model of the inner layer, the dynamic behaviour is described by the Standard Linear Solid model, which is made of a primary elastic spring in parallel with a Maxwell's element. The kinematics of the <b>outer</b> <b>beams</b> is developed by means of Galerkin-type approximations for the fields of both axial and transverse displacements in the <b>outer</b> <b>beams,</b> and imposing the pertinent compatibility conditions at interface. In the proposed formulation, the assumed modes are selected as the first modes of axial vibration and of lateral buckling for each layer with homogenised mechanical properties and their own boundary conditions.

Because of reduced side-lobe {{levels in the}} beam-array pattern, the new Simrad ME 70 multibeam echosounder installed on board Ifremer’s RV “Thalassa ” {{has been designed to}} allow improved detection of fish close to the seabed. To achieve this objective, precise and unambiguous detection of the water-bottom interface is required, which raises the issue of bottom detection, especially in the <b>outer</b> <b>beams.</b> The bottom-detection method implemented in the ME 70 is based on the amplitude of the reverberated echo. Such an approach is efficient for vertical beams, but less accurate for beams with higher incidence angles, typically 308 – 408 for the beam configurations used on RV “Thalassa”, where the incidence angle, the beam opening, {{and the nature of the}} seabed contribute to weakening the backscat-tered signal. Therefore, the aim of this study was twofold. First, we proposed to improve the current bottom-detection method based on the amplitude of the echo. Thanks to the split-beam configuration being available for all beams of the ME 70, we also proposed to use the phase information in the backscattered signals of the <b>outer</b> <b>beams,</b> as is more commonly done with multibeam systems dedicated to seabed mapping.

A calibration procedure to determine high resolution, three dimensional transmit and receive beam patterns of a Reson SeaBat 7125 MBES was performed using the fresh water calibration tank at the University of New Hampshire. The measurements employed an omni-directional Reson TC 4034 projector/hydrophone as a reference transducer at an acoustic distance of 13 m. The multibeam sonar system was configured for 256 beams equi-angle mode and operating frequency of 396 kHz. The transmit beam pattern was computed for across-track angular range between +/– 90 o in 0. 1 o increments and along-track angular range between +/– 2. 55 o in 0. 09 o increments. Receive directional characteristics were measured for the across-track range of +/– 120 o in 0. 1 o increments with along-track angular range of +/– 1. 23 o in 0. 18 o increments. With these measurements, a three-dimensional plot of the transmit beam pattern was computed for {{the entire range of}} angles, although for the receive beam pattern it was only determined for the 0 o along-track angle. The reduced angular coverage of the receive beam pattern was due to discrepancies in the off-axis results that are thought to be related to receiver saturation. Measurements for the transmit beam pattern show a – 3 dB beamwidth of 0. 99 o for across-track angle of 0 o with side lobes below – 17 dB. The results show an unexplained curvature in the transmit beam pattern that would have gone un-noticed during a two dimensional beam pattern measurement. An interference effect causing ripples and attenuation of the transmit beam pattern was also observed. This effect is thought to be caused by a second 200 kHz projector mounted parallel to the 396 kHz projector. This interference occurs at an across-track angular region between + 30 o and + 75 o with gradual decrease in amplitude of about 3 dB. The receive beam pattern measurements show a – 3 dB beamwidth of approximately 0. 62 o for the most inner beams (beams 128 and 129) and of approximately 1. 40 o for the most <b>outer</b> <b>beams</b> (beams 1 and 256) at along-track angular position of 0 o with side-lobes below – 26 dB for the most inner beams and below – 17 dB for the most <b>outer</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

Hohlraum energy balance, as measured by x-ray power escaping the LEH, is quantitatively consistent with revised estimates of backscatter and incident laser energy combined with a more rigorous non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium atomic physics model with greater emissivity than the simpler average-atom model used in the original design of NIF targets...|$|E

We use these observations to determine the telescope beam size, beam shape, and overall telescope beam efficiency as a function of frequency. We find that the beam size is well fit by λ/D over the frequency range with a correlation coefficient of ∼ 90 %. We determine the telescope main beam efficiencies are between ∼ 48 and 64 % for the 12 -mm receiver and reasonably flat at ∼ 50 % for the 7 -mm receiver. Beam maps of strong H 2 O (22 GHz) and SiO masers (43 GHz) provide a means to examine the radial beam pattern of the telescope. At both frequencies, the radial beam pattern reveals the presence of three components: a central ‘core’, which is well fit by a Gaussian and constitutes the telescopes main beam; and inner and <b>outer</b> error <b>beams.</b> At both frequencies, the inner and <b>outer</b> error <b>beams</b> extend out to ∼ 2 and ∼ 3. 4 times the full-width half maximum of the main beam, respectively.

40|$|The main {{mechanism}} of bathymetry survey is {{relied on the}} measurement of the travel time of the two ways sound wave. Speed of sound wave {{is dependent on the}} water density. Density of every water layer is affected by temperature, salinity and pressure. According to Snell’s Law, when sound wave travel through water layers with different densities, the travel speed will change and leads to refraction. Thus, the variation of sound speed will significantly affect the accuracy of the bathymetry result, as the refraction will cause the sound wave to be refracted from their ideal propagation path, and, resulting false depth and position. Compensation of the refraction can be completed by Trigonometry Method, Curvature Method and the Combined Method. The Trigonometry Method is implementing the averaging of the sound speed for a determined layer of depth. Conversely, the Curvature Method assumes the sound wave to travel in an arc of circle of different radius in every different depth layer. Meanwhile, the Combined Method is the combination of the Trigonometry Method and Curvature Method. This study aims to identify which approach provides the better positional result and depth.

The next satellite devoted to global sea surface salinity monitoring is the Aquarius/SAC-D, which was launched on June 9, 2011, by a collaboration between the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Argentinian Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). It includes three beam push-broom L-band real aperture radiometers and real aperture scatterometers, both full-polarimetric and feeded by the same reflector at three incidence angles (28. 7 °, 37. 8 ° and 45. 6 ° for the inner, the middle and the <b>outer</b> <b>beams)</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{programme}} of scanning and mapping observations of astronomical masers and Jupiter designed to characterise the performance of the Mopra Radio Telescope at frequencies between 16 and 50 GHz using the 12 -mm and 7 -mm receivers. We use these observations to determine the telescope beam size, beam shape, and overall telescope beam efficiency as a function of frequency. We find that the beam size is well fit by λ/D over the frequency range with a correlation coefficient of ∼ 90 %. We determine the telescope main beam efficiencies are between ∼ 48 and 64 % for the 12 -mm receiver and reasonably flat at ∼ 50 % for the 7 -mm receiver. Beam maps of strong H 2 O (22 GHz) and SiO masers (43 GHz) provide a means to examine the radial beam pattern of the telescope. At both frequencies, the radial beam pattern reveals the presence of three components: a central ‘core’, which is well fit by a Gaussian and constitutes the telescopes main beam; and inner and <b>outer</b> error <b>beams.</b> At both frequencies, the inner and <b>outer</b> error <b>beams</b> extend out to ∼ 2 and ∼ 3. 4 times the full-width half maximum of the main beam, respectively. Sources with angular sizes of a factor of two or more larger than the telescope main beam will couple to the main and error beams, and therefore the power contributed by the error beams needs to be considered. From measurements of the radial beam power pattern we estimate the amount of power contained in the inner and <b>outer</b> error <b>beams</b> is of order one-fifth at 22 GHz, rising slightly to one-third at 43 GHz...|$|R
40|$|In September 2006, several {{schools of}} Atlantic herring were {{simultaneously}} imaged with a Reson 7125 SeaBat multibeam sonar (400 kHz) and a Simrad EK 60 Scientific echo sounder (38 kHz, 120 kHz, and 200 kHz) on Georges Bank in the Gulf of Maine. One school was imaged five separate {{times over the}} span of one hour. These two sonar systems, along with pelagic trawl catch data collected on a separate ship, provided a synoptic view of the fish school as it changed depth and size, fragmented, and eventually dispersed. Of particular interest is the combination of data from the two sonars. The multifrequency, split‐beam EK 60 provided estimates of the fish school density directly under the ship, but was not capable of accurately extrapolating these measurements to the entire fish school, which was largely out of the EK 60 field of view. The multibeam sonar was generally able to image the entire fish school and provided useful information on school volume, fragmentation, and general school morphology, but was more difficult to use for quantifiable measurements, due to the unknown angle of ensonfication of {{the fish in the}} <b>outer</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{built an}} analytical source model for GPU-based MC dose engine. In this paper, {{we present a}} sampling strategy to efficiently utilize this source model in GPU-based dose calculation. Our source model {{was based on a}} concept of phase-space-ring (PSR). This ring structure makes it effective to account for beam rotational symmetry, but not suitable for dose calculations due to rectangular jaw settings. Hence, we first convert PSR source model to its phase-space let (PSL) representation. Then in dose calculation, different types of sub-sources were separately sampled. Source sampling and particle transport were iterated. So that the particles being sampled and transported simultaneously are of same type and close in energy to alleviate GPU thread divergence. We also present an automatic commissioning approach to adjust the model for a good representation of a clinical linear accelerator. Weighting factors were introduced to adjust relative weights of PSRs, determined by solving a quadratic minimization problem with a non-negativity constraint. We tested the efficiency gain of our model over a previous source model using PSL files. The efficiency was improved by 1. 70 ~ 4. 41, due to the avoidance of long data reading and transferring. The commissioning problem can be solved in ~ 20 sec. Its efficacy was tested by comparing the doses computed using the commissioned model and the uncommissioned one, with measurements in different open fields in a water phantom under a clinical Varian Truebeam 6 MV beam. For the depth dose curves, the average distance-to-agreement was improved from 0. 04 ~ 0. 28 cm to 0. 04 ~ 0. 12 cm for build-up region and the root-mean-square (RMS) dose difference after build-up region was reduced from 0. 32 %~ 0. 67 % to 0. 21 %~ 0. 48 %. For lateral dose profiles, RMS difference was reduced from 0. 31 %~ 2. 0 % to 0. 06 %~ 0. 78 % at inner beam and from 0. 20 %~ 1. 25 % to 0. 10 %~ 0. 51 % at <b>outer</b> <b>beam.</b> Comment: page line has been remove...|$|E
40|$|Monte Carlo (MC) {{simulation}} {{is considered}} {{as the most}} accurate method for radiation dose calculations. Accuracy of a source model for a linear accelerator is critical for the overall dose calculation accuracy. In this paper, we presented an analytical source model that we recently developed for GPU-based MC dose calculations. A key concept called phase-space-ring (PSR) was proposed. It contained a group of particles that are of the same type and close in energy and radial distance {{to the center of}} the phase-space plane. The model parameterized probability densities of particle location, direction and energy for each primary photon PSR, scattered photon PSR and electron PSR. For a primary photon PSRs, the particle direction is assumed to be from the beam spot. A finite spot size is modeled with a 2 D Gaussian distribution. For a scattered photon PSR, multiple Gaussian components were used to model the particle direction. The direction distribution of an electron PSRs was also modeled as a 2 D Gaussian distribution with a large standard deviation. We also developed a method to analyze a phase-space file and derive corresponding model parameters. To test the accuracy of our linac source model, dose distributions of different open fields in a water phantom were calculated using our source model and compared to those directly calculated using the reference phase-space file. The average distance-to-agreement (DTA) was within 1 mm for the depth dose in the build-up region and beam penumbra regions. The root-mean-square (RMS) dose difference was within 1. 1 % for dose profiles at inner and <b>outer</b> <b>beam</b> regions. The maximal relative difference of output factors was within 0. 5 %. Good agreements were also found in an IMRT prostate patient case and an IMRT head-and-neck case. These results demonstrated the efficacy of our source model in terms of accurately representing a reference phase-space file. Comment: page line has been remove...|$|E
40|$|Aquarius {{has been}} {{designed}} to map the surface salinity field of the global ocean from space a parameter important for understanding ocean circulation and its relationship to climate and the global water cycle. Salinity is measured remotely from space by measuring the thermal emission from the ocean surface. This is done at the low frequency end of the microwave spectrum (e. g. 1. 4 GHz) where the emission is sufficiently sensitive to changes in salinity to be detected with sophisticated radiometers. The goal is to monitor the seasonal and interannual variation of the large scale features of the surface salinity field in the open ocean by providing maps on a monthly basis with a spatial resolution of 150 km and an accuracy of 0. 2 psu. These are challenging requirements that have led to some unique features of the instrument. These include: a) The addition of a co-located scatterometer to help provide a correction for roughness; b) The addition of a polarimetric channel (third Stokes parameter) to the radiometer to help correct for Faraday rotation; c) Asun-synchronous orbit with a 6 pm ascending equatorial crossing to minimize Faraday rotation and with the antennas looking away from the sun toward the nighttime side to minimize contamination by radiation from the sun; and d) An antenna designed to limit side lobes in the direction of rays from the sun. In addition, achieving the accuracy goal of 0. 2 psu requires averaging over one month and to do this requires a highly stable radiometer. Aquarius has three separate radiometers that image in pushbroom fashion with the three antenna beams looking across track. The antenna is a 2. 5 -m diameter, offset parabolic reflector with three feed horns and the three beams are arranged to image with the boresight aligned to look across track, roughly perpendicular to the spacecraft heading and pointing away from the Sun. The three beams point at angles of theta = 25. 8 deg., 33. 8 deg. and 40. 3 deg. with respect to the spacecraft nadir which correspond to local incidence angles at the surface of 28. 7 deg., 37. 8 deg. and 45. 6 deg., respectively. The resolution of the three radiometer beams (axes of the 3 dB ellipse) is: 76 x 94 km for the inner beam, 84 x 120 km for the middle beam to 96 x 156 km for the <b>outer</b> <b>beam.</b> Together they cover a swath of about 390 km. Aquarius will map the global ice-free ocean every 7 -days from which monthly average composites will be derived. This will provide a snapshot of the mean field, as well as resolving the seasonal to interannual variations over the three-year baseline of the mission...|$|E
5000|$|The earlier single-action beam engines used a {{chain to}} connect the piston to the beam and this worked satisfactorily for pumping water from mines, etc. However, for rotary motion a linkage that works both in {{compression}} and tension provides a better design and allows a double-acting cylinder to be used. Such an engine incorporates a piston acted upon by steam alternately on the two sides, hence doubling its power. The linkage actually used by Watt (also invented by him) in his later rotary beam engines was called the parallel motion linkage, a development of [...] "Watt's linkage", but using the same principle. The piston of the engine {{is attached to the}} central point of the linkage, allowing it to act on the two <b>outer</b> <b>beams</b> of the linkage both by pushing and by pulling. The nearly linear motion of the linkage allows this type of engine to use a rigid connection to the piston without causing the piston to bind in its containing cylinder. This configuration also results in a smoother motion of the beam than the single-action engine, making it easier to convert its back-and-forth motion into rotation.|$|R

40|$|A three-beam lateral {{shearing}} interferometer {{has been}} developed. The three-beam shearing interferograms consist of {{two sets of}} fringes, one of which acts as a carrier whose intensity is modulated by the second set. The depth of modulation is directly proportional to the phase difference between the middle <b>beam</b> and the <b>outer</b> <b>beams.</b> Phase errors {{on the order of}} π/ 2 cause every other fringe to go from complete dark to complete bright. Therefore, phase errors much smaller than π/ 2 can be detected. The three-beam interferometer is implemented in three ways: (1) thin film thickness measurement, (2) surface roughness measurement, and (3) surface figure measurement. The three-beam interferometer implemented to measure thin film thickness and surface roughness is accurate to 25 Å. Surfaces with different microstructure are characterized. We have found that each of those surfaces may have {{one or more of the}} following: (1) random roughness, (2) slow waviness, and/or (3) periodic structure. The three-beam interferometer is also implemented for testing optical surfaces. The three-beam interferometer is more capable in detecting small zonal errors than the two-beam interferometer. Three-beam interferograms of different surfaces are produced and analyzed. The three-beam interferometer has many advantages: (1) it is a stable, common path interferometer, (2) white light can be instead of coherent light to get rid of the effects of speckle and dust particles, and (3) it is a very low cost interferometer...|$|R
