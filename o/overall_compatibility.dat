Sequences from the topA, ftsZ, mreB, rpoD, rctB and toxRgenes were used to investigate the degree of relatedness existing between these two separate populations by examining their phylogenetic and genetic disparity.

This paper presents a planning methodology known as 'values suitability analysis' (VSA) that combines the features of expanded public participation with a rational, analytic framework for incorporating human values into forest plan decision making. The VSA methodology provides a means to evaluate and compare how 'logically consistent' potential management prescriptions (set of activities) are with publicly held forest values. Based on a spatial inventory of ecosystem values, the VSA methodology constructs a numerical rating, or set of ratings, for each management prescription and ecosystem value interaction. These ratings are used to determine (1) which management prescription is most compatible with the dominant ecosystem value within a given management area, as well as (2) the marginal difference in <b>overall</b> <b>compatibility</b> between alternative management prescriptions.

In this regard, content providing industry legal recourse against OSPs takes two forms. The first is to claim primary copyright infringement, and the second to establish third-party copyright liability for the infringing acts of an OSP's users. The choice is dictated by the specific facts in individual cases. The latter important and complex case law based category, which applies to a spectrum of asp connections to infringements, some more direct than others, is specifically treated in this thesis. This thesis examines the, it is argued, inadequate case law based operation of UK third-party copyright liability. By firstly comprehensively studying UK copyright law {{as it pertains to}} OSPs, including primary liability as well as exceptions and limitations, UK third-party copyright liability is suitably extrinsically defined. Its intrinsic operation is then analysed. Severe deficiencies having been found and explained in this regard, a basis for reform is sought by conducting a similar examination of us third-party copyright liability, said law being more developed. Thus, a mirrored approach to the preceding UK analysis is taken in the analysis of us copyright law; carefully defining third-party copyright liability and ensuring <b>overall</b> systemic <b>compatibility.</b> Having established the need for reform and having provided a second compatible but more developed source, both strands of third- party copyright liability are compared and contrasted and entirely novel changes to the UK concepts are proposed for legislative adoption.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of photonic and electronic structures and devices has directed the manufacturing industry {{for the last}} 50 years. Currently, the majority of small-scale photonic devices are created by traditional microfabrication techniques that create features by processes such as lithography and electron or ion beam direct writing. Microfabrication techniques are often expensive and slow. In contrast, the use of electrospinning (ES) in the {{fabrication of}} micro- and nano-scale devices for the manipulation of photons and electrons provides a relatively simple and economic viable alternative. ES involves the delivery of a polymer solution to a capillary held at a high voltage relative to the fiber deposition surface. Electrostatic force developed between the collection plate and the polymer promotes fiber deposition onto the collection plate. Issues with ES fabrication exist primarily due to an instability region that exists between the capillary and collection plate and is characterized by chaotic motion of the depositing polymer fiber. Material limitations to ES also exist; not all polymers of interest are amenable to the ES process due to process dependencies on molecular weight and chain entanglement or incompatibility with other polymers and <b>overall</b> process <b>compatibility.</b> Passive and active electronic and photonic fibers fabricated through the ES have great potential for use in light generation and collection in optical and electronic structures/devices. ES produces fiber devices that can be combined with inorganic, metallic, biological, or organic materials for novel device design.

40|$|This {{research}} constructs {{and tests}} {{a model of}} the organisation of building projects for maximum benefit to clients. The model is developed from systems theory, independently of conventional organisational assumptions. It is based upon the premise that the process to be managed must be identified before organisational structures can be designed and it recognises the influence of environmental forces upon projects. The model proposes that the process of building provision consists of sub-systems created by decision points and identifies the interdependency and hence the differentiation within and between the subsystems. The major propositions of the model are that; a) there should be a match of differentiation and integrative effort, b) the operating and managing systems should be differentiated, c) the managing system itself should be undifferentiated and, d) the client and process of building provision should be integrated. The model was tested against three commercial buildings for private clients. Data is presented from interviews and other sources and is interpreted using Linear Responsibility Analysis, which was adapted and developed in this research. The testing method examines the <b>overall</b> <b>compatibility</b> of the model and the test projects, and also identifies the causes of deficiencies in the outcomes of the projects and whether they can be explained by divergence of the projects from the model. The model was found to be valid for the type of project used in the tests. It provides a theoretical framework against which the effectiveness of organisation structures for the management of building projects can be predicted and which can be used for the design of such structures. It is suggested that Linear Responsibility Analysis provides a useful tool for organisation analysis and design. Finally, implications of the results for the organisation of building projects in practice are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{timing of}} core {{formation}} {{is essential for}} understanding the early differentiation history of the Earth and the Moon. Because Hf is lithophile and W is siderophile during metal-silicate segregation, the decay of 182 Hf to 182 W (half-life of 9 Ma) {{has proven to be}} a useful chronometer of core-mantle differentiation events. A key parameter for the interpretation of 182 Hf/ 182 W data is the Hf/W ratio of the primitive (i. e. undepleted) mantle. Since W is incompatible during mantle melting, its ratio relative to U and other similarly incompatible elements in basalts (e. g. Th, La) may be used as proxies for their mantle sources. However, the assumption that W and U are equally incompatible may be flawed for petrological systems that equilibrated over a large range of oxygen fugacity (fO 2). Although W is typically perceived as being homovalent, evidence suggests that U is heterovalent over the range of fO 2 inferred for the silicate mantles of the Earth and the Moon. Here we report new partitioning data for W, U, high-field-strength elements (HFSE), and Th between clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, olivine, plagioclase and silicate melt. In agreement with previous studies, we show that these elements behave as homovalent elements at fO 2 characteristic of Earth 2 ̆ 7 s upper mantle. However, both W and U become more compatible at low fO 2, indicating a change in their redox state, with W becoming more compatible at progressively lower fO 2. This result for W is particularly unexpected, because this element was thought to be hexavalent even at very low fO 2. The much higher compatibility of W 4 + (the species inferred here at low fO 2) relative to W 6 + means that even a small fraction of W 4 + will have a significant effect on the <b>overall</b> <b>compatibility</b> of W. Our results imply that over the range of reducing conditions in which lunar differentiation is thought to have taken place (i. e. IW- 2 to IW- 0. 5), W is likely to become fractionated from U. When our partitioning data are applied to model the fractional crystallization of a lunar magma ocean, lunar trends for U/W, Hf/W and Th/W are well reproduced. The result of this model carries with it the implication that the Hf/W of the bulk silicate fractions that comprise the Earth and the Moon are virtually identical...|$|E

Adhesive materials have high sensitivity to changes in their environment and can be exploited to probe and quantify the influence of even subtle modifications in tissue architecture and biology. We studied inflammatory colitis and colon cancer and found not only a difference in adhesion related to surface chemical interactions but also the existence of a complex interplay that determined the <b>overall</b> dendrimer/dextran biomaterial <b>compatibility.</b> Compatibility was contextual, not simply a constitutive property of the material, and was related to the extent and nature of immune cells in the diseased environment present before material implantation. We then showed how to use information about local alterations of the tissue microenvironment to assess disease severity.

40|$|Standardisation is a {{means of}} {{co-ordinating}} technology diffusion in a way that preserves compatibility. It is in essence an ex ante market mechanism, which levels the playing ground of product and service developers. Its primary value for software developers, users and its importance for public ICT policy developers lies in the positive externalities that derive from compatibility. But need these externalities be achieved by formal standardisation? I this paper I explore and compare the compatibility effects of de facto standards, quasi-open source software developments and- indirect means of- formal standardisation. I centre the comparison on the Java technology, which is currently one of the key technologies in the field of ICT. Sun's compatibility strategies regarding Java illustrate a whole range of options: proprietary de facto (licensing and open source software), gated-multiparty, consortium, and international formal standardisation. Sun tries to combine wide involvement of developers with cross-platform <b>compatibility.</b> <b>Overall,</b> its efforts have resulted in market co-ordination- although not without costs. Could formal standardisation bodies also have achieved this outcome? 1 The empirical material to be used is more or less complete (the references, in particular the websites, are not). The conceptual framework still needs further polishing- and extra (re-) reading. Comments are welcome. M...|$|R
40|$|While frontal {{collisions}} between Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) {{and passenger}} cars are rare compared to car-to-car frontal crashes, {{they are much}} more severe. Between 43 % and 73 % of all frontal car-to-truck accidents result in fatalities. The severity is due to crash incompatibility between the vehicles that has been generally agreed to arise from differences in mass, stiffness and geometry and it refers not only to car-to-truck collisions but also to most vehicle-to-vehicle collisions. To address incompatibilities between passenger cars and HGVs, Front Underrun Protective Devices (FUPDs) are obligatory equipment for HGVs produced after August 2003. To date, there is insufficient research describing the efficiency of statutory and energy absorbing (e. a.) FUPDs in real traffic collisions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to understand and suggest improvements for the compatibility between trucks and passenger cars through parametric studies of different design and collision configurations where the compatibility between trucks and cars is seen as an indivisible part of <b>overall</b> crash <b>compatibility</b> between vehicles. The focus was the requirements for energy absorbing FUPDs to overcome the unpredictable behaviour of passenger cars in frontal collisions by studying the links between geometry and stiffness as influenced by crash configuration and structural interaction. The bending stiffness of e. a. FUPD cross-beams, their height, and triggering force for energy absorbing elements were found to be important characteristics of e. a. FUPD that influence the outcome in collisions between HGVs and passenger cars. The stable response of vehicle structures was identified as an important issue to understand. A new analysis approach, called the RED method, was developed and presented. Using energy absorption and impact forces calculated in FE simulations, the RED method gives more insight into structural deformation processes than other methods and thereby improves the evaluation of vehicle structures. Information derived from the procedure was used to develop two new assessment criteria - Structural Efficiency and Crash Stability – {{that can be used to}} objectively quantify the crash response of vehicles. Because the method is based on FE crash simulations it can be used in the development as well as production phase of a vehicle crash structure or even other structures where deformation modes are important. It was shown that these criteria can be used in compatibility rating where a new perspective on compatibility is introduced and applied...|$|R
