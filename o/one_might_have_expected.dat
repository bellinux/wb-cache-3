In the production, {{he plays a}} teacher who is ready {{to settle down and}} marry, but decides to visit four ex-girlfriends first. For his performance, Schwimmer {{received}} critical reviews. The Independent wrote that Schwimmer [...] "is not called upon to extend his range nearly as far as <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> in Some Girl(s). [...] Schwimmer remains bland, competent, and boyish—though not fatally boyish in the manner that appears to have turned these women on". However, Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph praised Schwimmer, reporting he [...] "proves inspired casting. He takes to the stage with... his endearing gaucheness seems designed to ensure our continued sympathy. Schwimmer mercilessly lays bare his character's opportunism, casual cruelties, and chronic self-deception".|$|E
2500|$|Their new-found sound {{took them}} to the DM i Rock semifinals in 1992, where they were beaten by Passion Orange. With their third attempt on 30 April 1993, the trio won because of [...] "their obvious talent and charisma." [...] Part of the grand prize was a {{recording}} session for a 4-track demo at Sweet Silence Studios, which spawned the songs [...] "Waterline" [...] and [...] "Silverflame" [...] that became huge hits on DR P3 and DR P4. The grand prize also contained a spot in the travelling Rock Show '93 and performances at the L'Europe d'Art d'Art festival in Niort, France, the Nordic Rock '93 competition that they also won, and all the major Danish summer festivals. A reviewer from that time remarked, [...] "They are not quite as extroverted as <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected,</b> but in return they play much better than one might dare hope for. Dense and energetic, making one wonder why there are only three men on stage. One is tempted to look into the back room to see where the rest of the band is hiding." [...] They would also entertain with ironic covers of among others [...] "Stayin' Alive" [...] by the Bee Gees.|$|E
2500|$|With Roadmaster being a {{completely}} new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> only modest changes for 1937. But {{that was not the}} case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up {{with the rest of the}} GM marques. [...] For 1937, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by [...] without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.|$|E

40|$|In {{this note}} we propose that D-brane charges, in the {{presence}} of a topologically non-trivial B-eld, are classied by the K-theory of an innite dimensional C -algebra. In the case of B-elds whose curvature is pure torsion our description is shown to coincide with that of Witten. 1. Introduction and discussion Recently it was realized that, as a consequence of the fact that D-branes naturally come equipped with (Chan-Paton) vector bundles, D-brane charges take values in the K-theory of the spacetime manifold X, rather than in the integral cohomology H (X; Z), as <b>one</b> naively <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> [MM, Wi]. In fact, it has been argued that the RR-elds themselves are classied by the K-theory of X as well [MW]. The identication of D-brane charges and K-theory classes has, among other things, led to a better understanding of the spectrum of D-branes, in particular of the existence of stable, nonsupersymmetric (i. e., non-BPS) D-branes [Se]. In many cases these novel stable, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} panel and time series {{regression}} analyses, and by resorting to a variance decomposition due to Asdrubali et al. (1996) {{we show that}} income flows to and from abroad did not play, in general, a large risk sharing role for a pool of EU countries over the horizon 1976 - 2007. This is particularly true in a pre-globalization period, but remains true for some countries, even in the finance globalization era. We then extend the analysis to consider a measure of cash flow, instead of income, available for consumption, and observe that capital flows to and from abroad have played a largely destabilizing role, to an extent that <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> not <b>expected</b> beforehand. Key to this result is also the study of asymmetries in smoothing positive and negative shocks by the different possible channels.

The hyperdense area disappeared on a subsequent enhanced CT scan after he was seizure free for about 48 hours. The hyperdense area was in a location (mesial frontal lobe) predicted by the interictal physical exam findings and the seizure type recorded on video-EEG monitoring.

[...] The Daily Telegraph was mostly critical, writing [...] "the composer falls {{below the level of}} accomplishment <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> reasonably <b>expected.</b> There are numbers in the piece, however, which seem to point to his possession of a gift for facile melody. ... The scoring throughout is decidedly thin even for musical comedy." [...] The Evening Standard and St. James, however, had some praise for the music, saying: [...] "It is not extraordinary, but neither is it commonplace except occasionally. He does not write particularly well for the voice, but he has, generally, originality and is always melodious. Some of his songs, not the purely sentimental ones, are fresh, 'catchy', well-written and full of tune." [...] The piece had one of the shortest runs of any Savoy opera, a total of 43 performances, after which it had another week's run at the Strand Theatre, a summer tour, and then disappeared.

40|$|The Bradford curves {{are used}} in the CIECAM 97 colour {{appearance}} model, and are `sharpened' {{in the sense that they}} have narrower support than the cone fundamentals. Spectral sharpening is a method which finds the linear combination of a set of sensors that is most sensitive to a given interval of the visible spectrum.

40|$|This is {{the second}} of two {{companion}} papers on the interior structure of self-similar accreting charged black holes. In the first paper, the black hole was allowed to accrete only a single fluid of charged baryons. In this second paper, the black hole is allowed to accrete in addition a neutral fluid of almost non-interacting dark matter. Relativistic streaming between outgoing baryons and ingoing dark matter leads to mass inflation near the inner horizon. When enough dark matter has been accreted that the center of mass frame near the inner horizon is ingoing, then mass inflation ceases and the fluid collapses to a central singularity. A null singularity does not form on the Cauchy horizon. Although the simultaneous presence of ingoing and outgoing fluids near the inner horizon is essential to mass inflation, reducing one or other of the ingoing dark matter or outgoing baryonic streams to a trace relative to the other stream makes mass inflation more extreme, {{not the other way}} round as <b>one</b> <b>might</b> naively <b>have</b> <b>expected.</b> Consequently, if the dark matter has a finite cross-section for being absorbed into the baryonic fluid, then the reduction of the amount of ingoing dark matter merely makes inflation more extreme, the interior mass exponentiating more rapidly and to a larger value before mass inflation ceases. However, if the dark matter absorption cross-section is effectively infinite at high collision energy, so that the ingoing dark matter strea...|$|R
