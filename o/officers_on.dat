5|$|The prison {{officers}} {{guarding the}} gates outside the chapel abandoned them, and ran towards the Centre. The prison {{officer in charge}} of the Centre saw his colleagues running {{from the direction of the}} chapel, but due to the presence of scaffolding he was in a poor position to view the upper levels, and mistakenly assumed he saw prisoners running from the chapel. He informed other <b>officers</b> <b>on</b> C1 and D1 of this and, upon hearing that prisoners were in possession of keys, told them and <b>officers</b> <b>on</b> A1 that they should evacuate the prison. Governor Morrison, who was responsible for the main prison, was present and did not intervene with these instructions. Morrison then ordered officers to evacuate the Centre at 11:13 am as he mistakenly believed prisoners had entered the Centre. By this time prisoners had gained access to the roofs of E and F wings, and from there gained access to other wings by making holes in unprotected office ceilings.|$|E
