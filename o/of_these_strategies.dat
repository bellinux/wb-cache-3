25|$|To {{address the}} problem of erosion in upland rice-growing regions, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) {{initiated}} a breeding program for perennial upland rice in the mid-1990s. Within just a few years, the program achieved significant progress. The Perennial Upland Rice project team used populations derived from crossing the rice plant Oryza sativa with two different distantly related perennials in the hopes that at least one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>strategies</b> would enable genes from the perennial to be moved to the cultivated rice gene pool.|$|E

From an economic perspective, many professional money managers and financial advisors shy away from day trading, arguing that the reward simply does not justify the risk.

25|$|Determinacy {{refers to}} the fact that, under {{appropriate}} assumptions, certain two-player games of perfect information are determined from the start {{in the sense that}} one player must have a winning strategy. The existence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>strategies</b> has important consequences in descriptive set theory, as the assumption that a broader class of games is determined often implies that a broader class of sets will have a topological property. The axiom of determinacy (AD) is an important object of study; although incompatible with the axiom of choice, AD implies that all subsets of the real line are well behaved (in particular, measurable and with the perfect set property). AD can be used to prove that the Wadge degrees have an elegant structure.|$|E
25|$|The task of {{producing}} iPS cells {{continues to be}} challenging due to the six problems mentioned above. A key tradeoff to overcome is that between efficiency and genomic integration. Most methods that do not rely on the integration of transgenes are inefficient, while those that do rely on the integration of transgenes face the problems of incomplete reprogramming and tumor genesis, although {{a vast number of}} techniques and methods have been attempted. Another large set of strategies is to perform a proteomic characterization of iPS cells. Further studies and new strategies should generate optimal solutions to the five main challenges. One approach might attempt to combine the positive attributes <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>strategies</b> into an ultimately effective technique for reprogramming cells to iPS cells.|$|E

2500|$|The {{received}} Tao Te Ching {{is a short}} text {{of around}} 5,000 Chinese characters in 81 brief chapters or sections (...) [...] There {{is some evidence that}} the chapter divisions were later additions—for commentary, or as aids to rote memorization—and that the original text was more fluidly organized. It has two parts, the Tao Ching (道經; chaps. 1–37) and the Te Ching (德經; chaps. 38–81), which may have been edited together into the received text, possibly reversed from an original [...] "Te Tao Ching." [...] The written style is laconic, has few grammatical particles, and encourages varied, even contradictory interpretations. [...] The ideas are singular; the style poetic. The rhetorical style combines two major strategies: short, declarative statements and intentional contradictions. The first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>strategies</b> creates memorable phrases, while the second forces us to create our own reconciliations of the supposed contradictions.|$|E
2500|$|But {{with regard}} to the {{proposition}} that [...] "Improved communication by industry might help to overcome current fears regarding nuclear power", [...] M.V. Ramana says that the basic problem is that there is [...] "distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy", and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that [...] "only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by safety violations by nuclear companies, or through ineffectiveness or corruption on the part of nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain. Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has [...] "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of [...] numerous [...] "fact sheets" [...] that discuss issues of public concern.

2500|$|Additionally, in the 2004 {{election}} {{there was}} an intense media campaign from the socially conservative Family First Party, including a television advertisement labelling the Greens the [...] "Extreme Greens". Competitive preferencing strategies prompted {{by the nature of}} Senate balloting (see Australian electoral system) lead to the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats ranking Family First higher than the Greens on their Senate tickets, and the Greens losing preferences they would normally have received from the two parties. Consequently, although outpolling Family First by a ratio of more than four to one first-preference votes, Victorian Family First candidate Steve Fielding was elected on preferences over the Australian Greens' David Risstrom, an unintended consequence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>strategies.</b> In Tasmania, Christine Milne only narrowly gained her Senate seat before a Family First candidate, despite obtaining almost the full required quota of primary votes.

2500|$|Originally, {{martingale}} {{referred to}} a class of betting strategies that was popular in 18th-century France. [...] The simplest <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>strategies</b> was designed for {{a game in which}} the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. [...] The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. [...] As the gambler's wealth and available time jointly approach infinity, his probability of eventually flipping heads approaches 1, which makes the martingale betting strategy seem like a sure thing. [...] However, the exponential growth of the bets eventually bankrupts its users, assuming the obvious and realistic finite bankrolls (one of the reasons casinos, though normatively enjoying a mathematical edge in the games offered to their patrons, impose betting limits). Stopped Brownian motion, which is a martingale process, can be used to model the trajectory of such games.|$|E

2500|$|This {{painting}} {{depicts the}} birth of Marie de' Medici's first son, Louis XIII. Rubens designed the scene around the theme of political peace. The birth of the first male heir brings {{a sense of security}} to the royal family that they will continue to rule. In those times an heir was of the utmost importance, especially if Henry wanted to showcase his masculinity and discontinue with the pattern of the royal reproductive failure. The word dauphin is French for dolphin, a term associated with princely royalty. Henry's promiscuity made difficult the production of a legitimate heir, and rumors circulated to the extent that Henry's court artists began to employ strategies to convince the country otherwise. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>strategies</b> was to personify Marie as Juno or Minerva. By representing Marie as Juno, implying Henry as Jupiter, the king is seen domesticated by marriage. The queen's personification as Minerva would facilitate Henry's military prowess and her own. As a Flemish painter Rubens includes a dog in the painting, alluding to fidelity in marriage. In addition to the idea of political peace Rubens also includes the personification of Justice, Astraea. The return of Astraea to earth is symbolic of the embodiment of continuing Justice with {{the birth of}} the future king. Louis is nursed by Themis, the goddess of divine order, referring to Louis XIII birthright to one day become king. The baby is quite close to a serpent, which is a representation of Health. [...] Rubens incorporates the traditional allegory of the cornucopia, which symbolizes abundance, to enhance the meaning of the painting by including the heads of Marie de' Medici's children who have yet to be born among the fruit. While Marie gazes adoringly at her son, Fecundity presses the cornucopia to her arm, representing the complete and bountiful family to come.|$|E
