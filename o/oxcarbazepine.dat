25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, <b>oxcarbazepine,</b> rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
2500|$|Pregabalin and {{gabapentin}} {{may reduce}} pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. The anticonvulsants carbamazepine and <b>oxcarbazepine</b> are especially effective in trigeminal neuralgia. [...] Gabapentin may reduce symptoms associated with neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia in some people. There is no predictor test {{to determine if}} it will be effective for a particular person. A short trial period of gabapentin therapy is recommended, to determine the effectiveness for that person. 62% of people taking gabapentin may {{have at least one}} adverse event, however the incidence of serious adverse events was found to be low.|$|E
2500|$|Lithium is {{the classic}} mood {{stabilizer}} to prevent further manic and depressive episodes. A systematic review found that long term lithium treatment substantially {{reduces the risk of}} bipolar manic relapse, by 42%. Anticonvulsants such as valproate, <b>oxcarbazepine</b> and carbamazepine are also used for prophylaxis. More recent drug solutions include lamotrigine, which is another anticonvulsant. Clonazepam (Klonopin) is also used. [...] Sometimes atypical antipsychotics are used in combination with the previous mentioned medications as well, including olanzapine (Zyprexa) which helps treat hallucinations or delusions, Asenapine (Saphris, Sycrest), aripiprazole (Abilify), risperidone, ziprasidone, and clozapine which is often used for people who do not respond to lithium or anticonvulsants.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there is}} limited data {{analyzing}} the impact of <b>oxcarbazepine</b> on a human fetus. Animal studies have shown an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats and rabbits treated with <b>oxcarbazepine,</b> during pregnancy. In addition, <b>oxcarbazepine</b> is structurally similar to carbamazepine (pregnancy category: D) which {{is considered to be}} teratogenic in humans. <b>Oxcarbazepine</b> should only be used in pregnancy if the benefits justify the risks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxcarbazepine</b> {{has great}} {{bioavailability}} {{once it is}} administrated orally as tablets. Upon absorption, <b>oxcarbazepine</b> is largely metabolized to its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite licarbazepine (sometimes called MHD). During a study in humans, the unchanged <b>oxcarbazepine</b> {{was found to be}} about 2% of the total radioactivity, while licarbazepine presented 70%, and the rest representing the minor metabolites. The half-life of <b>oxcarbazepine</b> is considered to be about 2 hours, whereas licarbazepine has a half-life of nine hours. Therefore, the antiepileptic activity can be attributed to licarbazepine.|$|E
50|$|Licarbazepine is a {{voltage-gated}} {{sodium channel}} blocker with anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing effects that {{is related to}} <b>oxcarbazepine.</b> It is an active metabolite of <b>oxcarbazepine.</b> In addition, an isomer of licarbazepine, eslicarbazepine ((S)-(+)-licarbazepine), is an active metabolite of eslicarbazepine acetate. <b>Oxcarbazepine</b> and eslicarbazepine acetate are inactive on their own, and behave instead as prodrugs to licarbazepine and eslicarbazepine, respectively, to produce their therapeutic effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oxcarbazepine</b> (Trileptal) - <b>Oxcarbazepine</b> is not FDA {{approved}} for bipolar disorder. Still, {{it appears to}} be effective in about one-half of patients with bipolar disorder and is generally well tolerated.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oxcarbazepine</b> is an {{anticonvulsant}} drug primarily {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy. There is some evidence for <b>oxcarbazepine</b> as a mood-stabilizing agent and thus, it can be used as add-on therapy for bipolar disorder in patients that have failed or are unable to tolerate approved treatments.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} side effects {{associated}} with <b>oxcarbazepine</b> include: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxcarbazepine</b> is a prodrug {{which is}} {{activated}} to licarbazepine in the liver.|$|E
5000|$|... {{antiepileptic}} {{drugs such}} as valproate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, vigabatrin, carbamazepine and <b>oxcarbazepine,</b> and topiramate ...|$|E
50|$|Similarly to <b>oxcarbazepine,</b> ESL behaves as a prodrug to (S)-(+)-licarbazepine. As such, their {{mechanisms}} of action are identical.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>oxcarbazepine</b> and its MHD {{the active}} {{metabolite}} {{were found to}} show anticonvulsant properties in seizure models done on animals. These compounds had protective functions whenever tonic extension seizures were induced electrically, but such protection was less apparent whenever seizures were induced chemically. There was no observable tolerance during a four weeks course of treatment with daily administration of <b>oxcarbazepine</b> or MHD in electroshock test on mice and rats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxcarbazepine</b> is an {{anticonvulsant}} used {{to reduce}} the occurrence of epileptic episodes, and {{is not intended to}} cure epilepsy. <b>Oxcarbazepine</b> is used alone or in combination with other medications for the treatment of focal (partial) seizures in adults. In pediatric populations, it can be used by itself for the treatment of partial seizures for children 4 years and older, or in combination with other medications for children 2 years and older.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oxcarbazepine</b> (1990). A {{derivative}} of carbamazepine that has similar efficacy but is better tolerated {{and is also}} available generically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxcarbazepine</b> and its active {{metabolite}} (monohydroxy derivative; MHD) {{have been}} shown to exhibit drug interactions when indicated with medications that are metabolized via CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. <b>Oxcarbazepine</b> and MHD is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and thus, has the potential to increase plasma concentration of drugs that are metabolized through this pathway placing the patient at higher risk for toxicities. Example of CYP2C19 substrates include: phenytoin, citalopram, diazepam, imipramine, omeprazole, propranolol, amitriptyline and progesterone when administered together.|$|E
50|$|To {{minimize}} epileptic seizures {{in these}} people, {{it is important}} to find an anti-convulsant medication that does not disrupt a person's sleeping structure. The anti-convulsant medications that were tested to meet this criteria are: phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, ethosuximide, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, vigabatrin, tiagabine, levetiracetam, zonisamide, and <b>oxcarbazepine.</b> <b>Oxcarbazepine</b> is shown to have the least amount of adverse effects on sleep. Another study shows that it enhances slow wave-sleep and sleep continuity in patients with epilepsy.|$|E
50|$|Pregnant persons on <b>oxcarbazepine</b> {{should be}} closely monitored, as plasma {{levels of the}} active {{metabolite}} (MHD) {{has been shown to}} potentially decrease during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>oxcarbazepine</b> {{has been}} shown to improve mood and reduce anxiety; therefore, it is a {{potential}} option for add-on therapy in the treatment of bipolar disorder.|$|E
50|$|Some neurological/psychiatric {{medications}} (<b>Oxcarbazepine,</b> among others) {{have been}} found to cause hyponatremia in some patients. Patients with diabetes insipidus are particularly vulnerable due to rapid fluid processing.|$|E
50|$|Eslicarbazepine acetate is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, a type of heart block, and in people who are hypersensitive to eslicarbazepine, <b>oxcarbazepine</b> or carbazepine.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>oxcarbazepine,</b> ESL has {{potential}} {{uses for the}} treatment of trigeminal neuralgia and bipolar disorder. A 2015 assessment showed no statistical difference to placebo for the latter disorder.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oxcarbazepine</b> is {{marketed as}} Trileptal by Novartis and {{available}} {{in some countries}} as a generic drug. There is also an extended-release formulation marketed as Oxtellar XR by Supernus Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} carbamazepine is {{the first}} line treatment; second line medications include baclofen, lamotrigine, <b>oxcarbazepine,</b> phenytoin, gabapentin and pregabalin. Uncontrolled trials have suggested that clonazepam and lidocaine may be effective.|$|E
50|$|In addition, coadministration of sofosbuvir with {{anticonvulsants}} (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, <b>oxcarbazepine),</b> antimycobacterials (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine), and the HIV {{protease inhibitor}} tipranavir and ritonavir {{is expected to}} decrease sofosbuvir concentration. Thus, coadministration is not recommended.|$|E
50|$|Eslicarbazepine acetate {{is absorbed}} {{to at least}} 90% from the gut, {{independently}} of food intake. It is quickly metabolised to eslicarbazepine, so that the original substance cannot be detected in the bloodstream. Peak plasma levels of eslicarbazepine are reached after 2-3 (1-4) hours, and plasma protein binding is somewhat less than 40%. Biological half-life is 10 to 20 hours, and steady-state concentrations are reached after four to five days after start of the treatment. <b>Oxcarbazepine,</b> for comparison, is also nearly completely absorbed from the gut, and peak plasma concentrations of licarbazepine are reached after 4.5 hours on average after <b>oxcarbazepine</b> intake. Plasma protein binding and half-life are of course the same.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>oxcarbazepine,</b> eslicarbazepine {{can reduce}} plasma levels {{of drugs that}} are metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 (verified in studies for {{simvastatin}} and the oral contraceptive levonorgestrel/ethinylestradiol) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and increase plasma levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, <b>oxcarbazepine</b> {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with other anticonvulsant medications when used in combination. For example, phenytoin and phenobarbital are known CYP inducers and thus, have the potential to decrease the plasma concentration of oxcarbazepine's active metabolite, MHD.|$|E
50|$|SJS may {{be caused}} by adverse effects of the drugs vancomycin, allopurinol, valproate, levofloxacin, diclofenac, etravirine, isotretinoin, fluconazole, valdecoxib, sitagliptin, oseltamivir, penicillins, barbiturates, sulfonamides, phenytoin, azithromycin, <b>oxcarbazepine,</b> zonisamide, modafinil, lamotrigine, nevirapine, pyrimethamine, ibuprofen, ethosuximide, carbamazepine, bupropion, telaprevir, and nystatin.|$|E
