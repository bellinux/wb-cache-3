5|$|Widespread {{segregation}} in 19th- and early 20th-century North America {{made it difficult}} for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions– and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans,</b> Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion.|$|E
5|$|Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Americans</b> {{from the}} Civil War to World War II {{is a book}} by American writer Douglas A. Blackmon, {{published}} by Anchor Books in 2008. It explores the forced labor of imprisoned black men and women, through the convict lease system used by states, local governments, white farmers, and corporations after the American Civil War until World War II in the southern United States. Blackmon argues that slavery in the United States did not end with the Civil War, but instead persisted well into the 20th century. It depicts the subjugation of Convict Leasing, Sharecropping and Peonage and tells {{the fate of the}} former but not of the latter two.|$|E

25|$|Other studies {{concluded}} that the Tuskegee Syphilis trial has played a minor role in the decisions <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> to decline participation as research subjects. Of the studies that have investigated the willingness <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> to participate in medical studies, they have not drawn consistent conclusions related to the willingness and participation in studies by racial minorities. Some {{of the factors that}} continue to limit the credibility of these few studies is how awareness differs significantly across studies. For instance, it appears that the rates of awareness differ as a function of method of assessment, study participants who reported awareness of the Tuskegee Syphilis Trials are often misinformed about the results and issues, and awareness of the study is not reliably associated with unwillingness to participate in scientific research.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the black}} Americans who {{traveled}} to Oklahoma had ancestors who could {{be traced back to}} Oklahoma. Many of the settlers were relatives <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> who had traveled on foot with the Five Civilized Tribes along the Trail of Tears. Others were the descendants of people who had fled to Indian Territory. Many Black residents were also from the various Muskogee speaking peoples, such as Creeks, Seminoles, and the Yuchi, while some had been adopted by the tribe after the Emancipation Proclamation. They were thus able to live freely in the Oklahoma Territory.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, blacks made up {{more than}} half of the state's population. By 1910, a {{majority}} of black farmers in the Delta had lost their land and become sharecroppers. By 1920, the third generation after freedom, most African Americans in Mississippi were landless laborers again facing poverty. Starting about 1913, tens of thousands <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> left Mississippi for the North in the Great Migration to industrial cities such as St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York. They sought jobs, better education for their children, the right to vote, relative freedom from discrimination, and better living. In the migration of 1910–1940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta {{tests for}} {{soldiers}} in World War I, mental testing became {{popular in the}} US, where it was soon applied to school children. The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the College Entrance Examination Board created the Scholastic Aptitude Test to standardize college admissions. The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions—i.e. the preferential training <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Americans</b> for manual labor. These practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison Davis. Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded. In the United States, {{tens of thousands of}} men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent which has never been overturned, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1907 case Buck v. Bell.|$|E

He is credited with raising the self-esteem <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> and reconnecting them with their African heritage. He is largely responsible for the spread of Islam in the black community in the United States. Many African Americans, especially those who lived in cities in the Northern and Western United States, felt that MalcolmX articulated their complaints concerning inequality better than did the mainstream civil rights movement. One biographer says that by giving expression to their frustration, MalcolmX [...] "made clear the price that white America would have to pay if it did not accede to black America's legitimate demands." ...|$|E
500|$|The Tuskegee {{program was}} then {{expanded}} {{and became the}} center for African-American aviation during World War II. Members of the Tuskegee unit {{became known as the}} Tuskegee Airmen. Formation of the black air units was announced by Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson on January 16, 1941. On March 19, 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron (Pursuit being an early World War II synonym for [...] "Fighter") was established at Chanute Field in Rantoul, Illinois and activated three days later on March 22. Over 250 enlisted men formed the first group <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> trained at Chanute in aircraft ground support trades. This small number became the core of other black squadrons subsequently formed at Tuskegee and Maxwell Fields in Alabama. Later in 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron moved to Maxwell Field and then Tuskegee Field before deploying to combat in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in 1943. Pilots, commanders, instructors, and maintenance and support staff comprised the [...] "Tuskegee (Airmen) Experiment".|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{strictly}} {{legal and}} political concerns, Sawyer was also interested in the plight <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans,</b> and {{became involved in the}} Civil Rights movement. According to his friend and fellow lawyer, Arlin M. Adams, Sawyer [...] "was troubled by the treatment of blacks in the South." [...] In 1965, he traveled to Selma, Alabama, to help register black voters there and in Mississippi, and gave legal representation to activists who were charged with breaking local ordinances. Closer to home, he also sued the Philadelphia Police Department and its commissioner, Frank Rizzo, over allegations that black applicants to the police academy were being unfairly rejected. Sawyer represented nine black applicants in a series of cases that spanned nearly a decade, culminating in court-ordered measures to ensure greater racial diversity on the force. In 1972, he again sued Rizzo (who was by then Mayor of Philadelphia) over improper funding of the city workers' pension fund. As Sawyer's son Jonathan recalled in 1999, [...] "a magazine printed Rizzo's top-10 enemies, and my father was on the list. He was very proud that he made it." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's second track [...] "Black Skinhead" [...] has {{alternately}} {{been called}} an industrial hip hop song and [...] "a galloping punk-rap manifesto". [...] "I Am a God" [...] {{was inspired by}} a [...] "diss" [...] from a major fashion designer, who informed West of his invitation to a widely anticipated runway show on the condition he agree to not attend other shows. [...] "I'm in It" [...] began with a different sample and melody, but West removed the sample and Rubin edited the track down from a six-minute arrangement. [...] "Blood on the Leaves," [...] which samples Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of [...] "Strange Fruit" [...] and was the first track in the first incarnation of the track list, is an example of West's signature dichotomy in which he melds the sacred and profane. [...] "Strange Fruit", first recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939, brought the lynchings <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> to a [...] "startling poignancy," [...] creating [...] "one of the most towering, important songs of the 20th century."

500|$|After President-elect Ulysses S. Grant's inauguration in 1869, Morton {{became one}} of the Grant administration's most able and {{reliable}} floor leaders. Morton helped shepherd through the bill readmitting Virginia to representation in Congress and voted in favor of the treaty annexing Santo Domingo to the United States. Later, he countered Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in a bitter debate over the president's motives and intentions towards the Caribbean nation and its people. In the Senate Morton argued in favor of the Enforcement Act (1871), also known as the so-called Ku-Klux Act, that gave the president expanded power to oppose terrorism in the Deep South. Morton, known as a masterful waver of the [...] "bloody shirt", was unstinting in his efforts to connect the Democrats to wartime treason and peacetime violence, and generally could be relied on to provide a ready and strong defense of the federal government's right to intervene and enforce the protection of the civil rights <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans.</b> Morton championed the right of Louisiana's black leader, Pinckney B. S. Pinchback, to a seat in the U.S. Senate, although the effort was unsuccessful. Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1875, and had his strongest support in 1876 among black Republicans in an increasingly [...] "solid South".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the film lead Koreyoshi Kurahara and Nobuo Yamada to write and direct a couple more {{original}} scripts, where Kurahara was primarily known for his adaptations of novels. This included the follow-up Black Sun (1964) which again featured Tamio Kawachi, who reprised his role from The Warped Ones, as did several of the other actors, {{and a lot of}} jazz music. In it, Kawachi's Akira shelters a black G.I., Gil, played by Chico Rolands, who goes A.W.O.L. after killing a white man in a bar fight. The film explores the two men's friendship and race relations. It was also the first reversal on rashamen-themed films, post-war, often American-Japanese co-productions focusing on friendships or romances between a Japanese and an American. Rashamen films were intended as to promote goodwill between the two nations but were generally less well received in Japan, seen as unrealistic or patronizing. Film historian Tadao Sato described Black Sun as the first film of this sort where Japanese pity Americans instead of the reverse as Akira's preconceptions <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> are undone. Mark Schilling characterized Kawachi as bringing an [...] "explosive energy" [...] to the film and Roland a [...] "piping screech of fear and desperation." [...] Acclaimed American jazz musician Max Roach contributed to the score.|$|E
