5|$|All {{efforts to}} extend the church beyond Kent {{encountered}} difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps {{at the urging of}} Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. It proved impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.|$|E

25|$|The Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 was a British Act of Parliament {{to define}} the {{relationship}} between local ("colonial") and British ("imperial") legislation. It confirmed that colonial legislation was to have full effect within the colony, limited <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> {{that it was not}} in contradiction with ("repugnant to") any Imperial Act which extended to that colony. The Act had the effect of clarifying and strengthening the position of colonial legislatures, {{while at the same time}} restating their ultimate subordination to the British Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit en banc, {{and thus}} the later {{decision}} controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only {{so long as the}} older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.|$|E
25|$|All {{wages of}} Connecticut {{residents}} {{are subject to}} the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.|$|E

25|$|Rodney Charlton Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst) — Rodney is Del's younger brother, {{and is more}} academically gifted, {{although}} <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of two GCEs. Orphaned when young, Rodney {{was raised}} by Del. His principal role throughout the show was as Del's lackey and sidekick. Much of {{the conflict between the}} two came from Rodney's dislike of his reliance on Del, and his unsuccessful attempts to gain greater independence through girlfriends or by setting up his own businesses; he was only partially successful after marrying Cassandra and briefly going to work for her father. In contrast to Del Boy, the part of Rodney was cast early, with Lyndhurst settled on quickly. Sullivan partly based Rodney on his own experiences; he, too, had a much older sibling and, like Rodney, claims to have been a dreamer and an idealist in his youth.|$|E
25|$|As English law {{applied in}} both in Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia, all land {{that had not}} already been alienated should in {{principle}} have been Crown land. However, in both territories, BSAC claimed ownership of the land not in other private ownership either because it, not the Crown, had conquered it or under the various concessions it had obtained. It also claimed the right to alienate this land as its owner. In 1890 and 1891, the Colonial Office and the High Commissioner accepted that BSAC had obtained title to the land in Mashonaland. After the Matebele wars, the company also claimed in 1894 {{to have the right}} to dispose of all land in Matebeleland, on the basis that the Ndebele king, Lobengula had owned it, but had forfeited it. The Colonial Office objected, but <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of requiring BSAC to reserve sufficient lands for the African population.|$|E

25|$|Finland re-entered World WarII {{mainly because}} of the Soviet {{invasion}} of Finland during the Winter War, which had taken place after Finnish intentions of relying on the League of Nations and Nordic neutrality to avoid conflicts had failed from lack of outside support. During the Continuation War, Finland primarily aimed to reverse its territorial losses under the March 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty and, depending on the success of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, to possibly expand, especially into East Karelia (Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic). Some right-wing groups also supported a Greater Finland ideology. Henrik Lunde notes that, unlike many of Germany's allies, Finland survived World WarII without losing its independence, although the price for war was high in war casualties, reparation payments, territorial loss, a bruised international reputation according to Olli Vehviläinen, and according to some, subsequent Soviet influence on Finland's foreign policy during the Cold War. According to Tuulikki Vuonokari, the Finnish–German alliance was different from most of the other Axis relationships, an example of which was the participation of Finnish Jews in the fight against the Soviet Union. The Finnish government did not take any anti-Jewish measures, despite repeated requests from Nazi Germany. One remarkable aspect of the Finnish–German relationship was that Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact, which was signed by all de jure Axis countries. The Finns, and Mannerheim in particular, clearly stated they would fight against the Soviets <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> necessary to redress the balance of the 1940 treaty. However, for Hitler the matter was irrelevant; and he saw Finland as an ally.|$|E

500|$|The {{state may}} {{regulate}} fishing by non-Indians {{to achieve a}} wide variety of management or [...] "conservation" [...] objectives. Its selection of regulations to achieve these objectives is limited only by its own organic law and the standards of reasonableness required by the Fourteenth Amendment. But when it is regulating the federal right of Indians to take fish at their usual and accustomed places it does not have the same latitude in prescribing the management objectives and the regulatory means of achieving them. The state may not qualify the federal right by subordinating it to some other state objective or policy.
