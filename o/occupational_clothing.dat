30|$|Min’s article, “Gendered role {{communication}} in marketing blue-collar <b>occupational</b> gear and <b>clothing</b> in the United States,” {{presents the results}} of a visual analysis of websites and advertisements selling blue-collar work apparel and personal protective gear. Min’s analysis shed light on the lack of options available for women in these occupations. Furthermore, although gender equality is promoted in the workplace, individuals still express a sense of discomfort when viewing advertisements that portray women employed in blue-collar roles.|$|R
50|$|High-visibility (HV) clothing, {{a type of}} {{personal}} protective equipment (PPE), is any clothing worn that has highly reflective properties or a colour that is easily discernible from any background. Yellow waistcoats worn by emergency services are a common example. <b>Occupational</b> wearers of <b>clothing</b> with high-visibility features include railway and highway workers, airport workers, or other places where workers are near moving vehicles or in dark areas. Some cyclists wear high-visibility clothing when riding amongst motor vehicles. Hunters {{may be required to}} wear designated high-visibility clothing to prevent accidental shooting.|$|R
40|$|A NIOSH {{standard}} for worker exposure to carbon-tetrachloride (56235) is reviewed. Control of air {{concentrations in the}} workplace so they do not exceed 2 parts per million (ppm) in 45 liters is discussed. Medical requirements of the standard, including preplacement and annual physicals, counseling regarding use of alcohol and barbiturates, {{and the maintenance of}} medical records also are discussed together with labelling requirements for shipping and storage containers, and for areas of <b>occupational</b> exposure. <b>Clothing</b> and equipment are described for protection of eyes and respiratory system, together with gloves, aprons, and footwear. The need for employee education regarding the hazards, signs, and symptoms of overexposure, emergency procedures, and proper conditions and precautions for safe use of carbon tetrachloride is considered. Work practices, including the control of airborne contamination, contact with skin and eyes, emergency procedures, cleaning of spills, housekeeping procedures, personal hygiene, access to regulated areas, and control of soiled clothing are described. Sanitation requirements are presented for washing facilities, clothing and locker facilities, and smoking restrictions. Record keeping and exposure monitoring procedures are reviewed. The author notes that the carbon-tetrachloride standard is designed to protect {{the health and safety of}} workers up to 10 hours per day, 40 hours per week, over a working lifetime.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>occupational</b> <b>clothing</b> would impair performance during swimming. The sub questions included: (1) Will the standard work wear of a railway worker or laborer impede swimming ability? (2) Will this clothing impact the individual’s ability to tread water? We addressed the research questions with three hypotheses. Analysis showed statistically significant p-values and all three null hypotheses were rejected {{in favor of the}} three research hypotheses, showing strong evidence that standard labor wear had adverse effects on 11. 43 meter/ 12. 5 yard swim time, water treading time and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) during water treading. The mean swim time more than doubled when the subjects wore standard labor-wear and their average rate of perceived exertion increased from 11. 6 in standard swim wear to 17. 1 in standard laborwear. It may be beneficial for those workers who work near water to be exposed to educational programs that allow in-water experiences so they develop an understanding of their abilities in, and respect for, the water...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{accordance}} with the German Infection Protection Act, the treatment and handling of laundry was checked by the Public Health Department in 2016 in all Frankfurt nursing homes with special focus on the staff’s clothing. Methods: On-site visits and surveys were conducted in all 44 nursing homes in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, and random microbiological examinations of 58 reprocessed and 58 already worn protective gowns were performed to determine the numbers of the colony forming units (cfu) and microbiological differentiation of the pathogen species. Results: 41 (93 %) of the 44 homes tested had contracted a certified laundry service. 23 (52 %) of the homes also ran a laundry of their own; in 21 of these, laundry was reprocessed and disinfected in an industrial washing machine. Regular technical or microbiological tests were carried out in 16 or 12 of the home-owned laundries, respectively. Only (70 %) provided uniforms for their employees. The staff’s clothing was processed in 25 homes by the external laundry, in 9 homes by the internal laundry, and in 12 homes, the nursing staff {{had to do this}} privately at their own home. Used coats exhibited significantly higher contamination than freshly prepared ones (median: 80 vs. 2 cfu/ 25 cm; P 95 percentile: 256 cfu vs. 81 cfu/ 25 cm). Clothing prepared in private homes showed significantly higher contamination rates than those washed in the certified external laundry or in the nursing homes themselves (Median: vs. 0. 5 – 1 cfu/ 25 cm). Conclusion: Considering various publications on pathogen transfers and outbreaks due to contaminated laundry in medical facilities, the treatment of laundry, in particular the uniforms, must be given more attention, also in nursing homes for the elderly. The private reprocessing of <b>occupational</b> <b>clothing</b> by the employees at home must be rejected on hygienic principles, and is furthermore prohibited by law in Germany...|$|E
40|$|In many <b>occupational</b> settings, <b>clothing</b> must be worn {{to protect}} {{individuals}} from hazards {{in their work}} environment. However, personal protective clothing (PPC) restricts heat exchange with the environment due to high thermal resistance and low water vapor permeability. As a consequence, individuals who wear PPC often work in uncompensable heat stress conditions where body heat storage continues to rise {{and the risk of}} heat injury is greatly enhanced. Tolerance time while wearing PPC is influenced by three factors: (i) initial core temperature (Tc), affected by heat acclimation, precooling, hydration, aerobic fitness, circadian rhythm, and menstrual cycle; (ii) Tc tolerated at exhaustion, influenced by state of encapsulation, hydration, and aerobic fitness; and (iii) the rate of increase in Tc from beginning to end of the heat-stress exposure, which is dependent on the clothing characteristics, thermal environment, work rate, and individual factors like body composition and economy of movement. Methods to reduce heat strain in PPC include increasing clothing permeability for air, adjusting pacing strategy, including work/rest schedules, physical training, and cooling interventions, although the additional weight and bulk of some personal cooling systems offset their intended advantage. Individuals with low body fatness who perform regular aerobic exercise have tolerance times in PPC that exceed those of their sedentary counterparts by as much as 100 % due to lower resting Tc, the higher Tc tolerated at exhaustion and a slower increase in Tc during exercise. However, questions remain about the importance of activity levels, exercise intensity, cold water ingestion, and plasma volume expansion for thermotolerance. ...|$|R
