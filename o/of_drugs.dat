40|$|Objective: Atypical {{sequences}} <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> use progression {{are thought}} to have important implications for the development of substance dependence. The extent to which this assumption holds for South African populations is unknown. This paper attempts to address this gap by examining the prevalence and correlates of atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> progression among South Africans. Method: Data on substance use and other mental health disorders from a nationally representative sample of 4351 South Africans were analysed. Weighted cross tabulations were used to estimate prevalence and correlates of atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> use progression. Results: Overall, 12. 2 % of the sample reported atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> use progression. The most common violation was the use <b>of</b> extra-medical <b>drugs</b> prior to alcohol and tobacco. Gender was significantly associated with atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> use with the risk pattern varying by the type <b>of</b> <b>drug.</b> None <b>of</b> the anxiety or mood disorders were associated with atypical patterns of use. Atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> use were not associated with increased risk for a lifetime substance use disorder. Conclusion: Atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> use initiation seem more prevalent in South Africa compared to other countries. The early use <b>of</b> extra-medical <b>drugs</b> is common, especially among young women. Drug availability and social environmental factors may influence patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> use.

Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion.

5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E
