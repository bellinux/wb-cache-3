5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English <b>ophthalmic</b> surgeon {{published}} a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of <b>ophthalmic</b> surgery.|$|E
5|$|Phase II {{clinical}} trials {{with one of}} the candidate compounds, mapracorat (code names BOL-303242-X and ZK245186), started in summer 2009. One was a double blind dose finding study for an ointment against atopic dermatitis conducted by Intendis, a part of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals specialized on dermatology. A Phase III trial started in November 2010, evaluating an <b>ophthalmic</b> suspension for the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery, conducted by Bausch & Lomb.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some <b>ophthalmic</b> procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|When {{the bust}} was first discovered, no piece of quartz to {{represent}} the iris of the left eyeball was present, as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £5 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that the quartz iris of the left eye had fallen out when the sculptor Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an <b>ophthalmic</b> infection, and actually lost her left eye, though {{the presence of an}} iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.|$|E
25|$|Common {{ostriches}} {{have evolved}} a 'selective brain cooling' mechanism {{as a means}} of thermoregulation. This modality allows the common ostrich to manage the temperature of the blood going to the brain in response to the extreme ambient temperature of the surroundings. The morphology for heat exchange occurs via cerebral arteries and the <b>ophthalmic</b> rete, a network of arteries originating from the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery. The <b>ophthalmic</b> rete is analogous to the carotid rete found in mammals, as it also facilitates transfer of heat from arterial blood coming from the core to venous blood returning from the evaporative surfaces at the head.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Australia, Gregg was {{appointed}} resident medical officer at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA). He returned to England to study ophthalmology, gaining a diploma of <b>ophthalmic</b> medicine and surgery after training at Moorfields Eye Hospital and Royal Westminster <b>Ophthalmic</b> Hospital in London, and the Birmingham and Midland Counties Eye Hospital.|$|E

25|$|CST most {{commonly}} results from contiguous spread of infection from a nasal furuncle (50%), sphenoidal or ethmoidal sinuses (30%) and dental infections (10%). Less common primary sites of infection include tonsils, soft palate, middle ear, or orbit (orbital cellulitis). The highly anastomotic venous {{system of the}} paranasal sinuses allows retrograde spread of infection to the cavernous sinus via the superior and inferior <b>ophthalmic</b> veins. It was previously thought that veins in the area were valveless {{and that this was}} the major cause of the retrograde spread, however, a recent study has found that the <b>ophthalmic</b> and facial veins are not valveless.|$|E

25|$|William Ilbert Hancock F.R.C.S. (10 April 1873 – 26 January 1910) was an English {{ophthalmologist}} {{who worked}} as an assistant surgeon at the Royal London <b>Ophthalmic</b> Hospital. He was also a sportsman who represented England in tennis.|$|E
25|$|The {{trigeminal nerve}} carries general somatic afferent fibers (GSA), which {{innervate}} {{the skin of}} the face via <b>ophthalmic</b> (V1), maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) divisions.

25|$|Typically not {{diagnosed}} {{until late}} childhood or later, Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome usually presents {{itself with a}} combination of central nervous system features (midbrain), <b>ophthalmic</b> features (retina), and facial features. The degree of expression of the syndrome's components varies both clinically and structurally. Common symptoms that lead to diagnosis are headaches, retro-orbital pain and hemianopia.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{over the}} high {{incidence}} of reported side effects with ketorolac trometamol led to its withdrawal (apart from the <b>ophthalmic</b> formulation) in several countries, while in others its permitted dosage and maximum duration of treatment have been reduced. From 1990 to 1993, 97 reactions with a fatal outcome were reported worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Gregg {{returned}} to Sydney, where {{he set up}} a practice in 1923. That same year he was appointed <b>ophthalmic</b> surgeon at RPA, and the same post at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children from 1925. In 1950 he was made a consultant at the Royal Alexandra, and in 1952 at the RPA.|$|E
25|$|Having {{moved to}} Scotland {{to study at}} the Medical School of the University of Edinburgh in 1886, Pope played a number of matches for Scottish {{representative}} sides against English county sides, as well as playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club on its tour of Great Britain in 1891. Australian representative sides toured England in 1886 and 1890, and Pope played {{in a number of}} matches for the teams. He graduated from the university in 1890 with a Doctorate of Medicine (specialising in ophthalmology) and fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, subsequently returning to Australia. For a period of 17 years, from 1894 to 1911, Pope worked at Sydney Hospital, firstly as honorary <b>ophthalmic</b> assistant, and then as honorary <b>ophthalmic</b> surgeon, later being appointed to the honorary consulting staff after his resignation in May 1911.|$|E
25|$|In 1951 Allesley House was closed, and Allesley Hall {{initially}} {{became an}} annexe of Paybody Hospital before closing in 1959. In 1962 the relatively few orthopaedic cases at Paybody Hospital {{were moved to}} Whitley Hospital to be replaced a year later by <b>ophthalmic</b> patients from the Keresley branch of the Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Aciclovir topical {{cream is}} {{commonly}} associated (≥1% of patients) with: dry or flaking skin or transient stinging/burning sensations. Infrequent adverse effects include erythema or itch. When {{applied to the}} eye, aciclovir is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with transient mild stinging. Infrequently (0.1–1% of patients), <b>ophthalmic</b> aciclovir is associated with superficial punctate keratitis or allergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{atropine}} {{is used as}} a cycloplegic, {{to temporarily}} paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shorter-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an α-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to <b>ophthalmic</b> examination.|$|E
25|$|The largest student {{involvement}} in their Union comes in the forms of the sports clubs (through the Athletics Union, {{commonly known as the}} AU), and the societies (through the Societies Federation). There is a wide variety of both, including many course related societies such as the Bradford <b>Ophthalmic</b> Optics Student Association. Students are also free to start their own societies.|$|E
25|$|A year later, {{buoyed by}} {{excellent}} results {{and a silver}} medal prize in the Apothecaries' yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at Charing Cross Hospital, where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by Thomas Wharton Jones, Professor of <b>Ophthalmic</b> Medicine and Surgery at University College London. Jones had been Robert Knox's assistant when Knox bought cadavers from Burke and Hare. The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland. He was a fine teacher, up-to-date in physiology and also an <b>ophthalmic</b> surgeon. In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating {{the existence of a}} hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as Huxley's layer. No doubt remembering this, and of course knowing his merit, later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor.|$|E
25|$|The paramedian {{forehead}} flap is {{the premier}} autologous skin graft for {{the reconstruction of}} a nose, by replacing any of the aesthetic nasal subunits, especially regarding the problems of different tissue thickness and skin color. The forehead flap is an axial skin flap based upon the supraorbital artery (an <b>ophthalmic</b> artery branch) and the supratrochlear artery (an <b>ophthalmic</b> artery terminus), which can be thinned to the subdermal plexus {{in order to enhance}} the functional and aesthetic outcome of the nose. Restricted length is a practical application limit of the paramedian forehead flap, especially when the patient has a low frontal hairline. In such a patient, a small portion of scalp skin can be included to the flap, but it does have a different skin texture and does continue growing hair; such mismatching is avoided with the transverse emplacement of the flap along the hairline; yet that portion of the skin flap is random, and so risks a greater incidence of necrosis.|$|E
25|$|The cornea {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sensitive}} tissues of the body, as it is densely innervated with sensory nerve fibres via the <b>ophthalmic</b> division of the trigeminal nerve by way of 70–80 long ciliary nerves. Research suggests the density of pain receptors in the cornea is 300-600 times greater than skin and 20-40 times greater than dental pulp, making any injury to the structure excruciatingly painful.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin is {{approved}} by the FDA to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease in bone-marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney, heart, and liver transplants. It is also approved in the US {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, as an <b>ophthalmic</b> emulsion for the treatment of dry eyes (a common symptom of Sjögren's syndrome), and as a treatment for persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|Rubella {{can cause}} {{congenital}} rubella syndrome in the newborn. The syndrome (CRS) follows intrauterine infection by the rubella virus and comprises cardiac, cerebral, <b>ophthalmic</b> and auditory defects. It may also cause prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatitis. The risk of major defects or organogenesis is highest for infection in the first trimester. CRS {{is the main reason}} a vaccine for rubella was developed.|$|E
