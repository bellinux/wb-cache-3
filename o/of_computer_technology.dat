5|$|Although the duo {{felt that}} the presets and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories {{could not have been}} made in the complete absence <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology.</b> The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two they preferred. Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.|$|E
5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology,</b> and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E

30|$|This study {{examines}} {{the attitudes of}} Saudi Arabian high school students toward the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English. The study also discusses the possible barriers that affect and limit the actual usage <b>of</b> <b>computers.</b> Quantitative approach is applied in this research, which involved 30 Saudi Arabia students {{of a high school}} in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The respondents comprised 15 males and 15 females with ages between 16  years and 18  years. Two instruments, namely, Scale <b>of</b> Attitude toward <b>Computer</b> <b>Technologies</b> (SACT) and Barriers affecting Students’ Attitudes and Use (BSAU) were used to collect data. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of Davis (1989) was utilized. The analysis of the study revealed gender differences in attitudes toward the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English. Female students showed high and positive attitudes towards the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English than males. Both male and female participants demonstrated high and positive perception of Usefulness and perceived Ease <b>of</b> Use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English. Three barriers that affected and limited the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English were identified by the participants. These barriers are skill, equipment, and motivation. Among these barriers, skill had the highest effect, whereas motivation showed the least effect.|$|R

25|$|Simon {{determined}} {{that the best way}} to study these areas was through computer simulation modeling. As such, he developed an interest in computer science. Simon's main interests in computer science were in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, principles of the organization of humans and machines as information processing systems, the use of computers to study (by modeling) philosophical problems of the nature of intelligence and of epistemology, and the social implications <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Computers and {{the first}} laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology</b> was {{expanded}} during the Reagan administration. A Carter-era innovation, a set of solar water heating panels that were mounted {{on the roof of}} the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency. Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years. The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Greenspan entered {{government}} in the 70s, and became Chairman of the Federal Reserve. In 1992, he visited the newly elected Bill Clinton. He persuaded him to let the markets grow, cut taxes, and to let the markets stabilise themselves with the help <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology,</b> to create the New economy. This involved using computer models to predict risks and hedge against them, {{in accordance with the}} Californian Ideology. However, by 1996, the production figures had failed to increase, but profits were nevertheless rising, and Greenspan suggested that it wasn't working. After political attacks from all sides, Greenspan changed his mind and decided that perhaps the New Economy was real after all, but that it couldn't be measured using normal economic measures, and so the apparent boom continued.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} the final type of {{obstacles}} identified by {{the participants in the}} present study and classified under the internal type of obstacles, the study findings demonstrated that this obstacle (motivation) was the least significant one with the score of 2.2750 out of 5. The score of this obstacle was considered as a low level of effects on the participants' reactions, attitudes and use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies.</b> Hence, this gives emphasis to the positive attitudes of the participants toward the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies.</b> Additionally, the participants also had positive interest, PU, and PEOU to employ <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English. The obstacles that restricted the employment <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> were linked to the external sources, such as the physical environment, and equipment.|$|R

25|$|The world's first {{nuclear power}} plant was {{commissioned}} on June 27, 1954 in Obninsk. Soviet scientists made a major contribution to the development <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology.</b> The first major achievements in the field {{were associated with the}} building of analog computers. In the USSR, principles for the construction of network analysers were developed by S. Gershgorin in 1927 and the concept of the electrodynamic analog computer was proposed by N. Minorsky in 1936. In the 1940s, the development of AC electronic antiaircraft directors and the first vacuum-tube integrators was begun by L. Gutenmakher. In the 1960s, important developments in modern computer equipment were the BESM-6 system built under the direction of S. A. Lebedev, the MIR series of small digital computers, and the Minsk series of digital computers developed by G.Lopato and V. Przhyalkovsky.|$|E
25|$|Western Europe's {{industrial}} {{nations in the}} 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. They had obsolescent heavy industry, and suddenly had to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology,</b> European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain {{under the leadership of}} Margaret Thatcher, the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations {{at the time of her}} death in 2013.|$|E
25|$|In 1926 Lt Col George Babington Croft Lyons left a {{substantial}} bequest to the Society of Antiquaries {{to prepare a}} revised and improved edition of Papworth. Anthony Wagner became co-general editor in 1940 and sole general editor in 1944, remaining in that position until 1995. A number of volunteers were recruited (some of them, during the war years, working in inactive periods of firewatching duties) to assemble material on index cards. However, the task was a large one and progress slow, {{in part because of}} Wagner's insistence on high scholarly standards and use of primary sources, and in part because of over-ambitious plans to include in the final work a series of essays on medieval armorial families. It was eventually decided to limit the project to England, to the medieval period (pre-1530), and to publish a simple ordinary, including a name-index but without the additional essays. With the aid <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology,</b> the first volume of what was now entitled the Dictionary of British Arms appeared in 1992. Volume 2 was published in 1996, volume 3 in 2009, and volume 4 (the final volume) in 2014.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{three questions}} regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> and education. The first question addresses the effects <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> on student achievement, the second regards the effects <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> on school climate, and the final question examines the cost efficacy <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in our nation’s schools. Using the most recent literature reviews, recent studies, and survey research that {{was not included in}} the most recent reviews, our synthesis of the data demonstrates an overall positive effect that computers have on student achievement and on the school environment. It also appears that using the latest <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> to keep the United States competitive in the global economy is cost effective. Over the past 5 years an extraordinary amount of private and public sector funds have been spent on the equipment and training infrastructure for the K- 12 teaching/learning environment. According to Johnson (2000), during fiscal years 1997 and 2000, the federal government had already spent $ 1. 25 billion dollars on the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund. The Preparing Tomorrow’s Teachers to Use Technology (PT 3) initiative had invested over $ 75 million alone in programming as of March 2001 (se...|$|R

25|$|Eye {{movement}} in reading involves the visual processing of written text. This {{was described by}} the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of eye {{movement in}} the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of human behaviour and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technology</b> to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of cognitive psychology as a theoretical and methodological framework within which reading processes are examined. Sereno & Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through the recordings of eye movements and event-related potential.|$|E

30|$|The {{group of}} the {{external}} obstacles identified and confronted by the Saudi EFL learners {{who participated in the}} current study was the lack of skills in employing the <b>computer</b> <b>technologies.</b> The skill barrier score was 3.4556, indicating that the participants’ lack of professional and technical skills slightly influenced their stands and restricted their use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies.</b> Some researchers (Xiong 2008 and Almuqayteeb 2009) agreed that the lack of technical and professional skills in using <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> including the Internet considerably influence the attitudes of learners and restrict the application <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English.|$|R

30|$|Among {{the three}} groups of barriers, the {{participants}} identified the lack of skill (score of 3.4556 of 5) as the most influential barrier on participants’ attitudes and restricting their use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies.</b> The findings are inconsistent and generally contradictory with those of Kung (2005), who declared {{that the lack of}} the equipment is the most identified obstacle. The same findings are in accordance with those presented by Kung (2005), Alaugab (2007) and Almuqayteeb (2009), since they all discovered that the lack of equipment was reported as a barrier influencing the subjects' reactions and restricting the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies.</b> In the case of the current study, however, the lack of skill has been identified as the most important obstacle influencing the Saudi EFL learners' stands and restricting the use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English.|$|R
