40|$|Although {{there is}} {{increasing}} talk of the importance <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> in organisational contexts, the notion <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> is nevertheless a difficult notion to speak about in an age dominated by positivist forms of rationality. In this paper, Drucker's notion <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> will be re-described in Heidegger's terms both {{to bring out the}} notion <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> itself and the importance <b>of</b> <b>spirit.</b> As will be seen, Drucker believes that while management by objectives is a necessary, it is not a sufficient condition for effective performance. He maintains that a notion <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> needs to underpin organisational interactions. Yet he does not define what he means by <b>spirit.</b> Heidegger's notion <b>of</b> authentic concern will be used to bring out Drucker's notion <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> and thus provide a language in which to talk about spirit in organisational contexts. 9 page(s...|$|R

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began {{to be regarded as}} increasingly unsafe, especially by night. One reason may be the prevalent superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> and ghosts, and even the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Yōmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{regard the}} badnjak customs as practises {{inherited}} from the old Slavic religion. In the pre-Christian religion of the Serbs, as shown by Serbian scholar Veselin Čajkanović, there were trees seen as dwelling places <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> or divinities. Čajkanović argues that there were also trees seen as divinities per se. He considers the badnjak as a convincing example of the latter. Salutations, prayers, and sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered to him (the name badnjak is of masculine gender in Serbian); he is consistently treated not as a tree but as a person.|$|E

The Clans also follow identical hierarchy structures: Clans each have one leader, a deputy who is second-in-command, and a medicine cat who heals Clanmates in addition to communicating with StarClan.

Apprentices are younger cats who are in training to become warriors, or more rarely, medicine cats.|$|E

5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect.

Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E

5|$|Elemental Spirits, {{also called}} Mana Spirits, are beings who govern the magic {{elements}} of the series' world, and are {{at the core of}} the games' magic system as they are used to cast magic spells. Eight types <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> have appeared in the series since Secret of Mana, and each embodies a different element. Their names are homonyms of mythological beings or phenomena. In Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, usage of their power is enabled upon the main characters' meeting with them. In Legend of Mana, the spirits serve as factors in the Land Creation System. In Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana, multiple spirits of the same elemental type appear. In terms of storyline, in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Heroes of Mana, the spirits are charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight elemental benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of SD3). In Dawn of Manas North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.|$|E
5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking <b>of</b> <b>spirits,</b> was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E
5|$|The second season, , begins {{six months}} later, with dark spirits terrorizing the seas. Korra {{turns to her}} spirit-attuned uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, for tutelage, and opens the polar portals to the Spirit World at his direction. Unalaq then seizes power in the Southern Water Tribe by force, {{starting}} a civil war {{in which he is}} opposed by his brother, Korra's father, Tonraq. Seeking allies against Unalaq, Korra experiences the life of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit Raava to imprison her opponent Vaatu. Aided by his twin children Eska and Desna, Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. As Korra fights this figure, her link to the previous Avatars is broken; but with the help of Tenzin's daughter Jinora, she defeats Vaatu and Unalaq, and leaves the spirit portals open, allowing a new coexistence <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> and humans.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the philosophy of religion.

How did Berdyaev come to this sense of the priority <b>of</b> <b>spirit?</b> 2. How did he verbalise the reality <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> in his philosophy? 3. Can he help us to find ways in which we and others might grow in awareness of the spiritual realm? 4. Is his philosophy still of value today? I have surveyed Berdyaev's books as translated into English, and other relevant literature, and have attempted to present his ideas in a logical order. I offer an assessment of his philosophy, and give some account of its application to current issues. I conclude that his existential methods are still relevant today, that any philosophy <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> must use methods comparable to them, and that we have much to leam from both his emphesis upon the manifestation <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> in secular life, and his questioning faith. He represents an important but often forgotten strand within Orthodoxy...|$|R
25|$|Christians {{believe that}} the Holy Spirit gives 'gifts' to Christians. These gifts consist of {{specific}} abilities granted to the individual Christian. They are frequently known by the Greek word for gift, Charisma, from which the term charismatic derives. The New Testament provides three different lists of such gifts which range from the supernatural (healing, prophecy, tongues) through those associated with specific callings (teaching) to those expected of all Christians in some degree (faith). Most consider these lists not to be exhaustive, and other have compiled their own lists. Saint Ambrose wrote of the Seven Gifts <b>of</b> the Holy <b>Spirit</b> poured out on a believer at baptism: 1. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom; 2. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Understanding; 3. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Counsel; 4. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Strength; 5. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Knowledge; 6. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Godliness; 7. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Holy Fear.|$|R

40|$|Ready.

However, cheerleading has changed, growing more athletic and competitive over time (consider the film Bring It On). As a result, more boys and young men are getting involved. What, then, is the meaning <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> in this new context?

40|$|This article explores ways of {{thinking}} about spirituality in relation to theatrical performance. It considers an existing European tradition of associating spirituality with theatre and performance in the work of Antonin Artaud, Jerzy Grotowski, and Peter Brook, but argues against conventional metaphysical considerations <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> that are normally deployed in the discourse of a ?holy theatre?. A materialist view <b>of</b> <b>spirit,</b> originating with the work of Heidegger and Derrida, does not ignore or reject the value <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> as with other materialist philosophies, but refuses to allow spirit to remain a metaphysical category and part of a traditional onto-theological logic. The article suggests {{that it is possible to}} develop an understanding <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> as an immaterial category that is not incompatible with its material other. In what follows an aesthetic understanding <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> is put forward, which has implications for the ontological and epistemological concerns of the performance event for both performers and audience. This argument for a Derridean conception <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> is supported and illustrated with examples drawn from the recent work of Theatre de Complicite, as a way of ?deconstructing? and resituating the tradition of a ?holy theatre? in the context of post-metaphysical philosophy.
