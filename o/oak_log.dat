2500|$|The {{hull of the}} Hasholme Logboat {{was made}} out of an oak tree (Quercus sp.). After all the {{measurements}} of the hull were taken, {{it was estimated that}} the parent log (<b>oak</b> <b>log</b> the boat was made of) had to be approximately [...] long with at least [...] circumference. Thus the theoretical weight of this log must have been around 28.5 tons but {{because of the presence of}} “heart rot” (the natural process of rotting of the interior of the log) these estimates are exaggerated. Based on the size of the oak and other dendro measurements, it was suggested that this kind of tree was between 810 and 880 years old on felling. Oaks of such advanced age and size must have developed a rot known as “brittle heart,” which originates at the base and spreads upward. In the case of Hasholme, this rot spread almost to the very top of the trunk. This meant that even though the hollowing was much easier, the openings on both ends had to be closed and made watertight. It was no accident to select a tree with an extensive rot along its entire length and thus save a tremendous amount of time.|$|E
2500|$|Having safely {{withdrawn}} {{his army}} to Dalton, Georgia, General Bragg directed Cleburne's exhausted troops to camp at nearby Tunnel Hill, a town bearing {{the same name}} as the spot where they had made their stand atop Missionary Ridge. Private Matthews reports that the 33rd Alabama was given [...] "some cabins... above the tunnel... some were of round oak poles, others of split <b>oak</b> <b>log,</b> their cracks daubed with clay." [...] Captured shelter halves were used as doors, and the men wintered there as best they could. He writes that those who died here were buried nearby; the regiment would accompany them to their final resting place [...] "with arms [...] reversed, and sounded taps; however, [...] did not always fire blank cartridges from our guns, for fear of exciting other sick men in camp." [...] Though they worried about the nearly worthless currency they were being paid in, [...] "there was not as much complaint as one might suppose, as all realized that the [...] Government was doing all it could for us." [...] Matthews blamed [...] "hospital rats" [...] {{for most of the}} grumbling, and observed that troops in winter quarters played cards, dominoes, dice or keno; those who had a dollar, said he, could go to minstrel shows. Not everyone in the camp had the best interests of their comrades at heart: [...] "two or more sharpers," [...] said he, would accost soldiers doing various chores and seek to con them out of their earnings. One regiment was assigned to twenty-four hours of guard duty every day; whenever the 33rd Alabama drew this duty, they would pack up their gear and march a mile or so to the front lines, leaving behind sick soldiers and a guard over their other property.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Severe bark decay {{disease was}} {{observed}} on <b>oak</b> <b>logs</b> at a shiitake cultivation farm in Geochang-gun, Gyeongnam province. The symptoms observed were fruiting bodies that had developed {{on the top}} and side surface of <b>oak</b> <b>logs.</b> As a result, the bark came off easily exposing the sapwood. Slime mold specimens collected from <b>oak</b> <b>logs</b> showed developing fruiting bodies comprising of stalks, hypothallus, capillitium, and columella, and the causal agent of bark decay disease was identified as Stemonitis splendens on the basis of morphological characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Stemonitis splendens causing bark decay of <b>oak</b> <b>logs</b> used for shiitake mushroom cultivation in Korea...|$|R

Twice he asked his mother if she thought he had enough, but she said [...] "Not near," [...] and just as Jake Milrace rode up the saw caught in a {{splinter}} of the tough <b>oak</b> <b>log</b> Frank was sawing and bumped back against Frank's nose; and he would have cried {{if it had not been}} for what Jake began to say.|$|E
6000|$|Here sits a stout gentleman, {{who looks}} as {{resolute}} as an <b>oak</b> <b>log.</b> [...] "These things are much {{the effect of}} imagination," [...] he tells you; [...] "a little self-control and resolution," [...] &c. Ah me! it is delightful, when these people, who are always talking about resolution, get caught on shipboard. As the backwoodsman said to the Mississippi River, about the steamboat, they [...] "get their match." [...] Our stout gentleman sits {{a quarter of an}} hour, upright as a palm tree, his back squared against the rails, pretending to be reading a paper; but a dismal look of disgust is settling down about his lips; the old sea and his will are evidently having a pitched battle. Ah, ha! there he goes for the stairway; says he has left a book in the cabin, but shoots by with a most suspicious velocity. You may fancy his finale.|$|E

6000|$|In {{yet another}} case(1) {{grotesque}} hunting adventures of Baiame are {{told in the}} mysteries, and illustrated by the sacred temporary representations in raised earth. I did not know it; I merely followed Mr. Howitt. But I do not doubt it. My reply is, that there was [...] "something sacred" [...] in Greek mysteries, something purifying, ennobling, consoling. For this Lobeck has collected (and disparaged) the evidence of Pindar, Sophocles, Cicero and many others, while even Aristophanes, as Prof. Campbell remarks, says: [...] "We only have bright sun and cheerful life who have been initiated and lived piously in regard to strangers and to private citizens".(2) Security and peace of mind, {{in this world and}} for the next, were, we know not how, borne into the hearts of Pindar and Sophocles in the Mysteries. Yet, if we may at all trust the Fathers, there were scenes of debauchery, as at the Mysteries of the Fijians (Nanga) there was buffoonery ("to amuse the boys," [...] Mr. Howitt says of some Australian rites), the story of Baubo is only one example, and, in other mysteries than the Eleusinian, we know of mummeries in which an absurd tale of Zeus is related in connection with an <b>oak</b> <b>log.</b> Yet surely there was [...] "something sacred" [...] in the faith of Zeus! Let us judge the Australians as we judge Greeks. The precepts as to [...] "speaking the straightforward truth," [...] as to unselfishness, avoidance of quarrels, of wrongs to [...] "unprotected women," [...] of unnatural vices, are certainly communicated in the Mysteries of some tribes, with, in another, knowledge of the name and nature of [...] "Our Father," [...] Munganngaur. That a Totemistic dance, or medicine-dance of Emu hunting, is also displayed(3) at certain Mysteries of a given tribe, and that Baiame is spoken of as the hero of this ballet, no more deprives the Australian moral and religious teaching (at the Mysteries) of sacred value, than the stupid indecency whereby Baubo made Demeter laugh destroys the sacredness of the Eleusinia, on which Pindar, Sophocles and Cicero eloquently dwell. If the Australian mystae, at the most solemn moment of their lives, are shown a dull or dirty divine ballet d'action, what did Sophocles see, after taking a swim with his pig? Many things far from edifying, yet the sacred element of religious hope and faith was also represented. So it is in Australia.|$|E

50|$|In the {{earliest}} {{part of the}} bronze age, tribal leaders and other important people were buried in the mounds encased in a hollowed out <b>oak</b> <b>log.</b> Often the mounds were used multiple times, with both early <b>oak</b> <b>log</b> burials and later urn burials found in the same mound. The Bronze Age {{in what is now}} Denmark was in many ways an international affair with import of copper and tin from far away for bronze production, and export of cattle. Archeologists reckon that the burials changed from coffin burials to cremation due to international influence. A hallmark of the turf built bronze age mounds is that a layer of metallic oxides tended to wash out from the top turf creating a hard and air tight cap isolating the inner mound from the atmosphere. This air tight lid prevents decay of the burials due to oxidation including protecting offerings accompanying the deceased inside the mounds.|$|E
50|$|Early Britons used {{hollowed}} {{tree trunks}} as canoes. Examples of these canoes {{have been found}} buried in marshes and mud banks of river, at lengths upwards of two metres.

50|$|Megleno-Romanians {{used to have}} a {{traditional}} custom, called bondic, where the head of a household would take an <b>oak</b> <b>log</b> and place it in the hearth just before Christmas, burning it bit by bit until Epiphany. The resulting charcoal would be put under fruit trees to make them fertile. A similar custom called bavnic, but with specific variations, also existed among Aromanians, some Romanians and Latvians. This custom is found in Orthodox South Slavic cultures (Serbian badnjak, Bulgarian budnik, Macedonian badnik). Some believe that these customs and other cultural archetypes discovered by scientists are proof that Megleno-Romanians come from {{a traditional}} mountainous region.|$|E
