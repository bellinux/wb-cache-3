"While <b>our</b> <b>teachers</b> were {{resorting to}} centers of {{learning}} in increasing numbers, followed to no small degree by student graduates and undergraduates, a new menace arose from an unexpected quarter. Wisely or unwisely, our medical college had linked up with an organization (AMA) which assumed the task of defining and dictating standards for medical schools, {{with a view to}} eliminating incompetent institutions. While the step we took looked innocent enough at first, the inevitable result of tying up an institution of our own with an organization of entirely different aims, soon showed itself in a surprising way. A new standard was promulgated, requiring that all entrants to a standard medical college should present their credits from a school that was registered as standard by an association of educators who had assumed a similar task of standardizing literary schools.|$|E
2500|$|The homilies {{contained}} in Midrash Tanḥuma A {{begin with the}} words [...] "As the Scriptures say" [...] or sometimes [...] "As it is written." [...] Then follow a verse (in most cases taken from the Hagiographa), its explanation, and a homily on the particular passage of the Pentateuch referred to. Several of the homilies on the first, third, and fourth books of the Pentateuch begin with brief halakic dissertations bearing on the passages to which the homilies refer. The halakic treatises consist of a question introduced with the words [...] "Yelammedenu rabbenu" [...] (May our teacher instruct us), and of a reply beginning with the phrase [...] "Kak shanu rabbotenu" [...] (Thus have <b>our</b> <b>teachers</b> instructed us); the replies are always taken from either a mishnah or a baraita. Many of the homilies close with words of hope and encouragement regarding {{the future of the}} Jews; but several of them are abbreviated and not entirely completed, this curtailment being apologized for in the words [...] "Much more might be said on this subject, but we shall not tire you" [...] (Noaḥ. xxvi. 27b), or [...] "This passage has been elucidated by several other interpretations and expositions, but in order not to tire you we quote only that which is necessary for to-day's theme" [...] (Ḥuḳḳat xvi. 57a).|$|E

[...] Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union's government {{to prevent the spread}} of the Beatles' popularity amongst their citizens, the band proved to be as popular in the USSR as it was in Britain. The government went as far as censoring the expression of all Western ideals, including the Beatles' bourgeois eccentricity, limiting the Soviet citizens' access to their music. Leslie Woodland, a documentary film maker, commented regarding what the Russian people were told about the West – [...] "Once people heard the Beatles' wonderful music, it just didn't fit. The authorities' prognosis didn't correspond to what they were listening to. The system was built on fear and lies, and in this way, the Beatles put an end to the fear, and exposed the lies." [...] Pavel Palazchenko, Mikhail Gorbachev's conference interpreter, stated that the Beatles' music was a [...] "source of musical relief. They helped us create a world of our own, a world different from the dull and senseless ideological liturgy that increasingly reminded me of Stalinism...". Like Gorbachev, many Russian youth agreed that the Beatles were a way to overcome the cultural isolation imposed by the Cold War and reinforced by their current political system.|$|E
