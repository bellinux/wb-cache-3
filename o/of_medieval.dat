5|$|Built between 1093 and 1537, Chester Cathedral {{includes}} a set <b>of</b> <b>medieval</b> choir stalls dating from 1380, with exquisite figurative carving. An unusual {{feature is the}} very large south transept. The Early English Lady Chapel is a harmonious composition in Lancet Gothic. It retains substantial monastic buildings including a large refectory.|$|E
5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations <b>of</b> <b>medieval</b> farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology <b>of</b> <b>medieval</b> agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E
5|$|David was one <b>of</b> <b>medieval</b> Scotland's {{greatest}} monastic patrons. In 1113, {{in perhaps}} David's first act as Prince of the Cumbrians, he founded Selkirk Abbey for the Tironensians.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, the musical {{performance}} {{has taken an}} important place {{in the study of}} the mise en voix of the Cantar de Mio Cid. Although this perspective is laudable in many ways, I propose to take care on the textual and codicological plane, because many of the musical traces are lost for distinct reasons: the condition of the copy, finished according to the historiographical patterns <b>of</b> the <b>medieval</b> scriptorium; the indirect knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>medieval</b> epic music; the gaps in the understanding <b>of</b> how <b>medieval</b> cantillation was performed during public workship, in the laic or clerical life; the influence (or not) <b>of</b> the <b>medieval</b> chant dialects (especially, mozarabic and eugenian chants), etc...|$|R

5|$|Leeds, {{like many}} {{industrial}} cities, has little remaining medieval architecture. The lack <b>of</b> <b>Medieval</b> architecture in central Leeds {{may be attributed}} to the small size of the town during the majority of the period, the population usually being around 1,000. At the time there were several larger settlements in Yorkshire such as Wakefield and York.|$|E
5|$|Marshalsea or marshalcy {{referred}} {{to the office of}} a marshal, derived from the Anglo-French mareschalcie.

5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits <b>of</b> <b>medieval</b> and post-medieval agriculture.

5|$|No {{surviving}} Greek texts written {{after the}} year 100 can be securely {{identified as having}} a Jewish author.

5|$|Scotland {{is known}} for its {{dramatically}} placed castles and towers, which have become an accepted part of a romantic landscape. Castles, tower houses, peel towers and royal palaces of the period all contributed {{to the development of the}} unique style known as the Scots baronial that would be used for estate houses in Scotland in the sixteenth century, and which would be revived and used extensively from the nineteenth century, including the royal residence at Balmoral and then exported across the world. The Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century would lead to the rejection of many features <b>of</b> <b>Medieval</b> churches, resulting in the widespread destruction <b>of</b> <b>Medieval</b> church furnishings, ornaments and decoration, and would usher in new architectural forms. However, they would be revived from the 1850s to the 1890s, when large Gothic revival churches were built in considerable numbers for all the major denominations.|$|E
