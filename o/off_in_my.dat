500|$|Hubbard's war {{service has}} great {{significance}} in the history and mythology of the Church of Scientology, as {{he is said to}} have cured himself through techniques that would later underpin Scientology and Dianetics. According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted that his eyes had been damaged as well, either [...] "by the flash of a large-caliber gun" [...] or when he had [...] "a bomb go <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face". Scientology texts say that he returned from the war [...] "linded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back" [...] and was twice pronounced dead.|$|E
500|$|... "Skipper Dan", a style {{parody of}} Weezer, was {{released}} on July 14, 2009. The song describes {{a man who has}} a fine arts degree and dreamed of pursuing an acting career, but is forced to work as a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland. Yankovic later explained in an interview with The A.V. Club that the song was [...] "a bit more poignant [...] bittersweet [...] than what I usually write." [...] He was inspired to write the song after going on a ride on the Disneyland Jungle Cruise with his family. During the cruise, one of the tour guides referred to his failed acting career. Yankovic then noted that [...] "the bells went <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head, and I thought, [...] "Well, here's a song right here."" ...|$|E
500|$|Shyamalan {{expressed}} {{hope for}} a third installment following Split, saying, [...] "I hope [...] The answer is yes. I'm just such a wimp sometimes. I don't know what's {{going to happen when}} I go <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room, a week after this film opens, to write the script. But I'm going to start writing. [...] a really robust outline, which is pretty intricate. But now the standards for my outlines are higher. I need to know I've won already. I'm almost there but I'm not quite there." [...] In April 2017, Shyamalan announced the official title, release date, and returning actors for the third movie. The film, titled Glass, will be released January 18, 2019 and will feature Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Anya Taylor-Joy, and James McAvoy returning to their respective roles in the series.|$|E

500|$|In Los Angeles, Goldstein {{associated}} with a crowd of heavy drug users. At 16, he approached his mother and asked for help with his drug problems. She arranged for him to attend Straight, Incorporated, a drug rehabilitation center that was later revealed to abuse patients. Goldstein disclosed that he was physically assaulted and spat on by staff while there. At one point, he escaped from the facility, but {{he was arrested and}} brought back after being recognized at Knott's Berry Farm. While he was in rehab, his mother visited him and disclosed that Herbert was not his biological father, was homosexual, and was dying from HIV/AIDS. Goldstein said that after he received this news it was [...] "like a bomb went <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head"; he subsequently [...] "exploded," [...] attacking one of his counselors. He was eventually indicted and dismissed from rehab for his treatment of younger patients shortly before his 18th birthday. Herbert died the following year.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Moulton, Hubbard's {{executive}} {{officer on the}} USS PC-815, testified in 1984 that Hubbard had {{said that he had}} been shot in the Dutch East Indies, and that on another occasion Hubbard had told him that his eyes had been damaged by the flash of a large-caliber gun. Hubbard himself told Scientologists in a taped lecture that he had suffered eye injuries after having had [...] "a bomb go <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face." [...] He told Robert Heinlein, the science fiction writer, that [...] "both of his feet had been broken (drumhead-type injury) when his last ship was bombed." [...] According to Heinlein, Hubbard said that he [...] "had had a busy war – sunk four times and wounded again and again". Hubbard was said to have been [...] "twice been pronounced dead" [...] and to have spent a year in a naval hospital which he [...] "utilized in the study of endocrine substances and protein". The techniques that he developed [...] "made possible not only his own recovery from injury, but helped other servicemen to regain their health". On another occasion, Hubbard said that he had been hospitalized because [...] "I was utterly exhausted. I'd just been in combat theater after combat theater, you see, with no rest, no nothing between." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1900, Weber {{was almost}} 21 and {{was living with}} her parents and two sisters at 1717 Fremont Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where she was a music student. By April 1903, Weber was {{performing}} as a soprano singer and pianist. She toured the United States as a concert pianist with renowned harpist Mrs Apt Thomas until her final performance in Charleston, South Carolina a year later. After an unfortunate incident when a piano key broke during a recital, Weber retired from the concert stage, having lost her nerve to play in public. Weber describes the incident that precipitated her retirement: [...] "Just as I started to play a black key came <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand. I kept forgetting that the key was not there, and reaching for it. The incident broke my nerve. I could not finish and I never appeared on the concert stage again. It is my belief that when that key came <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand, a certain phase of my development came to an end." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cranston drew further {{attention}} in late 1905 when he published a further {{article in the}} Boston Journal opining that athletics were being overdone at universities. Under the headline, [...] "Wishes He Had Not Been a Famous Athlete When In College," [...] Cranston wrote:"I have had several serious sicknesses since I left college which I attribute to the great strain of my athletic training. On the whole I can't say that athletics have benefitted me any in my business career. I sincerely believe I {{would have been better}} <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life since college if I had left athletics alone. ... I've never received any benefit in business life from athletics.

60|$|She {{would sit}} there for hours--never {{sleeping}} apparently, for her eye was always bright--preening herself, turning her head slowly, {{so as to}} watch on all sides, snapping now and then at an obtrusive fly, all in utter unconsciousness that I was just behind her, watching every movement. Then, when I had enough, I would steal away along a caribou path, and push <b>off</b> quietly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> canoe without looking back. She saw me, of course, when I entered the canoe, but not once did she leave the nest. When I reached the open lake, a little searching with my glass always showed me her head there in the grass, still turned <b>in</b> <b>my</b> direction apprehensively.|$|R

30|$|Years of {{regulations}} and compliance have caused most editors to feel {{alienated from the}} government’s leading ideology. In order to function under the government’s control, editors must possess “professional intuition”, {{a sense of the}} ideological boundaries of editorial work. Such “professional intuition” helps editors determine what topics and vocabulary are <b>off</b> limits. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> experience, successful editors employ several strategies to ensure good relations with the government: they use quotations from top leaders, they analyze social events from a dialectical materialist perspective, and they avoid absolutism and extremism. Nowadays, finely-tuned “professional intuition” is not only a critical measure of “professional maturity”, but more importantly, it saves a lot of trouble.|$|R

60|$|We {{could safely}} have stayed longer, {{for the evening}} damp no longer brings danger of Roman fever, which people used {{to take in the}} Colosseum, unless I am {{thinking}} of the signal case of Daisy Miller.
