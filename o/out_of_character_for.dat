Coon {{also left}} the series {{prior to the}} third season, and Nimoy {{subsequently}} found {{it more difficult to}} ensure that Spock was written in a manner that he preferred. This was because Roddenberry and Coon had been guiding the writers on how to write the characters during the first two seasons, and re-writing those scripts where required. With them both gone, the new writers would often write <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> situations <b>for</b> the main cast to perform.

Furthermore, several characters in the Nextwave book, not including Elsa herself, appeared in other books, referring to some events of the series as actually canon.

500|$|When {{reviewing}} the anime, Martin thought the first Shakugan no Shana always manages to slightly exceed expectations, and while its story elements may be typical, its execution is not.

Reviewer Chris Beveridge of Mania.com felt uncomfortable about the morbid nature of the series. While Beveridge did not think the series is [...] "groundbreaking", it proves to be a [...] "solid title" [...] that continuously gets better. The pacing {{in the middle of}} the first season was criticized for quickly ending an arc before [...] "going into a storyline that feels <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> <b>for</b> the show." [...] Martin's review of Shakugan no Shana Final was less positive; he described Yuji as having been made into a different character (though his complexity was praised), criticized the addition of a large number of prominent characters without sufficient development, and described some things as not making sense, although he praised Shana's development over the course of the third series.|$|E

He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting everyone else who works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set.

Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris thought that I was monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|A different, widely {{circulated}} story {{suggests that}} Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, suggested that [...] "it {{is difficult to}} ascertain the truth behind this long-standing tale", while Hodgson observes: [...] "I have never been convinced of this account because it has {{always seemed to be}} so much <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> <b>for</b> a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving 'like a gentleman' even in one's cups." [...] Mick Pope writes: [...] "The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust, unproven and such a myth... that it should have no place in any study of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." [...] The story originated in a cricket publication, Cricket Quarterly, in 1968. The historian Rowland Bowen, in an article called [...] "Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", claimed that an [...] "aged Yorkshireman of 85" [...] told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then. Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen's information came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not used the word [...] "urinated" [...] but had actually said [...] "pissed at the wicket", meaning that Peel was drunk ("pissed" [...] being slang for drunk) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story, not the new information claimed by Bowen. Rosewater self-published his findings in a book called An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|As {{head of the}} Elven guard, Lilly says of Tauriel, [...] "She's {{slightly}} reckless {{and totally}} ruthless and doesn't hesitate to kill."

[...] Lilly explains, [...] "She's only 600 years old, she's just a baby. So she's a bit more impulsive, and she's a bit more immature. I think she's more easily romanticized by a lot of things." [...] Alluding to Tauriel's pursuit of the dwarves in The Desolation of Smaug after Thranduil closes his kingdom's borders and forbids any interference on the part of Elves in outside affairs, and her refusal to fight alongside him in The Battle of the Five Armies, Lilly explains, [...] "In a very <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> move <b>for</b> an elf, she's broken ranks and disobeyed authority. That's driven from her own conviction about what is right and what is wrong. She feels so much at odds with Thranduil, that she feels the need to defy him. I think that any defiant role that boxes authority is an easy fit for me, because in life I'm a little bit like that." [...] However, Tauriel also has a [...] "softer side", and her character arc includes a love story. Though she and Legolas first met as children, and their relationship is significant, her romantic arc is not with him, as she develops a mutual attraction to the dwarf Kili. Legolas' father, the Elven king Thranduil, is fond of Tauriel, and [...] "sees something very special in her", though she understands that Thranduil would not approve of her pairing with his son, which Thranduil confirms in The Desolation of Smaug when he tells her not to give Legolas false hope of such a relationship. Lilly accepted the role under the condition that her role in The Hobbit would not include a love triangle. When she was called back into production for reshoots following the decision to split the story into three films instead of two, she was told that such a plot device would indeed be added to the story.|$|R
