2500|$|Jacob ben Meir (1100 in Ramerupt – 9 June 1171 (4 tammuz) in Troyes), {{best known}} as Rabbeinu Tam (...) , {{was one of the}} most renowned Ashkenazi Jewish rabbis and leading French Tosafists, a leading halakhic {{authority}} in his generation, and a grandson of Rashi.

2500|$|On one {{occasion}} in 1991, as the Rebbe {{was leaving the}} evening prayers when traditionally someone would start a song and the Rebbe would encourage it {{on his way out}} of the synagogue, some Chasidim began singing one of the Rebbe’s favorite lively songs, adding the words of Yechi -- [...] "Long live our master, <b>our</b> <b>teacher,</b> our Rebbe, King Moshiach." [...] The next morning, however, the Rebbe refused to go down to the synagogue until he was assured by Rabbi Groner that there would be no such songs sung again. Indeed, the song was never again sung in front of the Rebbe until some months after a stroke felled him and removed his ability to speak or write.|$|E
2500|$|Rebbe Nachman's magnum opus is the two-volume Likutei Moharan (Collected [...] of <b>Our</b> <b>Teacher</b> and Rabbi, Nachman), a {{collection}} of 411 lessons displaying in-depth familiarity {{and understanding of the}} many overt and esoteric concepts embedded in Tanakh, Talmud, Midrash, Zohar and Kabbalah. In the introductory section of certain editions of Likutei Moharan, the book is likened to the Zohar itself, and Rebbe Nachman is likened to the Zohar's author, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. This is based on the citation of numerous parallels between the lives of the two sages, as well as the fact that the names [...] "Nachman ben Simcha" [...] (Simcha being Rebbe Nachman's father's name) and [...] "Shimon ben Yochai" [...] share the same gematria (numerical value) of 501.|$|E

In the same interview, Spacey said he went to Juilliard because Kilmer did. Kilmer was at that time the youngest person ever admitted to Juilliard. During Kilmer's subsequent Inside the Actors Studio interview, he said [...] "Robert Carrelli, who was <b>our</b> <b>teacher,</b> had a knack for producing and directing.

2500|$|The {{parallel}} between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus {{was not lost}} on the early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued: [...] "when we say ... Jesus Christ, <b>our</b> <b>teacher,</b> was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." [...] (1 Apol. 21). There is, however, no belief in a general resurrection in ancient Greek religion, as the Greeks held that not even the gods were able to recreate flesh that had been lost to decay, fire or consumption. The notion of a general resurrection of the dead was therefore apparently quite preposterous to the Greeks. This is made clear in Paul's Areopagus discourse. After having first told about the resurrection of Jesus, which makes the Athenians interested to hear more, Paul goes on, relating how this event relates to a general resurrection of the dead: ...|$|E
2500|$|This second midrash {{with which}} the name of Tanḥuma, largely known through its being quoted in later works is {{associated}} {{is known as the}} [...] "Yelammedenu" [...] from the opening words of the halakic introductions to the homilies—"Yelammedenu rabbenu" [...] (May <b>our</b> <b>teacher</b> instruct us). It is referred to also under the name of Tanḥuma, though by only a few authorities, as Hai Gaon and Zedekiah ben Abraham (S. Buber, l.c. pp.44a, 50a). The reason for this confusion of names may be found in the fact that a later collection of midrashim (Tanḥuma C) included a great part of the material contained in the Yelammedenu, especially that referring to the second book of the Pentateuch. The Yelammedenu, which contains several passages from Tanḥuma A, is often cited in the [...] "Aruk," [...] and has been extensively referred to by the redactor of the Yalḳuṭ. Other old rabbinical authorities refer to the Yelammedenu by that name, and quote passages from it; but otherwise the work has been completely lost.|$|E
2500|$|The homilies {{contained}} in Midrash Tanḥuma A {{begin with the}} words [...] "As the Scriptures say" [...] or sometimes [...] "As it is written." [...] Then follow a verse (in most cases taken from the Hagiographa), its explanation, and a homily on the particular passage of the Pentateuch referred to. Several of the homilies on the first, third, and fourth books of the Pentateuch begin with brief halakic dissertations bearing on the passages to which the homilies refer. The halakic treatises consist of a question introduced with the words [...] "Yelammedenu rabbenu" [...] (May <b>our</b> <b>teacher</b> instruct us), and of a reply beginning with the phrase [...] "Kak shanu rabbotenu" [...] (Thus have our teachers instructed us); the replies are always taken from either a mishnah or a baraita. Many of the homilies close with words of hope and encouragement regarding {{the future of the}} Jews; but several of them are abbreviated and not entirely completed, this curtailment being apologized for in the words [...] "Much more might be said on this subject, but we shall not tire you" [...] (Noaḥ. xxvi. 27b), or [...] "This passage has been elucidated by several other interpretations and expositions, but in order not to tire you we quote only that which is necessary for to-day's theme" [...] (Ḥuḳḳat xvi. 57a).|$|E
