500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you do your best not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E
500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Colin Stutz of Billboard described [...] "Say Yes" [...] as a [...] "peppy" [...] number. John Walker of MTV News {{described the}} song's refrain as [...] "infectious". Mike Wass from Idolator praised the song's catchiness, describing {{it as an}} [...] "infectious gospel club-banger" [...] and {{an invitation to the}} dance floor for listeners. Further, he called it [...] "possibly the first twerk-inducing song of praise". He concluded his review, writing, [...] "those harmonies remain unrivaled and the chorus is a monster. Trust me, [...] will be stuck in your head after the first listen." [...] In another review he felt that the song managed {{to bridge the gap between}} gospel and popular music. Describing the song as [...] "kinetic", Marc Hogan of Spin magazine called it [...] "not only star-studded, but damn near impossible to get out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> too". Rolling Stone writer Jon Blistein described the horn stabs as [...] "heavenly" [...] and praised the trio's [...] "always potent harmonies".|$|E

500|$|Ready to Die {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. In his review for Rolling Stone, Cheo H. Cocker stated [...] "Ready to Die {{is the strongest}} solo rap debut since Ice Cube's Amerikkka's Most Wanted. From the breathtakingly visual moments of his birth to his Cobainesque end in [...] "Suicidal Thoughts," [...] B.I.G. proves a captivating listen. It's difficult {{to get him out}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> once you sample what he has to offer". Robert Christgau from The Village Voice commented [...] "His sex raps are erotic, his jokes are funny, and his music makes the thug life sound scary rather than luxuriously laid back. When he considers suicide, I not only take him at his word, I actively hope he finds another way". The New York Times wrote [...] "Though drug dealing carries tremendous heroic value with some young urban dwellers, he sacrifices the figure's romantic potential. His raps acknowledge both the excitement of drug dealing and the stress caused by the threat from other dealers, robbers, the police and parents, sometimes one's own. In presenting the downside of that life, Ready to Die offers perhaps the most balanced and honest portrait of the dealer's life of any in hip-hop".|$|E
500|$|Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song, stating that [...] "the girls are going to love the lyrics. It brings total sex appeal and groove that starts the hips swinging and is so meant to break the set into a dark drive and into sensual exploration of a grind close contact dance rhythm". Rich Lopez of the Dallas Voice cited the song as {{being one of the}} [...] "better" [...] songs of Love? and was surprised it had [...] "yet to be released as a single". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly complimented the potential of the song by stating that it is [...] "sure to fit right into club DJ mixes and get people dancing"; however, he criticized that Gaga was [...] "all over the song ... as if Lopez went into the booth trying to emulate her delivery." [...] Emily Exton of Popdust agreed, adding that [...] "you'd be silly not to think" [...] that the song's chorus will become a dance-floor chant among [...] "slightly intoxicated females (and males) in bars across America this summer". She additionally wrote that it was [...] "impossible to get [...] out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> after more than one listen" [...] although becoming [...] "increasingly monotonous over nearly three and half minutes" [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey roughly expanded on this view, stating that [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is not anything [...] "we haven't heard before," [...] although elaborating that it is worthy of a standalone release.|$|E

[...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start at the top <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E

One of his best is Chigurh, and between the Coens and Bardem, they never missed a beat in bringing this monster to the screen.

That's awesome, she's freaking Janet Jackson." [...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, {{because that was the}} first time that I really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up. So to finally see myself face to face with her and working with her and her calling me on a first name basis and calling my home and tracking me down on my cell phone… like her leaving messages, it was the weirdest thing." [...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> You realize that she’s a real person and she’s got just the same emotions as everyone else, but you can never get around the fact that she’s special." ...|$|E

2500|$|Modeliste {{grew up in}} the 13th Ward of New Orleans. The {{eldest of}} six siblings, he was raised in part by his grandmother, Lula Blouin. His first drum set was a three-piece paid for by Blouin. He was nicknamed Zigaboo at age ten by a {{neighborhood}} kid, and by junior high school the name had stuck. His drumming style was influenced by Smokey Johnson, Bob French and other New Orleans drum greats as he learned by watching them perform at gigs. He said listening to other musicians was {{the most important part of}} his learning process. He particularly tried to emulate Smokey Johnson's style. He started playing gigs at an early age including a stint with The Hawketts, a band led by Art Neville at the time. Over time the band evolved into The Neville Sounds and by late 1960s into The Meters. In a 2013 interview with Modern Drummer, Modeliste said: [...] "Your biggest teachers were those two things you got on the side <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> (...) It's got nothing to do with rudiments, nothing to do with time signatures, but it's got a lot to do with what you hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
