40|$|Currently an {{abundance}} of historical manuscripts, journals, and scientific notes remain largely unaccessible in library archives. Manual transcription and publication of such documents is unlikely, and automatic transcription with high enough accuracy to support a traditional text search is difficult. In this work we describe a lexicon-free system for performing text queries on <b>off-line</b> <b>printed</b> and handwritten Arabic documents. Our segmentation-based approach utilizes gHMMs with a bigram letter transition model, and KPCA/LDA for letter discrimination. The segmentation stage is integrated with inference. We show that our method is robust to varying letter forms, ligatures, and overlaps. Additionally, we find that ignoring letters beyond the adjoining neighbors has little effect on inference and localization, {{which leads to a}} significant performance increase over standard dynamic programming. Finally, we discuss an extension to perform batch searches of large word lists for indexing purposes. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{report will}} go into depth about these and related issues. It {{will focus on the}} needs of WSRC and, in so doing, will enable the scope of the {{repository}} to be reduced somewhat. For example, one goal is to minimize the impact on present application development practices; consequentially, WSRC may not wish to provide version control as a repository service. Another goal is to maximize the self-reliance of end-users, so the repository should be very user-friendly and provide clear descriptions of the elements stored in the repository. The ability to browse the repository and to perform keyword searches should allow end-users to find what they are looking for. Once found, the descriptions within the repository will get them started. The repository will also guide them to more detailed information (e. g., in on-line help, in on-line documentation, or even in <b>off-line</b> <b>printed</b> manuals). - 5 - 1. Introductio...|$|R
40|$|The ATLAS system {{provides}} an extensive set of integrated technical computer-program modules {{for the analysis}} and design of general structural configurations, as well as capabilities that are particularly suited for the aeroelastic design of flight vehicles. The system {{is based on the}} stiffness formulation of the finite element structural analysis method and can be executed in batch and interactive computing environments on CDC 6600 /CYBER computers. Problem-definition input data are written in an engineering-oriented language using a free field format. Input-data default values, generation options, and data quality checks provided by the preprocessors minimize the amount of data and flowtime for problem definition/verfication. Postprocessors allow selected input and calculated data to be extracted, manipulated, and displayed via on-line and <b>off-line</b> <b>prints</b> or plots for monitoring and verifying problem solutions. The sequence and mode of execution of selected program modules are controlled by a common user-oriented language...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for automatic recognition of <b>off-line</b> <b>printed</b> Arabic text using Hidden Markov Models. In this work different sizes of overlapping and non-overlapping hierarchical windows {{are used to}} generate 16 features from each vertical sliding strip. Eight different Arabic fonts were used for testing (viz. Arial, Tahoma, Akhbar, Thuluth, Naskh, Simplified Arabic, Andalus, and Traditional Arabic). It was experimentally proven that different fonts have their highest recognition rates at different numbers of states (5 or 7) and codebook sizes (128 or 256). Arabic text is cursive, and each character may have up to 4 different shapes based on its location in a word. This research work considered each shape as a different class {{resulting in a total}} of 126 classes (compared to 28 Arabic letters). The achieved average recognition rates were between 98. 08 % and 99. 89 % for the eight experimental fonts. The main contributions of this work are the novel hierarchical sliding window technique using only 16 features for each sliding window, considering each shape of Arabic characters as a separate class, bypassing the need for segmenting Arabic text, and its applicability to othe...|$|R
40|$|In the {{newspaper}} printing industry, offset is the dominating printing method {{and the use}} of multicolour printing has increased rapidly in newspapers during the last decade. The offset printing process relies on the assumption that an uniform film of ink of right thickness is transferred onto the printing areas. The quality of reproduction of colour images in offset printing is dependent on a number of parameters in a chain of steps and in the end it is the amount and the distribution of ink deposited on the substrate that create the sensation and thus the perceived colours. We identify three control points in the offset printing process and present methods for assessing the printing process quality in two of these points: • Methods for determining if the printing plates carry the correct image • Methods for determining the amount of ink deposited onto the newsprint A new concept of colour impression is introduced as a measure of the amount of ink deposited on the newsprint. Two factors contribute to values of the colour impression, the halftone dot-size and ink density. Colour impression values are determined on gray-bars using a CCD-camera based system. Colour impression values can also be determined in an area containing an arbitrary combination of cyan magenta and yellow inks. The correct amount of ink is known either from a reference print or from prepress information. Thus, the deviation of the amount of ink can be determined that can be used as control value by a press operator or as input to a control system. How a closed loop controller can be designed based on the colour impression values is also shown. It is demonstrated that the methods developed can be used for <b>off-line</b> <b>print</b> quality monitoring and ink feed control, or preferably in an online system in a newspaper printing press.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Character {{segmentation}} is {{a crucial}} step in most Arabic optical text recognition systems. The recognition process depends mainly on {{the accuracy of the}} character segmentation. This paper presents a novel adaptive algorithm for the <b>off-line</b> segmentation of <b>printed</b> Arabic text. There are many challenging features in the Arabic writing, for example, it is cursive and characters in a word can take four different shapes. A general rule cannot apply for segmenting all the characters. Hence, we propose an adaptive rule-based segmentation algorithm based on the general structural relationship of the Arabic text. The main rule used is that “most characters start with and end before a T-junction on the baseline. ” Some other rules are included {{to take care of the}} variations in the main rule. Results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, where it is found to achieve a segmentation accuracy of 96. 5 %. 1...|$|R
