5|$|A further {{testament}} to this devotion included Hasan-Jalal's commissioning of the Gandzasar Monastery. Construction {{of the monastery}} began in 1216 and lasted until 1238. On July 22, 1240, amid great celebration during Vardavar celebrations and {{in the presence of}} nearly 700 priests including Nerses, the Catholicos of Albania, the church was consecrated. The monastery {{went on to become the}} residence and sepulcher of the family as well as the house of the catholicos; beginning in the 15th century, the family also monopolized control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of Catholicos itself, which would from thereon in pass down from uncle to nephew. Hasan-Jalal's son John VII is considered to be the first to have established this practice when he became the Catholicos whereas his nephew, also named John, became the second.|$|E
25|$|Cowen {{was elected}} to Dáil Éireann in the Laois–Offaly {{by-election}} of 1984, caused {{by the death of}} his father. At the time Cowen, at the age of 24, became the youngest member of the 24th Dáil. He was also elected to Offaly County Council in the same year, taking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> vacated by his late father. He served on that authority until 1992.|$|E

When he resigned on health grounds, Kerina took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> from him and was elected Deputy Speaker of the house. After the Independence of Namibia in 1990 he also took FCN's {{seat in the}} 1st National Assembly of Namibia but resigned that same year.|$|E

25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the {{cushioned}} ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist {{for male and female}} cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.|$|E
2500|$|The October 25, 1980 {{edition of}} the German paper Bild {{reported}} that Haley had a brain tumor. It quoted British manager Patrick Malynn as saying that Haley [...] "had taken a fit and went <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> He didn't recognize anyone any more" [...] after being taken {{to his home in}} Beverly Hills. It also reported that a doctor at the clinic where Haley had been taken said, 'The tumor can't be operated on any more.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, {{as in the}} {{presentation}} miniature Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good by Rogier van der Weyden, the cloth continues <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> {{and then to the}} floor. [...] In the summer of 1520, a meeting was staged between Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, where the ostentatious display of wealth and power earned the meeting-place the name of The Field of Cloth of Gold. The canopy of estate may still be seen in most formal throne rooms.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of Taiwan {{has been a}} key political issue for the People's Republic of China (PRC). In 1971, the support of African nations was crucial in the PRC joining the United Nations (UN), taking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the ROC on Taiwan. However, while many African countries such as Algeria, Egypt and Zambia have stressed their support to [...] "one-China policy", Swaziland and Burkina Faso are maintaining relations with Taipei. [...] For the quest of a permanent UN seat for Africa, Nigeria, the largest African country, relies on Chinese support while Egypt looks to U.S. backing.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{modified}} RB-57As {{were used by}} the 7499th Support Group at Wiesbaden AB, West Germany in Operation [...] "Heart Throb" [...] reconnaissance missions over Europe. [...] Ten aircraft were pulled off Martin's production line and modifications were performed in August 1955 by the Wright Air Development Center and by Martin. [...] All equipment not absolutely essential for the daytime photography role was eliminated. The bomb bay door was removed and the area was skinned <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> for the system operator/navigator was removed, and an optical viewfinder was installed in the nose so that the pilot could perform all the reconnaissance duties without {{the assistance of the}} navigator. The clear plexiglass nose cone was replaced by an opaque fiberglass cone, but with a small optical glass window cut for the viewfinder. The plane's J65-BW-5s were replaced by higher-thrust J65-W-7s. The aircraft was referred to as RB-57A-1. The weight reduction program shaved 5665 pounds off the weight of the RB-57A, and the ceiling was increased by 5000 feet.|$|E
2500|$|John Keate, Head Master from 1809 to 1834, {{took over}} {{at a time when}} {{discipline}} was poor. Anthony Chenevix-Trench, Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with caning, also applied to the bare buttocks, which he administered privately in his office. Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane miscreants <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see Eton Society below) {{in the form of a}} [...] "Pop-Tanning", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.|$|E

5000|$|At Pentecost in 1063, the Goslar Precedence Dispute {{led to a}} bloodbath in the cathedral, {{which was}} {{witnessed}} by the young Henry IV.

2500|$|A costly canopy {{has been}} erected <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the exilarch. Then {{the leader in}} prayer steps {{in front of the}} {{platform}} and, in a low voice audible only to those close by, and accompanied by the 'Amen' of the choir, addresses the exilarch with a benediction, prepared long beforehand. Then the exilarch delivers a sermon on the text of the week or commissions the gaon of Sura to do so. After the discourse the leader in prayer recites the kaddish, and when he reaches the words 'during your life and in your days,' he adds the words 'and during the life of our prince, the exilarch.' After the kaddish he blesses the exilarch, the two heads of the schools, and the several provinces that contribute to the support of the academies, as well as the individuals who have been of especial service in this direction. Then the Torah is read. When the 'Kohen' and 'Levi' have finished reading, the leader in prayer carries the Torah roll to the exilarch, the whole congregation rising; the exilarch takes the roll in his hands and reads from it while standing. The two heads of the schools also rise, and the gaon of Sura recites the targum to the passage read by the exilarch. When the reading of the Torah is completed, a blessing is pronounced upon the exilarch. After the 'Musaf' prayer the exilarch leaves the synagogue, and all, singing, accompany him to his house. After that the exilarch rarely goes beyond the gate of his house, where services for the community are held on the Sabbaths and feastdays. When it becomes necessary for him to leave his house, he does so only in a carriage of state, accompanied by a large retinue. If the exilarch desires to pay his respects to the king, he first asks permission to do so. As he enters the palace the king's servants hasten to meet him, among whom he liberally distributes gold coin, for which provision has been made beforehand. When led before the king his seat is assigned to him. The king then asks what he desires. He begins with carefully prepared words of praise and blessing, reminds the king of the customs of his fathers, gains the favor of the king with appropriate words, and receives written consent to his demands; thereupon, rejoiced, he takes leave of the king." ...|$|E

50|$|Because {{the climate}} of Manaus is {{extremely}} warm because of its location near the equator, the stadium was designed to minimize the temperatures inside the structure with features such as a white, reflective exterior, plentiful shade <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> areas, and {{a large amount of}} ventilation openings in the façade of the building.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the station}} {{underwent}} renovations, the walls {{on the platform}} where covered in an orange-brown glazed tile pattern that still covers some of the walls in the access areas.

50|$|Artificial turf {{was placed}} in Burgess-Snow Field {{in time for the}} 2005 Football season. The turf is the same used by many colleges, high schools and pro teams (ProGrass).

5000|$|Similar roof panels {{were used}} on General Motors {{products}} of the time. The concept of a single, fixed window <b>over</b> <b>the</b> front <b>seat</b> reappeared in <b>the</b> late 1970s on Lincoln's full-size Continental models (through 1979), and later, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>seat</b> of General Motors' 1991 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser and Buick Roadmaster wagons.
