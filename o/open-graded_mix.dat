The low population (6 million) compared to the large area of the country (2, 253, 300 km², 900, 000 mi²) coupled with the high cost of crushed aggregate makes maintenance and road building costs very high. Local emulsified asphalt economics, plants, and uses were investigated in this study. Emulsified asphalt proved to be attractive when used for local road maintenance and road bases and low volume road construction, especially when used with dune sand and marl. Emulsified asphalts were evaluated for use with dune sand and marl and at two portland cement contents. Three types of emulsified asphalts were used which included locally produced, laboratory prepared, and Chevron U. S. A. emulsions. Emulsion treated mixes were tested for tensile strength, Poisson's ratio, resilient modulus, fatigue life, and rutting characteristics. Both diametral and beam fatigue tests were used and tests were conducted at 10 °, 25 °, 40 °, and 55 °C (50 °, 77 °, 104 ° and 131 °F). The <b>open-graded</b> <b>mix</b> was tested for fatigue characteristics using beam flexure with a confining membrane. Finite element methods were used to calculate beam bending moduli and the results were compared to beam equation results. These results together with local field experience were used to develop design charts for use of emulsions. The results indicated that emulsified asphalts can be produced locally at relatively low cost. It also indicated that emulsified asphalts have a high potential for stabilizing local sands and marginal aggregates at low cost, especially for low volume roads and road base construction. Stabilized materials provided satisfactory fatigue and rutting results. They can be utilized to produce satisfactory, reasonable, economical road sections...|$|E

The research has been carried out as part of Partnered Pavement Research Center Strategic Plan Element 4. 19 (PPRC SPE 4. 19). In the study documented in this report, field data regarding tire/pavement noise, surface condition, ride quality, and macrotexture were collected over three consecutive years from pavements in California placed with open-graded and other asphaltic mixes. The three-year data were analyzed to evaluate the durability and effectiveness of <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixes</b> in reducing noise compared to other asphalt surfaces, including dense- and gap-graded mixes, and to evaluate the pavement characteristics that affect tire/pavement noise. The analysis in this report is a supplement and update to a previous study on {{the first two years of}} data collected, which is detailed in a separate report prepared as part of PPRC SPE 4. 16, the previous phase of the Quieter Pavement Research Program. Conclusions are made regarding the performance of <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixes</b> and rubberized mixes (RAC-G), comparisons are made with dense-graded mixes (DGAC); and the effects of variables affecting tire/pavement noise are examined.

40|$|The central {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to support the Caltrans Quiet Pavement Pilot Program. The research conforms with FHWA guidance provided to State DOTs that conduct tire/pavement noise research. The broader {{purpose of this}} research is to support the Caltrans Quieter Pavements Road Map and Work Plan, with goals and objectives that address quiet as well as permeable asphalt surfaces for pavements. Results from this research will identify best practice for selecting asphaltic surfaces based on performance trends identified from field measurements for noise, permeability, friction and durability. Results will include a literature survey and creation of a database of California materials, designs, and specifications plus similar information from other states and Europe to identify potentially better mixes. Results also will determine whether there is a correlation between laboratory sound absorption as measured by impedance tube and field noise intensity, which could provide a tool for evaluating mixes for noise properties as part of mix design. Activities within the scope of this research focus on goals and objectives approved by the Caltrans Pavement Standards Team: * Develop a database for lifetime performance trends to identify best practice for California open-graded and rubberized mixes. * Summarize information on laboratory tests that correlate with pavement performance from the stand point of noise and permeability, and gather information on mix design methods, identifying best practices that can potentially be brought to California. * Survey practice and research in other states and Europe on the lifetime performance of their <b>open-graded</b> <b>mix</b> types with respect to sound intensity, durability, friction, and permeability. Gather and summarize their results, identifying promising mixes. * Determine whether a relationship exists between a laboratory noise absorption test, the impedance tube, and field sound intensity measurements. Potential future phases of work include conducting new laboratory tests on California mixes and those from other states and Europe for further consideration by Caltrans, and continued long-term monitoring of field sections after the two years approved in this work plan. These future phases will be reviewed by Caltrans at a later date for decisions on whether to proceed. Deliverables for each research objective are described in the Work Plan. The literature survey by the Partnered Pavement Research Center (PPRC) will include new information from European laboratories and will summarize {{the state of the art}} on quiet and permeable pavements. PPRC will become capable of performing tests for much-needed field measurement of sound and surface friction as well as laboratory noise impedance testing. The bulk of project effort will be spent on field data collection that will include eight Caltrans Environmental noise monitoring locations plus approximately 66 mainline highway sites with various open-graded mixes, rubberized mixes, Oregon F mix, and dense-graded asphalt concrete (as a control). These sections will represent different ages, traffic, and climate. Types of data, test methods, and frequency of testing are described in this Work Plan, and PPRC will coordinate with Caltrans Environmental to ensure compatibility of sound intensity data collection. Trend analysis will relate mix performance to variables such as age, traffic, and climate, and will correlate sound measurement techniques. Project costs and schedule are presented in this Work Plan. The total project cost is approximately $ 855, 000. Nearly 40 percent of this cost is for traffic closures ($ 324, 000) and 20 percent ($ 174, 900) is for equipment. A key risk in this cost estimate is that PPRC does not have funds for required traffic closures and for some equipment. The project schedule spans a maximum of two years, with data collection after the second year needing to be addressed in a follow-on project. Decision points are included in the schedule so Caltrans annually can decide, after reviewing each year's data, if further testing is warranted. The data collection schedule heavily depends on traffic closures, and might double if District Maintenance crews are unable to support this research effort or funds are not available for contracted traffic closures. The selection of pavement sections with open-graded and rubberized (RAC-G) surfacings also needs to be developed in cooperation with Caltrans Maintenance, who will provide lists of potential sites. Collecting data for DGAC sections is dependent on the PPE 2 contractor (Stantec) schedule, so delays in their progress and contract might affect this project schedule. Delays in having the PPRC contract amendment in place by 1 July 2005 also will delay this project. UCPRC-WP- 2005 - 01, Civil Engineering...|$|E
40|$|Good skid {{resistance}} of a pavement surface {{is essential for}} road safety. Loss of {{skid resistance}} can lead to property damage and loss of lives. Ever increasing need of driver safety poses challenges to the highway authorities to evaluate pavement conditions even more precisely under different conditions. Environmental variables like temperature, water, snow etc. can {{have a significant effect}} on the skid resistance apart from the vehicle and pavement related factors. The temperature increase in the tire-pavement contact region results in a complex relationship between the temperature and the friction and constitutes one of the main sources of uncertainty in interpreting the data of continuous field measurements. Likewise, very low friction coefficients can be observed between the tire and pavement surface under wet conditions. Nevertheless, the phenomena have not been adequately quantified yet within the skid resistance evaluation engineering community. The road agencies use correlation factors to estimate frictional characteristics of the road. These correlation factors are based on the experience and field test measurements which have a very limited scope in terms of reliability and transferability. It is the aim of this research is to study the effect of temperature and water on the frictional performance of the asphalt surface, when a pneumatic tire is traversing at given operating conditions. The tire operating temperature is a very important concern to the tire manufacturers, highway agencies and users due to its major influence on the traction performance of a tire. Tire rubber hysteresis is considered to play a major role in countering skidding of a vehicle travelling at high speed. Past studies showed that the contribution from the hysteresis component in comparison to adhesion has a larger influence on the friction measurements. This research aims to develop a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical model in the finite element (FE) framework to determine the progressive temperature development in a pneumatic tire rolling over a simulated asphalt pavement surface mesh and its eventual effect on the hysteretic friction. This research also studies the hysteretic frictional behavior of a test tire under different surrounding temperature conditions. In this methodology, first, the tire is tested under static loading conditions to obtain its overall deformation characteristics and in particular the relation tire load - inflation pressure – foot print. In the second step, rubber material tests are performed to determine the rheological characteristics of the tire tread rubber. The test results are used for the determination of rheological parameters of a tire rubber material in the form of Prony’s coefficients. The Prony’s coefficients are later utilized in the development of a 3 D FE test tire. In the third step, the tire is modelled in the FE framework, accounting for the different components of a tire like tread, side wall, carcass, belts, plies, inner liner, rim etc. The FE simulation results corresponding to the footprint and the deformation are compared with the measurements of static load deflection tests. The FE mesh of a given asphalt pavement surface is developed based on scanned asphalt surface data obtained by a Laser Profilometer and an X-ray tomographer. A dynamic analysis of a tire rolling at a definite slip ratio over a simulated asphalt pavement surface is performed. The results obtained from this analysis are used in the subsequent energy dissipation analysis to determine the heat fluxes. These heat fluxes are the input of a heat transfer analysis to determine the temperature development in the body of a tire. Many past experimental studies showed that the tire-pavement friction values are related to the tire surrounding conditions such as pavement temperature, ambient temperature, contained air temperature and surface characteristic of pavement. Therefore, in this research, the effect of pavement temperature, ambient temperature and contained air temperature on friction measurements is studied. By using the developed FE model, practical test conditions of fully and partially skidding tires traversing over different asphalt pavement surfaces, namely, Porous Asphalt, Ultra-Thin Surface and Stone Mastic Asphalt and AC- 10 are analysed. Emphasis is placed on the determination of tire tread temperature as a critical combination of pavement temperature and ambient temperature. An attempt has also been made to determine the time required for different regions of a rolling tire to reach an effective temperature equilibrated state. Such kind of analysis gives insight into the effect of thermal behaviour of different components of tire on the tire hysteresis which eventually decides its frictional performance. This research also deals with the cornering frictional behaviour of a pneumatic tire. By utilizing the developed FE model, the cornering friction was computed for inflation pressure, wheel load, vehicle speed, side-slip angle, surface texture and mix design. Good pavement macrotexture has a direct influence on the vehicle safety during wet weather conditions by improving its traction/braking ability. Apart from the macrotexture, there are several factors that affect the wet friction, such as, environmental, tire and pavement related characteristics. In recent years, development of powerful finite element tools made it possible to simulate complex wet tire-pavement interaction as close as possible to the actual field conditions. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, none of the past analytical/numerical studies were able to include the asphalt pavement surface texture in their analysis. In the next part of this thesis, the loss of friction under wet/flooded pavement conditions is studied. This research presents an FE approach to study the effect of surface morphology of asphalt pavements on the wet friction coefficient. The wet friction performance of different asphalt surface morphologies of <b>open-graded</b> <b>mix</b> to close-graded mix are studied by using the developed FE model. The tire-wet asphalt surface interaction FE model is duly calibrated with the field investigations conducted by using the state-of-art field equipment. The extreme loss of wet friction which ultimately leads to risk of hydroplaning is also studied. The FE simulations are performed on different water film thicknesses, tread pattern and different tire slip ratios and yaw angles. The results from the current study can be used as safety indicators of in-service asphalt pavements under wet/flooded conditions. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) {{has used}} crumb rubber from ground tires {{since the late}} 1960 's to {{primarily}} reduce reflective cracking. In 1988, ADOT started to use crumb rubber mixed with hot asphalt, {{commonly referred to as}} asphalt rubber (AR) as a binder in hot mix asphalt (HMA). Typically, these <b>mixes</b> are either <b>open-graded</b> or gap-graded and from half inch to one inch or one inch to two inches in thickness, respectively. <b>Open-graded</b> <b>mixes</b> generally contain 9 to 10 percent AR binder, whereas the gap-graded contains generally 7. 5 to 8. 5 percent AR binder. To date, field performance has been very good. As an extra benefit, the ground tire rubber from over five and one half million tires in Arizona has been recycled since 1988, in the making of HMA with AR. OGFC Meets CRM History of OGFC in Arizona The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) began to use Open Graded Friction Courses (OGFC) as early as 1954 (1). The primary reason for using this material was to provide a surface with good skid resistance, good rideability and appearance. Over the years the gradation has changed slightly (Illustration 1). In particular, more emphasis has been placed on the use of a single size aggregate. Also, the passing # 8 sieve material has been consistently reduced to a value of about 15 %. OGFC's typically have been placed one half inch in thickness with 5. 5 % to 6. 5 % asphalt (AC- 20 /PG 64 - 16) binder.

40|$|The {{infiltration}} of water causes lots of {{adverse effects on}} flexible pavement and reduces its performance. Moisture related damage in asphalt pavements, that consists {{in the loss of}} strength and durability caused by the presence of water, is global concern. This kind of damage is induced by the loss of bond between aggregate and binder surface and loss of bond within the binder itself. These two modes of failure occur in asphalt pavements as stripping, ravelling, cracking and even permanent deformation. To prevent these problems and to control the conditions of the mix, one of the primary requirements for a flexible pavements, since the advent of asphalt paving technology, is that hot mix asphalt are impermeable. By minimizing moisture infiltration, adequate support from the underlying unbound materials is obtained. In 1993, Superior Performing Asphalt Pavement was introduced as a part of Strategic Highway Research Program. With the adopting of Superpave <b>mix</b> design system, <b>open-graded</b> pavements have been produced with coarser gradation. This application of novel material limited distresses, however other issues related to higher permeability values have to be considered. The traditional approach used to evaluate the expected drainage capability of open-graded pavement is controversial. It is based on laboratory tests using hydraulic permeameters or measures on the field, and it is unable to estimate correctly the permeability due to many approximations in measurement and to the wide variety of variables that influence the hydraulic behavior of asphalt pavement. It often happens that the mixture is designed adopting an overestimated value for hydraulic conductivity. It increases the susceptibility to moisture induced damage in the asphalt pavement, promoting the oxidation of asphalt, and it produces many disadvantages and problems from an economic and environmental point of view. Mix design has consequently to be approached as an optimization problem. In order to solve this problem in the last decades several researchers have attempted to calculate permeability of porous media through analytical model, by defining empirical formulas derived from 4 experimental experiences. These formulas are not able to define exactly and univocally the infiltration process, causing uncertainty and approximation of prediction. Recently, in order to investigate fluid flow in <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixes,</b> some studies, based on numerical hydrodynamic simulations at the micro-structural levels, have been carried out. These models require the knowledge of the internal microstructure, that produce expensive and onerous experimental procedures. In this thesis a novel simulation approach is proposed, based on different numerical algorithms, in order to predict the properties of an open-graded asphalt pavement during its service life. This novel approach reduce computational complexity of the numerical models and increase the reliability of empirical methods. The simulation model allow to investigate three main characteristics of open-graded pavement, namely: i) physical characteristics, through generation of the physical microstructure of the mixture from the design inputs using RSA algorithm; ii) hydraulic properties, by the simulation of flow of water within the numerical sample, based on the Lattice– Boltzmann method; iii) acoustic performance, by {{the creation of a new}} experimentation and by the definition of additional variables. The results of the new procedures, validated through experimental data and analytical prediction, are encouraging in order to support and to optimize the design of the <b>open-graded</b> asphalt <b>mixes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} conducted with the purposeof determining {{the applicability of the}} Hveem Stabilometer to the testing of open-graded bituminous mixtures. The study was divided into two major sections. The first of these investigated the validity of the Stabilometer displacement measurement when applied to open-graded specimens having large surface air voids. The second portion of the study had two specific purposes: (l) to investigate the stress-strain characteristics of open-graded mixturestested in the Hveem Stabilometer and (2) to determine whether surface voids on the ends of Stabilometer test specimens influenced Hveem stability values. To check the validity of the displacement measurement, Stabilometertests were, conducted over a wide range of displacement values forduplicate specimens molded from three different mixtures. Displacement readings were varied by altering the surfaces of test specimens andby adjusting the quantity of air inside the Stabilometer oil chamber. In studying the stress-strain characteristics of <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixes,</b> Stabilometer values and specimen deformation readings were obtained for two mixtures. The first of these open-type mixes was well-graded, but the second was essentially 2 ̆ 2 one-sized 2 ̆ 2 in gradation. Results of this investigation showed that the final displacement value, when substituted into the Hveem stability equation, did notcompensate for the variations in lateral pressure caused by large changes(one or more turns) in the final displacement measurement. Stress-strain relationships for the well-graded, open-type mixture indicated that the quantity of strain permitted a Stabilometer test specimen conformed closely with the amount of strain developed at the maximum shearing strength of a rational triaxial test specimen subjected to confining pressures similar to those present in a Stabilometer test. Strain measurements recorded for Stabilometer specimens of the one-sized mixture used in this study were much lower than those obtained at the peak value of shearing resistance for triaxial test specimens ofthe same mixture and for similar confining pressures. Surface air voids on the ends of Stabilometer test specimens hada small effect on test results. When these voids were filled, Hveem stability values were not significantly higher, but the reproducibility of test results was greatly improved by coating test specimens. To improve the consistency of Stabilometer test results obtainedfrom open-graded mixtures, certain modifications in the testing technique were suggested. These changes involved the filling of air voids on thesurface of test specimens and the admittance of an increased amount of air in the Stabilometer oil chamber during the calibration of the testing apparatu...|$|R
40|$|Permeability of <b>open-graded</b> asphalt <b>mixes</b> {{is defined}} as the ability to {{transmit}} fluids through the voids. The infiltration of water affects the durability and safety of pavement systems. Traditionally, an empirical approach, based on laboratory tests or on field measurements, is used to evaluate hydraulic permeability. In general, such an approach allows the ex post calculation of the drainage capability of the open-graded pavement. In order to evaluate the hydraulic permeability during the phase of mix design, in this paper a novel method is proposed, based on simulation of unsteady flow of water through open-graded mixture. In particular, a real sample of asphalt mix is simulated {{in the shape of a}} Marshall test sample. It is composed of a set of particles, selected according to the real grading, positioned in the space domain following the random sequence adsorption approach (RSA) and covered by a film of bitumen. The flow of water through the synthetical sample is simulated through the lattice Boltzmann method. In this method, the particles of water propagate and collide while moving on a lattice, obtained by discretizing the physical space. This lattice is formed by equidistant nodes, where each node corresponds to a void or to a solid. The velocity of the particles depends on a set of microscopic velocity vectors. Simulation results allow prediction of the permeability of open-graded pavement through a theoretical calculation based on the Kozeny-Carman equation.
