5|$|As {{the first}} half of the period is largely prehistoric, {{archaeology}} plays an important part in studies of early Medieval Scotland. There are no significant contemporary internal sources for the Picts, although evidence has been gleaned from lists of kings, annals preserved in Wales and Ireland and from sources written down much later, which may draw on oral traditions or earlier sources. From the 7th century there is documentary evidence from Latin sources including the lives of saints, such as Adomnán's Life of St. Columba, and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. Archaeological sources include settlements, art, and surviving everyday objects. Other aids to understanding in this period include <b>onomastics</b> (the study of names) – divided into toponymy (place-names), showing the movement of languages, and the sequence in which different languages were spoken in an area, and anthroponymy (personal names), which can offer clues to relationships and origins.|$|E

25|$|Scanian once possessed many unique words {{which do}} not exist in either Swedish or Danish. In {{attempts}} to preserve the unique aspects of Scanian, these words have been recorded and documented by the Institute for Dialectology, <b>Onomastics</b> and Folklore Research in Sweden. Preservation is also accomplished through comparative studies such as the Scanian-Swedish-Danish dictionary project, commissioned by the Scanian Academy. This project is led by Helmer Lång and involves a group of scholars from different fields, including Birger Bergh, linguistics, Inger Elkjær and Inge Lise Pedersen, researcher of Danish dialects. Several Scanian dictionaries have been published through the years, including one by Sten Bertil Vide, who wrote his doctoral thesis on the names of plants in South Swedish dialects.

25|$|In {{response}} to the recent flurry of activity on the subject, Ian Mladjov reevaluated the question and presented a completely novel solution. He dismissed each of the prior theories in turn as insufficiently grounded and incompatible given the historical record, and further argued {{that many of the}} proposed solutions would have meant that later documented marriages would have fallen within the prohibited degree of kinship, yet there is no record the issue of consanguinity was ever raised with regard to these marriages. He argued that the documentary testimony of Agatha's origins is tainted or late, and concurred with Humphreys' evaluation that the names of the children and grandchildren of Agatha, so central to prior reevaluations, may have had non-family origins (for example, Pope Alexander II, having {{played a critical role in}} the marriage of Malcolm and Margaret, may have inspired their use of that name). However, he then focused in on the name of Agatha as being critical to determining her origin. He concluded that of the few contemporaries named Agatha, only Agatha Chryselia, the wife of Samuel of Bulgaria could possibly have been an ancestor of Edward the Exile's spouse. Some of the other names associated with Agatha and used to corroborate theories based in <b>onomastics</b> were present within the Bulgarian ruling family at the time, including Mary and several Davids. Mladjov inferred that Agatha was granddaughter of Agatha Cryselia, daughter of Gavril Radomir, Tsar of Bulgaria by his short-lived first marriage to a Hungarian princess thought to have been the daughter of Duke Géza of Hungary. This hypothesis has Agatha born in Hungary after her parents divorced, her mother being pregnant when she left Bulgaria, yet would entail her mother naming her after the mother of the Bulgarian prince who had just rejected her. Traditional dates of this divorce would seem to preclude the suggested relationship, but the article re-examined some long-standing assumptions about the chronology of Gavril Radomir's marriage to the Hungarian princess, and concludes that its dating to the late 980s is unsupportable, and that its dissolution belongs in c. 1009-1014. The argument is based almost exclusively on the onomastic precedent but is said to vindicate the intimate connection between Agatha and Hungary attested in the Medieval sources. Mladjov speculates further that the medieval testimony could largely be harmonized were one to posit that Agatha's mother was the same Hungarian princess who married Samuel Aba of Hungary, his family fleeing to Kiev after his downfall, thereby allowing a Russian marriage for Agatha.|$|E
500|$|In {{parallel}} to that official cult were the more private cults of pious individuals venerating Nyuserre {{as a kind}} of [...] "saint", an intercessor between the believers and the gods. This popular cult, which developed spontaneously, perhaps because of the proximity of Nyuserre's pyramid to Memphis, referred to Nyuserre using his birth name Iny, and likely consisted of invocations and offerings to statues of the king or in his mortuary temple. Therefore, archaeological traces of this cult are difficult to discern, yet Nyuserre's special status is manifest in some religious formulae, where his name is invoked, {{as well as in the}} <b>onomastics</b> of individuals, notably during the Middle Kingdom, whose names included [...] "Iny", such as Inhotep, Inemsaf, Inankhu and many more. Although the veneration of Nyuserre was originally a local phenomenon from Abusir, Saqqara and their surroundings, it may have ultimately reached even outside of Egypt proper, in Sinai, Byblos and Nubia, where fragments of statues, vessels and stelae bearing Nyuserre's name have been discovered in cultic contexts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} proper names {{is known as}} <b>onomastics,</b> which has a wide-ranging scope {{encompassing}} all names, all languages, all geographical and cultural regions.

2500|$|Finally, Dacoromania {{appeared}} from 1921 to 1948, in eleven enormous volumes totaling some 9,000 pages.

Each edition included a bibliography that systematically recorded writings on linguistics, philology, folklore, ethnography and literature, connected to Romanian language, culture and literature, both domestically and abroad. Three generations of scholars worked on the magazine, with most articles presented at weekly meetings.

2500|$|Even though erudites and {{scholars}} {{have been trying}} to ascertain the location of the ancient towns of Latium for at least the last four centuries (see Cluvier), and despite the recent progress made by archaeology in the field of the human settlement of ancient Latium, only a few towns of archaic Latium cited by ancient sources have been identified with certainty, whereas a remarkable number of settlements that have been unearthed remain unidentified. This is {{due to the lack of}} epigraphic confirmation, due to the rare use of writing in archaic times. The problem is made even more difficult because some of the ancient locations were possibly resettled during the early Middle Ages, as was probably the case for Labicum and Collatia. A good instance of such a custom is provided by Falerii outside Latium Vetus. [...] Towns which have been identified archaeologically include Satricum, Politorium, Ficana, Tellenae, Crustumerium, Corniculum, Antemnae, Collatia, Fidenae, Pedum, Apiolae, Gabii and perhaps Querquetulum.

2500|$|The Roman {{historian}} Livy, {{writing in}} c. AD 10, appears {{to imply that}} the Bastarnae were of Celtic speech. Relating the Bastarnic invasion of the Balkans of 179 BC (see Conflict with Rome below), he describes them then as [...] "similar in language and customs" [...] to the Scordisci, a tribe of Pannonia, whose <b>onomastics</b> and material culture have been identified as Celtic by several scholars. The Scordisci are described as Celtic by Strabo (although he adds that they had mingled with Illyrians and Thracians). However, a Celtic identity for the Bastarnae is apparently contradicted by Polybius (writing ca. 150 BC), who was an actual contemporary of the events described, unlike Livy, who was writing some 200 years later. Polybius clearly distinguishes the Bastarnae from the [...] "Galatae" [...] (i.e. Celts): [...] "an embassy from the Dardani arrived , talking of the Bastarnae, their huge numbers, the strength and valour of their warriors, and also reporting that Perseus [...] and the Galatae were in league with this tribe". In addition, inscription AE (1905) 14, recording a campaign on the Hungarian Plain by the Augustan-era general Marcus Vinucius (10 BC or 8 BC), also appears to distinguish the Bastarnae from neighbouring Celtic tribes: [...] "Marcus Vinucius... governor of Illyricum, the first [...] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi,... and Anartii {{to the power of the}} emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome." ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to explain the {{specificity}} of idioms with proper nouns (<b>onomastic</b> idioms), to give {{an overview of the}} most common Russian <b>onomastic</b> idioms, to explain their orig in and to compare their usage with <b>onomastic</b> idioms in Czech. Proper nouns are specific lexical units which name unique denotate. Unlike common nouns they do not have any generaI meaning. However, during the development of a language some proper nouns can undergo the process of the so-called appelativization - to tum into a common noun and get the meaning. Such proper nouns occur in most of idioms. In some less frequent cases a proper noun can become a part of an idiom thanks to its rhythmical similarity to other idiom components or due to its accidental or genetic relativity to common nouns. In both languages <b>onomastic</b> idioms represent a specific and important part of the idiomatic system. Proper nouns contained in idioms can be both of domestic and foreign origin. The domestic Russian and Czech <b>onomastic</b> idioms can be divided into two groups based on the way they reflect the national specificity. The Hrst group consists of idioms reflecting extralinguistic factors such as domestic folklore, history and literature. The second group includes idioms reflecting national specificity caused by linguistic factors - idioms with [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{priority}} of our dictionary of anoikonyms (the term used in traditional Slavic <b>onomastic</b> science; in different <b>onomastic</b> schools minor place names, field names, Flurnamen, microtoponyms, etc.) {{lies in the}} unique material (collected mainly through a correspondence survey and covering 96 % of the territory under investigation), and in the theoretical and methodological conception that represents the Czech <b>onomastic</b> school (V.

The <b>onomastic</b> interpretation of an anoikonym {{is not limited to}} etymology or word-formation; the Dictionary aims to reveal the variability of anoikonyms together with their geographical differentiation, their structure, their relation to the object as well as the motivational aspect of the naming process. In this way, it represents a new type of anoikonymic (microtoponymic) dictionary which is dominated by linguistic interpretation of the material comprising a great number of dialect forms. Many lexical units that cross the Czech border to Poland and Slovakia give the Dictionary an interslavic, Central-European character; registration of numerous lexical units of German origin, in contrast, emphasizes the multi-lingual connection with the German neighbourhood. The theoretical and methodological approach is illustrated by examples. The treatment of Moravian and Silesian anoikonyms may become a methodological basis for the anoikonymy (microtoponymy) in the Slavic <b>Onomastic</b> Atlas.
