The results show that the effect of oxidative stress resulting from the uptake of chlorites with drinking water is not additive to the effect due to G 6 PD deficiency. The observed change in haematological parameters, including those related to the G 6 PD polymorphism, is always within the normal range.

Toxic effects, including teratogenicity, carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity, have been observed for some BFR congeners, in particular the brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs). This concise review focuses on the potency of BFRs and to disrupt endocrine systems, and attempts to answer the question whether or not BFRs are endocrine disruptors. Evidence is provided on the disruption of the thyroid hormone system by BFRs, with particular emphasis on the BDEs, as most recent data is available on this class of flame retardants. Similar to the hydroxylated PCBs, in vitro mechanistic studies as well as animal experiments have demonstrated the effects of BDEs on thyroid hormone transport and metabolism. An overview of possible effects of BFRs on the estrogen system is also provided.

In a second step, the performance of this analytical method was evaluated to determine POPs in Arctic cores collected during an oceanographic campaign.

OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed {{to determine whether the}} combined effect of environmental estrogens measured as total effective xenoestrogen burden (TEXB) is a risk factor for male urogenital malformations. METHODS: In a case–control study, nested in a mother–child cohort (n = 702) established at Granada University Hospital, we compared 50 newborns with diagnosis of cryptorchidism and/or hypospadias with 114 boys without malformations matched by gestational age, date of birth, and parity. Controls did not differ from the total cohort in confounding variables. TEXB and levels of 16 organochlorine pesticides were measured in placenta tissues. Characteristics of parents, pregnancy, and birth were gathered by questionnaire. We used conditional and unconditional regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: TEXB from <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> was detectable in 72 % and 54 % of case and control placentas, respectively.

We determined concentrations of twenty OHCs in livers of 23 river otters salvaged by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources from 2009 to 2011, determined sex-dependent distribution of OHCs, and compared our results to the reported concentrations of four OHCs in Illinois river otters from 1984 to 1989. Since these contaminants have been banned for over 30 years, we predicted smaller mean concentrations than those previously reported in Illinois otters. We detected eleven of twenty OHCs; PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), dieldrin, and 4, 4 ′-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) were present in the greatest mean concentrations. We report the largest mean concentration of dieldrin to date in the liver of North American river otters (mean: 174, range: 14. 4 – 534 parts per billion wet wt [ppb]). Mean PCB concentrations were significantly higher in males (mean: 851; range: 30 – 3450 ppb) than females (mean: 282; range: 40 – 850 ppb; p= 0. 04). Mean concentrations of dieldrin were greater than those detected in otters from 1984 to 1989 (mean: 90; range: 30 – 130 ppb; p< 0. 05). Our results suggest OHC exposure remains a concern.

Information about the concentrations of POPs (persistent organic pollutants) and of MeO-PBDEs (methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers) in elasmobranchs is scarce and potential toxic effects are poorly understood. The aims of the present study were therefore to investigate the occurrence of multiple POP classes (PCBs, PBDEs, DDXs, HCB, CHLs) and of MeO-PBDEs in various elasmobranch species from different trophic levels in estuarine and marine waters of the southeastern United States. Overall, levels and patterns of PCBs, PBDEs, DDXs, HCB, CHLs and of MeO-PBDEs varied according to the species, maturity stage, gender and habitat type. The lowest levels of POPs were found in Atlantic stingrays and the highest levels were found in bull sharks. As both species are respectively near the bottom and at top of the trophic web, with juvenile bull sharks frequently feeding on Atlantic stingrays, these findings further suggest a bioaccumulation and biomagnification process with trophic position. MeO-PBDEs were not detected in Atlantic stingrays, but were found in all shark species. HCB was not found in Atlantic stingrays, bonnetheads or lemon sharks, but was detected in the majority of bull sharks examined. Comparison with previous studies suggests that Atlantic stingrays may be experiencing toxic effects of PCBs and DDXs on their immune system. However, the effect of these compounds on the health of shark species remains unclear...|$|R

The approach {{is based on}} a simple extraction with hexane, followed by a SPE clean-up using silica cartridges and final measurement by GC coupled to triple quadrupole MS. Analyses were performed in both ionizations, electron impact (EI) (selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode) and negative chemical ionization (NCI) (selected ion recording (SIR) mode). Three isotopically labeled standards were added before extraction and used as surrogates: HCB- 13 C 6, lindane-D 6 and p,p′-DDE-D 8. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, LOQ and LOD and confirmation reliability, using breast tissue spiked at three concentration levels in the range 1 – 100 ng/g for OC compounds and at two levels 0. 1 and 10 ng/g for OBr compounds (0. 5 and 50 ng/g for BDE 209). The usefulness of the developed method was tested by the analysis of real human samples, giving as a result the detection of several OC and OBr compounds in different samples analyzed.

Les résultats obtenus montrent que radian du bioxyde de chlore sur racide humique Pinail à l'obscurité, conduit à des faibles abattements du carbone organique dissous (< 10 %) et de l'absorbance UV à 254 nm (de l'ordre de 30 %) et conduit à des productions potentiel es en composées organohalogénés très nettement inférieures à celles formées par chloration.

L'oxydation de l'acide humique par le bioxyde de chlore s'accompagne, par ailleurs, de la formation de chlorites (0, 65 mg/mg de CIO 2 consommé) qui peuvent ensuite être oxydés en chlorates au cours d'une post-chloration ou réduits en chlorures par un traitement au charbon actif. Enfin, les résultats obtenus font apparaître que le mécanisme d'oxydation de composés organiques parle bioxyde de chlore en présence de la lumière ainsi que les interactions entre le bioxyde de chore, les chlorites, la matière organique et le charbon actif méritent d'être plus précisément étudiés. Chlorine dioxide has drawn much recent attention {{as an alternative}} disinfectant and oxidant for drinking water to replace chlorine because of its powerful disinfecting ability and its limited capacity to produce <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds.</b> However, the use of chlorine dioxide leads to chlorite (ClO 2 -) and chlorate (ClO 3 -) as inorganic oxidation by-products which are reported to have toxic effects on humans. The reactions of ClO 2 with simple organic compounds (phenols, aliphatic and aromatic amines [...] .) produce polar compounds such as quinone, ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids while oxydation by-products of dissolved organic matter of surface waters (in particular humic substances) are largely unknown. Consequently, {{the aim of this}} work was to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the use of chlorine dioxide in drinking water treatment To this end, experiments were carried out with dilute aqueous solutions of an isolated aquatic humic acid (Pinail humic acid, PHA) and the objectives of this present study were :- To evaluate the ClO 2 demand and to determine the productions of chlorite, chlorate and of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> such as trihalomethanes (THMs), dichloroacetic and trichloroacetic acids (DCA, TCA) which are the main organohalogenated products formed by chlorination. - To show the effects of chlorine dioxide preoxidation on organic halide formation potentials (postchlorination) and on the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by activated carbon. In addition, reactions of chlorite with chlorine or with activated carbon were also examined. EXPERIMENTALPniail humic acid was dissolved in phosphate buffered ultra-pure water (pH = 7. 5). Oxidation and adsorption experiments were carried out in headspace-free bottles, at 20 ± 1 °C and in the dark. Stock solutions of chlorine dioxide (4 - 6 g l- 1) and of chlorine (6 - 10 g l- 1) were prepared in the laboratory and titrated by iodometry. Residual chlorine dioxide concentration in PHA solutions was determined by spectrophotometric measurement at 360 nm and by two colorimetric methods : the chlorophenol red and the ACVK methods. Concentrations of DOC and of total organic chlorine or halogen (TOCI, TOX) were measured using a DOHRMANN DC 80 carbon analyser and a DOHRMANN DX 20 A TOX analyser equipped with a microcoulometric cell, respectively. THMs, DCA and TCA were determined by a gas chromatograph equipped with a 63 Ni electron capture detector after extraction by pentane for the THMs, and methylation in ether phase for DCA and TCA. Inorganic chlorine species were analysed by HPLC with a UV detector (ClO 2 -) or by chromatography (Cl-, ClO 3 -). RESULTS• Oxidation of PHA by ClO 2 The results showed that PHA consumed about 2 mg of ClO 2 /mg of DOC after a reaction time of 24 hours (fig. 1) and that there is a rapid consumption of ClO 2 during the first 30 minutes of the reaction (fig. 2) Oxidation by ClO 2 had no effect on DOC concentration (DOC removal : < 10 %) and led to a significant decrease (about 30 %) of the UV-absorbance at 254 or 270 nm (fig. 1 and 2), and to productions of ClO 2 - (0, 65 mg of ClO 2 -/mg of ClO 2 consumed) which were independant of the applied oxidant dose and of the reaction time. Furthermore, after a 72 hour reaction time in the dark, chlorine dioxide ([ClO 2] 0 = 5 mg l- 1, [PHA] 0 = 5 mg l- 1, DOC = 2, 6 mg l- 1) produces very small amounts of chloroform (< 5 µg l- 1), DCA (5 µg l- 1) and TCA (5 µg l- 1) and organochlorinated compounds (TOCl : 36 µg/mg DOC) compared to chlorine oxidation (tableau 1). However, in the presence of sunlight, ClO 2 is rapidly photodecomposed (fig. 3) and the photodegradation products of ClO 2 allow bromide oxidation (fig. 11) and lead to higher productions of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> such as THMs (fig. 4). • Chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by chlorinationAs shown in figure 5, chlorine dioxide preoxidation reduces the production of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> and the chlorine demand during postchlorination. For a preoxidant dose corresponding to the ClO 2 demand of PHA, the decrease in the formation potentials of CHCl 3, DCA, TCA and TOCl was about 40 - 50 %. These results confirm the similarity of the action of chlorine dioxide and chlorine on aromatic structures which have high electron density carbons and which constitute probably the most reactive precursors of organohalogenated by-products. As far as chlorite concentration is concerned, the results showed that chlorite formed during the preoxidation step was completely oxidized to chlorate during postchlorination, under the experimental conditions used in this study (chlorine dose : 40 mg l- 1; contact time : 24 or 72 hours). Because of the reactions of chlorine eh chlorine and with residual chlorine dioxide, a small increase in the chlorine demand was observed when PHA solutions were heavily preoxidized (fig. 5). • Chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by activated carbon treatmentBatch experiments were carried out with a powdered activated carbon (PAC, granulometry : < 80 µm) which was obtained by crushing a commercial granular activated carbon (CECA 40, 12 x 40 mesh). Once equilibrium was achieved (contact time : 10 days), adsorption isotherms indicated that chlorine dioxide preoxidation increases the absorbability of DOC on activated carbon (fig; 4 tableau 2). Furthermore, chlorite in oxidized PHA solutions was reduced by PAC to chloride. The capacity of CECA 40 activated carbon for ClO 2 - reduction to Cl- was about 170 mg ClO 2 -/g of PAC (fig. 7). Other experiments showed that chlorite may react with specific surface groups on PAC to produce inorganic carbon (fig. 7) and with PHA only in the presence of PAC as shown the DOC and UV-absorbance curves in figure 8 and the increase of TOX concentration in the liquid phase in figure 9. Thus the observed increase in DOC absorbability on PAC after a chlorine dioxide preoxidation may be attributed to cheminal interactions between PAC, chlorite, residual chlorine dioxide and adsorbed organic matter and requires further study...|$|R

Inner and outer blubber layers were analysed separately. <b>Organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> were detected in all blubber samples in the decreasing order of their concentrations: p,p′-DDE>PCBs⪢HCB>PBDEs. The concentrations of all studied compounds were homogeneously distributed in the blubber layer at early fast, since the concentrations of POPs were statistically not different in {{the inner and outer}} layers. With the progression of the fast, the concentrations of PBDEs, PCBs and p,p′-DDE increased more sharply in inner blubber than in outer blubber. As a result, their levels became significantly higher in inner blubber as compared to outer blubber at late fast. The rise of pollutant concentrations in blubber might result from a less efficient mobilisation than triglycerides and/or a reuptake by adipocytes of some of the pollutants released into the circulation. The mobilisation of pollutants from blubber was higher at late fast. An increase of pollutant concentrations was observed in serum between early and late fast. Lower halogenated congeners (i. e. tetra-CBs) were present in higher proportions in serum, whereas the higher halogenated congeners (i. e. hepta-CBs) were mainly found in the inner and outer blubber layers. The transfer ratios of both PBDEs and PCBs from inner blubber to serum decreased with the number of chlorine and bromine atoms. In addition, the distribution of both types of compounds between serum and blubber was strongly influenced by their lipophilic character (log Kow values), with more lipophilic compounds being less efficiently released from blubber to serum.

The {{most common form}} of disinfection is chlorination, although ozone and UV light are also used in some plants of the world. Disinfection equipment depends on the type of disinfectant used. In developing countries, the water disinfection problem is large and complex. There are a number of appropriate methods but chlorine continues {{to be one of the}} most popular options. In Algeria, it is the only method of disinfection used. Chlorine is a very effective disinfectant, it is relatively easy to handle, the capital costs of chlorine installation are low, simple to dose, measure and control and it has a relatively good residual effect. Chlorination efficiency depends on chlorine residual, contact time, type of chemical used, location in the treatment process, and on characteristics of the water being treated. The chlorine demand involves the reaction of chlorine with compounds in water, reducing the amount of chlorine available to kill microorganisms. Chlorination of humic substances in drinking water is known to produce mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds such as trihalomethanes. Because of their chemical quality, Algerian waters could lead to complex and competitive reactions during chlorination step. The widespread detection of chloroform and other <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> contamination in the water reservoirs appear to be largely a consequence of the use of chlorination for the disinfection of drinking water.

Further studies monitoring the human contamination by POHs, the sources of exposure {{and the influence of}} these compounds on thyroid health are still needed. Therefore we determined the concentrations of 16 POHs (pentachlorophenol (PCP), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), 4 bromophenols (BPs), 3 hydroxy-polybromodiphenylethers (OH-PBDEs) and 7 hydroxy-polychlorobiphenyls (OH-PCBs)) in serum from 274 people aged from 18 to 76 years old living in Liege (Belgium) and the surrounding area. A questionnaire about their alimentary habits, life style and home environment was also administered to the volunteers. The predominant compound measured in the population was PCP (median concentration of 593. 0 pg mL− 1). 4 -OH-CB 107, 4 -OH-CB 146 and 4 -OH-CB 187 were detected in all samples and contributed for 75 % of the sum of OH-PCBs (ΣOH-PCBs). The median measured in our population for ΣOH-PCBs was 143. 7 pg mL− 1. TBBPA and 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol were detected in 31 % and 63. 8 % of the samples respectively while the detection frequency observed for the other BPs and the OH-PBDEs was close to zero. We computed multivariate regression models in order to assess the influence of demographic and lifestyle parameters on the PCP and ΣOH-PCBs contamination levels. Significant correlation was found between the PCP concentration and sex, smoker status, sea fish consumption and level of education, although the model seemed to be a poor (R 2 = 0. 14) predictor of the PCP concentration.

This often can biased groundwater flow interpretation and lead to partially erroneous flowfields or piezometric maps. This is a real problem when dealing with pollution migration, as finding pollution sources, predicting plume evolution or pollutant concentration trends and setting up corrective measures to protect water resources. This paper intends to discuss complex pollution transfer in two chalk aquifer valleys in eastern Normandy where pollutants do not seem to only follow flowlines shown on available groundwater level maps; indeed, divergent pollutant transfer also take place along fractured axes and karst developments which can often be associated to geological discontinuities, as was already highlighted through model calibration processes in the Avre river catchment. In the Commerce valley case, a rare emerging pollutant, N-nitrosomopholine, was discovered to migrate in two opposite directions from a single source point identified in the upper Valley: indeed, this pollutant was both found south and downstream in the fractured and porous aquifer, and way up north in a karst channel system used for drinking water purposes, in what was thought to be a completely different watershed. In the Iton valley case, the pollutants are volatile <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> (VOH) which are widespread in Normandy and often stem from historical industrial pollutions. Several potential VOH sources were identified in industrial areas in the valley south from contaminated drinking water wells; yet the groundwater flow map suggest an eastern origin for the pollution source [...] .

40|$|At the {{sampling}} site at the Teltow Canal (Berlin) a longstanding pollution with DDT (1, 1, 1 -Trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(chlorophenyl) ethane) is evident. Due to conclusions of former investigations {{the majority of}} the contaminated sediment has already been removed. In this study the remaining sediment has been investigated with regard to the actual contamination state. Especially the widely neglected metabolite DDA (2, 2 -Bis(chlorophenyl) acetic acid) has been considered. Due to its enhanced dipole moment because of the polar carboxyl group it is representing a water soluble DDT-metabolite. The recommissioning of a former drinking water winning plant located downstream the contamination source, is planned in the near future. Therefore, it is an important factor to investigate the risk of DDA contamination for the water, because the canal is used for drinking water production by bank filtration. Subaquatic sediment was investigated for calculation of the maximum contamination range with regard to DDA. All DDT-metabolites, especially DDA and its precursor metabolites, which can transform to DDA, were considered. Furthermore, the incorporation of metabolites into sediment was investigated by applying a sequential degradation procedure. Free available as well as easily- and hardly available fractions of DDA (DDA + precursor metabolites) were obtained and a maximum contamination potential of 63 kg Sigma DDA was calculated to be contained by the estimated sediment mass of 541 t. About 53 % of the DDT-metabolites are represented by precursor metabolites of DDA, which are extractable and represent a directly available contamination potential. About 35 % is represented by sedimentary DDA which can be remobilized by hydrolysis processes (”easily releasable”). The remobilisation of sedimentary DDA under dynamic conditions as well as a possible retention of DDA in soil of the infiltration area has been investigated. Hence, a high remobilisation potential of sedimentary DDA was observed. The majority of the applied DDA amount has been released immediately referring to a direct contamination potential for the aquatic environment. The soil of the infiltration area of the drinking water plant turned out to be highly permeable for DDA. Therefore, negligible processes can be expected for water-borne DDA drained through a soil matrix; there is no retention of the DDA potential evident. Possible microbial degradation processes were investigated by stable carbon isotope analysis. Sediment samples as well as river water and groundwater samples were investigated with regard to selected DDT-metabolites. The contaminated sediment of the Teltow canal has been identified as a DDA source. Further investigations of several DDT-metabolites did reveal different changes of the isotopic signature. Industrially affected groundwater samples were subject to a target-screening with focus on halogenated compounds. Thereby, DDA was found to be the main DDT-metabolite; additionally, DDT, DDD and further unpolar DDT-metabolites were detected. Furthermore, three unknown substances with structural relation to DDA and DDT were detected. A great number of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> like HCH (Hexachlorocyclohexane) and related substances as well as aromatic and aliphatic chlorinated and brominated compounds were detected. As a result, a considerable structural diversity of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> due to industrial pollution was obtained, which is not recorded by regular monitoring programs; the latter are usually focussed on main metabolites. This study should demonstrate the necessity to investigate not only extractable residues of sedimentary pollutions but to consider the incorporation of pollutants in particulate matter as well. Bound residues in sediments can represent a long-term pollution potential for the environment. In most studies, the remobilisation of bound residues and their transformation reactions were widely neglected. Furthermore, released compounds can be transported due to adsorption on particles like colloidals to remote locations. Therefore, the original punctual contamination can form a hazardous potential on other sites. The transport of released sedimentary compounds to the aquatic environment is neglected in literature as well. Stable carbon isotope analysis is conducted more frequently in environmental research but DDT and its metabolites are hardly considered. By this study, the contamination source of the water-borne DDA was identified to be the contaminated sediment. Generally, longstanding pollutions are subject to complex transformation and transport reactions in the environment, therefore, it is difficult to estimate the complete hazard risk potential...|$|R
40|$|Contaminants in the Arctic {{environment}} are mainly transported from lower latitude areas by atmospheric transport. However, the Russian settlements (Barentsburg and Pyramiden) in Svalbard have {{shown to be}} heavily influenced by local pollution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), as high concentrations {{have been found in}} vegetation, soil and sediments. The Norwegian settlements (Longyearbyen and Ny-&# 197;lesund) are to a lesser extent influenced by local pollution of PCB. Birds have been utilized as sentinels for environmental pollution in several studies, as the use of bird-eggs is considered as a non-invasive method. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) is influenced by local pollution of PCB in the Russian settlements. During the 2010 field season and the 2011 field season, 32 eggs of snow buntings were collected in Longyearbyen (n= 8), Ny-&# 197;lesund (n= 8), Barentsburg (n= 9) and Pyramiden (n= 7). The analysis was conducted at the Norwegian Institute of Air Research (NILU) in Troms&# 248;. The eggs were analyzed for PCBs, organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and perfluoroalkylated compounds (PFASs). The results showed that PCBs were the most abundant contaminant group in the Russian settlements, while PFASs was the most abundant contaminant group in the Norwegian settlements. Significant higher concentrations (ng/g wet weigth) of &# 8721; 7 PCB (sum of the seven most common PCBs) were found in the eggs from the Russian settlements (Barentsburg and Pyramiden) than in the eggs from the Norwegian (Longyearbyen and Ny-&# 197;lesund). Further on, the PCB congener composition in the eggs was comparable with the technical PCB-mixtures previous used in the Russian settlements. The results thus indicate influence of local pollution of PCB in eggs of snow buntings in the Russian settlements. Further on, local influence of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p&# 146;-DDE) and PFASs cannot be excluded. However, the contaminant burden of hexachlorobenzen (HCB), trans-nonachlor, p,p&# 146;-DDE and PFASs in the eggs of snow buntings in Svalbard are mainly explained by; I: atmospheric transport of contaminants to the Arctic environment, II: transport of contaminants by sea birds, III: exposure during migration, IV: exposure in overwintering areas. The concentration of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> (OHCs) in eggs of snow buntings in this study is considerable lower than concentrations in previously studies that have reported to cause adverse effect in other bird species. Further are the concentrations of OHCs in this study in general lower when compared with other studies on Svalbard seabirds. However, it should be noted that the concentration of &# 8721;PCB in eggs of snow buntings is comparable with previous studies on Svalbard seabirds. The results in this study indicate that the snow bunting may be utilized as a sentinel of local pollution in Svalbard in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|Il est admis aujourd'hui que la génotoxicité identifiée dans les extraits d'eau potable provient principalement de l'action du chlore sur la matière organique naturelle qui donne naissance à des dérivés organohalogénés. Dans le présent travail, nous avons comparé la sensibilité de trois essais de génotoxicité (SOS chromotest, test d'Ames-fluctuation et test micronoyau triton) lors de l'étude de composés organohalogénés, d'acides fulviques chlorés et d'échantillons d'eau (non concentrés) en cours de {{traitement}} de potabilisation. Les composés organohalogénés étudiés sont 4 trihalométhanes, 5 acétonitriles et 5 chloropropanones identifiés dans l'eau potable ou dans des solutions de substances humiques chlorées. Les résultats obtenus révèlent que le SOS chromotest est globalement le moins sensible des trois essais et que le test d'Ames-fluctuation et le test micronoyau triton permettent généralement de détecter les plus faibles concentrations de composés génotoxiques. Les essais ont également permis de démontrer que {{la nature}} des substituants halogénés (brome ou chlore), le nombre et la position des atomes de chlore influencent notablement la génotoxicité des composés organohalogénés. Toutefois, les résultats obtenus indiquent qu'aucun des trois tests réalisés n'est suffisant à lui seul pour détecter l'ensemble des produits génotoxiques. Ces observations confirment la nécessité de réaliser une batterie de tests qui mette en oeuvre divers types cellulaires et différents systèmes de métabolisation, et détecte divers évènements de génotoxicité. Les travaux portant sur les solutions concentrées d'acides fulviques chlorés montrent l'intérêt des essais sur bactéries (particulièrement le test d'Ames-fluctuation) pour la détection rapide de l'activité génotoxique de ces solutions. L'étude concemant les échantillons d'eau prélevés à différents niveaux d'une station de potabilisation, et analysés sans concentration préalable, indique que le test d'Ames- fluctuation est le seul capable de détecter une activité génotoxique dans les échantillons non concentrés étudiés. On montre, conformément à la littérature, que l'activité mutagène observée résulte de la chloration de l'eau. Since {{the identification of}} organohalides in drinking water in 1974, several investigators have detected genotoxic activity in drinking water concentrates. It is now widely admitted that the observed genotoxicity originates mainly from the reaction of chlorine on natural organic matter contained in the raw water, {{which leads to the}} formation of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} show the benefit of three short-term assays for the evaluation of the genotoxic potency of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> and of complex mixtures. In a wider context, the purpose is to identify a test or a battery of tests that can contribute to the control of natural and drinking water genotoxicity. The three genotoxicity assays carried out during this work were:- the SOS chromotest, a primary DNA damage in vitro assay on Escherichia coli; - the Ames- fluctuation test, a point mutation in vitro assay on Salmonella typhimurium; - and the newt micronucleus test, a chromosomal aberration in vivo assay on the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl. These assays display a valuable advantage: the water samples under study can be analyzed without concentration prior to testing. Thus, the different concentration procedures, which may modify the original genotoxicity of the water samples, are avoided. A previous study on seven reference genotoxic chemicals had indicated that the SOS chromotest was never the most sensitive of the three tests (for a given chemical, the most sensitive assay is defined as the test which detects the lowest concentration inducing a significant genotoxic effect). On the contrary, the Ames-fluctuation test proved to be the most sensitive for compounds showing direct genotoxic activity, and the newt micronucleus test the most sensitive for chemicals with indirect genotoxic effects. None of the assays was the most sensitive for every substance analyzed. These observations suggested the need to implement a battery of tests using several cell types, different metabolization systems and detecting several genotoxicity events. This earlier study also showed, in accord with several results in the literature, that the Ames-fluctuation test (in liquid medium) demonstrated a better sensitivity than the Ames test (in agar solid medium). The first part of the present study involved testing the genotoxicity of 14 organo- halogenated compounds identified in drinking water samples or in chlorinated humic matter samples. The chemicals studied were four chlorinated and/or brominated trihalomethanes (trichloro-, bromodichloro-, chlorodibromo- and tribromomethane), five chlorinated or brominated acetonitriles with one, two or three halogens (monochloro-, dichloro-, trichloro-, monobromo- and dibromoacetonitrile) and five chlorinated propanones with one, two or three substitutions on one or two carbon atoms (monochloro-, 1, 1 -dichloro-, 1, 3 -dichloro-, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- and 1, 1, 3 - trichloropropanone). Although the SOS chromotest was the most sensitive for 3 of the 14 substances analyzed, the results confirmed that this test was globally the least sensitive; the Ames-fluctuation test and the newt micronucleus test remained the most efficient assays. It is interesting to note that the Ames-fluctuation test appeared the most sensitive for all the chloropropanones tested and the newt micronucleus test, for all the haloacetonitriles analyzed. Moreover, several structure-activity relationships were demonstrated: the nature of the halogenated substituents (bromine or chlorine), the number and, above all, the position of chlorine atoms strongly influenced the genotoxicity of the organohalides studied. In the second part of the work we analyzed the effects of complex mixtures containing several organohalogenated compounds: the three tests were performed on two chlorinated fulvic acids of different origin. Pornic fulvic acid was extracted from a surface water reservoir used to produce drinking water in Vendée (France) and Pinail fulvic acid came from a forest pond near Poitiers (France). The total organic carbon was about 1 g/l in the solution subjected to chlorination and the molar chlorination ratio was 1. 5 Cl 2 /C. The results showed the advantage of tests using bacteria: the Ames fluctuation test was the only assay able to detect the genotoxicity of both chlorinated fulvic acids; the SOS chromotest detected the genotoxic effect of only one of the chlorinated fulvic acids (Pinail). In contrast, the newt micronucleus test did not show any genotoxicity of the chlorinated fulvic acids. However, it must be pointed out that, as insufficient fulvic acid was available, the genotoxic potency of these solutions on the newt was not tested under adequate conditions (e. g., subchronic concentrations were not studied). Nevertheless, the concentrations of fulvic acid analyzed were very close to those found in the aquatic environment. The last part of the study attempted to approximate environmental and human exposure conditions: the three tests were performed on four water samples taken at several stages of a drinking water treatment plant. These samples were analyzed for genotoxicity in the three test systems without preconcentration. The plant studied is characterized by the following treatment steps: - coagulation-flocculation; - chlorination at 6 g Cl 2 /m 3; - sand filtration; - ozonation at 1. 9 g O 3 /m 3; - final chlorination at 1. 4 g Cl 2 /m 3 before sending the treated water into the distribution system. The four samples were taken: 1. before any treatment (raw water, 10 to 13 mg total organic carbon per liter), 2. between the sand layer filter and the ozonator (chlorinated water), 3. after the ozonator (ozonated water), 4. and at the end of the treatment process (treated water). The results obtained confirmed the advantage of the Ames fluctuation test, which was the only assay able to detect a genotoxic activity in the unconcentrated water samples studied. Regarding the influence of the different chemical treatments on the mutagenicity observed, it was demonstrated that the first chlorination step led to the formation of direct-acting mutagens. The treatment with ozone, at the rate used, did not significantly modify the mutagenicity of the samples that had previously been chlorinated. Similarly, the second chlorination step did not significantly increase the direct mutagenicity detected. Practically, our study indicated that the Ames-fluctuation test is the only assay, among the three performed that is able to contribute efficiently to the control of drinking water genotoxicity. In this context, the benefit of the SOS chromotest appears only in case of accidental pollution: indeed, it is the only test able to yield results within 24 hours. The implementation of the newt micronucleus test could be useful for the control of natural or drinking water genotoxicity in case of extensive pollution...|$|R
40|$|L'étude des {{interactions}} entre les ions chlorite, un charbon actif en grains (CAG CECA 40) et des composés phénoliques (phénol et para-nitrophénol) a été réalisée à partir d'expériences de filtration sur mini-colonnes de CAG de solutions aqueuses de chlorite et du composé organique en mélange ([C 102 -] inf= 50 mg. l-¹; [Composé Organique]jnf= 200 µmol. l-¹; 3 g de CAG; Vitesse de filtration: 3, 7 m. h-¹). Les résultats obtenus ont permis de montrer que la présence de chlorite conduit à une {{augmentation des}} capacités du CAG vis-à-vis de l'élimination du phénol et du para-nitrophénol. Cette augmentation résulte de réactions chimiques entre le composé organique et les sous-produits de décomposition des ions chlorite par le charbon actif. Les analyses par couplage CG/SM des extraits issus des charbons actifs à la fin des filtrations ont permis de mettre en évidence la présence de nombreux composés adsorbés sur le charbon actif. Les composés identifiés résultent de réactions d'oxydation, de deshydroxylation, de carboxylation, d'halogénation, d'hydroxylation et de dimérisation. L'action des ions chlorite sur le charbon actif peut conduire à la formation de radicaux à la surface du charbon actif ou en solution capables de réagir avec les composés organiques pour former les sous-produits observés. The use of chlorine dioxide for the chemical preoxidation of potable water with high oxidant demand {{requires that the}} major inorganic byproduct, chlorite, in the treatment system be removed, owing to the potential toxicity of this oxychlorine species. Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filtration, in converting chlorite ions into chloride, {{appears to be an}} interesting approach, but very few data are available concerning possible interactions in the presence of organic matter. The present research was designed to examine the influence of phenolic compounds on the efficiency of activated carbon in removing chlorite and to study the reactions between chlorite, activated carbon and organic molecules. Laboratory experiments have been carried out with relatively high substrate concentrations in order to identify the resulting byproducts. Materials and Methods. Filtrations of solutions containing chlorite and a phenolic compound (phenol or para nitrophenol; [Organic Compound]inf= 200 µmol. L-¹;[C 102 -] inf= 50 mg L-¹; pH= 7. 2); were performed using 1 - cm i. d. glass columns packed with 3. 0 g of GAC CECA 40 (Flow rate: 3. 7 m. h-¹). Inorganic species were analysed by HPLC, with an anion column and a conductimetric detector for chloride and chlorate, and with a C- 18 column and a UV detector for chlorite. Phenol and para nitrophenol were also analysed by HPLC, in the reverse mode. At the conclusion of the filtrations, the Total Organic Halogen (TOX) adsorbed on the carbon was determined after combustion of the carbon and measurement of the liberated halides with a micro coulometer (Dohrmann DX 20). In order to identify organic reaction byproducts, carbon samples were Soxhlet extracted with methylene chloride and half of the extracts were methylated with diazomethane. Identification of the organic products was then carried out by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry with a DB 5 capillary column and a quadrupolar hyperbolic filter system CPV/MS. Results and Discussion. Effects of phenol and p nitrophenol on removal of chlorite by GAC. The effluent curves from columns that received solutions containing both chlorite and an organic solute (columns A and B; fig. 1) showed that the presence of phenol or p nitrophenol in the influent decreases the capacity of GAC to remove chlorite. Effect of chlorite on removal of phenol and p nitrophenol. An increase in the cumulative removal of the organic solute was observed for columns A and B compared with columns that received solutions of the phenolic compound only (fig. 2; table 11). p benzoquinone was found in the eff 1 uent of column A fed with a chlorite phenol solution (fig. 3). Formation of organic byproducts by reactions between chlorite and phenol or p nitrophenol in the presence of GAC. TOX analyses showed that interactions between chlorite, GAC, and phenol or p nitrophenol led to the production of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds.</b> These data clearly demonstrate that halogenation reactions take place in the GAC bed and that a fraction of the total amount of phenol or p nitrophenol removed can be due to chemical reactions. GC/MS analyses of GAC extracts of columns A and B (tables IV and V) indicated that the phenol chlorite GAC reactions yield a variety of organic byproducts that are produced by hydroxylation and carboxylation of the aromatic ring by oxidation to quinones, by chlorine substitution and by dehydroxylation and dimerization reactions. Fewer products could be identified in the reaction between p nitrophenol, chlorite, and GAC. Since chlorite is unreactive with phenol and p nitrophenol in neutral aqueous solution, the formation of these organic byproducts can be attributed to reactions between phenol or p nitrophenol present in the GAC pore solution or adsorbed on GAC and the chemical species (Cl· ClO·, ClO 2, HOCl (ClO-), surface free radicals [...] .) generated from the reaction of chlorite and carbon. Thus, aromatic acids could come from radical processes between adsorbed molecules and carbon surface functional groups oxidized by chlorite. The formation of dimers can also be explained by a freeradical mechanism. The reactions between Cl·, ClO· radicals or radicals present on the GAC surface, with organic compounds produce organic radicals via H atom abstraction or one electron transfer. Organic radicals such as phenoxy radicals or other aromatic radicals can then undergo dimerization by carbon-oxygen or carbon-carbon coupling. The formation of organochlorinated compounds {{can be explained by the}} reaction of chlorine (HOCl, ClO-) and chlorine radicals with organic molecules present in the solution. However further investigation is needed in order to evaluate if such compounds can be formed on GAC filters and then desorbed in the effluent in thc case of drinking waters pretreated with chlorine dioxide...|$|R
40|$|As the top {{predator}} of {{the arctic}} marine food chain, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) accumulate high levels of <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> (OHCs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), various pesticides, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) (e. g. perfluorinated carboxylic acids [PFCAs] and perfluorinated sulfonic acids [PFSAs]). Most of these OHCs and their metabolites (e. g. hydroxylated PCBs [OH-PCBs] and hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers [OH-PBDEs]) disrupt the thyroid hormone (TH) -system of vertebrates. Developing mammals are particularly vulnerable {{to the effects of}} TH disrupting chemicals (TDCs) because THs influence activities in multiple and essential growth and developmental processes. TDCs transferred from mothers to foetus or nursing offspring may cause developmental, cognitive and neurobehavioral effects in the offspring, raising the risk of potential health-effects in highly contaminated polar bear cubs. Although TDCs may act through several modes of action, OH-PCBs and PFASs are of particular concern due to their ability to compete with thyroxine (T 4) in binding to TH-transport proteins in blood such as transthyretin (TTR), and thereby deplete T 4 levels in blood. The present thesis reports levels, pattern and cub-mother ratios (maternal transfer ratios) of PCBs, OH-PCBs, and PFASs in polar bear mothers and their approximately four-month old cubs from Svalbard (Norway). A method for extracting TTR-binding compounds from polar bear plasma samples was developed and validated, and applied to plasma samples of polar bear cubs to measure the total TTR-binding activity, expressed as T 4 -equivalents (T 4 -EQ Meas), using a radioligand 125 I-T 4 -TTR-binding assay. Orthogonal partial least square (OPLS) modelling was used to assess the potential disruptive effects of PCBs, calculated dioxin-like activity of PCBs (ΣTEQ-PCBs 7), OH-PCBs, PFASs and T 4 -EQMeas on circulating THlevels (total and free T 4 [TT 4 and FT 4], total and free triiodothyonine [TT 3 and FT 3], total reverse T 3 [rT 3]) and TH-ratios (TT 4 /TT 3 and TT 3 /rT 3) in polar bear cubs. Whether the mechanism of competitive binding to TTR could be involved in observed TH-disruptive effects were discussed. Samples from both 1998 and 2008 were included to investigate possible recent temporal trends in levels and effects of TDCs in polar bears. Mean levels of Σ 21 PCBs in the nursing cubs were 2. 7 ± 0. 7 times the levels of their mothers, while Σ 6 OH-PCBs, Σ 7 PFCAs and Σ 2 PFSAs were 0. 53 ± 0. 16, 0. 24 ± 0. 07 and 0. 22 ± 0. 05 times the levels in their mothers, respectively. Although {{it was not possible to}} differ between the relative importance of prenatal and postnatal transfer and the influence of toxicokinetical factors, the results indicate that in polar bears, the maternal transfer of hydrophobic PCBs is considerably higher than for protein-binding compounds such as OH-PCBs and PFASs. Assessment of levels, patterns, and metabolite/precursor ratios of PCBs and OH-PCBs in mothers and cubs indicates that polar bear cubs do biotransform PCBs. Although the relative pattern of enzyme activities involved in the biotransformation of PCBs to OH-PCBs in mothers and cubs appear to be similar, cubs seem to have a lower ability to biotransform PCBs compared to adult bears. Between-year comparisons of exposure levels show that the PCB, OHPCB and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) levels in mothers and cubs were lower in 2008 than in 1998. Conversely, the levels of most PFCAs were higher in 2008 than in 1998, while the levels of perfluorohexanoic sulfonate (PFHxS) did not differ between the sampling years. Much of these between-year differences are likely due to a temporal decrease of PCBs and PFOS and a temporal increase of PFCAs in the environment, and thus, in exposure levels in polar bear mothers and cubs from Svalbard. However, because sampling in 2008 was conducted 6 ° further west than in 1998, the between-year differences could partly be explained by between-year differences in capture location. A method to extract TTR-binding compounds from plasma sample was successfully established. The extraction method was successfully applied to polar bear plasma samples, and the total TTR-binding activity in cub plasma was quantified. Approximately 50 % of the T 4 -EQ Meas, in the cubs’ blood was accounted for by chemically determined OH-PCBs, while only about 1 % was accounted for by PFASs. This indicates that significant burdens of unidentified TTR-binding TDCs were present in blood of polar bear cubs. Examining the associations between plasma TH-levels, TH–ratios, and OHC-levels in cubs showed that OHCs only inflicted TH-effects in the 1998 cubs. Inverse correlations were observed between plasma T 4 (TT 4 and FT 4), and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) (i. e. PCB- 156, - 157), ΣTEQ-PCB 7, and non-DL PCBs (NDL-PCBs) (i. e. PCB- 47, - 99, - 137, - 153, - 170, - 180, - 183) in these cubs. Likewise, PFCAs showed a weak impact on plasma TH-levels in the 1998 cubs (TT 4, FT 4 and TT 4 /TT 3). It is notable that T 4 -EQ Meas and plasma levels of OH-PCBs did not affect plasma THlevels, including T 4 levels, suggesting that the PCB affects circulating T 4 levels through other mechanisms than competitive binding to TTR. There were no observed effects of OHCs on plasma TT 3, FT 3, rT 3 or TT 3 /rT 3. In the 2008 cubs, all TH-variables were unaffected by contaminant variables, suggesting that recent lower burdens of PCBs may have improved the TH-health of polar bear cubs. It is noteworthy that in both the 1998 and 2008 cubs, the molar plasma concentrations of OH-PCBs, PFASs, and T 4 -EQ Meas were considerably higher than the concentration of plasma T 4 levels. This suggests that the T 4 binding sites of TTR are fully saturated by contaminants, which could explain the lack of association between plasma T 4 levels, OH-PCBs and T 4 -EQ Meas. Although other plasma transport protein than TTR likely are involved in plasma transport of THs in polar bears, these findings raise concern because alterations of the TH-homeostasis and TTR-transport of THs in developing cubs may affect hunting and mating behaviour later in life, and hence, affect the fitness and populations of polar bears. While it is clear that OHCs present a physiological challenge to developing polar bears, further research is required to understand the complexity of these effects. PhD i biologiPhD in Biolog...|$|R
40|$|Cette étude présente les principaux résultats se rapportant d'une part à l'évolution des consommations en chlore par des composés organiques en {{solutions}} synthétiques de minéralisation variable. D'autre part, quelques essais sont consacrés aux possibilités de formation de sous- produits de la chloration tels les trihalométhanes. Les différences de réactivité entre les composés simples (phénol, résorcinol, aniline) et les substances humiques, déjà observées en eau distillée, ont pu également être mises en évidence lors de leur dilution dans des milieux minéralisés (eaux de sources ou de forages). L'influence de la minéralisation, appréhendée par le paramètre "conductivité" ou par des teneurs variables en éléments minéraux spécifiques, s'est concrétisée par des écarts souvent considérables entre les potentiels de consommation en chlore en eau distillée et ceux en eaux minéralisées. La présence d'ions bromures dans les eaux les plus minéralisées induit en particulier une formation plus importante des THM bromés. L'intervention d'ions chlorures et sulfates, en provoquant une diminution des potentiels de consommation en chlore, peut rendre plus complexe le schéma réactionnel du chlore avec les différentes entités réactives présentes dans une eau naturelle. L'application du procédé de chloration à des eaux de surface algériennes a permis de distinguer entre les eaux très minéralisées du sud algérien et celles moins minéralisées du nord du pays. Leur réactivité vis-à-vis du chlore s'est trouvée directement liée à leurs caractéristiques physico-chimiques. Les différences de réactivité relevées peuvent être attribuées d'une part à la variabilité de la proportion en matériel humique et d'autre part aux teneurs relatives en éléments minéraux promoteurs ou inhibiteurs de la réaction de chloration. The {{organic compounds}} studied {{during this work}} are simple aromatic structures (phenol, resorcinol, aniline), as well as macromolecular structures (humic substances). These compounds are representative of natural organic matter in surface waters. Various studies (De Laat et al., 1982; Norwood and Christman, 1987; Legube et al., 1990) showed that chlorination of these organic substances led to a strong chlorine consumption {{and the formation of}} volatile and non-volatile <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds.</b> However, the majority of these experiments were conducted in aqueous media at very low ionic strength or in distilled water. The aim {{of the present study was}} to observe the reactivity of organic compounds in mineralised media. Indeed, Algerian waters are often very mineralised, excessively hard with high amounts of chloride and sulphate (Achour, 2001). In addition, humic substances can account for 60 to 90 % of the total organic carbon (TOC) in most surface waters used to produce drinking water (Achour and Moussaoui, 1993). The first part of this study involved the investigation of the impact of the overall parameter "total mineralisation", which can be directly related to conductivity measurements in the dilution waters. In addition to distilled water, dilution media for the organic compounds included four ground waters initially free of organic matter and residual chlorine. Figure 1 shows the geographic location of sampling sites for the waters of Drauh and Oued Biskra (Biskra) as well as those of waters of Ifri (Bedjaïa) and Youkous (Tebessa). Their main physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The influence of certain specific inorganic constituents such as ammonia, bromide, chloride and sulphate is also observed on the chlorination of the organic compounds tested. The objective was to determine and to compare chlorine consumption potentials respectively for the simple organic compounds (D) and the humic substances (PCCl 2) in media with differing degrees of mineralisation and under controlled conditions (pH, contact time and chlorine dose applied). Chlorination ratio is expressed for the simple organic compounds by r=moles of introduced chlorine/moles of organic compound and for the humic substances by m=mg of introduced chlorine/mg of humic substances. Tests were performed to evaluate the formation of trihalomethanes (chloroform and brominated trihalomethanes). Analysis was done by gas chromatography using a head space method. The main experimental chlorination conditions for the synthetic solutions of organic compounds are summarised in Table 2. The results obtained (Table 3) show that the organic compounds tested remain very reactive towards chlorine, whatever the mineralisation of the dilution media. Potentials of chlorine consumption in distilled water and in mineralised waters are different (E), showing the obvious effect of the degree of mineralisation (Table 4). The reactivity of humic substances seems intermediary between the structures of resorcinol and phenol or aniline. The highest variations (E) between distilled water and the natural mineralised waters were observed in the case of the most highly mineralised water (water of Oued Biskra); generally the gaps decreased in the order E (Oued Biskra) > E (Ifri) > E (Youkous) > E (Drauh). In studies at different pH values, the oxidation capacity of chlorine was exerted more vigorously at circumneutral pH values (Table 5). For phenol and humic substances, gaps are more meaningful within five minutes of contact time, during the first step of the chlorination reaction (Table 6). Total mineralisation does not seem to be the only parameter able to affect the reactivity of organic matter. The composition of the inorganic matrix must be considered too. Thus, according to the relative proportions of ammonia and bromides, competitive reactions (chlorine/organic matter and chlorine/inorganics) will condition chlorine consumption and the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs). For waters with a low ammonia/bromide ratio, an increase of the bromide concentration can induce a significant degradation of the chlorine consumption potentials, even for resorcinol, which is habitually more reactive with chlorine than with bromide (Figure 2). In waters with high levels of bromides (waters of Drauh and Oued Biskra), bromoform may be formed (Table 7). The presence of high concentrations of chloride and sulphate in aqueous solutions with humic substances seems to induce a reduction of chlorine consumption potentials (Figures 3 and 4). Several hypotheses can be advanced to explain this phenomenon, especially the decrease of activity of the chlorinating element by the increase of the ionic strength of the aqueous media. At the same time, it can be assumed that chlorinated entities may be formed with less reactivity than hypochlorous acid. The reduction of chlorine consumption is less significant in the presence of sulphates than chlorides. Moreover, the cation associated with sulphate seems to have an effect on the reactivity of the humic substances towards to chlorine. In the second part of the work, chlorination was applied to four surface water samples. The sampling sites (Figure 1) relate to reservoir waters of Souk El Djemâa (Tizi-Ouzou), Aïn Zada (Sétif), Foum El Gherza (Biskra) and Fontaine des gazelles (Biskra). Amounts of humic material are relatively important and constitute about 60 % of the TOC found in the raw waters. The mineralisation in these waters is considerable, particularly for waters in the southern part of the country (Table 8). Chlorine consumption and THMs formed seem to be correlated with the nature and concentration of organic matter, as well as with the inorganic component of these waters (Table 9). Chlorination of water samples taken from the north of Algeria (Aïn Zada and Souk El Djemâa) leads to higher values of chlorine consumption potentials than for water samples taken from the south of the country. Taking into account the results obtained on synthetic solutions, this trend can be explained by the appreciable contents of humic substances as well as by a lower degree of mineralisation of waters in the north. It also interesting to note that proportion of brominated trihalomethanes compared to the total trihalomethanes increases not only with the initial concentration of bromides but also with increasing levels of chlorides and sulphates. Highly mineralised waters, containing humic material, seem therefore to favour numerous competitive reactions during chlorination...|$|R
40|$|Depuis la mise en évidence de trihalométhanes dans les eaux potables en 1974, de {{multiples}} travaux ont démontré la présence de nombreux composés génotoxiques dans l'eau de boisson. L'eau potable obtenue à partir d'eau de surface subit un traitement incluant généralement une étape de chloration. Il est aujourd'hui largement admis que l'activité génotoxique des eaux de boisson provient principalement de la chloration des substances humiques, composés organiques naturels contenus dans l'eau brute et issus de la dégradation des déchets animaux et végétaux. Les très faibles concentrations en composés génotoxiques dans les eaux potables nécessitent la concentration des échantillons, procédé qui risque toutefois de modifier la génotoxicité. Plusieurs tests mettant en oeuvre des cellules procaryotes ou eucaryotes, des plantes ou des mammifères, ont permis de mettre en évidence les effets génotoxiques dans des eaux potables chlorées. L'identification des composés génotoxiques est réalisée au moyen des données de la spectrométrie de masse et de la spectroscopie UV ou RMN (proton ou carbone). Ces agents sont généralement non volatils, acides et polaires. Bien que certains composés inorganiques interviennent parfois, la majeure partie de la génotoxicité est attribuée aux agents organohalogénés (bromés ou/et chlorés), les principaux étant les trihalométhanes, acides acétiques, acétonitriles, cétones, et hydroxyfuranones. La fixation de normes contribue à limiter l'exposition des populations aux agents potentiellement dangereux. La qualité des eaux de boisson peut être accrue en utilisant une eau brute moins chargée en matière organique, et en améliorant le traitement chimique tout en veillant à conserver la qualité microbiologique de l'eau produite. In 1974, {{two independent}} studies - {{one in the}} Netherlands {{and the other in}} the United States - demonstrated the occurrence of trihalomethanes in drinking water. Following studies showed that these chemicals were common contaminants of drinking water and that chloroform, i. e. one of these trihalomethanes, was carcinogenic in rodents. Further investigations demonstrated that extracts of chlorinated drinking water induced significant mutagenicity in the Ames/Salmonella assay. In the present paper we will fist discuss the methods used to detect the genotoxic activity of drinking water and, then, the methods developed to identify the compounds responsible for this activity. After this, we will present the main genotoxic chemicals identified in drinking water, before finally considering several propositions to limit the exposure of populations to these genotoxic compounds. Drinking water is usually produced through a multistage process which includes one or several chlorination steps. It is now widely accepted that the genotoxic activity of drinking water mainly originates from the reaction of chlorine with humic substances present in raw water. Humic substances are natural organic matters (resulting from the degradation of plants and animal tissues) of very complex structure with most chemical functions arranged in aromatic rings or aliphatic chains. The identification of a genotoxic activity in drinking water usually requires concentration of the water samples. Even though such a process implies a probable qualitative/quantitative alteration of the constituents of water samples, the extremely low amounts of genotoxic compounds in drinking water require concentration steps. Among the many genotoxicity tests carried out, the Ames test (which detects reverse mutations in bacteria Salmonella typhimurium) is the assay which was the most frequently used in the field of drinking water mutagenicity. Other tests were performed on eucaryotic cells. Assays detecting micronuclei or chromosomal aberrations in plants, or mutations in mold, yeast, or maize enabled the detection of genotoxic effects of drinking water extracts. Tests on mammal cells also showed that drinking water extracts induced point mutations, sister chromatid exchanges, chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei. In vivo tests on aquatic organims such as newt or mussels demonstrated the micronuclei inducing effect of unconcentrated drinking water samples. Regarding the identification of the compounds responsible for the genotoxicity, it is obviously not possible to identify all of the thousands of chemicals that may be involved. But such a process is important in order to evaluate the specific genotoxicity and the risk associated with (at least) the main chemicals occurring in drinking water. The identification process usually follows three steps: 1. concentration of the sample can be performed using reverse osmosis, freeze drying, liquid-liquid extraction, and/or adsorption on non ionic resin followed by extraction with organic solvent; 2. the purification step uses one or a combination of chromatographic techniques (TLC, packed column liquid chromatography, HPLC or GC); 3. structural identification of the chemical is performed using data from mass spectrometry, and proton and carbon NMR, or UV spectroscopy. The analysis of the genotoxic compounds of drinking water showed that they are rather non-volatile, quite acid and not stable at high pH, rather polar, and with a mean molecular weigh around 200. Turning now to the identity of these compounds, it is considered that the genotoxicity of drinking water is mainly due to organohalogenated chemicals. Some inorganic chemicals (this class of chemicals is usually not recovered in drinking water extracts) which induce genotoxic or carcinogenic effects must, however, be recalled. Arsenic, nitrates, bromates and radon are natural or human-activity-related drinking water contaminants which are responsible for cancers in rodents or in humans. Among the many genotoxic or carcinogenic <b>organohalogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> identified in drinking water, the most abundant chemicals are chlorinated and/or brominated trihalomethanes. Other important groups of compounds are chlorinated and/or brominated derivatives of acetic acids, acetonitriles, ketones, phenolic compounds. The chlorinated hydroxyfuranones, although present at concentrations lower than 0. 1 µg/l in drinking water, can be responsible {{for more than half of}} the Ames mutagenicity. MX, the most potent of these chlorohydroxyfuranones, has been submitted to intensive toxicological studies worldwide and was very recently identified as a potent carcinogen in rats. Now that the presence of genotoxic compounds in drinking waters is a well documented and accepted fact, the perspectives lies in the better identification of the impact of these drinking water contaminants. The development of more sensitive tests such as the Comet assay (detection of DNA strand breaks) or the 32 P postlabelling assay (detection of DNA adducts) should be pursued. Moreover, the interaction between genotoxic compounds and DNA must be investigated more thoroughly, including the identification of adduct structures. More globally, it is of interest to better assess the impact of these agents on public health and on the occurrence of specific human cancers. At present, even though a few individual water contaminants are classified as human probable carcinogens, the chlorinated drinking water (in itself) is not considered as carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to these potentially harmful agents can be limited with 1. improving drinking water quality - i. e. decreasing the formation of genotoxins - by using raw water containing lower amounts of organic matter; and 2. modifying the water chemical treatment by using lower amounts of chlorine and/or combining chlorine with other disinfectants. The public health can also be protected by the setting of guidelines for drinking water: each compound identified as dangerous would be given a concentration threshold which should never be exceeded. The Environmental Protection Agency in the U. S. A. and the World Health Organisation are authorities setting such guidelines. Finally, we believe it is important to limit the concentration of genotoxic compounds in drinking water as much as possible, and one way to do so is to use chlorine in smaller amounts and in a more efficient way. But it is of paramount importance to keep in mind that the disinfection process (in which chlorine still plays a major role) and the providing of a microbiologically safe drinking water should never be jeopardized...|$|R
