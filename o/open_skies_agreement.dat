Is it worthwhile to implement policies {{designed to increase}} competition in transport markets? Focusing on air transport, this paper quantifies the effects of liberalization of air cargo markets on transport costs. Between 1990 and 2003, the United States implemented a series of <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>Agreements,</b> providing {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the effect that a change in the competition regime has on prices. In our sample, <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>Agreements</b> reduce air transport costs by 9 % and increase by 7 % the share of imports arriving by air.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the long term}} impact of <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreements</b> between US and Europe {{from the perspective of}} scheduled passenger flights. Our analysis is based on flight schedule data from the Official Airline Guide and also includes bilateral trade volume data and crude oil prices. We find that the changes in frequency, in total capacity (in terms of number of seats per week) and in inter-city connectivity (in terms of number of cities and city-pairs served) are more complex than the conventional notion of an abrupt, monotonic increase in air transport services between countries that have bilateral <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreements</b> compared to those without. The results of this study would help temper the expectations of policy makers from <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreements.</b> They would also have implications on possible transatlantic airline mergers...|$|R
50|$|Beyond the {{domestic}} liberalization of the airlines in the USA, <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>agreements</b> are bilateral agreements between the US {{and other countries}} to open the aviation market to foreign access and remove barriers to competition. They give airlines the right to operate air services from any point in the US to any point in the other country, {{as well as to}} and from third countries. The first major <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>agreements</b> were entered into in 1979.|$|R
25|$|In 1995, taking {{advantage}} of a new US-Canada <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreement,</b> Air Canada added 30 new trans-border routes. In May 1997, Air Canada became {{a founding member of the}} Star Alliance, with the airline launching codeshares with several of the alliance's members. The second half of the 1990s saw the airline earn consistent profits, totalling $1 billion for the 1997 to 1999 period.|$|E

25|$|In the mid twentieth century, the Irish {{government}} {{introduced a}} rule stating that all air traffic between Ireland and the United States must transit through Shannon Airport. In return, the United States government placed {{a limit of}} four airports in the US that Aer Lingus could operate to. On 22 March 2007, the <b>Open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreement</b> between the US and EU was ratified. This resulted in the immediate cancellation of the long-running 'Shannon Stopover' requirement, whereby the Irish government had insisted that 50% of all transatlantic flights between Ireland and the United States must pass through Shannon Airport.|$|E
25|$|Air {{transportation}} made up 9% of {{the transport}} sector's GDP generation in 2005. Canada's largest air carrier and its flag carrier is Air Canada, which had 34 million customers in 2006 and, as of April 2010, operates 363 aircraft (including Air Canada Jazz). CHC Helicopter, the largest commercial helicopter operator in the world, is second with 142 aircraft and WestJet, a low-cost carrier formed in 1996, is third with 100 aircraft. Canada's airline industry saw significant change following {{the signing of}} the US-Canada <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreement</b> in 1995, when the marketplace became less regulated and more competitive.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, an <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>Agreement</b> {{between the}} U.S. and the European Union became effective, invalidating Bermuda II {{restrictions}} that had limited {{the number of}} carriers and cities in the U.S. that could serve London-Heathrow. In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and are offered {{with a combination of}} Boeing 777-200ER and 757-200 equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin. Continental has grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.|$|E
50|$|In January 2009, United {{announced}} a code-sharing agreement with Aer Lingus for flights between Washington Dulles and Madrid. Aer Lingus would operate the service, which is permitted under recent <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreements</b> between the US and EU.|$|R

50|$|The U.S. has <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>agreements</b> {{with more}} than 60 countries, {{including}} fifteen of the 27 EU nations. <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>agreements</b> have been successful at removing many of the government implemented barriers to competition and allowing airlines to have foreign partners, access to international routes to and from their home countries and freedom from many traditional forms of economic regulation. A global industry would work better with a globally minded set of rules that would allow airlines {{from one country to}} establish airlines in another country and to operate domestic services in the territory of another country.These agreements still fail to approximate the freedoms that most industries have when competing in other global markets.|$|R
25|$|In early 2006, Virgin Blue {{announced}} {{its intention to}} operate up to seven flights a week to the U.S. through either Los Angeles International Airport or San Francisco International Airport. At the time, only Qantas and United Airlines competed in the Australia-US transpacific market. The airline was given permission for ten flights a week to the U.S. by Australian regulators on 24 July 2007. The plans were approved by US regulators on 15 February 2008, due to the signing of an <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreement</b> between Australia and the US. Instead of using its existing brand, Virgin Blue launched a fully owned subsidiary with a separate Air Operator's Certificate, named V Australia {{as the result of}} a public naming competition, with a fleet of five specifically branded 777-300ERs.|$|E
500|$|With the {{creation}} of an <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>agreement</b> between Europe and the United States in March 2008, British Airways started a new subsidiary airline called OpenSkies (previously known as [...] "Project Lauren").

Lufthansa sold its stake in JetBlue in March 2015. In late 2007, [...] Lufthansa Cargo was forced to relocate a hub from Kazakhstan to Russia.|$|E
50|$|Cabotage rights remain rare in {{passenger}} aviation.

2500|$|On December 10, 2004, South Phoenix Airways {{announced}} their international flights to Sandakan and Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia, {{but it was}} eventually cut due to poor load of passengers. [...] Likewise, Asian Spirit commenced service to Sandakan on May 2, 2007, restarting Zamboanga's international operations. The Zamboanga-Sandakan route and other international routes are expected to grow with the signing of a BIMP-EAGA <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreement,</b> notably with Indonesia's Sriwijaya Air planning to fly the Zamboanga-Sandakan route.|$|E
2500|$|As Minister of Transport, Lapierre {{initiated}} the Pacific Gateway Strategy, signing air transport agreements with China and India and completed a formal Canada-US <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>Agreement.</b> [...] He also spearheaded a large federal {{investment in the}} Prince Rupert container terminal, saying that it improved ties to Asian markets, while enhancing economic development in northern British Columbia and Alberta. Lapierre reduced the amount paid by airports {{to the federal government}} by some $5 billion over the remaining life of the leases. He announced the implementation of a No Fly List to increase security for airline passengers.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the stated}} goal of both {{countries}} is for an <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreement,</b> the process of reaching such an agreement has taken several years {{and has not been}} completed. Liu Weimin, director of the Aviation Laws Research Centre with the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China, has said [...] "Under the current market situation, local carriers have a hard time competing against global giants such as Continental. That is why US airlines are enthusiastic to fly to China, while Chinese carriers are hesitating to open more flights. For local airlines, more flights may mean more losses if they cannot get enough passengers." [...] There have been reports that the load factors (percentage of seats sold) in business and first class are lower on Chinese carriers than on US carriers.|$|E
50|$|The last {{twenty-five years}} have seen {{significant}} changes in airline regulation. The United States began pursuing <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>agreements</b> in 1979, and, by 1982 it had signed twenty-three bilateral air service agreements worldwide, mainly with smaller nations. That was followed in the 1990s by agreements with individual European states.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s, [...] "open skies" [...] {{agreements}} {{became more}} common. These agreements take {{many of these}} regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. <b>Open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreements</b> have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of cabotage restrictions.|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} of transport costs has increased as liberalization continues to reduce artificial barriers to trade. Countries need to adopt policies to `get closer` to global markets. Can improvements in infrastructure and regulation reduce transport costs? Is it worthwhile to implement policies {{designed to increase}} competition in transport markets? Focusing on air transport, which has increased its share in US imports from 24 percent in 1990 to 35 percent in 2000, this paper quantifies the effects of infrastructure, regulatory quality and liberalization of air cargo markets on transport costs. During the 1990 s, the US implemented a series of <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>agreements,</b> which have provided {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the effect on prices of a change in the competition regime. We find that infrastructure, quality of regulation and competition matter. In our sample, an improvement in airport infrastructure from the 25 th to 75 th percentiles reduces air transport costs 15 percent. A similar improvement in the quality of regulation reduces air transport costs 14 percent. In addition, <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> <b>agreements</b> reduce air transport costs by 8 percent. ...|$|R
