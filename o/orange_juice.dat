5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida <b>orange</b> <b>juice,</b> Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay men and lesbians. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Outbreaks of diarrhoea, {{haemolytic}} uraemic {{syndrome and}} food poisoning {{have been associated}} with the consumption of (apple and orange ciders) and (apple and <b>orange</b> <b>juices).</b> The organisms implicated in these outbreaks have been Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and Salmonella typhi (a group D serotype), indicating the resistance of the serotypes of these organisms to acidic pH. The acid tolerance, the growth, and the survival of these organisms were investigated in both natural (unpasteurized, untreated) and pasteurized, treated apple and <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> and ciders. The effects of benzoic acid, as a preservative, on the growth of the mentioned bacteria subjected to examination, in trypticase soy broth and apple and <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> and ciders were also examined. It was evident that E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and S. typhi (a group D serotype) organisms grew well in trypticase soy broth at pH level ranging from 3. 0 to 9. 0. The growth of both mentioned serotypes were inhibited by adding 0. 05 % of benzoic acid. Similarly, E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. typhi strains grew well in both natural (unpasteurized) as well as in pasteurized apple and <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> and ciders, and the growth was inhibited by adding 0. 1 % of benzoic acid. The possible sources of contamination of natural apple and <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> and ciders with E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and S. typhi (a group D serotype) are discussed.

40|$|The patient's diet {{has been}} {{considered}} an important etiological factor of dentin hypersensitivity. The frequent ingestion of acidic substances can promote the loss of dental structure or remove the smear layer. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the degree of smear layer removal and dentinal tubules exposure by different natural <b>orange</b> <b>juices.</b> Extracted human teeth were submitted to manual scaling in order to develop the smear layer. Seventy dentin samples were obtained and distributed into the following groups: Control, lime orange, lime, valência orange, navel orange, mandarin, and tangerine. Each group included 2 methods of application: Topical and topical + friction. After preparation for SEM analysis, photomicrographs were assessed by a blind calibrated examiner using an index system. The Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant influence of the <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> on smear layer removal. Significant difference was observed between navel orange, valência orange, mandarin and the control group (p < 0. 05). These <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> resulted in greater removal of the smear layer and greater opening of dentinal tubules.

5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the {{ordinance}} proposal was reported in December 1976, a small ripple of protest spread from local churches. Northwest Baptist Church announced it from the pulpit. The news worried one of the church members named Anita Bryant, who was a 36-year-old singer celebrity. Bryant began her career as a local child star on a television show in Oklahoma City and on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. Her young life was marked by frequent moves; her parents divorced each other twice, and she often lived in poverty conditions, but she became a born again Christian at eight years old, and counted her faith and her participation at church as the stabilizing influences in her life. As a child, she asked God to make her a star. She was, by her own admission, remarkably driven and ambitious. In her older teens she became a beauty pageant contestant, winning Miss Oklahoma and second runner-up as Miss America. In 1960, she married a Miami disc jockey named Bob Green and became a professional singer, finding some success with three gold records featuring popular, patriotic, and Gospel standards. She performed with the Bob Hope Christmas tour, entertaining troops serving overseas, and sang at President Lyndon Johnson's funeral in 1973. Since 1969 she had been employed regionally by the Florida Citrus Commission endorsing Florida <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> in television commercials. She also advertised for Coca-Cola, Tupperware, Kraft Foods and Holiday Inn. Bryant's talent agent was married to Ruth Shack; Bryant had contributed $1,000 to her campaign.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Among {{the citrus}} species, C. sinensis {{has been the}} most studied given its {{importance}} in terms of production and its industrial application in <b>juices.</b> Some of <b>orange</b> <b>juice's</b> organoleptic and functional properties, which make it an attractive product for the consumer, are due to its carotenoid composition. Xanthophylls can be found in either their free form (as the carotenes are found) or in a more stable fatty acid esterified form in the case of mono and polyhydroxylated xanthophylls. Detection of adulteration of <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> is of concern to consumers, regulatory agencies and citrus processing industries, and the study of carotenoid ester composition has been proposed to evaluate fruit products' authenticity. In this study, we report on the native (carotenoid esters and free carotenoids) carotenoid profile of <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> of eight different varieties. Materials and methods. Monovarietal fresh <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> were obtained from squeezing mid-season oranges (Citrus sinensis varieties: Bionda, Brasiliana, Moro, Ovale, Sanguinello, Tarocco, Valenc e and Washington) cultivated and supplied by a local producer. After the extraction of the carotenoids from the samples, the analyses were carried out by HPLC-DAD-APCI-MS. Results and discussion. The results showed that, in the juices st udied, the xanthophylls were mostly esterified (93 % of the total carotenoid mean content). The different varieties investigated showed variations in their carotenoid contents. The total carotenoid contents ranged from 2. 42 μg·g – 1 in the Washington variety to 15. 8 μg·g – 1 in the Valencia variety. Among the monoesters, the Valencia variety showed the highest violaxanthin ester amounts (61 %), the Brasiliana variety showed the highest  -cryptoxanthin ester content (86. 9 %) and the Tarocco variety had the highest luteoxanthin ester amount (75. 7 %). Moreover, in general, in the Brasiliana, Ovale, Sanguinello, Valencia and Washington varieties, the monoester contents were higher than the diesters, whereas in the Bionda, Moro and Tarocco varieties the opposite was determined. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that this analytical approach has been applied to characterising, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the whole carotenoid pattern (carotenoid esters and free carotenoids) in <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> from the Bionda, Bras iliana, Moro, Ovale, Sanguinello, Tarocco, Valence and Washington varieties. This contribution could also be used to establish authenticity markers among orange varieties that could potentially be used to prevent adulteration. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
