5|$|Zaireeka was {{the first}} album made by the band since the {{departure}} of guitarist Ronald Jones.

5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E

5|$|The band {{gradually}} rebuilt {{their musical}} and songwriting confidence during these rehearsals {{during the summer}} of 1979, with the styles of the session's early cover songs setting the template for the diverse material that would be written for London Calling. The band were also encouraged by a growing appreciation of drummer Topper Headon's drumming skills, which they realised could be used to perform music in a wide array of genres and styles beyond punk rock. The Clash wrote and recorded demos, with Mick Jones composing and arranging much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> Joe Strummer generally writing the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{idea for}} the game was {{inspired}} by , a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half-jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game to be fun and addictive, {{and to have a}} great deal of replay value.|$|E

Performances designed for a competition setting usually include more esoteric music (including {{but not limited to}} adaptations of modern orchestral pieces). Many traditional style bands compete in contest known as a Battle of the Bands, similar to the Atlanta Classic from the movie Drumline.|$|E

25|$|These {{collections}} of dances {{performed at the}} imperial court show the diversity and cosmopolitan nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> dance of the Tang dynasty: only the Yanyue and Qingshang music originated with the Han Chinese. Music and dance from India, Central Asia, Southeast Asia (Pyu and Funan) and other states bordering Tang China such as Tuyuhun and Nanzhao were performed in the imperial capital Chang'an with performers and dancers in native costume. The Tang imperial court gathered the top dancing talent {{of the country to}} perform a lavish dance that incorporated elements of the dance of China, Korea, India, Persia and Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|This period saw {{civil wars}} {{as well as}} {{conflicts}} with the northern nomads (Wu Hu), resulting in the splintering of China into multiple states and dynasties established by Han and non-Han Chinese people. The imperial court of the Jin dynasty (265–420) was relocated {{to the south and}} many Han Chinese also migrated southwards due to pressure from the northern Hu tribes. This migration resulted in a fusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> dance of the Central Plains with those of the southern local traditions, producing a genre known as Qingshang (清商) music (later known simply as Qingyue 清樂).|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{also have}} {{many ways of}} {{indicating}} class distinctions. English is seen as more direct, one far more suited to the tough quality presented in hip-hop. Eventually, artists began translating music from English to Japanese and performing those direct translations, often leaving {{the bridge of the}} song in English to keep the catchiness of the rhymes and flow. Slowly, with the increase in popularity of rap in Japan, more rappers began using Japanese. Rappers added stressed syllables to their music, altering the natural flow of the language to fit into traditional hip-hop. American injections were also used in raps to help the flow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> often homonyms were placed in raps, which appealed both to the global English-speaking audience and to Japanese speakers, who often would understand the double meanings intended. Japanese was found to allow subtle put downs in raps, which appealed to many audiences.|$|E
25|$|Argentine rock, called rock nacional, is {{the most}} popular music among youth. Arguably the most listened form of Spanish-language rock, its {{influence}} and success internationally owes to a rich, uninterrupted development. Bands such as Soda Stereo or Sumo, and composers like Charly García, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Fito Páez and Andrés Calamaro are referents of national culture. Mid-1960s Buenos Aires and Rosario were cradles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> by 1970, Argentine rock was well established among middle class youth (see: Almendra, Sui Generis, Pappo, Crucis, Pescado Rabioso). Serú Girán bridged the gap into the 1980s, when Argentine bands became popular across Latin America and elsewhere (Enanitos Verdes, Fabulosos Cadillacs and Virus). There are many subgenres: underground, pop-oriented, and some associated with the working class (La Renga, Divididos, Hermética, V8 and Los Redonditos). Current popular bands include: Babasónicos, Los Auténticos Decadentes, Rata Blanca, Horcas, Attaque 77, Bersuit, Los Piojos, Catupecu Machu, Carajo and Callejeros.|$|E
