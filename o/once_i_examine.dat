40|$|Covaluation is the {{generalization}} of coreference introduced by Tanya Reinhart. Covaluation distributes in patterns {{that are very}} similar yet not entirely identical to those of binding. On a widespread view, covaluation and binding distribute similarly because binding is {{defined in terms of}} covaluation. Yet on Reinhart's view, binding and covaluation are not related that way: binding pertains to syntax, covaluation does not. Naturally, the widespread view can easily explain the similarities between binding and covaluation, whereas Reinhart can easily explain the dissimilarities. Reciprocally, the widespread view finds it harder to explain the dissimilarities, whereas Reinhart finds it harder to explain the similarities. Reinhart and others have proposed more than one explanation of the similarities, but as I argue, these explanations do not work. Hence although I adopt Reinhart's view, I propose a new explanation of the similarities and dissimilarities between binding and covaluation: While Reinhart has invoked semantic structure only to explain dissimilarities, I do so to explain both similarities and dissimilarities at <b>once.</b> Finally, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> in light of this approach the topics of language acquisition, only-constructions, the identity predicate, the Partee/Bach/Higginbotham problem, the Dahl puzzle and its recent versions by Roelofsen...|$|R

I am aware that the task may occupy months or even years, for, of course, my opportunities will be limited.

40|$|<b>I</b> <b>examine</b> {{the role}} and {{relationship}} of epistemic and moral values in the Evidence-Based Policy (EBP) paradigm. I argue that several epistemic values that {{play a crucial role}} in shaping standard EBP methodology stand in a trade-off relation with certain kinds of moral and political values. This is because the outputs afforded by standard EBP methods are insufficient for the pursuit of moral and political values that require information about the distribution of individual treatment-effects among agents in a population. <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> a potential reply to this standard concern, and argue that the changes to standard EBP methodology required for rendering research outputs informative about the distributive consequences of policy typically involve the sacrifice of several key EBP epistemic values at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> expand on the implications of this trade-off for value-freedom and -neutrality in EBP...|$|R

6000|$|A rule which forbids social {{intercourse}} {{between members}} of different corps is strict. In the dueling-house, in the parks, on the street, and anywhere and everywhere that the students go, caps of a color group themselves together. If all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one, and that one had two red-cap students at it and ten vacant places, the yellow-caps, the blue-caps, the white caps, and the green caps, seeking seats, would go by that table and not seem to see it, nor seem {{to be aware that}} there was such a table in the grounds. The student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling-place, wore the white cap--Prussian Corps. He introduced us to many white caps, but to none of another color. The corps etiquette extended even to us, who were strangers, and required us to group with the white corps only, and speak only with the white corps, while we were their guests, and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> wished to <b>examine</b> some of the swords, but an American student said, [...] "It would not be quite polite; these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue; they will bring in some with white hilts presently, and those you can handle freely." [...] When a sword was broken in the first duel, I wanted a piece of it; but its hilt was the wrong color, so it was considered best and politest to await a properer season.|$|R

40|$|In {{what follows}} <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> {{problems}} surrounding Barbara Herrnstein Smith's relativist conception {{of value in}} her book Contingencies of Value: Alternative Perspectives for Critical Theory. I begin by showing how her conception of value is comprised of two distinct philosophical claims: the first axiological and the second epistemological. She first presents an anti-objectivist argument for axiological relativism which is quite tenable. She then tries to gain further support for this position by putting forth a version of epistemological relativism, a move which not only fails, but if true would undermine even her relativist axiology. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> have shown her constructivist position to be misleading, if not incoherent, I then reconsider what her axiological position would look like if it {{had the support of}} a more tenable epistemology. I therefore offer a conception of value, borrowed from Paul Grice's The Conception of Value and Allan Gibbard's Wise Choices, Apt Feelings, which argues from a realist epistemology yet accepts a significant degree of axiological relativism...|$|R
