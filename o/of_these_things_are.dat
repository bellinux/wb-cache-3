In a follow-up piece, Schultz discussed the tools used by digital media to achieve community impact, including lower barriers to entry and greater efficiencies {{through the use of}} information systems. Schultz wrote [...] "For members of Anonymous I'm betting most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> already unspoken understandings", and pointed to their use of memes and cited the forums of the website enturbulation.org {{as an example of the}} group's ability to collaborate effectively to accomplish goals.|$|E
500|$|... "Young Girls" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} on Saturday Night Live {{and was released}} as the first promotional single taken from Unorthodox Jukebox, on November 6, 2012 on iTunes. Later, it was reported by Mars that the record {{was scheduled to be}} the second single from the album. This release involved little planning according to Mars [...] "I felt [...] was good. None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> planned, which one goes first, which one goes second. One day I wake up and I say, 'You know what? I want the world to hear this song that I wrote called 'Young Girls,' and I put it out". However, a week later, while performing [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] on the third season finale of The Voice, he announced that the track played would be the second official single from the album. The fifth and overall single, [...] "Young Girls", was first liberated on Australian contemporary hit radio, on November 26, 2013, after being promoted by Mars in radio station, Nova. Subsequently, the song was released to United States and United Kingdom contemporary hit radios on December 10, 2013 and February 17, 2014, respectively. Italian radio stations began adding the track onto their playlist on February 26, 2014. Later, on April 4, 2014 a CD single containing the track as released in Finland.|$|E

2500|$|Al-Bashir has {{rejected}} the charges, saying [...] "Whoever has visited Darfur, met officials and discovered their ethnicities and tribes... {{will know that}} all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> lies." [...] He described the charges as [...] "not worth the ink they are written in." [...] The warrant will be delivered to the Sudanese government, which has stated {{that it will not}} carry it out.|$|E
2500|$|When Time {{magazine}} {{asked about}} The Harry Potter Alliance, Rowling said, [...] "It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting {{to see people}} {{going out there and}} doing that in the name of your character. What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> happening in Darfur. So they really couldn't have chosen a better cause." [...] Rowling awarded The Harry Potter Alliance a Fan Site Award in December 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Default {{reasoning}} and the qualification problem: Many {{of the things}} people know {{take the form of}} [...] "working assumptions". For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> true about all birds. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.|$|E
6000|$|Nay, none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> true miracles, since all, however strange, {{might be}} capable of explanation. What right then had we to expect a marvel now? ...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{users have}} {{experienced}} battery drain problems after updating to iOS 11. In a poll on its website, 70% of 9to5Mac visitors reported decreased battery life after updating {{to the new}} operating system. However, in an article featuring Twitter complaints of battery life, Daily Express wrote that [...] "honestly, {{this is to be}} expected. It happens every year, and it's completely normal. Major iOS releases will hammer the battery on your device much faster during {{the first few days of}} use", with Forbes stating in an article that [...] "The days after you install a new version of iOS, your iDevice is busy doing all sorts of housekeeping. Practically all of your apps have updates, so iOS is busy downloading and installing them in the background. [...] Additionally, after you install a new version of iOS, it has to do something called [...] "re-indexing." [...] During this process, iOS 11 will comb through all of the data on your device so that it can be cataloged for quick Spotlight searching." [...] The article further states that [...] "The good news is that both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> temporary".|$|E

6000|$|We {{talked of}} religion; I {{think she was}} the first person to thaw the private silences that had kept me bound in these matters even from myself for years. I can still recall her face, a little flushed and coming nearer to mine after avowals and comparisons. [...] "But Stephen," [...] she says; [...] "if none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> really true, why do they keep on telling them to us? What is true? What are we for? What is Everything for?" ...|$|E
60|$|In none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>was</b> Billy interested.

60|$|Alas! our ignorance <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> {{manifest}} by our {{unwillingness to}} abide affliction, by our secret murmuring under {{the hand of}} God; by our wondering why we are so chastised as we are, by our thinking long that the affliction is no sooner removed.|$|R
50|$|The nomen {{could be}} derived from any number of things, such as {{the name of an}} ancestor; a person's occupation; {{physical}} appearance, behavior, or characteristics; or town of origin.

6000|$|... "Dear," [...] she said, [...] "do {{you think}} any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> worth a moment's {{consideration}} {{to a woman}} against {{the love of the}} man she cares for? We are all the same, though some of us do not wear our hearts upon our sleeves. The longing for love is always there, and the women who go hungry for it through life are the women to be pitied. Douglas, I would change places with that simple, dark-eyed little girl you were with this evening if--if I could marry you to-morrow. Is that too bold?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I spoke {{a moment}} ago of the {{existence}} of some superstitions that have been parading the world as facts this long time. For instance, consider the Dollar. The world seems to think that the love of money is [...] "American"; and that the mad desire to get suddenly rich is [...] "American." [...] I believe that both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> merely and broadly human, not American monopolies at all. The love of money is natural to all nations, for money is a good and strong friend. I think that this love has existed everywhere, ever since the Bible called it the root of all evil.|$|E
60|$|As Job sayes, God has strook them as wicked men in {{the open}} sight of others, Job 34. 26. So that I cannot conceive, since their sin and Judgment was so conspicuous, that my admonishing the world thereof, should turn to their detriment: For the {{publishing}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> <b>are,</b> so far as Relation is concerned, intended for remembrancers: That they may also bethink themselves, repent and turn to God, lest the Judgments for their sins should prove hereditary. For the God of Heaven hath threatned to visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, if they hate him, to {{the third and fourth}} generation, Exod. 20. 5.|$|E
50|$|In addition, archeological finds add {{evidence}} to the documents {{and the results of}} toponymic research. Around the city of Caen and in the Bessin (Vierville-sur-Mer, Bénouville, Giverville, Hérouvillette), excavations have shown numerous Anglo-Saxon jewellery, design elements, settings and weapons. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> discovered in cemeteries in a context of the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries AD.|$|R
50|$|These {{cases were}} {{revisited}} for two reasons. For one their lawyers {{never gave up}} fighting for them. Second the Virginia courts passed the law to let felons petition for DNA testing. Since both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> done {{to a great extent}} the cases were reopened and retested. It proved that they were innocent of the charges after all.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, some there were, {{who even}} in the face <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the {{specific}} details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.|$|R
60|$|None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> bad {{pieces of}} art; and yet,--if it were offered {{to me to}} have, instead of them, so many windows, out of which I should see, first, the real chain of the Alps from the Superga; then the real block of gneiss, and Aiguilles-Rouges; then the real towers of Fribourg, and pine forest; the real Isola Bella; and, finally, the true Mary and Elizabeth; and beneath them, the actual old monk at work in his cell,--I would very unhesitatingly change my five {{pictures}} for the five windows; and so, I apprehend, would most people, not, it seems to me, unwisely.|$|E
60|$|Now, it's {{all very}} well that these big people should be frightened out of their wits by an old wife talking with her mouth shut; {{that is one of}} the things we happen to know about. All the old women in the world might talk with their mouths shut, and not frighten you or me, but there are plenty of other things that frighten us badly. And if we only knew about them, perhaps we should find them no more worthy to be feared than an old woman talking with her mouth shut. And the names of some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> Death, and Pain, and Sorrow.|$|E
60|$|Of course {{our present}} {{collections}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> the merest {{beginnings of the}} accumulations we may hope for in the future, when there are searchers {{enough to make a}} thorough examination of all possible sources and when other countries in the world, now inaccessible to archæologists, have been explored in some detail. The greater part of Africa and Asia has never even been traversed yet by a trained observer interested in these matters and free to explore, and we must be very careful therefore not to conclude that the early true men were distinctively inhabitants of western Europe or that they first appeared in that region.|$|E
60|$|None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> lost upon Percy Singleton, and I often {{wondered}} why he did not hate me. He was {{of the kind that}} never shows a hurt.
