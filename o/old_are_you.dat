He asked Wright if he had three boys in the house from Chicago. Till was sharing a bed with another cousin; there were eight people in the small two-bedroom cabin. Milam asked Wright {{to take them to}} [...] "the nigger who did the talking." [...] Till's {{great-aunt}} offered the men money, but Milam refused as he rushed Emmet to put on his clothes.
