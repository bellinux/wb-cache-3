5|$|In the mid-2000s, {{the route}} was reconfigured in the {{northern}} part of Medina to use Main and Commercial streets instead of Center Street and Prospect Avenue. The change was made as part of a village project known as the Pass Thru Project, and the realignment eliminated a three-block overlap with the easternmost part of NY31E <b>on</b> <b>Center</b> Street. Ownership and maintenance of NY63's former alignment was transferred from the state to the village on July1, 2010, as part of a highway maintenance swap that gave Commercial Street and the northernmost block of Main Street to the state.|$|E

5|$|The Raiders won {{the coin}} toss and {{deferred}} {{in the second}} half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed <b>on</b> <b>center</b> Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal.|$|E

25|$|The route {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of 500 West (US-89) and Center Street in Provo, with SR-114 heading west on the latter, a four-lane highway. The route reaches an interchange at I-15, where it narrows down to one lane in each direction. The highway continues west <b>on</b> <b>Center</b> Street before reaching Geneva Road—a two-lane highway—where the route turns north onto. Geneva Road turns northwest before intersecting with 820 North. Now the first road east of Utah Lake, the road curves in a more north-northwesterly direction while entering Orem. The road also begins to parallel I-15 at this point, also intersecting University Parkway (SR-265) where it becomes a five lane highway. Past 800 South, SR-114 turns north and intersects Orem's Center Street. Turning north-northwest again, the highway crosses 800 North (SR-52) and passes under I-15 before turning north one final time, and entering Pleasant Grove. The road terminates at State Street (US-89).|$|E
25|$|State Route 300 was {{designated}} in 1972 to serve Snow Canyon State Park, running from SR-18 {{south to the}} southern boundary of the park. In 1991, the Utah Transportation Commission passed a resolution {{to create a new}} State Route 8, pending roadway improvements, which would absorb the entire length of SR-300, and continue south through Ivins <b>on</b> <b>Center</b> Street and 200 East and southeast on Santa Clara Drive and Sunset Boulevard (old US-91) back to SR-18. Sunset Boulevard between SR-18 and Dixie Downs Road was so improved and added to the state highway system in 1996, and at that time SR-300 was renumbered as a second piece of SR-8. As requested by the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation so they could carry out their resource management plan, the latter portion was removed from the state highway system in 1999, leaving only the present extent of SR-8.|$|E

25|$|The state {{legislature}} designated two routes in 1969 that served the areas east of Logan's Main Street, following {{in part the}} old road from the 19th century. State Route 238 began at SR-165 in Nibley, and headed east on 200 South into Millville, then north on that city's Main Street, becoming Providence's 200 West. It jogged east on 100 South (changed to 100 North in 1970 to remove traffic from the city center) to 100 West, and then continued north into River Heights on its 600 East (numbered to match Logan's grid). Finally, it turned west on River Heights Boulevard (changed to 600 South in 1970 to avoid hills), north on 400 East into Logan, and west on 300 South to end at US-91. State Route 237 continued north from Logan, beginning at US-89 (400 North) and 600 East, and following 600 East, 1000 North, and 800 East through North Logan. In Hyde Park, the name changed to 250 East, and SR-237 turned west on 200 South, north on Main Street, and west <b>on</b> <b>Center</b> Street to a northern terminus at US-91.|$|E
25|$|In July 1924 when Arthur Dove and Helen Torr sailed into Huntington Harbor aboard their 42-foot yawl, Mona, {{they could}} not have {{anticipated}} the extent to which Long Island’s North Shore would inspire some of their greatest paintings. They lived in Halesite until the Great Depression when both Dove and Torr moved back to the Dove's estate located in Geneva. Longing to be back on Long Island, in 1938 they moved back into their first home, a former post office and general store <b>on</b> <b>Center</b> Shore Road in Centerport, New York. They purchased the house for $980.00. Their tiny, one-room cottage stood {{on the edge of the}} Titus Mill Pond. Almost immediately, Dove was found to have pneumonia; he eventually suffered from a heart attack and was diagnosed with a debilitating kidney disorder. In terrible health for the remainder of his days, he lived quietly, finally about to devote himself entirely to painting, and focusing on the inspiration of his surroundings and his home. Some of the most powerful paintings of his career, including Indian Summer, were painted in Centerport. Torr remained in the house on the millpond but never painted again. After her death in 1967, works by Torr and Dove were hung together in The Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1979.|$|E
