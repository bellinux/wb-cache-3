25|$|An <b>oral</b> <b>health</b> {{assessment}} {{carried out}} before a child reaches {{the age of}} one may help with management of caries. The <b>oral</b> <b>health</b> assessment should include checking the child’s history, a clinical examination, checking the risk of caries in the child including the state of their occlusion and assessing how well equipped the child’s parent or carer {{is to help the}} child prevent caries. In order to further increase a child’s cooperation in caries management, good communication by the dentist {{and the rest of the}} staff of a dental practice should be used. This communication can be improved by calling the child by their name, using eye contact and including them in any conversation about their treatment.|$|E

A strong correlation was determined between the patient that concluded his treatment and his return to the preventive check up. However, no correlation was found between the oral hygiene and the performer of this hygiene (patient and/or parent). The oral hygiene’s quality was related to the clinical conditions (diagnosis), because the ones that lacked motricity skills or showed intelligence deficiency presented higher scores for “regular” to “poor” oral hygiene among all the ones studied.

Subjects were recruited from age range (4 – 14 years) by purposive sampling. A total of 270 cased were interviewed and examined. Data were collected from school going children in different rural areas of Bangladesh. All children were interviewed (face-to-face) using a semistructured questionnaire. Clinical examination was performed to measure the oral hygiene status. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS program version 16. 0.

25|$|Chewing gum in {{many forms}} has existed since the Neolithic period. 6,000-year-old chewing gum made from birch bark tar, with tooth imprints, {{has been found in}} Kierikki in Finland.
