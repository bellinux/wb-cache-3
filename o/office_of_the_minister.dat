5|$|During Western Han, the Minister of Finance's {{powers were}} limited to the public treasury, the Minister Steward being {{responsible}} for the emperor's private wealth. However, in Eastern Han, the responsibilities for the public treasury and the emperor's private wealth were amalgamated and entrusted solely to the Minister of Finance, which later proved disastrous when handled by irresponsible emperors such as Ling (r. 168–189 AD). During Western Han, the Minister of Finance managed the government's monopolized salt and iron agencies, which were abolished during Eastern Han and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship. He also managed the government's brief monopoly over liquor from 98–81 BC, before it was returned to private production. Although the Minister Steward and then the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed the imperial mint for issuing standard coins during Western Han, in Eastern Han the imperial mint {{was transferred to the}} <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minister</b> of Finance.|$|E

25|$|Guo Jia {{was from}} Yangzhai County (陽翟縣), Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), {{which is in}} present-day Yuzhou, Henan. As a youth, he was famous for his {{intelligence}} and foresight. Since reaching adulthood at around the age of 19, Guo Jia had been travelling {{around the country and}} befriending members of the scholar-gentry and other talented persons. He did not associate himself with the hoi polloi and was thus not very well known outside of his circles. However, all those who knew him recognised his talent and felt that he was extraordinary. When he was 26, he served in the Han government as a minor official in the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minister</b> over the Masses (司徒).|$|E
25|$|Sun Yi was {{the third}} son of the warlord Sun Jian and his wife Lady Wu. He {{was known for his}} martial valour and fiery personality, which made him {{resemble}} his eldest brother Sun Ce. He was nominated as a xiaolian (civil service candidate) by Zhu Zhi and served in the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minister</b> of Works. After Sun Jian was killed in action at the Battle of Xiangyang in 191, Sun Ce succeeded him and took over command of his troops. Between 194 and 199, Sun Ce launched a series of conquests in the Jiangdong region and established his power base there. In 200 CE, when Sun Ce was mortally wounded during a hunting expedition, his adviser Zhang Zhao and other subjects believed that he would designate Sun Yi as his successor, but Sun Ce chose his second brother Sun Quan instead.|$|E
25|$|Around the time, Emperor Ling {{wanted to}} build bronze statues but {{realised}} that the imperial treasury was unable to support his spending, so he issued a decree to increase taxes and recruit labour from the masses. Lu Kang observed that the people were already suffering from natural disasters such as floods and droughts, so he wrote a memorial to Emperor Ling, advising him against constructing the bronze statues and urging him to relieve the people's burdens. The eunuchs (Emperor Ling's close aides) accused Lu Kang of defaming the emperor and showing disrespect in the memorial, so Lu was arrested and brought to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minister</b> of Justice (廷尉) for questioning. Liu Dai, an Imperial Clerk (侍御史), carefully examined Lu Kang's case and wrote to the imperial court to explain matters for Lu and clear his name. Lu Kang was released but was dismissed from office and sent home. However, not long later, he was recalled back to the court {{to serve as a}} Consultant (議郎).|$|E

500|$|In 119 BC, the {{government}} issued the bronze wushu (五銖) coin weighing the coin remained the standard currency in China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). During the brief interruptive Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) of Wang Mang (45 BC– 23 AD), {{the government}} introduced several new denominations in 7, 9, 10, and 14 AD. These new units (including bronze knife money, gold, silver, tortoise, and cowry shell currencies) often had a market price unequal to their weight and debased {{the value of}} coin currency. Once the widespread civil wars following Wang's overthrow abated, the wushu coin was reintroduced by Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25–57 AD) in 40 AD at the instigation of Ma Yuan (14 BC– 49 AD). Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed all commandery mints in 113 BC and granted the central government's Superintendent of Waterways and Parks the exclusive right to mint coins. Although the issue of central government coinage {{was transferred to the}} <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minister</b> of Finance (one of Nine Ministers of the central government) by the beginning of Eastern Han, the central government's monopoly over the issue of coinage persisted.|$|E

60|$|His brain {{began to}} spin. He sought tho <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minister</b> of Marine, {{and made a}} report of his expedition, and of the Island of the Seven Cities, which he had so {{fortunately}} discovered. No body knew any thing of such an expedition, or such an island. He declared that he had undertaken the enterprise under a formal contract with the crown, and had received a regular commission, constituting him Adelantado. This must be matter of record, and he insisted loudly, that the books of the department should be consulted. The wordy strife at length {{attracted the attention of}} an old, gray-headed clerk, who sat perched on a high stool, at a high desk, with iron-rimmed spectacles {{on the top of a}} thin, pinched nose, copying records into an enormous folio. He had wintered and summered in the department for a great part of a century, until he had almost grown to be a piece of the desk at which he sat; his memory was a mere index of official facts and documents, and his brain was little better than red tape and parchment. After peering down for a time from his lofty perch, and ascertaining the matter in controversy, he put his pen behind his ear, and descended. He remembered to have heard something from his predecessor about an expedition of the kind in question, but then it had sailed during the reign of Don Ioam II., and he had been dead at least a hundred years. To put the matter beyond dispute, however, the archives of the Torve do Tombo, that sepulchre of old Portuguese documents, were diligently searched, and a record was found of a contract between the crown and one Fernando de Ulmo, for the discovery of the Island of the Seven Cities, and of a commission secured to him as Adelantado of the country he might discover.|$|E
