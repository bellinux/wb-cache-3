5|$|In spite <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of {{his role}} in these nuclear tests, Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are no records of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon jihad, {{perhaps because of the}} internal troubles in Bundu at that time, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and {{he received a}} command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, {{he was an old}} man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E

5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, {{but were}} defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the Sack of Moguntiacum and the Sack of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.|$|E
25|$|Despite drug {{legislation}} (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of it), large, organized criminal {{drug cartels}} operate worldwide. Advocates of decriminalization argue that drug prohibition makes drug dealing a lucrative business, leading {{to much of}} the associated criminal activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{vicinity}} of Jacob Lake remained popular despite, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of, its relative inaccessibility. It {{was an important}} source of lumber and game for local settlements, and cattle would graze on the Kaibab's abundant grass during the summer months. During the winter months, ten feet of snow was not an unusual occurrence.|$|E
5000|$|The chook raffle is {{a special}} case of a meat raffle, but is more often used as a {{fund-raising}} activity by an amateur club <b>or</b> organisation. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of this association, the expression tends to be used disparagingly about someone who claims to have, or should have, superior organisational skills, that they [...] "couldn't run a chook raffle".|$|R

25|$|Bullock {{took his}} job seriously, deputizing several {{residents}} and tackling {{the job of}} civilizing the camp. Despite (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of) a reputation for fearlessness and an uncompromising nature, Bullock managed the task without killing anyone. Bullock had several 'run ins' with Al Swearengen, proprietor of the notorious Gem Theater, Deadwood's most notable brothel. Swearengen {{had a knack for}} making money from vice and shrewdly invested some of his profits in cultivating alliances with the camp's wealthy and powerful.|$|E
25|$|Homosexuality in the United Kingdom was decriminalised in 1967, {{leading to}} a more liberal public attitude. There are many openly gay {{politicians}} and entertainers who remained elected and popular {{with little or no}} criticism or comment on their sexuality. However, football has been distinctly lacking in openly gay men. Despite this, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of this, rumours in the press, or joking between fans and players and even hostile homophobic abuse have been common within the game.|$|E
25|$|Despite, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of, the {{pressure}} and stress put upon the young emperor, he despised learning {{for the majority of}} his life. According to Weng Tonghe's diary, the emperor could not read a memorandum in full sentences by the age of 16. Worried about her son's inability to learn, Cixi only pressured him more. When he was given personal rule at the age of 18, in November 1873 (four years behind the usual custom), the Tongzhi Emperor proved to be an incompetent ruler.|$|E

The first {{writing of}} the term would fairly easily be picked out as referring to sexual interactions, whereas the second term could just mean [...] "the customs of {{the southern part of}} China." [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> male sexual arousal is easier to spot where heavy clothing is not worn, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> simply <b>because</b> of the frequent use of this term, homosexuality came to be regarded as more common and accepted {{in the southern part of}} China.|$|R

25|$|Despite (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of) {{the fact}} that Wonder Woman {{had fallen in love}} with the first Steve Trevor, the {{producers}} chose to drop any suggestion that Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman were anything more than good friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinand {{violated}} the 1491 Treaty of Granada peace treaty in 1502 by dismissing the clearly guaranteed religious freedom for Mudéjar Muslims. Ferdinand forced all Muslims in Castile and Aragon to convert, converso Moriscos, to Catholicism, or else be expelled. Some of the Muslims who remained were mudéjar artisans, who could {{design and build}} in the Moorish style. This was also practised by the Spanish inquisitors on the converso Marrano Jewish population of Spain. The main architect behind the Spanish Inquisition was King Ferdinand II, who was ironically of converso heritage (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of it, {{he may have been}} embittered by being the great-grandson of Fadrique's mistress).|$|E
25|$|Joseon {{was founded}} on Korean Confucianism, and these {{scholars}} of the time took a very dim view of professional women and of the kisaeng class in particular. There were many calls for {{the abolition of the}} kisaeng, or for their exclusion from court, but these were not successful—perhaps because of the influence of the women themselves, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of fear that officials would take to stealing the wives of other men. One such proposal was made during the reign of Sejong the Great, but when an advisor of the court suggested that the abolition of the class would lead to government officials committing grave crimes, the king chose to preserve the kisaeng.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people think}} of {{therapeutic}} and undesired side effects as only applying to medications, drugs <b>or</b> supplements, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> pharmacology approaches are more often more rigorously evaluated by carefully controlled comparisons with placebo treatments, {{but this is not}} the case.

25|$|Despite (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of) his {{two years}} as a Socialist parliamentarian, Ben Gitlow professed a belief in revolutionary Socialism. From its {{earliest}} days in 1919, Ben Gitlow was an adherent of the proto-Communist Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, working closely with renowned radical journalist and war correspondent John Reed. In April 1919, the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party of Local Greater New York established an official weekly newspaper called The New York Communist. Reed was named {{the editor of the}} new publication, with Maximilian Cohen handling the day-to-day operations of the publication as its business manager. Effective with the June 14, 1919, issue, Max Cohen exited the scene and Ben Gitlow assumed the post of business manager.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck's {{conflict}} with the legislators intensified in the coming years. Following the Alvensleben Convention of 1863, the House of Deputies resolved that it could no longer {{come to terms with}} Bismarck; in response, the King dissolved the Diet, accusing it of trying to obtain unconstitutional control over the ministry—which, under the Constitution, was responsible solely to the king. Bismarck then issued an edict restricting the freedom of the press, an edict that even gained the public opposition of the Crown Prince. Despite (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of) his attempts to silence critics, Bismarck remained a largely unpopular politician. His supporters fared poorly in the elections of October 1863, in which a liberal coalition, whose primary member was the Progress Party, won over two-thirds of the seats. The House made repeated calls for Bismarck to be dismissed, but the King supported him, fearing that if he did dismiss the Minister President, he would most likely be succeeded by a liberal.|$|E
25|$|Outside of Tibeto-Burman, {{one finds}} in Arunachal Pradesh a single {{representative}} of the Tai family, spoken by tribes like the Khampti and Singpho, which is closely affiliated to the Shan language of Myanmar's Shan State. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern Myanmar. In addition to these non-Indo-European languages, the Indo-European languages Assamese, Bengali, English, Nepali and especially Hindi are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily {{as a result of}} the primary education system—in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking immigrant teachers from Bihar and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-creolized variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state. Despite, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of, the linguistic diversity of the region, English is the only official language recognised in the state.|$|E
60|$|In {{order that}} he might not be an unwelcome visitor, Seth had had {{sufficient}} good sense never to enter the building without an express invitation <b>or</b> permission, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> he was thus scrupulous the men were all the more willing to admit him.|$|R

25|$|From the 2nd century onwards, {{many of the}} Germanic tribes {{recorded}} as active during the Principate started to unite into bigger tribal unions, such as the Franks, Alamanni, Bavarii, and Saxons. The Lombards are not mentioned at first, perhaps {{because they were not}} initially on the border of Rome, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> they were subjected to a larger tribal union, like the Saxons. It is, however, highly probable that, when the bulk of the Lombards migrated, a considerable part remained behind and afterwards became absorbed by the Saxon tribes in the Elbe region, while the emigrants alone retained the name of Lombards. However, the Codex Gothanus states that the Lombards were subjected by the Saxons around 300 but rose up against them under their first king, Agelmund, who ruled for 30 years. In {{the second half of the}} 4th century, the Lombards left their homes, probably due to bad harvests, and embarked on their migration.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a {{campaign}} had been started {{to build a}} memorial {{to the victims of}} the Holocaust in Berlin. It was felt by at least some Germans that there was something wrong about the Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to any of the people killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist Lea Rosh to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters. In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built. Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, a Michigan State University student, James Dallas Egbert III, {{allegedly}} {{disappeared into}} the school's steam tunnels while playing a live-action version of D. In fact, Egbert was discovered in Louisiana several weeks later, but negative mainstream media attention focused on D as the cause. In 1982, Patricia Pulling's son killed himself. Blaming D for her son's suicide, Pulling formed an organization named B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons) to attack {{the game and the}} company that produced it. Gygax defended the game on a segment of 60 Minutes, which aired in 1985. When death threats started arriving at the TSR office, Gygax hired a bodyguard. Despite the negative publicity, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of it, TSR's annual D sales increased in 1982 to , and in January 1983, The New York Times speculated that D might become [...] "the great game of the 1980s" [...] in the same manner that Monopoly was emblematic of the Great Depression.|$|E
