500|$|The single [...] "Undone - The Sweater Song" [...] was {{described}} by Cuomo as [...] "the feeling you get when the train stops and the little guy comes knockin' <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>door.</b> It {{was supposed to be}} a sad song, but everyone thinks it's hilarious." [...] The video marks one of the early directorial efforts of Spike Jonze, whose pitch was simply [...] "A blue stage, a steadicam, a pack of wild dogs." [...] The video became an instant hit on MTV. [...] The final single, [...] "Say it Ain't So", was again inspired by Cuomo believing his parents split up when he was four because he thought his dad was an alcoholic. The music video, which was directed by Sophie Muller, was less successful than the previous Spike Jonze-directed video. It featured the band performing in the garage of their former house, and the bandmates playing hacky sack in the backyard.|$|E
2500|$|Their debut single, [...] "Trojans", was {{released}} on 4 May 2011. It was co-written by all four members. They entered the track on national radio station Triple J's talent contest Unearthed's website. In the United States in June, [...] "Trojans" [...] received its first favorable review from Neon Gold's Andrew Hwang, who proclaimed that, [...] " [...] knocks <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>door</b> and creeps into your peripheries in stealth mode" [...] and that the single [...] "approaches Phoenix-esque levels of infectiousness". By September that year, it was placed on high rotation by satellite radio station Sirius XM's Alt Nation channel.|$|E
2500|$|The spot {{advertising}} for the fictional United Trek Federation was {{a spot on}} Darker Projects, premiering on the sixth third-season episode of Star Trek: The Section 31 Files called Invasion, Part III - Warday. In this spot, an announcer says [...] "How many times does this happen to you?", followed by the two geeks downloading a possible new Star Trek episode ( [...] or Section 31) available. Instead, they stumbled upon Doctor Who, and attempts to free the computer unsuccessful as it detonated, marking [...] "another tragic act of computer terrorism {{at the hands of}} the Who World Order." [...] The announcer then asks: [...] "Do you wake up in the middle of the night, wondering today's the day the forces of the Who World Order will come knocking <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>door,</b> to drag you off to their Who Relocation Camps?" [...] It is then the United Trek Federation is introduced. What happens next is that a young woman (voiced by Kara Dennison) shouting her Trek DVDs have been stolen by some Dinomonster. This particular agent is being intercepted by the UTF agent who's there for her, and the stolen DVDs are recovered back. It concludes with the line: [...] "With the United Trek Federation, you can sleep easily. Knowing the monsters of the Who World Order have at last met their match. United Trek Federation. We are here to protect you!" ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{things in}} {{agriculture}} move fast. Technology is growing and changing rapidly. Input dealers are knocking <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>doors</b> earlier and earlier each year. This summer {{it seemed like}} many producers were dealing with marketing their 2010 crop, growing their 2011 crop and making input decisions on their 2012 crop. Each of these things complicates the tax planning each year. Add that to the record high profitability many agricultural producers have seen {{over the past five}} years, {{and one of the most}} common comments I’m hearing is “I think I’m going to have a tax problem this year. ” You’re not alone, but it creates a need for tax planning to be more than something you do two weeks before the end of the year. Ten years ago, the income patterns for many farmers seemed to be one good year followed by one not so good year, followed by another good year. Somewhere along the past decade we lost that pattern. According to the accrual net farm income numbers we generate each year, we have seen five straight years of record high incomes at levels that were unheard of before this. While this has been great for the economies of many agriculturally based states and for the producers themselves, it does bring us right back to having a tax problem...|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{communication}} {{has become}} global and almost instantaneous, {{and as the}} Editor in Chief, I {{feel that it is}} my duty to present you with the BJBMS as one of the main platforms highlighting the increasing advancements in the basic medicine. The BJBMS aims to cover the broadness of basic medical science and also make the link between the basic research and clinical studies and vice versa. In this we fully depend on you, as potential authors submitting manuscripts to our Journal. But the mainstay of the Journal is top-quality original science. Which studies receive the highest priority? This obviously strongly depends on novelty, the relevance of the research question, and on the strength of the design and data. We also feature strong cell biology and animal studies, which provide the scientific basis of the clinical sciences. As many of you know, we love novel technology, so new molecular methods, imaging and proof-of-concept therapy receive relatively high priority in our Journal. The BJBMS reaches out to you through the web, at www. bjbms. org and of course in its printed form, which arrives <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>doors</b> every three months. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the electronic BJBMS has about 1500 visits per month! It’s twice more than in the same time last year. The largest number of visitors is from Bosnia & Herzegovina, USA, Serbia, Turkey, India, Croatia, etc. We will continue to make a positive selection of the best papers, which at the time being means we accept one in five/six submitted manuscripts. Based on the above, we will adjust our 2007 instructions to authors at our journal. This is based on the uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals 1. Please read it, because it is meant to assist you in getting your manuscripts up to the currently advocated international quality standards. All this illustrates a delightful balance between dynamics and innovation on the one hand, and consistency and experience on the other. This is the way we like it; this is our BJBMS. </p...|$|R
