40|$|Purpose Although a population's {{senescence}} rate is classically {{measured as}} {{the increase in}} mortality rate with age <b>on</b> <b>a</b> logarithmic <b>scale,</b> {{it may be more}} accurately measured as the increase <b>on</b> <b>a</b> linear <b>scale.</b> Patients <b>on</b> dialysis, who suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality rate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> logarithmic <b>scale,</b> but <b>a</b> larger increase <b>on</b> <b>a</b> linear <b>scale</b> than patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be biased by population heterogeneity. Methods Follow-up data on 323, 308 patients on dialysis and 91, 679 patients with a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models that allow individual variation in this increase. Results According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase in mortality rate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> logarithmic <b>scale</b> was smaller in patients on dialysis, while the senescence rate measured as the increase <b>on</b> <b>a</b> linear <b>scale</b> was larger in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.

5|$|After the Revolution of 1848, then-Count Wilhelm {{became the}} first duke of Urach. A passionate {{artillery}} officer, he desired to improve the defenses of his castle and so began to build pre-outwork caponiers {{in the style of}} the imperial Fortress of Ulm (though not <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> as grand) and a trench along the fortress to deter attack. Later he had cannons placed in the bastions on the walls. From 1898 to 1901 the two buildings left of the main gate, the Ducal Palace and the old groundskeepers house, were constructed and expanded respectively. A motion to build a cableway up to the castle in 1911 was rejected because it was believed it would ruin the beauty of the castle.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the causal factors influencing students adversity between twelfth grade and third-year vocational students in Sisaket province, Thailand. Six hundred and seventy two of twelfth grade and 376 third-year vocational students were selected by multi-stage random sampling techniques. Approach: The instruments used for collecting data were: <b>A</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> self-esteem, <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> dominance, <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> self-confidence, <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> sense of personal freedom, <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> achievement motivation, <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> ambition, <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> enthusiasm, <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> responsibility, <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> future orientation, and <b>an</b> adversity quotient <b>scale.</b> The data were analyzed by validity test of the causal relationship model. Results: The results of the study were as follows: (1) variables influencing the adversity quotient of 12 th grade and third-year vocational students were dominance, sense of personal freedom, self-esteem, enthusiasm, self-confidence, ambition and achievement motivation. (2) Variables are directly influencing the adversity quotient of twelfth grade students was self-confidence while the variables both directly and indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of students were dominance, sense of personal freedom, self-esteem, and enthusiasm. (3) Variable are directly influencing adversity quotient of third-year vocational students was achievement motivation, the variables are indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of these students was dominance while the variables both directly and indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of these students were sense of personal freedom, self-esteem, enthusiasm, self-confidence, and ambition.
