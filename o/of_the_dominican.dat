5|$|The {{island of}} Hispaniola was also {{predicted}} to be heavily {{affected by the}} storm. Workers from World Vision supplied food, clean water, medicines and emergency generators in the southern provinces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic, and in the southern departments of Haiti where hurricane warnings had been issued. In low-lying areas, 1,580residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic and more than 1,000Haitians were evacuated as the storm approached. Small craft were advised to stay in port, while Haiti's Toussaint Louverture International Airport was closed.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Puerto Rico, {{the hurricane}} passed just north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic, producing very little damage. This {{was due to}} the small core and weaker winds to the south of the center. Advance warning reduced the number of ships traversing the region.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, the government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, while the government of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor the progress of the storm. After the heavy rainfall began in the Dominican Republic, officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E

5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of August 31, {{tropical}} storm warnings were dropped for Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, and St. Kitts while hurricane watches were issued for the southeast Bahamas as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands. Hurricane watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings later that morning.

On the morning of September 1, a hurricane watch was issued for the northwest Bahamas while the watch for the central Bahamas was upgraded to a warning. That afternoon, warnings were dropped for the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic, {{then known as}} Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo, but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions for the protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm.|$|E

5|$|Cindy brought {{considerable}} rainfall {{to southern}} and eastern parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic, with totals of 4–10in (100–255mm). Upon the storm's landfall in the country, winds reached 35mph (55km/h) in Barahona. The rain filled rivers and caused scattered street flooding, affecting hundreds of houses. In Villa Altagracia, onefatality occurred when a child drowned in flood waters; the final death toll for the country stood at two. There were no reports of damage elsewhere after Cindy's rapid demise over Hispaniola, though its remnants likely produced localized showers in Haiti.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lili {{was one of}} {{only five}} Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclones on record to reach hurricane status in the month of December. The final of thirteen tropical storms in the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season, Lili developed as a subtropical cyclone which originated from a frontal trough to the south of Bermuda on December 12. It tracked southeastward, then northward, slowly attaining tropical characteristics and becoming a hurricane on December 20. Lili turned to the south and southwest, briefly threatening the northern Caribbean islands before weakening and dissipating near the coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic. The storm produced light rainfall but no damage.|$|E

50|$|Dupax {{started as}} a mission by <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Priests to convert the native group called Isinays into Christianity at around 1602. <b>The</b> <b>Dominicans</b> pushed through with <b>the</b> evangelization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region until 1704 when the {{missions}} were turned over to <b>the</b> Augustinians because <b>of</b> lack of personnel.
