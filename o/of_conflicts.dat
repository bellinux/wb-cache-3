5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> {{occurred}} between the Empire and its neighbors.

The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to come to a better {{understanding}} of desire through an examination of certain kinds <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> desire. Standard accounts <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> desire involve a two-part analysis. First, desires are held to conflict just in case the satisfaction of one precludes the satisfaction of the other; second, a desire is said to be satisfied just in case the propositional content of the desire is true. I argue that this account <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> rests in an inadequate notion of desire satisfaction, and suggest a revision of our understanding of desire satisfaction to yield a better account <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> desire. This account of satisfaction requires that we recognize as a fundamental feature of desire, alongside the desire ’s strength and content, the desire ’s role.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the causal effects <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> on dietary energy supply in C 4 te d'Ivoire. To identify the true impact <b>of</b> <b>conflict,</b> we use prewar and post-war household data bracketing the conflict {{period and the}} spatial variation in the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> between the North and South regions. Our second identification strategy uses the specific counts <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> events across departments. For our third identification strategy, we employ self-reported victimization indicators at the individual level. Combining data from household surveys (Households Living Standards Surveys) and the conflict database (ACLED), we find robust and statistically significant evidence of households in the worst-hit conflict areas and individuals who are the direct victims <b>of</b> the <b>conflict</b> having lower dietary energy supply. The propensity score matching estimates do not alter the main findings. Other robustness checks including firstly, subsamples of households with children and secondly, alternative estimation <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> intensity provide mixed but encouraging evidence that supports the impact <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> on food security...|$|R
