Shortly thereafter, the FPÖ attempted {{to become a member}} of the Europe for Freedom and Democracy group, but was vetoed by some of its parties. The FPÖ's two MEPs are individual members of the establishing European Alliance for Freedom. After the 2014 European elections, the party joined the National Front, the Northern League, Vlaams Belang and the Czech Civic Conservative Party in forming the Movement for a Europe <b>of</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Freedom, and participated along with these parties, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alternative for Germany, the Polish Congress of the New Right and a former member of the UK Independence Party in the Europe <b>of</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Freedom parliamentary group.|$|E
5|$|Belgians began campaigning against Lumumba, {{whom they}} wanted to marginalise; they {{accused him of being}} a {{communist}} and, hoping to fragment the nationalist movement, supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT. Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the French Community or British Commonwealth <b>of</b> <b>Nations,</b> <b>and</b> that close economic and political association with Belgium would continue. As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in a broad MNC majority.|$|E

40|$|The European Union {{challenges}} the European national {{state and its}} idea of the unity <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> <b>and</b> state. It is a transnational union <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> states in which, like in any un-ion, the member states must give up parts of their sovereignty. Regardless of the fact whether the EU is already a federal state or still a confederation of states, it is the return to an older European model of the transnational commonwealth or empire: the EU is supranational and has only limited central power. Since the EU {{challenges the}} nation state it seems appropriate to ask what constitutes a nation. The paper discusses two his-torical answers, by Schelling and by Herder. For Schelling, the <b>nations</b> are forms <b>of</b> thought of the absolute spirit, for Herder nations are constituted by their language <b>and</b> the unity <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> <b>and</b> language. The unity <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> <b>and</b> state {{is derived from the}} idea that a nation or a people becomes conscious of itself in the state. State <b>and</b> <b>nation</b> are the identity of subject and object. The state is the subject <b>of</b> the <b>nation</b> which is in turn the object on which and on behalf of which the state acts. This identitarian constitution <b>of</b> the <b>nation</b> state is questioned by the EU and by the argument that the identity of the political will <b>of</b> the <b>nation</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> the state is usually a fiction. In contrast, the nation must be seen as a club into which one is born, and political representation as temporal delegation without claims to the identity of the citizens and of the political power. The EU is a club <b>of</b> <b>nations,</b> a club <b>of</b> clubs into which its citizens are born. That the EU does not realize popular sovereignty is no flaw. The model <b>of</b> the <b>nations</b> as clubs <b>and</b> <b>of</b> the EU as a club of clubs replaces the national model of the unity <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> <b>and</b> state. ...|$|R

5|$|The FN {{has been}} part of several groups in the European Parliament. The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also {{consisted}} of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union. Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival. As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN. From 1999 to 2001, the FN {{was a member of the}} Technical Group of Independents. In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group. Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. It leads the Europe <b>of</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Freedom group, which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria, Polish Congress of the New Right, Italian Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the Alternative for Germany, the Dutch Freedom Party, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party.
