5|$|Meanwhile, at the UN, {{although}} the UN members and US were initially divided {{on how to}} respond to Chinese intervention in Korea, the Chinese rejection <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> ceasefire soon rallied the UN members towards US. Immediately afterward, a UN resolution that condemned China as an aggressor was passed on February 1. In the opinion of historian Bevin Alexander, the Chinese rejection <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> ceasefire had damaged the international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes, and this later made it difficult for China to either join the UN or to deny US support for Taiwan. The Korean War, which ultimately ended at the 38th parallel, would drag on for another two bloody years due to the Chinese demand for all UN forces to be withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1989, Israeli commandos kidnapped Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid, {{the leader}} of Hezbollah. This action led to the {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> Security Council resolution 638, which condemned all hostage takings by all sides.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few months}} later, the Korean War began, and units from Japan began {{streaming}} into South Korea. The Eighth United States Army, taking charge of the conflict, requested the activation of three corps headquarters for its growing command <b>of</b> <b>U.N.</b> forces. I Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 2 August 1950.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sadruddin was {{nominated}} and passed over twice {{for the post}} <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> Secretary-General. Although he won the 1981 vote, the Soviet Union considered him too Western and vetoed his election. When he {{was nominated}} again in 1991, the United States and Britain expressed their disagreement with his belief in a policy of boosting aid to Iraq.|$|E
5|$|With an {{increasing}} Third World presence {{and the failure}} <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> mediation in conflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange. By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} governments linked the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to UN Peacekeepers in 1988 to the UNTAG operation, but the award {{was shared by}} peacekeepers and {{peacekeeping}} operations worldwide. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar mentioned a number <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> peacekeeping operations (including Namibia) in his Nobel lecture in Oslo on 9 January 1989. Senator Graham Richardson also made similar comments in the Australian Senate.|$|E
40|$|After {{violence}} has been stopped in conflicts {{the international community}} has attempted to build durable peace in the conflict regions. Previous research focused on the success of and the criticism on UN-led peacebuilding while not considering unilateral peacebuilding in detail. This thesis hypothesizes that peacebuilding by the US before the rise <b>of</b> the <b>UN</b> is more successful than unilateral peacebuilding thereafter. Furthermore, a US peacebuilding mission before the rise <b>of</b> the <b>UN</b> will be more expansive with regard to the instruments used than a mission after the rise <b>of</b> the <b>UN.</b> 15 cases that took place before and after the rise <b>of</b> the <b>UN</b> confirm that US peacebuilding efforts were indeed more successful before the rise <b>of</b> the <b>UN.</b> These cases reveal that peacebuilding not necessarily became less expansive after the rise <b>of</b> the <b>UN</b> but that the nature of peacebuilding shifted towards democratization and financial aid, for instance...|$|R

5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> members, including all five {{permanent members of the}} Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, and none of them were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{continued}} the reform agenda covering oversight, integrity, and ethics which {{had previously been}} launched in response to investigation of the UN Oil-for-Food Programme. The Programme responded to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi civilians and was the largest, most complex and most ambitious relief effort {{in the history of}} the United Nations. With reference to the 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly approved in April 2007 a number of loosely related reform initiatives, covering international environmental governance, a unified gender organization, and ‘Delivering as One’ at the country level to enhance the consolidation <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> programme activities.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, the North Korean {{government}} became more aggressive, and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E

5|$|By 13 August, North Korean {{troops were}} {{operating}} in the mountains west and southwest of Yongil Airfield. U.S. Air Force commanders—wary of enemy attack—evacuated the 45 P-51s of the 39th and 40th Fighter Squadron from the airstrip, against complaints of General MacArthur. However, the airstrip remained under the protection <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> ground forces and never came under direct North Korean fire. The squadrons were moved to Tsuiki {{on the island of}} Kyushu, Japan.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{was heavy}} {{and the two}} sides fought to capture and {{recapture}} P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni, with the North Koreans seeking {{to break through the}} Kyongju corridor as a way to attack the UN base at Pusan. However, with large amounts <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> air and naval support, the US and South Korean ground forces were able to rout and force back the North Korean troops after two weeks of fighting.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{government}} of India nominated Tharoor for the post <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> Secretary-General. Had he won, the 50-year-old Shashi Tharoor would have become the second-youngest Secretary-General, after the 46-year-old Dag Hammarskjöld. Although all previous Secretaries-General had come from small countries, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and National Security Advisor M. K. Narayanan felt that Tharoor's candidacy would demonstrate India's willingness to play a larger role at the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|In early 1994, {{the initial}} batch of US-built {{aircraft}} arrived at MCAS Cherry Point for pilot conversion training. The first Italian-assembled Harrier was rolled out the following year. In mid-January 1995, Giuseppe Garibaldi set off from Taranto to Somalia with three Harriers on board to maintain stability following the withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> forces. The Harriers, flown by five Italian pilots, accumulated more than 100 flight hours and achieved 100 percent availability during the three-month deployment, performing reconnaissance and other missions. The squadron returned to port on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} ten-day round of meetings, Vance {{negotiated}} another ceasefire agreement as a provisional arrangement {{backed by a}} deployment <b>of</b> <b>UN</b> peacekeepers to oversee it. The final obstacle to the agreement was removed when Tuđman agreed to lift the blockade of the remaining JNA barracks in HV-held territory on 25 December. This met Kadijević's conditions {{for the implementation of}} the ceasefire, and Milošević declared he had no objections to the plan on 31 December.|$|E
