40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to know how is the effect of capital inflow and capital outflow in Indonesia against the rupiah {{exchange}} rate in short-term and long-term. Variables which are used in capital flow are direct investment, portofolio <b>investment</b> and <b>other</b> <b>investment,</b> that recorded in the Indonesian balance of payments on capital transaction and financial account. The estimation result of the short-term equation indicates that the enhancement of direct investment inflow at the last quarter caused the rupiah exchange rate run into appreciation. While the <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> inflow at the last two quarters, direct investment outflow at one or two quarters and portfolio investment outflow at the last quarter caused the rupiah exchange rate run into depreciation. The estimation results of the long-term equation indicates that the enhacement of <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> inflow caused the rupiah exchange rate run into appreciation, portfolio <b>investment</b> outflow and <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> outflow caused the rupiah exchange rate run into depresiation...|$|R

5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a special purpose entity used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and <b>other</b> <b>investments.</b> Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.|$|E

It was passed, in 2001, by {{the city and county}} councils, as well as the Norwegian Parliament.

The initial order by Oslo Sporveier was for 33 units (or 99 cars), and was approved by the board on 28 June 2003. The initial order cost NOK1.6 billion, and included options for further orders. Five other manufactures had been rejected during the procurement process. Combined with <b>other</b> <b>investments</b> in the network, the new trains will allow faster travel times on the metro.|$|E

5|$|Kosmos {{was bought}} by the Skaugen Group in 1988, and on 21 October, Kosmos' Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bjørn Bettum and Chairman Otto Grieg Tidemand were fired. The Skaugen Group decided to {{integrate}} Kosmos' shipping and oil-related activities into their group. All <b>other</b> <b>investments,</b> including Norsk Air, were to be sold or closed. At the time, Norsk Air had 140 employees. Norsk Air's CEO, Mr. Røsjodet, made contact with Bård Mikkelsen, who was CEO of Widerøe, {{to try to convince}} them to purchase Norsk Air. Widerøe was a that time solely occupied with flying on the subsidized regional routes. The company was interested in having some non-subsidized routes to better benchmark its operations. The two largest owners, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE, did not want to purchase Norsk Air, but the third-largest owner, Fred. Olsen & Co. liked the idea, and bought SAS' and Braathens SAFE's 62.3 percent stake in Widerøe to make the deal possible. Other possible purchasers who had negotiated with Norsk Air were Sterling Airlines, Partnair and Jan Einar Johansen, former owner of Scandi Line.|$|E
