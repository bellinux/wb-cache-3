40|$|Objectives: This study aims to {{investigate}} the general public knowledge, source of knowledge, and practice towards antibiotics {{in the state of}} Penang Malaysia. Methods: A cross sectional study design using convenience sampling technique was adopted in this study from May 2010 until August 2010. A pre-validated questionnaire was developed and distributed to 700 participants in the state of Penang, Malaysia. All data was analysed using SPSS version 16. A p-value of less than 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: 85. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> could correctly identify that antibiotics are used for bacterial infections whereas almost 58 % believed that antibiotics are used for viral infections. Physicians and pharmacists were the main sources of knowledge about antibiotics. While around 30 % <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> rely on the internet, family members and friends as their sources of information about antibiotics. Malpractice regarding antibiotics use was found in a high proportion <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> where many use antibiotics without prescription, prescribe the leftover antibiotics to their friends and family members while others modify the antibiotics dose without referring to healthcare professional and others stop the antibiotics course once they feel that their symptoms improve. Conclusion: Malpractice regarding antibiotics was found in a great proportion <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> which might be due to the irrational prescription of antibiotics by healthcare professionals as well as due to the misleading sources of knowledge about antibiotics. There is a need for a national awareness program to the public and healthcare professionals about antibiotics and about the approaches to improve the current practice...|$|E

Our findings here highlight the overlooked legislative underbelly: the personnel, structural, and process-related factors that, <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> repeatedly volunteered, drive the details of the drafting process more than judicial rules of interpretation. These factors range from the fragmentation caused by the committee system, to the centrality of nonpartisan professional staff in the drafting of statutory text, to the use of increasingly unorthodox legislative procedures-each <b>of</b> which, <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> told us, affects statutory consistency and use of legislative history in different and important ways. <b>Our</b> <b>respondents</b> also painted a picture of legislative staffers in a primary interpretive conversation with agencies, not with courts, and as using different kinds of signals for their communications with agencies than courts consider...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{understand}} how {{managed care plans}} use performance measures for quality improvement and to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of currently used standardized performance measures such as the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans (CAHPS) survey. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Representatives (chief executive officers, medical directors, and quality-improvement directors) from 24 health plans in four states were surveyed. The overall response rate was 58. 3 percent, with a mean of 1. 8 respondents per plan. STUDY DESIGN: This exploratory qualitative research used a purposive sample of respondents. Two study authors conducted separate one-hour tape-recorded telephone interviews with multiple respondents from each health plan. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All managed care organizations interviewed use performance measures for quality improvement but the degree and sophistication of use varies. Many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondent</b> plans use performance measures to target quality-improvement initiatives, evaluate current performance, establish goals for quality improvement, identify the root cause of problems, and monitor performance. CONCLUSION: Performance measures are used for quality improvement in addition to informing external constituents, but additional research is needed to {{understand how}} the benefits of measurement can be maximized...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have studied {{equality}} and equity from an HR perspective in South Africa. The study is partly made from an inductive approach and an analytical interpretation {{in line with}} hermeneutic has been used. The data is mainly contracted from interviews with HR professionals within various South African organizations. A mix of snowball and convenience sample has been used and among our respondents {{there are a variety}} and mix of the following variables: gender, position (manager/practitioner), race (blacks/white) and organization sector(public/parastatal/private). Our main findings are that equality and equity are highly debated topics and that the laws regulating them have a major effect on the HR professionals’ dailywork. The study gives us various perspectives of employment equity but a majority <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> do believe that the regulation of employment equity is needed. We find that there are obstacles for achieving equality in South African workplaces and our respondents have given us examples of different ways of how to tackle them. Many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> are also of the opinion that {{there is a lack of}} implementation of the regulations and that it is time to rewrite several Acts...|$|E

40|$|We asked college {{students}} to make judgments about realistic moral situations presented as dilemmas (which asked for an either/or decision) vs. problems (which {{did not ask for}} such a decision) as well as when the situation explicitly included affectively salient language vs. non-affectively salient language. We report two main findings. The first is that there are four different types of cognitive strategy that subjects use in their responses: simple reasoning, intuitive judging, cautious reasoning, and empathic reasoning. We give operational definitions of these types in terms of our observed data. In addition, the four types characterized strategies not only in the whole sample, but also in all of the subsamples in our study. The second finding is that the intuitive judging type comprised approximately 26 % <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents,</b> while about 74 % <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> employed one of the three styles of reasoning named above. We think that these findings present an interesting challenge to models of moral cognition which predict that there is either a single, or a single most common, strategy – especially a strategy of relying upon one’s intuitions – that people use to think about moral situations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{qualitative}} data from three research projects that examined {{the impact of}} poor skills on the life chances of adults living in two disadvantaged areas of England. We employed the theories of Goffman and Bourdieu to document how problems with literacy have a corrosive effect on the identities of interviewees, threatening their wellbeing. Though learning difficulties occur across all social backgrounds, the poor family resources and educational opportunities <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> meant they struggled to overcome their literacy problems when young, thus shaping later life course transitions. Thus {{the origins of the}} shame that our adults felt about their poor skills lie in part in the distinctive classed experiences they had when young. However, the resourcefulness <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> meant that many had secured employment, bought homes and become parents which obscured the ongoing psychic problems that a lifetime of poor skills had bestowed on our sample. The disjuncture between the apparent material standing of our sample and the ‘hidden injuries of class’ raises questions about how we understand the operation of class across the life course and the role of literacy, learning and wellbeing in the shaping of social identities...|$|E

Interviews were carried out with managers in a number of companies affiliated to both the Building Employers' Confederation and the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. There was a broad similarity in the experience <b>of</b> all <b>our</b> <b>respondents.</b> An accelerated trend away from direct employment was generally seen to be the main factor explaining the low incidence of industrial action over the period under review.

[15] reported that only around half of their respondents had ready access to UAE. Our work suggests that this figure has risen to 62 %. In the past, it was a common opinion that UAE should not be offered to women wishing to conceive, and this is reflected in 26 % of the participants in Taylor et al.’s study who agreed that they would offer UAE to such women. With ever increasing reports of women having successful pregnancies following UAE, guidance is no longer quite so didactic, and in our survey, 43 % <b>of</b> all <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> would offer UAE to women planning conception.

3000|$|Habilitation {{is defined}} as “making {{something}} fit, or proper to use.” In order to develop successful human capital, the starting point {{has been found to}} be rehabilitating the minds of youth in various ways. A good example is Finland’s plan to reform their entire educational system; the national educational committee planned to change the entire curriculum from typical subjects to subjects that would prepare students for their future working lives (Bez 2017). If Jordan were to apply this as a first step, the rising generation would have all the tools to innovate and conquer the industry they want to work in, encouraging organizations, locally and globally, to invest in human capital. This research showed that a small change in the educational system or in the curriculum would result in a much bigger change in industry: the rising generation will drive advances in every sector, using their educational background, and of course some creativity and training. In their current form, the Jordanian as most other education systems was not interested in encouraging critical thinking. Rather, the focus was on organizing children and creating consistent people. In able to improve the future of the country, the education system must be adjusted and changed for the better. One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>respondent</b> summarized “You can’t have innovation without people’s minds. What we have today in Jordan is a missing link between both. For example in universities, it’s all theory and no practice, we can’t really get innovation out of theory—theory gives you the framework yes, but human capital gives you innovation in the theory. So we need to bridge the gap between theory and practice to actually have real time innovation.” [...]...|$|R
