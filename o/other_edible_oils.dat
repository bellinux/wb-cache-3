25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, and broccoli stir-fried with extra virgin olive oil or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli.

It also has a correspondingly higher content of the linoleic acid, omega-6 fatty acid, around 65% to 75%. The lower level of ALA increases the oxidative stability of the oil/seed, which makes remain edible when stored. The seed colour was also changed from the wild type dark brown seed to a light yellow seed, which consequently gives an oil of a light colour, easily distinguished from the darker linseed oil, the flaxseed oil that we consume today.

This research objective was to produce biodiesel from Jatropha Curcas L. using KOH and Lipase Candida Rugosa catalyst and to investigate the effect of reaction time, reaction temperature and methanol/oil ratio to biodiesel production. Two-stage transesterification method was used for KOH catalyst reaction while onestage transesterification for biocatalyst reaction. Two-stage transesterfication method was the suitable method used to reduce high free fatty acid content in jatropha oil and increase the biodiesel yield. Without acid treatment in two-stage transesterification process, triglycerides tend to go through saponification reaction which produce soap rather than biodiesel. Methanol was used as solvent in both methods due to it short chain characteristic that can produce higher result than other type of alcohol. As a conclusion, biodiesel has been successfully produced from jatropha oil using KOH and Lipase Candida Rugosa enzyme and resulted 98 % and 4 % biodiesel yield respectively.

Natural food sources regularly included in diets offer a more viable long term solution. Red palm oil (RPO) can emerge as a viable alternative to other vitamin A rich foods, since it contains enormous amounts of natural carotenoids to the tune of around 700 PPM, the predominant ones being a and b carotene which have the highest biological potential for vitamin A conversion.   Value addition of palm oil for edible purposes results in several nutritionally rich products like edible grade red palm oil (RPO), deacidified, deodourised RPOlein, isolated carotenoids and refined, bleached and deodourized palmolein oil RBD palmolein).

Second, the recent surge in demand for commodities used as feedstocks for biofuels is unlikely to become a new source of growth for the cotton oil market. Third, within the context of deepening the on-going reform efforts in West and Central African countries, cotton by-products should be taken into consideration, both in terms of the cotton price setting mechanism and the size of the organization of the cotton by-products industry. Fourth, trade policies including export bans or import tariffs to protect the domestic crushing industries, and policies that favor crude over refined oils, should be rationalized. Fifth, large cottonseed processing operations using advanced technology, while efficient from a technological perspective, tend not to be economically profitable in the African context.

The analysis shows that the principal strengths of the Turkish olive oil industry are related to the product characteristics and new orchards. It also shows that the industry is improving but nevertheless is still confined by various constraints, mostly based on a lack of commercialization and marketing skills, which prevent Turkey from fully taking advantage of available export opportunities.
