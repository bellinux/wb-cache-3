5|$|In 1864, Major General Samuel Jones {{commanded}} the Departments of Florida, South Carolina, and South Georgia, with his headquarters in Pensacola, Florida. His primary orders were {{to guard the}} coastal areas <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states</b> and to destroy Union gunboats. He also destroyed all the machinery and sawmills that would be beneficial to the Union armies.|$|E
5|$|The Third World Congress in 1951 {{resolved}} {{that the}} economies of the East European states and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more. These states were then described as deformed workers states in an analogy with the degenerated workers state in Russia. The term deformed was used rather than degenerated, because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Lincoln's {{election}} became evident, secessionists {{made clear}} their intent {{to leave the}} Union before he took office the next March. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Six <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states</b> then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America. The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch {{were very}} keen {{to resume the}} lucrative trade with Japan which had been choked off {{in the wake of}} the dispute between Nuyts and Hamada at the behest of the Japanese {{authorities}} in Edo. All their overtures to the Japanese court failed, until they decided to extradite Pieter Nuyts to Japan for the shogun to punish him as he saw fit. This was an unprecedented step, and was representative of both the extreme official displeasure with Nuyts in the Dutch hierarchy and the strong desire to recommence Japanese trade. It also demonstrates the relative weakness of the Dutch when confronted by powerful East Asian states such as Japan, and recent historiography has suggested that the Dutch relied on the mercy <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states</b> to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|The museum’s plan {{concept was}} {{developed}} by architect, Laurie Baker, without charging any fee, because of his interest in rural architectural design. Baker's approach included the use of local materials and the adaptation of artisanal production methods suited to the environment. Benny Kuriakose was the architect at site. Kuriakose, retained the main “spatial types and syntax”, but altered the layout plan. The {{southern part of the}} museum was devoted to restoring and recreating native structures and putting them together in a sequence in the order of the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu; a separate area was initially earmarked for the tribal people <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states</b> but this was not put into effect.|$|E
5|$|Thebes, Corinth and Athens {{also refused}} to {{participate}} in a Spartan expedition to Ionia in 398 BC, with the Thebans {{going so far as to}} disrupt a sacrifice that the Spartan king Agesilaus attempted to perform in their territory before his departure. Despite the absence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states,</b> Agesilaus campaigned effectively against the Persians in Lydia, advancing as far inland as Sardis. The satrap Tissaphernes was executed for his failure to contain Agesilaus, and his replacement, Tithraustes, bribed the Spartans to move north, into the satrapy of Pharnabazus. Agesilaus did so, but simultaneously began preparing a sizable navy.|$|E

[...] Universal caps on donations for ballot initiatives {{as well as}} specific bans aimed to prevent [...] "undue" [...] corporate influence on referenda were still considered constitutional. <b>Of</b> <b>these</b> 31 <b>states,</b> 18 <b>of</b> them, including Massachusetts, had laws that would be considered unconstitutional after the Bellotti decision.|$|R

5|$|In 1885, British {{claims to}} a West African sphere of {{influence}} received recognition from other European nations at the Berlin Conference. The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company {{under the leadership of}} Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900 the company's territory came {{under the control of the}} British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered Benin in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states</b> opened up the Niger area to British rule.|$|E
5|$|In the East, Diocletian {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} with desert tribes {{in the regions}} between Rome and Persia. He might have been attempting to persuade them to ally themselves with Rome, thus reviving the old, Rome-friendly, Palmyrene sphere of influence, or simply attempting to reduce the frequency of their incursions. No details survive for these events. Some of the princes <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states</b> were Persian client kings, a disturbing fact in light of increasing tensions with the Sassanids. In the West, Maximian lost the fleet built in 288 and 289, probably {{in the early spring}} of 290. The panegyrist who refers to the loss suggests that its cause was a storm, but this might simply have been an attempt to conceal an embarrassing military defeat. Diocletian broke off his tour of the Eastern provinces soon thereafter. He returned with haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.|$|E

Had Bush carried all four <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>states,</b> he {{would have been able to}} win the electoral vote, even with a loss in Florida.
