5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy {{is the notion that}} the present world is the greatest possible world, or the best <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the best <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E

These results are promising for relating sensors with symbols, partial-knowledge games, multi-agent decision making, and AI planning. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{main object}} of the Moralists is to propound a system of natural theology, and to vindicate, so far as natural {{religion}} is concerned, the ways of God to man. The articles of Shaftesbury's religious creed were few and simple, but these he entertained with a conviction amounting to enthusiasm. They may briefly be summed up as a belief in one God whose most characteristic attribute is universal benevolence, in the moral government of the universe, and in a future state of man making up for the imperfections and repairing the inequalities of the present life. Shaftesbury is emphatically an optimist, {{but there is a}} passage in the Moralists (pt. ii. sect. 4) which would lead us to suppose that he regarded matter as an indifferent principle, coexistent and coeternal with God, limiting His operations, and the cause of the evil and imperfection which, notwithstanding the benevolence of the Creator, is still to be found in His work. If this view of his optimism be correct, Shaftesbury, as Mill says of Leibniz, must be regarded as maintaining, not that this is the best of all imaginable but only <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> This brief notice of Shaftesbury's scheme of natural religion would be conspicuously imperfect unless it were added that it is popularized in Pope's Essay on Man, several lines of which, especially of the first epistle, are simply statements from the Moralists done into verse. Whether, however, these were taken immediately by Pope from Shaftesbury, or whether they came to him through the papers which Bolingbroke had prepared for his use, we have no means of determining. On the other hand, Pope had certainly read Shaftesbury's work, for he mentions the character of Theocles in the latter's The Moralists in his Dunciad (IV.487–490): [...] "Or that bright Image to our Fancy draw,/Which Theocles in raptur'd vision saw,/While thro' Poetic scenes the Genius roves,/Or wanders wild in Academic Groves". In his notes to these lines, Pope directs the reader to various passages in Shaftesbury's work.|$|E

In the presence of the ances-tor/descendant relationships, the existing dynamic programming approaches to rank top-k probabilities over a set of tuples cannot be directly applied, because any node/edge in PXML may have impacts on the top-k probabilities of answers. We propose new algorithms to compute PXML-RANK queries efficiently and give conditions un-der which a PXML-RANK query can be processed efficiently with-out enumeration <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> We conduct extensive performance studies using both real and large benchmark datasets, and confirm the efficiency of our algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Para{{consistent}} logics are non-classical logics {{which allow}} non-trivial and consistent reasoning about inconsistent axioms. They have been pro- posed as a formal basis for handling inconsistent data, as commonly arise in human enterprises, and as methods for fuzzy reasoning, with applica- tions in Artificial Intelligence {{and the control}} of complex systems. Formalisations of paraconsistent logics usually require heroic mathe- matical efforts to provide a consistent axiomatisation of an inconsistent system. Here we use transreal arithmetic, which {{is known to be}} consis- tent, to arithmetise a paraconsistent logic. This is theoretically simple and should lead to efficient computer implementations. We introduce the metalogical principle of monotonicity which is a very simple way of making logics paraconsistent. Our logic has dialetheaic truth values which are both False and True. It allows contradictory propositions, allows variable contradictions, but blocks literal contradictions. Thus literal reasoning, in this logic, forms an on-the- y, syntactic partition of the propositions into internally consistent sets. We show how the set <b>of</b> <b>all</b> paraconsistent, <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> can be represented in a transreal space. During the development of our logic we discuss how other paraconsistent logics could be arithmetised in transreal arithmetic...|$|R
40|$|Both Descartes before Spinoza and Leibniz {{after him}} {{continued}} the medieval Aristotelian tradition of 'supernaturalizing' Aristotle's conception of God as first substance, and of treating God as {{the creator of}} natural substances. Because Spinoza adopts the terminology of that tradition, while identifying Nature with God, he is widely taken to supernaturalize Nature. This presupposes that he conceives his metaphysical axioms as the medievals did theirs, as true <b>of</b> <b>all</b> logically <b>possible</b> <b>worlds,</b> and per se nota to the human intellect. Unlike them, however, he holds that the "mechanical principles of nature," while per se nota, are true only of the actual world. This suggests that his conception of what is per se no tum in metaphysics is holistic, and presumes experience of the actual world. Assuming this, it is shown that his theory of substance in Ethics I must be elucidated on naturalist lines. The objection raised by de Vries to ElplOs, that really distinct attributes cannot, as Spinoza maintains, constitute {{one and the same}} substance (or essence of a substance), is shown to be valid on the 'supernaturalizing' interpretation of Spinoza's theory, and Spinoza's replies to it in Ep 9 and ElplOs are shown to be question-begging. However, on the naturalist interpretation of it, Spinoza's doctrine in ElplOs is shown to be defensible. Pollock's explanation of why his arguments in ElplOs and Eplld are incompatible with the naturalist interpretation is adopted...|$|R

5000|$|The {{earthquake}} and its fallout strongly influenced the intelligentsia of the European Age of Enlightenment. The noted writer-philosopher Voltaire used the earthquake in Candide {{and in his}} Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ("Poem on the Lisbon disaster"). Voltaire's Candide attacks the notion that all is for the best in this, [...] "the best <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds", a <b>world</b> closely supervised by a benevolent deity. The Lisbon disaster provided a counterexample. As Theodor Adorno wrote, [...] "the earthquake of Lisbon sufficed to cure Voltaire of the theodicy of Leibniz" [...] (Negative Dialectics 361). In the later twentieth century, following Adorno, the 1755 earthquake has sometimes been compared to the Holocaust as a catastrophe that transformed European culture and philosophy. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was also influenced by the devastation following the earthquake, whose severity he believed was due to too many people living within the close quarters of the city. Rousseau used the earthquake as an argument against cities {{as part of his}} desire for a more naturalistic way of life.|$|R
40|$|In the era Voltaire criticized Leibnizian {{optimism}} and Rousseau defended {{it on the}} occasion of the disaster of Lisbon, the theological thought that God chose and created the best <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> certainly deserved criticizing or defending. However, after Auschwitz had made the idea of theodicy completely futile, as Levinas put it, could it be of any use to discuss the significance of Leibnizian optimism in our time? In reality the question that should be raised is rather why catastrophic disasters never fail to recall some kind of theodicies even among people who don' t seem to believe in God any longer. Like other theodicies in general, Leibnizian theodicy had the theoretical functions to relieve people of their intolerable evils and pains, so its substitutes must have been indispensable ever since theodicy in a strict sense lost its validity. As a result, various forms of theodicies in a broader sense that appeared through their modern history, which can be characterized by the "humanization of theodicy" and then by the "naturalization of evils", have now transformed into handy tools of justification and remission largely accompanied by Panglossian optimism. Today, living after Fukushima, we need new theodicy and another optimism, whether we still believe in God or not. My point is that the metaphysical system of Leibniz can offer an effective model of ontology and ethics we are forced to adopt under our current predicaments. In particular, the idea of "re-moralization of evils" by sharing them in common with our monadological relations would be essential for us to realize Leibnizian optimism in its original sense, which will never forget our obligations to others and toward the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Emerging {{uncertain}} database applications often {{involve the}} cleansing (conditioning) of uncertain databases using additional information as new evidence {{for reducing the}} uncertainty. However, past researches on conditioning probabilistic databases, unfortunately, only focus on functional dependency. In real world applications, most additional information on uncertain data sets can be acquired {{in the form of}} aggregate constraints (e. g., the aggregate results are published online for various statistical purposes). Therefore, if these aggregate constraints can be taken into account, uncertainty in data sets can be largely reduced. However, finding a practical method to exploit aggregate constraints to decrease uncertainty is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we present three approaches to cleanse (condition) uncertain databases by employing aggregate constraints. Because the problem is NP-hard, we focus on the two approximation strategies by modeling the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and then utilizing Simulated Annealing (SA) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to sample from the entire solution space of <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> In order to favor those <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> holding higher probabilities and satisfying all the constraints at the same time, we define Satisfaction Degree Functions (SDF) and then construct the objective function accordingly. Subsequently, based on the sample result, we remove duplicates, re-normalize the probabilities <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the qualified <b>possible</b> <b>worlds,</b> and derive the posterior probabilistic database. Our experiments verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms and show that our approximate approaches scale well to large-sized databases. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to look at {{categorical}} approaches to many valued logic, both propositional and predicate, to see how different logical properties result from different parts of the situation. In particular, the relationship between the categorical fabric I introduced at Linz in 2004 and the Fuzzy Logics studied by Hajek (2003) [5], Esteva et al. (2003) [1], and Hajek (1998) [4], comes from restricting the kind of structures used for truth values. We see how the structure of the various kinds of algebras shows up in the categorical logic, giving a variant on natural deduction for these logics. Quantification typically needs more completeness than is present in the algebras used in Hajek (1998) [4], hence the need for safe interpretations. The categorical setting gives a predicate logic without variables. The language in the more traditional sense comes from a structure built on a particular freely generated Cartesian category. Formulas have a clear meaning in that more restricted context. Interpretation of the language in other categorical fabrics is given by application of a product preserving functor. Traditional completeness results relate to this kind of interpretation. Completeness can also be understood as showing that the derivable truths in the general fabric are the necessary truths: those which are true in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the <b>possible</b> <b>worlds...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on {{hard and}} soft computing, an {{integrated}} design process, called rough logic government, is proposed. In this process, fuzzy logic {{is viewed as}} a methodology of a grand scale interpolation based on qualitative information. The design process is a sequence of transformations of mathematical models. It starts with a symbolic model that describes the control system in terms of predicates in rough logic. Predicates may include not only the usual linguistic rules, but also some hard computing information. These predicates are derived from either (1) experts' experience or (2) some training data using rough set methodology (rules mining). The next step is a transformation of the symbolic model into a fuzzy model, called a <b>possible</b> fuzzy <b>world.</b> It is accomplished by replacing every symbol that represents certain real world phenomena with a membership function that represents the same phenomena according to a fuzzy view. In formal logic, the symbolic model is called a theory and the transformation an interpretation of the theory. Of course, interpretations are usually not unique. The collection <b>of</b> <b>all</b> such <b>possible</b> fuzzy <b>worlds</b> is called a rough fuzzy model. It is a highly structured set, and can be treated as a differential geometric object. Using some inference methods, each <b>possible</b> fuzzy <b>world</b> is transformed into a “virtual” trajectory or integral submanifold which is a candidate for the solution of the unconstructed system equations. So a rough fuzzy model will produce a family of candidates. To verify and validate these candidates, the method of evolutionary computing is adopted. Some of these “virtual” objects may actually become “real world” trajectories or integral submanifolds, which are the design goal. Several new applications are identified...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{research}} aims at {{developing a}} different kind of virtual world that is dynamically designed and implemented as needed. Currently, most virtual world designs are considered static. Similar to the physical world, these worlds are pre-defined prior to their use. The resultant environments serve certain purposes but do not take into consideration possible changes to the purposes during their use, changes which often occur when the occupants interact with the environments and with each other. Virtual worlds as networked environments can be flexibly configured and programmed. This flexibility makes it possible to consider virtual world designs in terms of dynamics and autonomy, reflecting the changing needs of different moments. To achieve dynamic designs of virtual worlds, this study applies a computational approach using rational design agents. A Generative Design Agent (GDA) model is developed that specifies computational processes for reasoning and designing in virtual worlds. The GDAs serve as personal design agents to the virtual world occupants. Design formalisms for virtual worlds are also addressed. The design component of a GDA is supported by the application of a generative design grammar. On one hand, generative design grammars serve as the generative force to be applied by the GDAs for virtual world design automation. On the other hand, each grammar defines coherent stylistic characterisations shared by the virtual world designs it generates. The technical outcomes of the research consist of the GDA model and a generative design grammar framework. The framework provides guidelines and strategies to designers for developing generative design grammars that produce different design languages for virtual worlds, rather than predefine every detail <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> virtual <b>world</b> designs. GDAs monitor the virtual worlds and the various activities that occur in the worlds, interpret the occupants’ needs in the virtual worlds and the state of the worlds based on these observations, hypothesise design goals in order to satisfy these needs, and finally apply generative design grammars to provide virtual world designs for the moment, or initiate other actions in the worlds, according to the current design goals, on behalf of the occupants. The development of the GDA model and the generative design grammar framework provides new perspectives for understanding and developing virtual worlds. The GDA model challenges the conventional way that virtual worlds are designed and implemented, and this leads to dynamic designs of virtual worlds. The generative design grammar framework provides a computational approach to formally defining design languages for virtual worlds...|$|R
