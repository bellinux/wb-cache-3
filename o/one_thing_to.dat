5|$|It is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet it is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{notice is}} that if P has an element Pi,i on its main {{diagonal}} that is equal to 1 and the ith row or column is otherwise filled with 0's, then that row or column will remain unchanged {{in all of the}} subsequent powers Pk. Hence, the ith row or column of Q will have the 1 and the 0's in the same positions as in P.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> worship a picture, it {{is another}} by means of {{pictures}} to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated. For what writing makes present to those reading, the same picturing makes present to the uneducated, to those perceiving visually, because in it the ignorant see {{what they ought to}} follow, in it they read who do not know letters. Wherefore, and especially for the common people, picturing is the equivalent of reading.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> note {{is that in}} the PRSV equation, the {{parameter}} fit is done in {{a particular}} temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.|$|E
25|$|Cunningham's novel also mirrors Mrs. Dalloway's stream-of-consciousness {{narrative}} style (a style {{pioneered by}} Woolf and James Joyce) {{in which the}} flowing thoughts and perceptions of protagonists are depicted as they would occur in real life, unfiltered, flitting from <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> another, and often rather unpredictable. In terms of time, this means characters interact {{not only with the}} moment in the time in which they are living, but also shoot back to the past in their memories, and in so doing create a depth of history and backstory which weighs upon their present moments, which otherwise might appear quite trivial; buying flowers, baking a cake and such things.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{impose a}} tax {{dependent}} upon {{the conduct of the}} taxpayers, or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. … It is quite another thing to say that a tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

He concluded, [...] "It's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> make a dance record [...] it is another to instill that track with an epic, celebratory quality as Michael does here".

500|$|Although the {{majority}} of the tribe decided to follow Keokuk's lead, about 800 Sauks—roughly one-sixth of the tribe—chose instead to resist American expansion. Black Hawk, a war captain who had fought against the United States in the War of 1812 and was now in his 60s, emerged as the leader of this faction in 1829. Like Keokuk, Black Hawk was not a civil chief, but he became Keokuk's primary rival for influence within the tribe. Black Hawk had actually signed a treaty in May 1816 that affirmed the disputed 1804 land cession, but he insisted that what had been written down was different from what had been spoken at the treaty conference. According to Black Hawk, the [...] "whites were in the habit of saying <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> the Indians and putting another thing down on paper." ...|$|E

[...] Zoromski was unhappy however with the [...] "outright product placement [...] " [...] with Staples, writing that [...] "the show's quality felt a little compromised.

500|$|But Hazlitt goes further, {{to develop}} an idea that only much later was seen to have radical {{implications}} for literary theory: he claims {{that it is of}} the very nature of poetry to glorify the aristocrat, the solitary hero, and the monarch, while being much less suited to represent, in ways that capture the imagination, the social problems of the common people. Poetic [...] "imagination naturally falls in with the language of power. The imagination is an exaggerating and exclusive faculty: it takes from <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> add to another: it accumulates circumstances together to give the greatest possible effect to a favourite object." [...] On the other hand, the language that would be used to argue the cause of the people relies more on [...] "the understanding", which [...] "is a dividing and measuring faculty: it judges of things not according to their immediate impression on the mind, but according to their relations to one another. [...] Poetry [...] is right-royal. It puts the individual for the species, the one above the infinite many, might before right." ...|$|E

Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
