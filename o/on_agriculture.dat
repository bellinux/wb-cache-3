5|$|Following the {{draining}} of the Fens, {{beginning in}} the 17th century and completed in the 19th century, the town's economy has been based <b>on</b> <b>agriculture</b> and related industry.

5|$|Palmyra's economy {{before and}} at the {{beginning}} of the Roman period was based <b>on</b> <b>agriculture,</b> pastoralism, trade, and serving as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert. By the end of the first century BC, the city had a mixed economy based <b>on</b> <b>agriculture,</b> pastoralism, taxation, and, most importantly, the caravan trade. Taxation was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government. Caravaneers paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court, where a tax law dating to AD 137 was exhibited. The law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants for goods sold at the internal market or exported from the city.|$|E

5|$|An avid {{conservationist}} and hunter, Burnham {{supported the}} early conservation programs {{of his friends}} Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa {{with the goal of}} finding large animals such as Giant Eland, hippopotamus, zebra, and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen. Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the House Committee <b>on</b> <b>Agriculture</b> to ask for help in importing large African animals. In 1914, he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of America, Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} under Justinian's predecessors, the Empire's {{economic}} health rested primarily <b>on</b> <b>agriculture.</b> In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching {{as far north as}} Cornwall where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat. Within the Empire, convoys sailing from Alexandria provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large granary on the island of Tenedos for storage and further transport to Constantinople. Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians.|$|E

5|$|Carmarthenshire {{is mainly}} an {{agricultural}} county, {{apart from the}} southeastern part which at one time was heavily industrialised with coal mining, steel-making and tin-plating. In {{the north of the}} county the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century. Nowadays the economy of the county depends <b>on</b> <b>agriculture,</b> forestry, fishing and tourism. With the decline in its industrial base and the low profitability of the livestock sector, Carmarthenshire is economically one of the worst-performing regions in the United Kingdom.|$|E

Cui Shi's book provides descriptions of rituals for ancestor worship, festival and religious holiday celebrations, conduct for family and kinship relations, farmwork, and the schooling season for boys. Cui Shi's book also provides detailed instructions on which months were the most profitable times {{to buy and sell}} certain types of farm-produced goods.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Massachusetts {{became a}} {{national}} leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around cities such as Lowell and Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles. The economy transformed from one based primarily <b>on</b> <b>agriculture</b> to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the steam engine to power factories. Canals and railroads were used for transporting raw materials and finished goods. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada.|$|E

Cattle ranching {{and the industrial}} processing of milk and cheese have been developed extensively in recent years.

Since {{the launch of the}} Jesuit Mission Circuit– a marketing label to promote regional tourism– in 2005, craftsmanship and tourism have been closely related.|$|E
5|$|Following Mexico's {{independence}} from Spain, {{the new nation}} established long-term settlements, including Anahuac and San Jacinto, around the bay. Early rebellions by the settlers against Mexican rule occurred {{in the region and}} it was later the site of the victory of the Texas army over the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution. Following Texas' {{independence from}} Mexico and its annexation by the United States, economic growth was centered initially <b>on</b> <b>agriculture</b> and cattle ranching. Commerce grew between Galveston, Harrisburg and Houston in the later 19th century, and created additional economic opportunities as railroads were built through the Bay Area to connect these and other commercial centers.|$|E
5|$|Great Oasis sites {{appeared}} in the Missouri River drainage, and have attributes of both Late Woodland and Late Prehistoric cultures. Great Oasis cultures extended through the eastern Plains from Iowa to South Dakota. Developing independently from the eastern Mississippian cultures, Great Oasis sites display large sites along major stream terraces, increased reliance <b>on</b> <b>agriculture</b> combined with hunting and gathering, substantial pit earth lodges, and a transition from Late Woodland to Late Prehistoric ceramic forms. Overall, Great Oasis {{appears to have been}} a regional adaptation of new forms of farming and settlement patterns, including seasonal occupation of different ecological zones, that includes aspects of Late Woodland and the subsequent Middle Missouri Tradition.|$|E

5|$|Historically part of Cheshire, Altrincham was {{established}} as a market town in 1290, {{a time when the}} economy of most communities was based <b>on</b> <b>agriculture</b> rather than trade, and there is still a market in the town today. Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park.|$|E
5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects.
