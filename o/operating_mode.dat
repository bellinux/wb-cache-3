During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> effectively becoming a PROM programmer. Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{techniques}} for characterizing electrical energy use now {{play a key}} role in reducing electricity consumption, particularly miscellaneous electrical loads, in buildings. Identifying device <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> (mode extraction) creates a better understanding of both device and system behaviors. Using clustering to extract <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> from electrical load data can provide valuable insights into device behavior and identify opportunities for energy savings. We present a fast and effective heuristic clustering method to identify and extract <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> in electrical load data...|$|R

40|$|Many {{embedded}} {{control systems}} work in different <b>operating</b> <b>modes,</b> for example start-up, stand-by, shut-down and failure <b>mode.</b> These different <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> usually have different timing requirements, {{and the different}} functional behaviour also leads to differences in timing behaviour. A Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis of such a system needs to determine mode-specific bounds on execution times, because a single overall bound may be too pessimistic. Mode determination and mode-specific analysis also form a prerequisite for analysing system behaviour during mode transitions, a most critical phase of a system. The <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> of embedded control systems are often not precisely represented, neither in hand-written code nor in code synthesised by model-based design tools nor on the model level. In this paper, we outline the use of <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> for WCET analysis. Furthermore, we describe ongoing work on semi-automatically deducing mode information from C source code and using that information in WCET analysis...|$|R

25|$|Because many {{encodings}} {{have only}} a limited repertoire of characters, they are often only usable to represent text in a limited subset of human languages. Unicode {{is an attempt to}} create a common standard for representing all known languages, and most known character sets are subsets of the very large Unicode character set. Although there are multiple character encodings available for Unicode, the most common is UTF-8, which has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with ASCII; that is, every ASCII text file is also a UTF-8 text file with identical meaning. UTF-8 also has the advantage that it is easily auto-detectable. Thus, a common <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> of UTF-8 capable software, when opening files of unknown encoding, is to try UTF-8 first and fall back to a locale dependent legacy encoding when it definitely isn't UTF-8.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, captains {{operating}} ships in icebound waters discovered that {{sometimes it was}} easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. Although not known at the time, this was because the forward-facing propellers generated a lubricating water flow that lowered the ice resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice. However, as the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main <b>operating</b> <b>mode.</b> These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but in the more severe Arctic ice conditions they could not be used because the risk of the bow propellers being damaged by multi-year ice floes was too great. Furthermore, forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and they considerably increase the ship's open water resistance, making them unsuitable for merchant ships.|$|E

25|$|Although icebreaking {{cargo ships}} {{had been built}} in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather while a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance. However, already in the late 1800s captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that sometimes it was easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. This was because the forward-facing propellers generated a water flow that lowered the resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice. These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but as forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> for merchant ships.|$|E
500|$|The ZX81's {{designers}} {{adopted an}} improved approach, involving {{the use of}} two modes called SLOW and FAST respectively. In SLOW mode, also called [...] "compute and display" [...] mode, the ZX81 concentrates on driving the display. It runs the current program for only {{about a quarter of}} the time – in effect slowing the machine down fourfold, although in practice the speed difference between FAST and SLOW modes depends on what computation is being done. In FAST mode, processing occurs continuously, but the display is abandoned to its own devices – equivalent to the ZX80's standard <b>operating</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1984, Timex of Portugal {{developed}} and produced several Timex branded computers, including the Timex Computer 2048, highly {{compatible with the}} Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K, which was very successful in both Portugal and Poland. An NTSC version was also made, initially intended for a United States release, but it was sold only in Chile and Argentina. Timex of Portugal also made a PAL version of the TS2068, called the Timex Computer 2068 (or TC2068 for short) which had different buffers for both the ULA and the CPU, which significantly increased the compatibility with ZX Spectrum software {{when compared to the}} North American model (the TS2068). The expansion port was also modified and made to be 100% compatible with the ZX Spectrum's, which bypassed the need for a [...] "Twister Board" [...] expansion that the TS2068 needed {{in order to make it}} compatibile with ZX Spectrum expansion hardware. It also had the AY sound output routed to the monitor/TV speakers instead of the internal twitter. The software developed for the TC2068 is completely compatible with the TS2068, since the ROMs weren't altered. Timex of Portugal also developed a ZX Spectrum [...] "emulator" [...] on cartridge form that mapped the first 16kB exactly like the earlier TC2048 computer did. Several other upgrades were made available, including a BASIC64 cartridge that enabled the TC2068 to use high resolution (512x192) modes. Despite having an AY-3-8912 sound chip, it's not connected in the same ports as in the ZX Spectrum 128K, rendering the TC2084 incompatible with the AY sound that the Spectrum 128K games produced. Due to all its advantages compared to the usual TS2068, a North American company, Zebra Systems, licensed the Timex TC2068 and sold it in the United States as the Zebra Silver Avenger. They also sold the FDD 3000 as the Zebra FDD 3000 in a silver case (as opposed to the European black cases) to match their colour scheme. Timex of Portugal was working on a successor to the TC2068 called the TC3256, using a Z80A CPU and featuring 256kB of RAM, which would feature a ZX Spectrum BASIC <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> and a CP/M <b>operating</b> <b>mode,</b> but the company pulled the plug on its development since that by the end of 1989, the 8bit market was no longer profitable. Only one complete and fully working prototype of the TC3256 was made.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} pattern {{recognition}} (PR) method {{associated with a}} tracking and a prediction of evolution for various <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> of a process. The aim is to improve diagnosis of a process by enhancing its knowledge database. Indeed, PR needs an initial database named training set. It is composed of different <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> and obtained during {{the first step of}} PR. It is commonly named training phase. It is a laborious step and moreover the whole of <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> is never available (generally poor experimental feedback). Thatpsilas why, using knowledge in training set, it is interesting to predict evolution of <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> in unknown fields of representation space. PR steps are first presented and followed by a polynomial approach of tracking evolution. Next, a Kalman algorithm is used to predict evolution and finally two different asynchronous machines (5. 5 kW and 18. 5 kW) are used to illustrate our purpose...|$|R

40|$|Observations of {{air traffic}} {{controller}} operating practices suggest that controllers operate in distinct <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> in response {{to changes in the}} cognitive demands of the air traffic situation. These modes appear to correspond to differences in the use of structure-based strategies and abstractions identified primarily from rich but uncontrolled settings. In order to investigate the effects of manipulating traffic levels on controller use of structure, a part-task human-in-the-loop experiment was conducted. Participant actions are examined for changes in the use of standard flow and critical point abstractions and transitions between controller <b>operating</b> <b>modes.</b> The results provide evidence of transitions between distinct <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> as participants modified their use of standard flows as traffic levels increased...|$|R
2500|$|The air/water-brine/water {{heat pump}} is a hybrid heat pump, {{developed}} in Rostock, Germany, that uses only renewable energy sources. [...] Unlike other hybrid systems, which usually combine both conventional {{and renewable energy}} sources, it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device. The air/water-brine/water heat pump has two evaporators — an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator — both connected to the heat pump cycle. This allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions (for example, air temperature). [...] The unit automatically selects the most efficient <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> — air or geothermal heat, or both together.

2500|$|The Type C1 BSC was {{borne out}} of {{necessity}} to control infectious material, chemical hazards, reduce operating costs and add flexibility in modern laboratories. The Type C1 moves air by mixing inflow air with {{the air in the}} columns of downflow air marked for recirculation. Air above a clearly delineated section of the work surface is drawn by a second internal fan where it is exhausted through a HEPA filter. The C1 differs from a Type A in that it can use this single pass airflow, and when installed in a ducted <b>operating</b> <b>mode,</b> can protect from hazardous chemistry, like the Type Bs. The C1 also differs from the Type B BSCs in several ways; (1) it does not require a hard connected, dedicated exhaust system and blower to operate, (2) pending a risk assessment, the BSC can run for an extended duration to increase operator protection during a remote exhaust system failure, and (3) Type C1 BSCs can run without being connected to an exhaust system at all.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to the gasoline-only variants, several {{features}} {{are unique to}} the hybrid. In addition to the hybrid powertrain, the Camry Hybrid employs electric power steering, brakes, and air conditioning that are fully operational once {{the internal combustion engine}} is deactivated. The car can run in an all-electric mode, gasoline-only or both. A real-time dashboard screen shows power distribution and the operation of the hybrid system and the tachometer is replaced by an analog fuel economy readout. The hybrid drivetrain has also necessitated a redesigned front subframe, along with remodeled rear and center floor pressings. This was required to accommodate the battery pack, which is stowed in the trunk. Other differences include wheel spats and underbody pans which reduce aerodynamic drag from 0.28 to 0.27cd, an [...] "Eco" [...] <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> for the HVAC system that reduces the output of air conditioning to assist fuel economy, and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM). Cosmetic changes are limited to redesigned tail lights with LEDs, a chrome-lined grille, as opposed to the color-coded version on every other Camry trim, and hybrid-oriented emblems including [...] "Hybrid" [...] badging on the front fenders and a decklid-mounted [...] "Hybrid Synergy Drive" [...] logo.|$|E

40|$|Riser <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> {{are vital}} to {{designing}} a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor for a required process of either a gas-solid or a gas-catalytic nature. Different <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> provide different solids' residence times and mixing behaviors, which define the reactions' efficiency and yield. The literature demonstrates distinct <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> resulting from observed differences in slip factors {{and the range of}} particle velocities and their associated residence time distribution. The present research uses positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) in a riser of B-type bed material to determine the different <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> by measuring (i) particle velocities and residence time distribution, (ii) population densities of these particles in the cross-sectional area of the riser, and (iii) solids flow pattern {{at the bottom of the}} riser. Data treatment defines four distinct solids hold-up regimes in the riser and proposes a "phase diagram" depicting the existence of the different <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> (dilute, dense, core-annulus and combined) as a function of the superficial gas velocity and solids circulation flux in the riser. The delineated regimes have good agreement with available literature data and known industrial operations. Comparison with literature data for risers using A-type powders is also fair. The diagram enables CFB designers to better delineate operating characteristics. © 2011 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

2500|$|Ulysses was {{launched}} October 6, 1990, and reached Jupiter for its [...] "gravitational slingshot" [...] in February 1992. It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 {{and crossed the}} ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. Ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> depending on (1) measured count rate, (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10−6 erg/cm2 (1 nJ/m2). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution data, recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from {{the sum of the}} 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations). During 'wait' mode, the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels (with shortest integration time being 8 s). Again, the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Roosevelt {{named his}} friend Joseph P. Kennedy, a self-made multimillionaire [...] {{financier}} {{and leader of}} the Irish community, as the insider-as-chairman who knew Wall Street well enough to clean it up. Two of the other five commissioners were James M. Landis (one of the architects of the 1934 Act and other New Deal legislation) and Ferdinand Pecora (Chief Counsel to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency during its investigation of Wall Street banking and stock brokerage practices). Kennedy added a number of brilliant young lawyers, including William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, both of whom later became Supreme Court justices. Kennedy's team defined the mission and <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> for the SEC, making full use of its wide range of legal powers. The SEC had four missions. First and most important was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed because of doubts about its internal integrity, and fears of the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had {{to get rid of the}} penny-ante swindles based on fake information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich-quick schemes. That unsavory element had to be prosecuted and shut down. Thirdly, and much more important than the outright frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar insider maneuvers by top officials of major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much better information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was given high priority. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow. Drafting precise rules was the main challenge faced by the bright young lawyers. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He became a cheerleader for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again.|$|E
