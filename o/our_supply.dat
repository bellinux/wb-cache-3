6000|$|... "Max, {{you should}} {{remember}} that a fire strong enough to subdue forty degrees below zero is intense--also, that <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of tea is limited. All this comes of your unwisely calling me a gross creature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus we {{maintain}} <b>our</b> <b>supply,</b> though {{were it not}} for certain commercial uses to which the virus is put, it would scarcely be necessary to add to our present store, since the sith is almost extinct.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, wouldn't that jar you?" [...] cried Snap, {{when the}} other crowd was gone. [...] "Hide <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> and sink <b>our</b> boat! Well, I guess not!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father {{thinks it}} would be wise for us to row to Firefly Lake. Then we can hide our boat and tote <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> over to the mountains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They either took a {{large share}} of <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> away, or else hid them," [...] said Gif, after another look around. [...] "My, what a mess they did make!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then on {{a certain}} day we sailed past that land which Captain Gosnold told me was Porto Rico, and next morning came to anchor off the island of Mona, where the seamen were sent ashore to get fresh water, for <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> was running low.|$|E
60|$|After {{a certain}} time mining would {{probably}} be begun, and then, if <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of ammunition had not been replenished, the end must be near at hand, when St. Leger would have opportunity to carry into execution his threat of allowing Thayendanega's murderers to work their cruel will.|$|E
6000|$|... "We have {{sufficient}} food to last us three days {{if there is}} no game picked up on the way; but <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of water threatens to run short very soon unless we can manage to refill the canteens. Are we likely to find a stream among these hills, Poyor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We cannot {{take them}} all, Hunilla; <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> are short; {{the winds are}} unreliable; we {{may be a good}} many days going to Tombez. So take those you have, Hunilla; but no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely. Carnally and Graham {{have been}} calculating <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> closely {{and we shall}} not have much left when we reach the first cache. You had better put a barked fir-pole {{on the top of}} it; there are trees about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} you {{understand}} my unwillingness to write, {{and still more}} to print over much about our proceedings. I do speak pretty freely in New Zealand and Australia, from whence I profess and mean to draw <b>our</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{idea is that}} {{we should}} stay here to-day (<b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of water won't last much longer), and start early to-morrow morning. That would be time enough to prove whether the boats are coming, and give us a chance to get the traps into proper shape for carrying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{be careful}} of the fuel," [...] Halcon said. [...] "I would we had thought of this before we lay down to sleep. If we had {{collected}} fuel enough for our fires {{we should have been}} safe; but I doubt much if <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> will last now till morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In this heavy mist {{we should}} not see {{a quarter of a}} mile away. We have got all our clothes dry, now, and it would be a pity to get them wet again, without need or profit. Anyhow, we will find some more of those fir cones. <b>Our</b> <b>supply</b> is nearly gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you that the troops, here, are a good deal better off than they are elsewhere. There is a fearful want of land carriage, but we get <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> up by boats. That is why the Portuguese regiments are encamped on the river.|$|R
60|$|On the day Fort Donelson fell I had 27,000 men {{to confront}} the Confederate lines and guard the road four or five miles to the left, over which all <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> had to be drawn on wagons. During the 16th, after the surrender, {{additional}} reinforcements arrived.|$|R
40|$|Oil shale is a {{potential}} source of oil that will supplement conventional sources for oil as our needs for fossil fuels begin to exceed <b>our</b> <b>supplies.</b> The resource may be mined and processed on the surface {{or it may be}} processed in situ. An overview of the potential technologies and environmental issues is presented...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{will buy}} me enough turf to last {{me all the}} winter,” the old woman said. “My son is a {{fisherman}} who is sometimes weeks from home, and <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of turf is running low. Thank you very much! though I would gladly {{have done it without}} reward, for we all hate the French.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has all the}} {{men from}} Clisson, from St. Paul's and St. Briulph's-- except a few of Charles' own tenants, who went on forward to join him at Doué, and who have <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of flags with them, made in the château at Clisson. Madame de Lescure and poor Marie have worked their fingers to the bone." ...|$|E
60|$|The Spanish {{governor}} {{returned a}} very civil and obliging answer, and immediately permitted us to buy what provisions we pleased for <b>our</b> <b>supply,</b> {{or anything else}} for our use; but added, that, as for allowing any exchange of merchandises, or giving leave for European goods to be brought on shore there, he was not empowered to grant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Son of the hotel, yes," [...] said Jeff, with {{increasing}} ease. The lady continued her {{question in a}} look, and he went on: [...] "I've been scouring the country for butter and eggs this morning. We shall get all <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> from Boston next year, I hope, but we depend on the neighbors a little yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{turned my}} back upon him {{and walked to}} my tent. His acquaintances left at once, and he quickly packed and followed. Faithful old Doyle took up the duties of cook and we gained, rather than missed by the change. <b>Our</b> <b>supplies,</b> however, had been so {{depleted}} {{that we could not}} stay much longer on the hunt.|$|R
50|$|In June of 2016 {{an acre of}} exhibit space, {{located on}} the site of the Exploradome, reopened as GROW. GROW is a one-of-a-kind {{permanent}} indoor/outdoor gallery dedicated to the experience of the journey of <b>our</b> food <b>supply</b> from farm to table. This immersive and hands-on destination shows visitors the role that each of us plays in the stewardship of <b>our</b> food <b>supply.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We must husband <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of the gas," [...] said he. [...] "The {{atmosphere}} of the room is now strongly hyperoxygenated, and I take it {{that none of us}} feel any distressing symptoms. We can only determine by actual experiments what amount added to the air will serve to neutralize the poison. Let us see how that will do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's one {{satisfaction}} {{to be had}} in arousing the Frenchman's temper," [...] Mark said, grimly, {{when the}} work of disembarkation was well under way. [...] "We won't need to expect a night attack, and hang around in suspense waiting for it, because the assault is to be begun some time before sunset. We had best get out <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of ammunition, and warn the others that they will soon be needed." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{arrival of}} {{reinforcements}} {{here will be}} very encouraging to the men, and I hope they will be sent as fast as possible, and in as great numbers. My object in having them sent to Belle Plain was to use them as an escort to <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> trains. If {{it is more convenient}} to send them out by train to march from the railroad to Belle Plain or Fredericksburg, send them so.|$|E
60|$|It {{would have}} given me {{greatest}} satisfaction to ask him a few questions concerning <b>our</b> <b>supplies,</b> which, {{when he made the}} statement to the garrison, had seemed so plentiful; but, fortunately, I had sense enough to understand that, for a lad like me, to make searching inquiries of the commandant of a fort was something which the most easy-going officer would not tolerate for an instant.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of solar}} energy to stretch <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> {{of fossil fuels}} was investigated. Project SAGE (semi-automated ground environment) {{addresses}} itself to one application of this goal, solar assistance in central water heating systems for multifamily projects. Public policy issues that affect the rate of adoption of solar energy systems were investigated and policy actions were offered to accelerate the adoption of SAGE and other solar energy systems...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have a duty}} to my partner. It's {{probable}} that he has already set off, but I know where to find him, and there'll be plenty to do. For one thing, as transport is expensive, we'll have to relay <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> over very rough country, and that means the same stage several times. Then, I don't suppose Harding will have been able to buy very efficient boring plant." ...|$|R
60|$|The mistresses of American families, {{whether they}} like it or not, have the duties of missionaries imposed upon them by that class from which <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of {{domestic}} servants is drawn. They may as well accept the position cheerfully, and, as one raw, untrained hand after another passes through their family, and is instructed by them in the mysteries of good housekeeping, comfort themselves with the reflection {{that they are doing}} something to form good wives and mothers for the Republic.|$|E
60|$|Also another trouble stared {{us in the}} face; <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> of {{the crude}} mineral oil which the Abati used for {{lighting}} purposes was beginning to run low. Measurement of {{what remained of the}} store laid up for our use while the mine was being made, revealed {{the fact that there was}} only enough left to supply four lamps for about three days and nights: one for Maqueda, one for ourselves, one for the watchman near the tunnel mouth, and one for general purposes.|$|E
60|$|Upon this, {{after long}} debate, it was {{conceived}} {{that they should}} not remove their habitation, because that some time or other they thought they might hear from their governor again, meaning me; and if I should send any one to seek them, I would be sure to direct them on that side, where if they should find the place demolished they would conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were gone, and so <b>our</b> <b>supply</b> would go away too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{had better}} eat something, and then lie down for a sleep. Meat is {{plentiful}} with us, for {{there are thousands of}} goats in the forest, and occasionally we get a deer or wild boar. If we had but bread and wine we should live like nobles. <b>Our</b> <b>supplies,</b> however, are low at present, and we shall have to make an expedition, tomorrow or next day, to replenish them." ...|$|R
40|$|Newfoundland n[He] {{suggested}} I {{return home}} and move <b>our</b> <b>supplies</b> {{for the winter}} into our new house and get Aung Maggie off Square Islands [Labrador], because if all the Newfoundland people were gone, she would be there by herself on the island.

60|$|It took me {{longer to}} get under way, for I had {{determined}} {{to take at least}} thirty days' provisions for myself and a newspaper man who joined me here. <b>Our</b> <b>supplies,</b> together with tent, tools, and clothing, made a considerable outfit. However, in a few days we were ready to move, and when I again took my place {{at the head of a}} little pack train it seemed quite in the natural order of things.|$|R
