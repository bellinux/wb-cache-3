5|$|The show {{focused on}} Arab heritage, like the wedding rituals of {{countries}} in the region, and included Arab poems and songs. Iftah Ya Simsim premiered in Kuwait in September 1979, and was broadcast in all Arabic-speaking countries excluding Egypt. The show's opening consisted of a catchy tune that became beloved of its young viewers. As the song played, the opening footage showed children across the Arab world running past familiar landmarks like the Pyramids and playing in playgrounds and ancient alleyways before running into a white fort that had its gates <b>open</b> <b>wide.</b> The show's set consisted of an intricately traditional Arabian neighborhood called Sharee Eshreen (20th Street).|$|E
5|$|Two {{years passed}} {{before the next}} attempt on the Ostend locks. The First Ostend Raid was {{conducted}} {{in tandem with the}} similar Zeebrugge Raid led by Acting Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes on 23 April 1918; a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge. Both attacks largely failed, but while at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to success that it took several months for the British authorities to realise that it had been unsuccessful, at Ostend the attack had ended catastrophically. Both blockships intended to close off the canal had grounded over half a mile from their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties. Thus while Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, Ostend was <b>open</b> <b>wide,</b> nullifying any success that might have been achieved at the other port.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, saber-toothed cats {{have been}} artistically {{restored}} with external features {{similar to those}} of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G.J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to <b>open</b> <b>wide</b> without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.|$|E

25|$|Almost all vipers have keeled scales, {{a stocky}} build {{with a short}} tail, and due to the {{location}} of the venom glands, a triangle-shaped head distinct from the neck. The great majority have vertically elliptical, or slit-shaped, pupils that can <b>open</b> <b>wide</b> to cover most of the eye or close almost completely, which helps them to see {{in a wide range of}} light levels. Typically, vipers are nocturnal and ambush their prey.|$|E
25|$|Shoelaces, {{also called}} shoestrings (US English) or bootlaces (UK English), are a system {{commonly}} used to secure shoes, boots and other footwear.They typically consist {{of a pair of}} strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks {{on either side of the}} shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to <b>open</b> <b>wide</b> enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe.|$|E
25|$|After the {{commercial}} {{success of their}} first two albums, the band became involved in a dispute with their record label, Sony, regarding accounting procedures, alleging that in at least 30 cases Sony had used fraudulent accounting practices, underpaying them at least $4 million (£2.7m) in royalties on their albums over the previous three years. Sony held out, and the trio walked away, with Sony suing the group for failure to complete their contract. The Chicks responded with their own $4.1-million lawsuit against Sony Music Entertainment on August 27, which added clout to claims made by singers Courtney Love, Aimee Mann, and LeAnn Rimes against the recording industry. After months of negotiation, the Chicks settled their suit privately, and were awarded their own record label imprint, <b>Open</b> <b>Wide</b> Records, which afforded them more control, a better contract, {{and an increase in}} royalty money, with Sony still responsible for marketing and distribution of albums.|$|E

25|$|Responsible men {{can become}} more deeply {{convinced}} of {{the truth of the}} doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control. Let them first consider how easily this course of action could <b>open</b> <b>wide</b> the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings—and especially the young, who are so exposed to temptation—need incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.|$|E

The stela bears a complex design representing an undulating vision serpent rising toward the sky from the water flowing from two earth monsters, the jaws of the serpent are <b>open</b> <b>wide</b> towards the sky and from them emerges a characteristically Maya face. Several glyphs appear among the imagery. This stela is early Maya in style and dates to the Late Preclassic.|$|E

[...] Similarly, in the song [...] "Donna", Berger sings that [...] "I'm evolving through the drugs that you put down." [...] At another point, Jeanie smokes marijuana and dismisses the critics of [...] "pot". [...] Generally, the tribe favors hallucinogenic or [...] "mind expanding" [...] drugs, such as LSD and marijuana, while disapproving of other drugs such as speed and depressants. [...] For example, Jeanie, after revealing that she is pregnant by a [...] "speed freak", says that [...] "methedrine is a bad scene". [...] The song [...] "Hashish" [...] provides a list of pharmaceuticals, both illegal and legal, including cocaine, alcohol, LSD, opium and Thorazine, which is used as an antipsychotic.|$|E

2500|$|The Type L did {{not have}} a long, {{enclosed}} fuselage but instead the empennage was supported on an open girder. [...] The Type L, unusually for Caudron, had two parallel sided, cross braced side frames. The longitudinal members were steel and the cross-members ash.

At the extreme tail, the final vertical frame member served as the axis for the rudder, with a small, roughly triangular fin ahead of it. The elevator hinge was also mounted high on this member, with a straight edged tailplane ahead of it.|$|E
