5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period, the Book of the Dead {{started to}} appear in hieratic script, {{as well as in}} the {{traditional}} hieroglyphics. The hieratic scrolls were a cheaper version, lacking illustration apart from a single vignette at the beginning, and were produced <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> papyri. At the same time, many burials used additional funerary texts, for instance the Amduat.|$|E
5|$|Stronger soils make {{stronger}} walls. Adobe builders {{can test}} cured blocks for strength by dropping from a specific height or by breaking {{them with a}} lever.

5|$|The Paleo-Indians {{that survived}} are {{now known as}} the Archaic peoples of the Florida peninsula.

5|$|Use {{of the sea}} for leisure {{developed}} {{in the nineteenth century}} and became a significant industry in the twentieth century.

5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards {{preferentially}} prey <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> animals {{than those}} hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills {{when the opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena. There is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing and eating a young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the leopard.|$|E

5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E
5|$|By now the Commandos {{started to}} move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into four brigades to {{spearhead}} future Allied landing operations. The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major General Robert Sturges. Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 were used {{in the formation of the}} four Special Service brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.|$|E
5|$|Crushing {{can also}} be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due to}} environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a road roller on the tusks and then <b>on</b> <b>smaller,</b> sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.|$|E

5|$|Hawaiian {{monk seals}} mainly prey on reef {{dwelling}} bony fish, {{but they also}} prey on cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and sub-adults prey more <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> octopus species, such as Octopus leteus and O. hawaiiensis, nocturnal octopi species, and eels than do adult Hawaiian monk seals. Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as O. cyanea. Hawaiian monk seals have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed {{on a wide variety}} of available prey. Tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks are both predators of the Hawaiian Monk Seal.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside {{thousands of others}} appearing <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people, requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water, and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for charity organisations.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E
5|$|Midshipmen were {{expected}} {{to work on the}} ship, but were also expected to learn navigation and seamanship. They {{were expected}} to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising gun batteries, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. <b>On</b> <b>smaller</b> ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen {{were expected to}} keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.|$|E
