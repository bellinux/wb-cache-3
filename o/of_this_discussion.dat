5|$|The {{raising of}} Yugoslav Partisan-manned squadrons within the Royal Air Force (RAF) was {{discussed}} between the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito {{and the head}} of the British mission to the Partisans, Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean, on 12 March 1944. As a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion,</b> an agreement was concluded later that month for the RAF to train Yugoslav personnel who would man two squadrons, one of fighters and one of fighter-bombers. After completing training, these two squadrons were to conduct operations exclusively over Yugoslavia. It was agreed that the new squadrons would largely be staffed by former VVKJ personnel who had fled the country during the invasion and had later agreed to join the Partisans. The first squadron was raised at an airfield near Benghazi, Libya, as No. 352 (Yugoslav) Squadron RAF. Members took their Partisan oaths on 21 May 1944. Until late June, this squadron was equipped with Harvard training aircraft and Hurricane Mk IICs, which were then replaced by Supermarine Spitfire Mk Vs, which it operated until the end of the war. The Hurricane Mk IICs were handed over to a second Partisan-manned squadron, raised as No. 351 (Yugoslav) Squadron RAF, which was also established as a fighter-bomber unit in Libya on 1 July 1944.|$|E

25|$|There {{was another}} {{proposal}} in 1929, {{but nothing came}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> and the idea was shelved. Proponents estimated construction to be about US$150 million. The engineers had addressed the concerns of both nations' military leaders by designing two sumps—one near the coast of each country—that could be flooded at will to block the tunnel. This design feature did not override the concerns of both nations' military leaders, and other concerns about hordes of undesirable tourists who would disrupt English habits of living. Military fears continued during the Second World War. After the fall of France, as Britain prepared for an expected German invasion, a Royal Navy officer in the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development calculated that Hitler could use slave labour to build two Channel tunnels in 18 months. The estimate caused rumours that Germany had already begun digging.|$|E

25|$|If {{this move}} was {{intended}} to free the Wemyss Estate coal masters from their constraints it failed, for the North British Railway continued to be the sole haulier for coal from any distance, and Leven Harbour was unsatisfactory, and not easily reached by rail {{from many of the}} East Fife pits. Several other small harbours were developed, but this too failed to resolve the problem, and in any case numerous new pits had been opened remote from the existing railway. In May 1874 a Committee of coalmasters discussed building their own line to the developing Methil Dock, a little west of Leven. Nothing came <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> at first, but in 1878 a definite scheme was produced to connect Buckhaven with Thornton. Thornton was chosen as the junction because of the convenience of bringing coal from Dunfermline.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{a fierce}} debate {{occurred}} about {{the rate of}} profit between leading Marxist economists from various political organizations in Western Europe and North America. According to the French Marxist economist Michel Husson, there were basically four bones of contention: (1) how had the average rate of profit in industries evolved since the early 1980s, in the larger developed capitalist countries? (2) what is the theoretical status of the tendential fall {{in the rate of}} profit in the Marxist analysis? (3) {{what is the nature of}} the capitalist crisis today? (4) what is the political relevance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion?</b> However, there was very little agreement about concepts, measurement principles, and political perspectives among participants. According to some (like Michel Husson) the rate of profit had gone up again since 1980, while others (like Andrew Kliman) thought it had stayed down. All kinds of different political conclusions were being drawn from the econometric evidence. The traditional orthodox Marxist narrative is that capitalist crises are crises of profitability: the economic disturbance is caused by the circumstance that capitalists are making insufficient profits, and not because there are insufficient goods for everybody. That situation is bound to happen, because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Once workers understand that, they can break with illusions about reforming capitalism, and prepare for revolution. Critics point out, however, that this kind of interpretation is problematic. There are two main reasons.|$|E

It became known that Khrushchev had hinted to Venizelos that the Soviet Union {{would not be}} against territorial and/or political concessions to the Greeks by the Albanians...

500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{combined}} Franco-Spanish expedition first arose in 1704, when the governor of Florida, José de Zúñiga y la Cerda, discussed the idea with a French naval captain {{as a means of}} revenge for the Carolina raids; however, no concrete action came <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion.</b> [...] Pierre LeMoyne d'Iberville, the founder of Mobile and an experienced privateer who had previously wrought havoc against English colonial settlements in the Nine Years' War, in 1703 developed a grandiose plan for assaulting Carolina. [...] Using minimal French resources, d'Iberville planned for a small French fleet to join with a large Spanish fleet at Havana, which would then descend on Carolina's capital, then known as Charles Town. [...] The expedition was to be paid for by holding other English colonial communities hostage after destroying Charles Town. [...] It was not until late 1705 that d'Iberville secured permission from King Louis XIV for the expedition. [...] The king provided ships and some troops, but required d'Iberville to bear the upfront cost of outfitting the expedition.|$|E

2500|$|In {{twentieth century}} {{philosophy}} {{the concept of}} the sensus communis as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of relativism are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as Jacques Rancière indeed take the lead from Jean-François Lyotard and refer to the [...] "postmodern" [...] condition as one where there is [...] "dissensus communis".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the course}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion,</b> Nixon learned or was {{reminded}} that Helms was a career civil servant, {{not a political}} appointee.

[...] "I'm not sure how the Russians might interpret my being sent across the lines as an ambassador," [...] Helms remembers telling Nixon. Instead Helms proposed being sent to Iran. Nixon assented. Among other things Nixon perhaps figured Helms, after managing CIA's long involvement in Iranian affairs, would be capable in addressing issues arising out of Nixon's recent policy decision conferring on the Shah his new role as [...] "policeman of the Gulf".|$|E

2500|$|In 1958 Mao Zedong {{tried to}} look for {{supporters}} within the Soviet leadership for his planned war with the Republic of China (Taiwan). He flabbergasted Gromyko by telling {{him that he was}} willing to sacrifice the lives of [...] "300 million people" [...] just for the sake of annexing the Republic of China into the People's Republic of China. Gromyko assured Mao that the proposal would never get the approval of the Soviet leadership. When the Soviet leadership learnt <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> they responded by terminating the Soviet-Chinese nuclear program and various industrialization projects in the People's Republic of China. Years later Gromyko, during the Cuban Missile Crisis under Nikita Khrushchev, acting on the instruction of the Soviet leadership met John F. Kennedy, then President of the United States. Gromyko wrote in his Memoirs that Kennedy seemed out of touch when he first met him, he further claimed that Kennedy was not practical but instead very ideologically driven. Gromyko, in an interview in 1988, described Kennedy as nervous and said most of his arguments were contradictory. Threats towards Cuba were followed by assertions by the United States government that they were not planning any assaults on Cuba. During his twenty-eight years as Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko supported the policy of disarmament, stating in his Memoirs that [...] "Disarmament is the ideal of Socialism".|$|E
