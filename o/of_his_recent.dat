5|$|Allemand {{requested}} that Cotes come aboard Carmagnole, but Cotes responded {{that he was}} unable to do so as his ship's boats had all been destroyed. Allemand sent a boat from his own ship to Thames and brought Cotes to Carmagnole as a prisoner of war; Cotes used the delay to destroy his ship's documents. Allemand questioned Cotes intently about the nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> combat and, on identifying Uranie as one of his own squadron, commented that Tartu should have defeated Thames in half the time the action had taken.|$|E
5|$|In 1171 Rhys {{made peace}} with King Henry and was {{confirmed}} in possession <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> conquests {{as well as being}} named Justiciar of South Wales. He maintained good relations with King Henry until the latter's death in 1189. Following Henry's death Rhys revolted against Richard I and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory, capturing a number of castles. In his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly Maelgwn and Gruffydd, who maintained a feud with each other. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196 and captured a number of castles. The following year he died unexpectedly and was buried in St David's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|It soon {{becomes clear}} that MacPherson is being poisoned. Nikola {{believes}} that Brandt is responsible, because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> disappearances, but is proven wrong. After MacPherson dies, Sarah Walker takes his place as commander of Strike Force Centauri. Walker sends Nikola, disguised as a pirate, on an espionage mission to discover the traitor's identity. Nikola finds information that incriminates Ashford, who, when confronted, boasts of his actions and leaps to his death from a docking bay. The squad continues the war, and the Hegemony is eventually forced to gather its remaining forces at a base on Thatcher. The squad destroys the facility by detonating a highly explosive fuel tank inside it. Following its defeat, the Hegemony denies involvement in the war, declares Pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to the system. While angered by the announcement, Strike Force Centauri celebrates its victory as the game ends.|$|E

5|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even in the wake <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E

25|$|As Ambassador, McKenna {{attracted}} more media attention than most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> predecessors {{on both sides}} of the border. In the U.S. his message was one of dispelling common urban legends and misconceptions about Canada, while in Canada he urged Canadians to be more understanding of the American people and culture, particularly following what he argued is their understandable sensitivity after the September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|E

25|$|In October 1640, with {{opinion in}} the country {{swinging}} against the king's supporters (including Coventry), Cooper was not asked to stand for election for Tewkesbury in the Long Parliament. He contested, and by some accounts, won a by-election to the seat of Downton in Wiltshire, but Denzil Holles, soon to rise to prominence {{as a leader of}} the opposition to the King and a personal rival of Sir Anthony, blocked Cooper's admission to the Parliament. It was probably feared that Sir Anthony, as a result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> marriage to the daughter of Charles I's Lord Keeper, Coventry, would be too sympathetic to the king.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Hanna Batatu, Bitar {{was born}} in the Midan area of Damascus in 1912; {{he was the son of}} a reasonably well-off Sunni Muslim grain merchant. His family were religious and many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> ancestors had been ulama and preachers in the district's mosques. Bitar grew up in a conservative family atmosphere and attended a Muslim elementary school before receiving his secondary education in Maktab Anbar. He was exposed to the political vicissitudes of the time, as Midan played a leading role in the Great Syrian Revolution of 1925 against Francethen the mandatory power in Syria. The district was heavily bombarded with considerable loss of life and physical damage.|$|E
25|$|The young Asada invited {{two friends}} to help him: the {{architectural}} critic and {{former editor of}} the magazine Shinkenchiku, Noboru Kawazoe, and Kisho Kurokawa who was one of Tange's students. In turn these two men scouted for more talented designers to help, including: the architects Masato Otaka and Kiyonori Kikutake and the designers Kenji Ekuan and Kiyoshi Awazu. Kurokawa was selected because he had recently returned from an international student conference in the Soviet Union and was a student of the Marxist architectural theorist Uzo Nishiyama. Ekuan was asked because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> participation in a seminar given by Konrad Wachsmann (he arrived at the lecture on a YA-1 motorbike that he had newly designed for Yamaha) and Otaka was a junior associate of Kunio Maekawa and had just completed the Harumi Apartment Building in Tōkyō Bay. Fumihiko Maki, a former undergraduate student of Tange also joined the group whilst in Tōkyō on a travelling fellowship from the Graham Foundation.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} this time that the Trojans were unable to defeat their rivals. They {{suffered}} winless streaks of 13 years (1983–1995, including the 1994 17–17 tie) to rival Notre Dame and 8 years (1991–1998) to crosstown rival UCLA which were unacceptable to many USC supporters. Under Robinson the Trojans were 2-2-1 against Notre Dame, but unable to beat UCLA. After posting a 6-6 record in 1996, and a 6-5 record in 1997, Robinson was fired. In 1998, head coach Paul Hackett took over the team, but posted an even more disappointing 19–18 record in three seasons than any <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> predecessors. By 2000, some observers surmised that USC football's days of national dominance were fading; the football team's record of 37–35 from 1996 to 2001 was their second-worst over any five-year span in history (only the mark of 29–29–2 from 1956–1961 was worse), and the period marked {{the first and only}} time USC had been out of the final top 20 teams for four straight years.|$|E
500|$|A {{defining}} {{feature of}} the album is the strong presence of romantic ballads. The ballad [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] was described as [...] "sublime" [...] by one critic, although not all the ballads received universal praise. Alexis Taylor, the main contributor to the lyrics, stated that {{he was proud of}} the album lyrically and felt that feelings of love and happiness, partly the result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> marriage, had contributed to the album's romantic tone.|$|E

Upon {{returning}} from Uluru, Fanning wrote [...] "Black Tears", which intended to [...] "document a relationship gone wrong". In his piece, Fanning also criticised the 17-year life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, and encouraged all to join a conversation on reconciliation.|$|E
