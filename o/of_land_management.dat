A case study approach {{was used to}} provide an in depth analysis of the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Management???s</b> Eagle Lake Field Office???s management considerations for wild horses and burros in California???s Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. The study followed the planning process and removal of wild horses and burros from the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area.

The U.S. Weather Bureau office was moved to {{the second floor of the}} old administration building on June 5, 1969. The U.S. Weather Bureau made the Boise office its “hub of fire weather activities” in the west where fire weather specialists are able to make face to face contact with the Forest Service and Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Management</b> fire dispatchers. U.S. Congress approved the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) requested for $316,000 in additional funds in the fiscal year 1970 budget in July 1969 for the Boise, Idaho, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and for bringing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma up to full Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) status. On June 22, 1970, the Boise Forecast Office began issuing official weather forecasts for Idaho south of the Salmon River. The U.S. Weather Bureau changed their name to the National Weather Service on October 1, 1970.|$|E

5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>management,</b> but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E

5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable.

The pools are also one of only a few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Management</b> has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{have been}} present in the American West since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were {{released}} by the Spanish or stolen by Native Americans. Their descendents crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds brought by farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses brought by the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved {{across the border from}} Canada to contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the Mustang present in the western portion of the US today. By the early 1970s, it was assumed that due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from feral herds. In 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Management</b> (BLM) the authority to manage the feral horse populations in the American West.|$|E
5|$|Many {{overlapping}} entities including city, county, state, {{and federal}} governments share jurisdiction for parts of the watershed. About 60percent of the basin is publicly owned and is managed by the United States Forest Service, the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Management</b> (BLM), and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), assisted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and other agencies in both states, is charged with controlling water pollution in the basin. United States National Forests and other forests cover about 83percent of the basin; another 6percent is grassland, 3percent shrub, and only 0.2percent wetland.
