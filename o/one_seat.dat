Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of <b>one</b> <b>seat</b> per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.|$|E

The Hungarian minority in Croatia is recognised by the Constitution of Croatia; minority rights (including official use of Hungarian by local governments and education in Hungarian) are safeguarded by legislation enacted by the Sabor. Seven municipalities in Croatia introduced Hungarian for official use (either in part of their territory or the entire municipality), depending on the distribution of the Hungarian population there. There are five Hungarian minority organizations in Croatia, and the Hungarian minority is guaranteed <b>one</b> <b>seat</b> in the Croatian Parliament.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} in 1946, after the Japanese Occupation and the {{disbanding}} of the Straits Settlements, that the people were allowed to elect members into the Legislative Council.

Although UMNO lost all its bids, relations between PAP and UMNO worsened. The PAP, in a tit-for-tat, challenged UMNO candidates in the 1964 federal election as part of the Malaysian Solidarity Convention, winning <b>one</b> <b>seat</b> in Malaysian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions taken}} against the {{military}} {{contributed to a}} strong showing by the UCR in the November 1985 legislative elections.

The Justicialists lost eight seats (leaving 103) and smaller, provincial parties made up the difference. Alfonsín surprised observers in April 1986 by announcing {{the creation of a}} panel entrusted to plan a transfer of the nation's capital to Viedma, a small coastal city 800km (500mi) south of Buenos Aires. His proposals boldly called for constitutional amendments creating a Parliamentary system, including a Prime Minister, and were well received by the Chamber of Deputies, though they encountered strong opposition in the Senate.|$|E
