40|$|A thermal–hydraulic {{system code}} is an {{essential}} tool for the design and safety analysis of a nuclear power plant, and its accuracy quantification {{is very important for}} the code assessment and applications. The fast Fourier transform-based method (FFTBM) by signal mirroring (FFTBM-SM) has been used to quantify the accuracy of a system code by using a comparison of the experimental data and the calculated results. The method is an improved version of the FFTBM, and it is known that the FFTBM-SM judges the code accuracy in a more consistent and unbiased way. However, in some applications, unrealistic results have been obtained. In this study, it was found that accuracy quantification by FFTBM-SM is dependent on the frequency spectrum of the fast Fourier transform of experimental and error signals. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} reduce the frequency dependency of FFTBM-SM evaluation. For this, it was proposed to reduce the cut <b>off</b> <b>frequency,</b> which was introduced to cut off spurious contributions, in FFTBM-SM.

40|$|An {{increased}} <b>frequency</b> {{of kidney}} <b>rejection</b> {{has been reported}} in diabetic patients who have simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation compared with patients who have a kidney transplant alone. Kidney graft outcome is similar in the two groups. The mechanism for increased kidney graft rejection with a simultaneous pancreas graft is not clear. It is ascribed to the immunogenicity of the exocrine pancreas that initiates migration of activated cells from the peripheral blood that are entrapped in the kidney. Since the volume of the transplanted tissue is less in islet transplantation (usually < 2 ml) than in pancreas transplantation, one might not expect an increased <b>frequency</b> of kidney <b>rejection</b> in islet cell recipients. We looked at biopsy- proven kidney rejection episodes in patients who had combined kidney and islet transplants and compared this with the <b>frequency</b> of <b>rejection</b> in diabetic and nondiabetic patients who underwent a kidney transplant alone under the same immunosuppression. Diabetic patients who had kidney islet transplants (n= 9) had a higher <b>frequency</b> of <b>rejection</b> (100 %) compared with diabetic patients (n= 107, 55. 1 %) and nondiabetic patients (n= 327, 65 %) who had a kidney transplant alone. The 1 -year graft and patient survival rates were not different among the groups. Although the number of patients is small, it would appear that transplantation of a low volume of islet cells with high purity can lead to an increased <b>frequency</b> of kidney <b>rejection.</b> This is unlikely to be explained {{solely on the basis of}} fewer antigen matches in these recipients but may reflect the inherent immunogenicity of the purified islet preparations.
