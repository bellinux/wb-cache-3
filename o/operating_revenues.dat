5|$|As {{a public}} university, McGill {{is not as}} {{dependent}} on its endowment for operating revenue as some of its international peers. The McGill endowment only provides approximately 10 per cent of the school's annual <b>operating</b> <b>revenues.</b> Nonetheless, McGill's endowment rests within the top 10 percent of all North American post-secondary institutions' endowments. While McGill's conservative investment policy has protected it from the more substantial losses experienced at many other universities during the market crisis of 2008–2009, it still faced a 20% endowment decline from approximately $920 million to $740 million. Currently valued at $39,323 per student, the university's endowment is the second largest among Canadian universities on a per-student basis.|$|E
5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of <b>operating</b> <b>revenues</b> and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of lower {{government}} funding, Canadian cities have to recover a much higher share of their costs out of <b>operating</b> <b>revenues.</b> This lack of funding may explain why there is resistance to the high capital costs of rail systems and {{there are only a}} few light rail systems in Canada.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the New York City Transit System {{showed an}} {{operating}} surplus on the five-cent fare, because gasoline was rationed and auto riders had {{to abandon their}} cars for subway and bus travel. Factories began to work around the clock, and therefore business boomed. Transit repairs were kept at a minimum as basic materials were in short supply for civilian use. <b>Operating</b> <b>revenues</b> were raised and maintenance costs were reduced, but as a result, the future problems of deferred maintenance and falling ridership. In 1946, costs rose and profits turned to losses, and to obtain needed funds, the fare was raised in 1948 to ten cents on the subways and elevated, and to seven cents on the surface lines. This increase only produced a revenue surplus for a single year. In 1951 a uniform ten-cent fare was established on both the rapid transit and surface lines. Operating deficits continued to add up and public dissatisfaction with the transit system grew, as equipment was deteriorating, and train schedules being difficult to abide by.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptian {{government}} highly subsidizes the sector. The Egyptian Water Regulatory Agency {{estimates the}} degree of overall cost recovery in 2012/13 at 62%, and the recovery of {{operation and maintenance costs}} excluding depreciation at 76%. The regulator classifies this as insufficient compared to a good performance of more than 80% full cost recovery and more than 100% operation and maintenance cost recovery. This is lower than {{the degree of}} cost recovery achieved in 2010, when the recovery of operation and maintenance costs, excluding depreciation, through <b>operating</b> <b>revenues</b> was 95% for water supply and sanitation, ranging from 31% in Sinai to 134% in Beheira. Nevertheless, the degree of cost recovery is apparently higher {{than it was in the}} early 2000s. According to one estimate dating from prior to 2007, cost recovery was only 20%, with tariffs at 0.23 EP per m3 and costs at 1.10 EP per m3. According to another estimate, between 1982 and 2004 the government spent 65 billion Egyptian pounds (about 10.73 billion USD at the exchange rate of 2004) for water supply and sanitation, of which 40% was recovered through tariff revenues.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the performance of audit firms in the Republic of Serbia in the period 2008 - 2010. For this period the trend in the number of audit firms in the Republic of Serbia, the size and number of employees in audit firms, and the participation of individual audit firms in total <b>operating</b> <b>revenue,</b> employment, and net income were observed. Further, correlation analysis of variations in <b>operating</b> <b>revenue,</b> employment, and net income of audit firms was carried out. The analysis showed the absence of the expected correlation between <b>operating</b> <b>revenue</b> and net income, as well as between the number of employees and net income. Additional analysis showed that the newly established audit firms achieved lower than average results and a higher level of variation in the level of profitability in relation to the audit firms that have been in the audit service market longer.
