5|$|Massive Dynamic {{executive}} Mark Young (Ptolemy Slocum) {{delivers a}} {{presentation at the}} company’s Manhattan office. When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing to go <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E
5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. He goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E

Helen, tipsy after dinner, lets Leslie know she can tell he's fondly remembering his former flame. Leslie's guilt gets the better of him, Helen having financed his way through medical school, but his heartstrings are pulling him in another direction.|$|R
50|$|Sheldon and Amy are {{shooting}} an Internet show called Fun with Flags. Leonard interrupts them heading <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> Penny. Penny is {{glad that he}} asked her out {{and that they should}} take their relationship slow. Leonard suggests that they treat any issues as computer bugs and report them so they can be fixed. They agree to keep each other informed and then say good night. Leonard returns to his apartment interrupting Fun with Flags, take 47.|$|R
60|$|Poor Frank {{had hardly}} {{anticipated}} what {{there would be}} to do, and before dinner was announced he was very tired of it. He had no warmer feeling {{for any of the}} grand cousins than a very ordinary cousinly love; and he had resolved, forgetful of birth and blood, and all those gigantic considerations which, now that manhood had come upon him, he was bound always to bear in mind,--he had resolved <b>to</b> sneak <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> comfortably <b>with</b> Mary Thorne if possible; and if not with Mary, then with his other love, Patience Oriel.|$|R
25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} of the good order of the house during the time of Richard de Morins; he would {{scarcely}} have been chosen twice to visit other houses unless he had ruled his own with care and diligence. During his forty years of office canons of Dunstable were at least five times elected priors to other monasteries of the order—at Caldwell, St. Frideswide's, Ashby and Coldnorton. Bishop Grosseteste visited the house once in 1236, not so much to inquire into the daily life of the priory as to investigate its title to several appropriate churches; but he exacted an oath on this occasion from all the canons individually, and one of them fled to Woburn rather than submit to it. The bishop came again in 1248, while Geoffrey of Barton was prior; when the cellarer, accused by many, fled before his coming to Merivale; but he {{does not seem to have}} found fault with the convent in general, and his next visit in 1250 was for purposes of his own. Archbishop Boniface came in 1253, but made no complaint. In 1274 Bishop Gravesend sent a canon of Lincoln to visit Dunstable, who left his corrections in writing; and in Advent of the same year he made a personal visitation. In November 1279 Bishop Sutton came and discharged his office 'strictly and without respect of persons.' The sub-prior and certain others were removed from their charge, and forbidden to hold office in future, and certain 'less useful members' of the household expelled; in May of the following year he deposed the prior, William le Breton, from all pastoral care. It seems most likely that these depositions were on account of mismanagement rather than for any personal failings; the great necessity and heavy debts of the house called for stringent measures, and William le Breton had shown himself (like Abbot Richard of Woburn in a similar case) unable to meet the difficulty. There is no sign of any other grave faults having been committed, nor of anything like luxurious living. The new prior, according to the bishop's advice, set himself to limit the expenses of the whole house and assigned a fixed income to the kitchen for the future; the deposed prior had a proper maintenance assigned to him at Ruxox. The canons seem to have borne no ill-will to Bishop Sutton for his corrections, and were ready on his next visit to their church (which was made not officially but only in passing) to praise him for his excellent sermon. Other visitations of his are mentioned in 1284, 1287, 1288, and 1293; the last was only to confer orders. Archbishop Peckham came in 1284, but found all well ('as the bishop had been there quite lately,' the chronicler naively remarks); and Archbishop Winchelsea in 1293. The only serious charge that could be laid to the door of the canons all through the thirteenth century was their inability to keep clear of debt; and the record shows that this was often quite as much their misfortune as their fault. There are many incidental remarks of the chroniclers which serve to show that the tone of the house was thoroughly religious, and that the canons were faithful in keeping their rule. It will suffice to instance, early in the century, the generous treatment of the two young canons (one only a novice), who escaped by night through a window and went to join the Friars Minor at Oxford. They were indeed solemnly excommunicated and compelled to return; but after they had done their penance in the chapter house and had been absolved, they were allowed a year to consider the matter, and if after that time they preferred the stricter order, they were granted permission to depart; if not, they might remain at Dunstable. A good deal later than this, in 1283, the apologetic way in which the chronicler relates how the prior went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> John Durant is sufficient to show that the ordinary rules and customs of the order were not commonly broken.|$|E
500|$|Following Karl's {{affair with}} Sarah, Susan goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> Martin Chester (Gil Tucker), a former boyfriend {{and member of}} Karl's {{university}} band. Woodburne told Annette Dasey of Inside Soap that Karl knows Martin is taking Susan to dinner {{and he does not}} think she would be capable of any [...] "misconduct" [...] with him. The actress explained [...] "Susan is very attracted to Martin, but she wouldn't be aware of it if her marriage was more solid and she wasn't feeling so unloved." [...] Woodburne stated that Susan is tempted to have a fling, but she ultimately decides that she wants to save her marriage. Despite Karl's affair, she still loves him and they need to work through their problems. Woodburne was good friends with Tucker as they previously worked together on Cop Shop.|$|E
500|$|Ellen goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> her {{old friend}} Richard, a {{reporter}} who is in town to cover a story. His producer, Susan, joins them for dessert and she and Ellen hit it off. Ellen goes back to Richard's hotel room. He comes on to her and, uncomfortable, Ellen leaves. She runs into Susan {{in the hall and}} returns with her to her room. They continue to enjoy each other's company until Susan tells Ellen that she's gay and that she thought Ellen might be too. Ellen denies it and suggests that Susan is trying to [...] "recruit" [...] her. Susan sarcastically says that she'll have to call [...] "national headquarters" [...] and let them know Ellen got away. ("Damn, just one more and I would have gotten that toaster oven.") An agitated Ellen leaves Susan's room and returns to Richard's room, determined to have sex with him to prove to herself she is not gay.|$|E
50|$|Hammond {{appears in}} the 2008 storyline Green Lantern: Secret Origin, a re-telling of Hal Jordan's first days as a Green Lantern. In that storyline, Hammond aspires to be Carol Ferris' boyfriend, {{feelings}} that are not reciprocated by Ferris, who merely went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> one <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> him for business purposes, as he is a private consultant for Ferris Aircraft. While inspecting Abin Sur's crashed spacecraft, Hammond {{is affected by the}} meteorite fragment used as a power source in its reactor, which results in an increase in his brain size and telepathic abilities, with which he learns Jordan is a Green Lantern. He attempts to use his telepathy to keep Hal from using his ring, but is thwarted by Sinestro. It is revealed that Hammond wants the power of a god in order to gain revenge on Hal Jordan/Green Lantern.|$|R
50|$|The Baileys call {{a doctor}} to examine him. The doctor arrives and takes the stranger's {{temperature}} with her thermometer. As the doctor holds it up to his mouth, the stranger blows on it and the mercury inside freezes. The doctor thinks that the thermometer is broken. Although the stranger isn't seriously hurt, he can't remember who he is or where he's from. The doctor gives advice to the Baileys, telling them to give the stranger shelter until he regains his memory. They do and he fits in well with the family and even helps out on the farm. One night, the stranger comes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> the Baileys. They are having soup, and the stranger notices steam rising from his bowl. He sees the little girl blowing on the soup to help it cool. He lightly blows on his own bowl, and the steam drifts away. When he blows, Mrs. Bailey feels a draft on her spine.|$|R
60|$|As Benham grew to look manly {{and bear}} himself with pride, his mother's affection for him {{blossomed into a}} passion. She made him come down to London from Cambridge as often as she could; she went about with him; she made him squire her to theatres and take her <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinners</b> and sup <b>with</b> her at the Carlton, and in the summer she had him with her at Chexington Manor, the Hertfordshire house Sir Godfrey had given her. And always when they parted she {{looked into his eyes}} to see if they were still clean--whatever she meant by that--and she kissed his {{forehead}} and cheeks and eyes and lips. She began to make schemes for his career, she contrived introductions she judged would be useful to him later.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} days of the space program, astronauts and reporters would often socialize {{together}} in Cocoa Beach, and had a very different relationship than they do today. Barbree described his relationship with the astronauts as a friend and confidant, often going <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> them, or socializing together when the astronauts were in town. In his book, Barbree writes that in 1961 Alan Shepard told him an [...] "off the record" [...] fact: He was going to be the first American astronaut in space. Barbree noted that if he were to report this, it would not only jeopardize the friendships, but possibly his career as well, so he said nothing. Barbree also recounts a conversation with Gus Grissom about the astronaut’s concerns regarding Apollo not long before the fatal Apollo 1 fire. Barbree's association with the astronauts had some unexpected bonuses as well, Neil Armstrong carried a gold coin to the moon on Apollo 11 for Barbree, and Pete Conrad flew several flags and patches on Apollo 12, which Barbree later handed out to friends.|$|E
2500|$|Brown is a Christian. He says, I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian, that I {{believe in}} the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, that I read the Bible every day. I'm still me.

We'll go to dinner and we'll be sitting around the table and we'll say Grace. You know what? People are going to stare at you. I used to feel really self-conscious. But I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about that. I'm not going to apologize about that. Brown said in a December 2014 interview in Time that he [...] "could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention's indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance" [...] adding that he's now [...] "searching for a new belief system." ...|$|E

At dinner, he was envied and flattered as a being of might, was Treasuried, Barred, and Bishoped, {{as much as he}} would; and an hour after midnight came home alone, and being instantly put out again in his own hall, like a rushlight, by the chief butler, went sighing to bed.|$|E
