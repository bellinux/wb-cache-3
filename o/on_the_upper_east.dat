5|$|The film's premise was {{inspired}} by a French couple in an open marriage whom Levin met in the 1980s. Though he completed the film's first draft in 2007, the project remained in development for seven further years due to casting issues.

5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> Side, prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started.

50|$|In July 2008 the Mount Benson Regional Park, {{comprising}} 212 ha <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> north <b>east</b> {{slope of}} Mount Benson was established on land acquired in 2005 by the Regional District of Nanaimo and the Nanaimo and Area Land Trust.

5|$|In early 2015, {{as part of}} its expansion, NYCDOT and Motivate {{increased}} the price of annual memberships from $95 to $149 plus taxes, although annual rates for New York City Housing Authority residents and members of some Community Development Credit Unions will remain at $60 per year. That year, the company installed 91 new stations in Queens and Brooklyn, with 12 of these stations in Long Island City and the other 79 in Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and Bedford-Stuyvesant.

5|$|In {{addition}} to connecting the BMT Nassau Street and IND Sixth Avenue Lines, {{as well as}} the Sixth Avenue Line to the Manhattan Bridge, the Chrystie Street Connection {{is one of the few}} completed sections of the SAS. The Grand Street station was built to serve as a transfer point between the Sixth Avenue and Second Avenue lines. The connection was built this way because the original 1960s plans for the SAS had Second Avenue and Sixth Avenue Line trains sharing two island platforms in a four-track layout, with connections from the Second Avenue Line to the Sixth Avenue Line and the Manhattan Bridge. Because Second Avenue Subway construction was halted in 1975, this station has only served Sixth Avenue Line trains since its opening. As part of the contemporary Second Avenue Subway construction, a new station is planned for construction below the current station during the fourth and final phase of the project; Phase 1 of the project <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> Side opened on January 1, 2017, with Phase 2 in planning and two other phases with no funding commitments.|$|E
