5|$|The Second World War brought havoc to Wearside, with Sunderland one of {{the seven}} most heavily bombed towns in the country. Despite the heavy {{shelling}} of the North East coast and River Wear, the Echo offices and printing plant escaped undamaged. The Shields Gazette, the Echo's nearest rival, was not as fortunate. Its premises in Chapter Row, South Shields, were bombed in September 1941 and, under an emergency wartime arrangement, the paper was printed on the Echo presses. The Echo continued to be published throughout the war, despite paper rationing, a lack <b>of</b> <b>reporters</b> and a strict censorship of photographs. The war did have one major impact on the Echo—in the form of its size. Wartime restrictions on newsprint reduced the former broadsheet to its present tabloid size, and this style has been retained ever since.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} {{to be free from}} the {{distraction}} <b>of</b> <b>reporters.</b> The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} {{the current status}} <b>of</b> the <b>reporter</b> gene technology and their basics. Reporter gene technology is widely used to monitor cellular events associated with gene expression and signal transduction. Based upon the splicing of transcription-al control elements to a variety <b>of</b> <b>reporter</b> genes, it “reports ” {{the effects of a}} cascade of signaling events on gene expression inside cells. The principal advan-tage of these assays is their high sensitivity, reliability, convenience and adaptability to large scale measure-ments. The reporter gene systems β-galactosidase (LacZ), luciferases (LUC), β-glucoronidase (GUS), green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP-like pro-teins, widely used presently, are compared. The poten-tialities <b>of</b> a new <b>reporter</b> system, based on ther-mostable lichenase (β- 1, 3 - 1, 4 -gluconases) of Clostridium thermocellum are described in detail. Advantages and disadvantages <b>of</b> the used <b>reporter</b> systems, and also the opportunities for development and application <b>of</b> bifunctional <b>reporter</b> systems are considered.

She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group <b>of</b> <b>reporters.</b> As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying.

5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group <b>of</b> <b>reporters</b> while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

40|$|Molecular imaging is a newly emerged {{multiple}} disciplinary {{field that}} aims to visualize, characterize and quantitatively measure biological processes at cellular and molecular levels in humans and other living systems. A reporter gene is a piece <b>of</b> DNA encoding <b>reporter</b> protein, which presents as a readily measurable phenotype that can be distinguished easily from the background of endogenous protein. After being transferred into cells of organ systems (transgenes), the reporter gene can be utilized to visualize transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, protein-protein interactions, or trafficking of proteins or cells in living subjects. Herein, we review previous classification <b>of</b> <b>reporter</b> genes and regroup the reporter gene based imaging as basic, inducible and activatable, based on the regulation <b>of</b> <b>reporter</b> gene transcription and post-translational modification <b>of</b> <b>reporter</b> proteins. We then focus on activatable reporters, in which the signal can be activated at the posttranslational level for visualizing protein-protein interactions, protein phosphorylation or tertiary structure changes. The applications of several types <b>of</b> activatable <b>reporters</b> will also be summarized. We conclude that activatable reporter imaging can benefit both basic biomedical research and drug development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP 1) {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and the immunofluorescent intensity of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs). PML NBs have been implicated in the modulation of transcription and the association <b>of</b> <b>reporter</b> plasmids with PML NBs has been implicated in repression <b>of</b> <b>reporter</b> activity. Additionally, repression <b>of</b> various <b>reporters</b> in the presence of LMP 1 has been noted. This study demonstrates that LMP 1 suppresses expression <b>of</b> <b>reporter</b> activity in a dose responsive manner and corresponds with the LMP 1 induced increase in PML NB intensity. Disruption of PML NBs with arsenic trioxide or a PML siRNA restores reporter activity. These data offer an explanation for previously conflicting data on LMP 1 signaling and calls attention to the possibility of false-positives and false-negatives when using reporter assays as a research tool in cells expressing LMP 1. </p...|$|R
