We demonstrate using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to effectively circumvent the <b>optical</b> background <b>noises.</b> Besides, by using simple equalization at the receiver side, the transmission capacity can be extended from 1 Mb/s to 12 Mb/s. The theory and analysis of the equalization are presented. Experiments at different data rates and different OFDM subcarriers are preformed, and results show that, by adjusting the number of OFDM subcarriers, the influence of the background <b>optical</b> <b>noises</b> can be significantly circumvented.

30|$|The other {{phenomenon}} {{affecting the}} performances of underwater laser imagers is scattering. Light backscattered by water and falling into the angular field {{of view of the}} receiver gives rise to an undesirable signal (<b>optical</b> <b>noise),</b> which combines with the target signal that carries the information necessary to image reconstruction. (Because of its deleterious effects on 3 D imaging measures, the signal due to light backscattered by water {{is often referred to as}} <b>optical</b> <b>noise</b> in this work-although it cannot be considered noise in strict sense.) The result is a reduction of the accuracy of range measurements, as well as a degradation of image contrast. It follows that <b>optical</b> <b>noise</b> has to be strongly reduced, in order to obtain 3 D images of high contrast, resolution and accuracy.|$|E
