500|$|Rix {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth died. Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: [...] "I could scarcely put <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other and walked like an old thing".|$|E

500|$|Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail has criticised Amy for {{the amount}} of make-up she wears. When Leyla accused her of thieving, Stephen said it couldn't have been her because she wears too much eye make-up. She jibed [...] "she's lucky she can find <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other." [...] When Amy is unsure whether or not to abort her baby, Stephen jested her first {{decision}} should be whether to change her mascara - [...] "I’ve seen less fuel-faced coal miners." [...] Stephen opined that it was obvious David was heading for trouble with [...] "gratingly Geordie Amy." [...] She said she had no sympathy for him because he knowingly walked into Amy's [...] "maelstrom of rampant teen hormones." [...] Entertainment website Digital Spy have chosen certain plots featuring Amy in their [...] "Picture of the day" [...] recommendation feature. These include Amy being accused of thieving, blackmailing David and revealing her pregnancy to Cain.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1949, Bradbury {{was stopped}} and {{questioned}} {{by a police}} officer while walking late one night.

[...] This incident inspired Bradbury to write the 1951 short story [...] "The Pedestrian".|$|E
50|$|The basic {{technique}} {{stands in}} contrast to hunt and peck typing in which the typist keeps his or {{her eyes on the}} source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or keyboard (which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their {{feet flat on the floor}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> slightly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.|$|R
5000|$|The Burmese position, named {{so because}} of its use in Buddhist sculptures in Burma, places both <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the pelvis with knees bent and {{touching}} the floor to the sides. The heels are pointing toward pelvis or upward, and toes are pointed so that {{the tops of the}} feet lie on the ground. This looks similar to the cross legged position, but the feet are not placed underneath the thigh of the next leg, therefore the legs do not cross. Instead, <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> is placed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other.|$|R
50|$|A front walkover is an acrobatic {{movement}} sequence. It {{begins with}} the performer standing up straight with arms raised and positioned near to the ears. The performer then lunges forward and quickly raises one leg, with the other leg following as if transitioning to a handstand. The legs are held straight in a split as they travel overhead. The back is then arched until the leading foot touches the floor, such that the performer is briefly in a back bridge position. After the trailing foot reaches the floor, the performer returns to a standing position. <b>In</b> gymnastics, a <b>front</b> walkover typically ends with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> extended <b>in</b> <b>front</b> and arms raised. Front walkovers are performed in various activities, including acro dance, circus, and gymnastics.|$|R
2500|$|The best-known {{types of}} Archaic {{sculpture}} are the kouros and kore, near life-size frontal statues {{of a young}} man or woman, which were developed around the middle of the seventh century BC in the Cyclades. [...] Probably the earliest kore produced was the Dedication of Nikandre, which was dedicated to Artemis at her temple on Delos between 660 and 650 BC, while kouroi began to be created shortly after this. [...] Kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities. [...] Some kouroi, such as the Colossus of the Naxians from around 600 BC, are known to represent Apollo, while the Phrasikleia Kore was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked. Early in the seventh century around 650 BC when kore are widely introduced, Daedalic style made an appearance in Greek sculpture. This style consisted most noticeably of a geometric pattern of female subjects' hair framing their face. On male sculptures they were often posed with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> as if in motion.|$|E
2500|$|Young used session musicians for his 1960s' covers album, The Singer {{released}} in August 1981 {{but failed to}} reached the top 50. Young turned to a more contemporary electropop sound and adult oriented style. He signed to the Australian branch of German label I.C. Records in 1983 and flew to Germany with producer, composer and keyboard player John Capek (ex-Carson) to start recording a new album, with sessions at studios in Hanover, Munich, Los Angeles, Melbourne and Sydney. Most of the material was co-written by Capek and Canadian Marc Jordan. The resulting album, <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>Front</b> was {{released in}} March 1984. The lead single, [...] "Soldier of Fortune", peaked at No.17 on the national singles chart, other singles [...] "War Games", [...] "L.A. Sunset" [...] and [...] "Call the Night" [...] (1984) all failed to chart into the top 50, [...] "Soldier of Fortune" [...] gained further prominence when it was picked as the theme song for the 1984 Summer Paralympics held in New York City, and also went on to be a hit in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other. The song reminds us of the early days when we put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E
50|$|Acrobats {{maintain}} their balance by positioning their {{centre of mass}} directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up. When {{they are on the}} ground with their feet side by side, the base of support is wide in the lateral direction but narrow in the sagittal (back-to-front) direction. In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> positioned <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker's sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced. In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.|$|R

[...] He stands facing right in profile to the viewer, with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> stepping out <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other. The relief is 98 x 24 3/4 x 9 3/4 inches and is carved in marble.|$|R
5000|$|Water skiers can use two skis (<b>one</b> on each <b>foot,</b> {{also called}} [...] "combo skiing") or <b>one</b> ski (dominant <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of the other}} foot, also called [...] "slalom skiing"). Generally the heavier the person, the bigger the skis will be. Length will also vary based {{on the type of}} water skiing being performed; jump skis, for example, are longer than skis used in regular straight-line {{recreational}} skiing or competitive slalom and trick skiing. A trick ski is around 40 inches and wider than combo skis. Again the skier rides it with his or her dominant <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> It has no fins which allows for spins to be performed.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Wat Danbury {{was not the}} lad to flinch, and at it he went full split, {{like a man who}} {{means what}} he is doing. She rose gallantly to it, rapped it hard with her front hoof, shook him on to her withers, {{recovered}} herself, and was over. Wat had hardly got back into his saddle when there was a clatter behind him like the fall of a woodstack, and there was the top bar in splinters, the horse on its belly, and the huntsman on hands and knees half a dozen yards in front of him. Wat pulled up for an instant, for the fall was a smasher; but he saw old Joe spring to his feet and get to his horse's bridle. The horse staggered up, but the moment it put <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other, Wat saw that it was hopelessly lame--a slipped shoulder and a six weeks' job. There was nothing he could do, and Joe was shouting to him not to lose the hounds, so off he went again, the one solitary survivor of the whole hunt. When a man finds himself there, he can retire from fox-hunting, for he has tasted the highest which it has to offer. I remember once when I was out with the Royal Surrey--but I'll tell you that story afterwards.|$|E

5000|$|Research {{showed that}} the inter-rater {{reliability}} ICC range=0.93-0.99 and the test-retest reliability ICC range=0.63-0.90. [...] To determine validity, Lark and Sowjanya used tandem stance (<b>one</b> <b>foot</b> directly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other), parallel stance (feet 20cm apart) and tandem walking for 6 meters. The Validity Co-efficient (percent correctly classified as faller)=0.70-0.84 for the balance score. There was a significant correlation between tandem stance mean time and scores of the Parallel Walk Test r=0.49 p<.001. The study showed non-fallers were able to stand 3 times longer compared to fallers and tandem standing is incorporated to several balance measurement tools, i.e. Berg Balance Scale.The reliability of the Parallel Walk Test was also tested with people with strokes by Ng et.al. [...] They found intra-rater reliability ICC range=0.784-0.962, inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities ICC range=0.864-1.00. The sensitivity=84%-89% and specificity=71%-80%. They also found significant correlation between the PWT, all 3 widths, and Berg Balance Scale r=-0.617--0.682, p<.05 and TUG r=0.466-0.658, p<0.05.|$|R
5|$|Jack Broughton, {{a celebrated}} boxing {{champion}} (and another {{who was also}} a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with their <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> line and their fists raised level <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> slightly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to adjudicate between them.|$|R
5000|$|Chanel {{became very}} close to les blousons Chanel, none more so than to the [...] "incomparable" [...] Arnaud, who was [...] "almost like her shadow", her [...] "fetish model", her [...] "alter ego ... whom she almost {{considered}} her equal", [...] "her muse and dream model" [...] and [...] "her favourite". Chanel said, referring to Arnaud's early work as a cover girl and the shabby way {{in which she had}} been treated by magazines: [...] "I was a good angel to her. I became rather attached to her." [...] It troubled Chanel that Arnaud had to return to her parents' house in Neuilly after a day's work and that she ate alone at a restaurant, so she offered the model a room in a hotel on rue Cambon, as well as meals with her alone or when she was entertaining friends. [...] Ballard said that Chanel had created her [...] "in her own image", and Arnaud not only constantly pestered Chanel for her old, worn suits, but also mimicked many of Chanel's mannerisms both in everyday life, such as how she held her cigarette and folded her scarf, {{as well as on the}} catwalk and on photoshoots, including the trademark Chanel stance with <b>one</b> of her <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other, her stomach resolutely vertical and flat, her head held imperiously high with her chin up, and one hand thrust into a skirt pocket. Nearly forty years later Karl Lagerfeld, who was appointed as artistic director of the fashion house in 1983, would instruct supermodel Linda Evangelista to copy the [...] "legendary" [...] Arnaud's poses when modelling during the 1992 Chanel spring collection at rue Cambon.|$|R

5000|$|Senior Big East Defensive {{player of}} the Year Rick Jackson and Juniors Kris Joseph and Scoop Jardine led the 2010-2011 Orange. Syracuse started strong by winning their first 18 {{contests}} before losing in Pittsburgh. That loss started a slide for the Orange, who lost six of their next eight games. The Orange regained their momentum by beating the West Virginia Mountaineers to start a six-game winning streak before losing in overtime to the Connecticut Huskies in the semi-finals of the Big East Tournament. With a record of 28-7, the Orange garnered a #3 seed in the East Region of the NCAA tournament. The Orange easily handled Indiana State 77-60 in their first game. The Orange faced Marquette {{in the second round}} when one of the tournament's more controversial moments occurred. With the game tied at 59 with 51 seconds left, a backcourt violation was called on the Orange when Scoop Jardine retrieved Dion Waiters' inbound pass with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> landing <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> court before his second settled in the backcourt. NCAA officiating coordinator John Adams admitted the call was made in error however; the officials were unaware of the full rule. According to the 2010 and 2011 NCAA Men's and Women's Basketball Rulebook, Rule 4, Section 3, Article 8 states: [...] "After a jump ball or during a throw-in, the player <b>in</b> his/her <b>front</b> court, who makes the initial touch on the ball while both feet are off the playing court, may be the first to secure control of the ball and land with <b>one</b> or both <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the back court. It makes no difference if the first <b>foot</b> down was <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> court or back court." [...] Marquette guard Darius Johnson-Odom hit a three-pointer on the ensuing possession with 27 second left to give the Golden Eagles the lead for good and a spot to the Sweet Sixteen. The loss culminated a season in which SU remained undefeated outside of their conference {{for the first time in}} the program's history.|$|R
50|$|The {{visual system}} in the brain is too slow to process that {{information}} if the images are slipping across the retina at {{more than a few}} degrees per second. Thus, {{to be able to see}} while we are moving, the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes. Another specialisation of visual system in many vertebrate animals is the development of a small area of the retina with a very high visual acuity. This area is called the fovea, and covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Eye movement is thus very important for visual perception, and any failure can lead to serious visual disabilities. To see a quick demonstration of this fact, try the following experiment: hold your hand up, about <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> (30 cm) <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of your nose. Keep your head still, and shake your hand from side to side, slowly at first, and then faster and faster. At first you will be able to see your fingers quite clearly. But as the frequency of shaking passes about 1 Hz, the fingers will become a blur. Now, keep your hand still, and shake your head (up and down or left and right). No matter how fast you shake your head, the image of your fingers remains clear. This demonstrates that the brain can move the eyes opposite to head motion much better than it can follow, or pursue, a hand movement. When your pursuit system fails to keep up with the moving hand, images slip on the retina and you see a blurred hand.|$|R
