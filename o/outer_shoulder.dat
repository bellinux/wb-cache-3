50|$|The {{vertical}} clearance for vehicles {{is limited by}} the portals and sideways sway structs. These are relatively low in older bridges. In Washington State bridges, the sway struts are often curved downwards at the outer ends, with less clearance above the outer lanes and <b>outer</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Tall loads then need to use the inner lanes for maximal clearance. These bridges are vulnerable to impacts by overheight vehicles, and such impacts were common. There was a known strike on this bridge that occurred on October 22, 2012, and investigators found evidence of several other impacts in years past. Bridge inspection reports dating back to 1979 frequently note damage caused by over-height vehicles, and an inspection report from late 2012 noted a three-inch gash in the steel.|$|R
50|$|All {{alternatives}} {{proposed that}} the bridge be single level, cable-stayed, double spans, separated by towers with a height of 135 ft above the high-water mark of the Arthur Kill shipping channel. Each deck would have three 12 ft lanes with a 12 ft <b>outer</b> <b>shoulder</b> and 5 ft inner shoulder and the northern deck would feature a 10 ft pedestrian walkway. In addition, permanent access roads would be built under the bridge on land for maintenance, security, and construction purposes. Lastly, space would be left in between the two bridges to accommodate potential mass-transit services.|$|E

50|$|On the backstretch {{with less}} than two laps to go, Coburn moved forward to {{challenge}} the Kenyans and Chespol dropped off the pace. At the bell, being challenged by Coburn and Chepkoech, Jebet began to drop back. Down the final backstretch it was four athletes shoulder to shoulder across the track, the Kenyans {{on the inside and}} the Americans on the outside. Out of that, Jepkemoi emerged in the lead with Frerichs on her <b>outer</b> <b>shoulder</b> and Coburn a step behind. After the hard comeback, Chepkoech faded. Entering the final water jump, Jepkemoi took the turn wide and smoothly with Frerichs following, but Coburn cut sharply and took the inside line through the water jump, emerging with a two metre lead over Frerichs who had a step on Jepkemoi. With free running room down the home stretch, Coburn opened up another seven metres on Frerichs who opened up another metre on Jepkemoi.|$|E

50|$|In 1986, a $150 million bridge {{replacement}} project began. A new northbound span {{opened in}} January 1989, which allowed the temporary northbound truss {{to be taken}} out of service and demolished. On the former site, a new southbound span was built. The southbound span opened in November 1992, after which the remainder of the original bridge was taken out of service and demolished. The replacement bridge completed in 1992 is a continuous girder and floorbeam design, which eliminated the need for pin and hanger assemblies that were implicated in the collapse of the original 1958 span. Related cosmetic work and the restoration of the beachfront underneath the bridge continued to affect the area through early 1993. The new bridge, like the old one, contains six lanes of traffic, but also contains <b>outer</b> <b>shoulders,</b> a feature absent from the older and slightly narrower bridge.|$|R

50|$|Heavy {{traffic and}} harsh New England weather {{have taken their}} toll on the Moses Wheeler Bridge. It has been rated as 'structurally deficient' during recent inspections, with {{accelerating}} deterioration of the structural steel being of particular concern. The Connecticut Department of Transportation (CONNDOT) began drawing up plans to replace the bridge in 1996. Originally CONNDOT planned to construct the new bridge {{to the south of}} the existing one, away from 115 kilovolt high tension wires that run atop the nearby Metro-North Railroad Drawridge. Stratford residents and officials demanded the new bridge be built {{to the north of the}} existing span, closer to the Metro-North bridge and the power lines. A compromise was reached where the new bridge will use approximately the same alignment as the existing one, though be substantially wider. To make this possible, the project will be completed in three stages: the first two stages will consist of constructing the outer parts of the new bridge that will eventually carry two outer lanes and the <b>outer</b> <b>shoulder,</b> while three lanes of traffic are maintained on the existing bridge. During the final stage of construction, three lanes of traffic will be shifted to the new outer spans, at which point crews will demolish the existing span and complete the center portion of the new bridge.|$|E
40|$|The forming {{tools of}} {{multilevel}} parts may be simplified by choosing shelf dies. To support {{the axial force}} on the flanged section of the die, some corresponding support is needed on {{the interior of the}} ring as well. Going ahead with a consolidated research line, stress and strain states of shelf (or “shouldered”) dies, with fixed filling height, have been numerically analyzed by FEM. After previous study of two-diameter shrink-fitting surface, connected by a transversal ring, the effects of a conical shrink-fitting surface have been investigated. Also in this case, to assess stress distribution and strain pattern, on the nucleus and on the ring, no analytical calculation method is available, whereas the usual empirical approach sometimes leads to disappointing and expensive operating failures. The shelf geometry depends on part shape and compression ratio on the inner of the nucleus, but may be variable on the common surface nucleus/ring. In this investigation, the common profile between the <b>outer</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the nucleus and the inner shoulder of the shrink-fitting ring has been assumed conical, with various angles. The FEM analysis, based on two-level parts with different relative extension of flange and different heights, covers different die geometries. The effects of relative interferences have been also investigated, for typical nucleus materials, such as HSS from powder or hard metal (10...|$|E

40|$|Shoulder {{balance is}} one of the key {{components}} to the body deformity in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients with double thoracic curve and shoulder cosmesis plays an important role in patients’ satisfaction of surgical outcomes. Up to now, only radiographic parameters were used to evaluate the shoulder balance in literatures; no corresponding cosmetic parameters have been developed to evaluate the cosmetic shoulder balance. Meanwhile, we often confronted that perfect radiographic shoulder balance was achieved, but the patients complained about the residual cosmetic deformity. This phenomenon implied that discrepancy may exist between radiographic shoulder balance and cosmetic shoulder balance. The present study was carried out to investigate the correlation between radiographic and clinical cosmetic shoulder balance in AIS patients with double thoracic curve. Thirty-four AIS patients were recruited for this study. All the patients had a double thoracic curve. Six cosmetic parameters––inner shoulder height (SHi), <b>outer</b> <b>shoulder</b> height (SHo), shoulder area index 1 (SAI 1), shoulder area index 2 (SAI 2), shoulder angle (α 1) and axilla angle (α 2) were developed and measured on the standing photographs. Also, seven radiographic parameters––T 1 tilting (T 1), first rib angle (FRA), clavicle angle (CA), coracoid process height (CPH), clavicle-rib cage intersection (CRCI), first rib–clavicle height (FRCH), trapezius length (TL) were measured on the standing posterior–anterior radiographs. Correlation analysis was made between cosmetic parameters and radiographic parameters. SHi was found to be significantly correlated with T 1, FRA, CA, CPH, CRCI (P <  0. 05), among which FRA had the highest correlation coefficient. SHo was found to be significantly correlated with T 1, FRA, CA, CPH, CRCI, FRCH (P <  0. 05), among which CRCI had the highest correlation coefficient. However, none of the correlation coefficient was greater than 0. 8. The correlation coefficients between radiographic parameters and SAI 1, SAI 2, α 1, α 2 were also below 0. 8 that were similar with SH. The results indicated that radiographic parameters could only partially reflect the shoulder cosmetic appearances. However, none of the existing parameters can accurately reflect the shoulder cosmetic appearance. As cosmesis is critical important to patients’ satisfaction, spine surgeons should pay more attention to the cosmetic shoulder balance rather than radiographic shoulder balance...|$|E
5000|$|Troughton {{described}} the type specimen as follows: Specimens. — Male holotype, female allotype, {{in possession of}} Sir Edward Hallstrom at Taronga Zoological Park, Sydney, for eventual lodgment {{in the collection of}} the Australian Museum. General characters:Muzzle or rostral region short and narrow in contrast with the remarkable facial or bi-zygomatic width, imparting the strikingly vulpine or fox-like appearance.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{visualize}} the mode and impact of force transmission in narrow diameter implants with different implant-abutment designs and material properties and to quantify the displacement of the abutment. Material and methods: Narrow diameter implants of two manufacturers were examined: Astra 3. 0 mm (n= 2) diameter implants (Astra OsseoSpeed TX, Dentsply, Germany) and Straumann BoneLevel implants with a 3. 3 mm diameter made of cpTi Gr. 4 (n= 2) and 3. 3 mm TiZr-alloy (n= 2) (BoneLevel, Straumann, Switzerland) under incremental force application using synchrotron radiography (absorption and inline xray phase-contrast) and tomography. Results: Astra 3. 0 and BoneLevel 3. 3 mm implants showed during loading (250 N) a deformation of the <b>outer</b> implant <b>shoulder</b> of 61. 75 to 95 μm independent of the implant body material. The inner implant diameter showed during loading (250 N) a deformation of 71. 25 - 109. 25 μm. A deformation of the implant shoulder persisted after the removal of the load (range 42. 75 - 104. 5 μm). An angulated intrusion of the abutment (max. 140 μm) into the implant body during load application was demonstrated, this spatial displacement persisted after removal of the load. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated a deformation of the implant shoulder and displacement of the abutment during load application in narrow diameter implants...|$|R
50|$|The Interstate Highway {{standards}} for the U.S. Interstate Highway System uses a 12 ft standard for lane width, while narrower lanes are used on lower classification roads. In Europe, as laws and road width vary by country, the minimum widths of lanes is generally between 2.5 to 3.25 m. The federal Bundesstraße interurban network in Germany defines a minimum of 3.5 m for each lane for the smallest two lane roads with an additional 0.25 m on the <b>outer</b> sides and <b>shoulders</b> being at least 1.5 m on each side. A modern Autobahn divided highway will have two lanes per direction which are 3.75 m wide with an additional clearance of 0.50 m on each side, while three lanes per direction are set at 3.75 m for the rightmost lane and 3.5 m for the other lanes. Urban access roads and roads in low-density areas may have lanes as small as 2.75 m in width per lane with shoulders being at least 1 m wide.|$|R
