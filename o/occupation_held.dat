25|$|In 1979, Chomsky and Herman revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence and {{published}} it with South End Press as the two-volume The Political Economy of Human Rights. In this they compared U.S. media {{reactions to the}} Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. They argued that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on that in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy. Taking a particular interest in the situation in East Timor, Chomsky testified on the subject {{in front of the}} United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization in both 1978 and 1979, and attended a conference on the <b>occupation</b> <b>held</b> in Lisbon in 1979. The following year, Steven Lukas authored an article for the Times Higher Education Supplement accusing Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot. Although Laura J. Summers and Robin Woodsworth Carlsen replied to the article, arguing that Lukas completely misunderstood Chomsky and Herman's work, Chomsky himself did not. The controversy damaged his reputation, and Chomsky maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies about him in order to defame him.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not expect}} him to return until mid-day, and she sat herself down on a log before the fire to darn a pair of socks {{as well as she}} could. For a time this unusual <b>occupation</b> <b>held</b> her {{attention}} and then her hands became slow and at last inactive, and she fell into reverie. She thought at first of her children and what they might be doing, in England across there to the east it would be about five hours later, four o'clock in the afternoon, and the children would be coming home through the warm muggy London sunshine with Fraulein Otto to tea. She wondered if they had the proper clothes, if they were well; were they perhaps quarrelling or being naughty or skylarking gaily across the Park. Of course Fraulein Otto was all right, quite to be trusted, absolutely trustworthy, and their grandmother would watch for a flushed face or an irrational petulance or any of the little signs that herald trouble with more than a mother's instinctive alertness. No need to worry about the children, no need whatever.... The world of London opened out behind these thoughts; it was so queer to think that she was in almost the same latitude as the busy bright traffic of the autumn season in Kensington Gore; that away there in ten thousand cleverly furnished drawing-rooms the ringing tea things were being set out for the rustling advent of smart callers and the quick leaping gossip. And there would be all sorts of cakes and little things; for a while her mind ran on cakes and little things, and she thought in particular whether it wasn't time to begin cooking.... Not yet. What was it she had been thinking about? Ah! the Solomonsons and the Capeses and the Bernards and the Carmels and the Lees. Would they talk of her and Trafford? It would be strange to go back to it all. Would they go back to it all? She found herself thinking intently of Trafford.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{a gentleman}} {{in the middle of}} the place, a gentleman who had removed his hat and was for a moment, while he glanced, absently, as she could see, at the top tier of the collection, tapping his {{forehead}} with his pocket-handkerchief. The <b>occupation</b> <b>held</b> him long enough to give Milly time to take for granted--and a few seconds sufficed--that his face was the object just observed by her friends. This could only have been because she concurred in their tribute, even qualified, and indeed [...] "the English style" [...] of the gentleman--perhaps by instant contrast to the American--was what had had the arresting power. This arresting power, at the same time--and that was the marvel--had already sharpened almost to pain, for in the very act of judging the bared head with detachment she felt herself shaken by a knowledge of it. It was Merton Densher's own, and he was standing there, standing long enough unconscious for her to fix him and then hesitate. These successions were swift, so that she could still ask herself in freedom if she had best let him see her. She could still reply to that that she shouldn't like him to catch her in the effort to prevent this; and she might further have decided that he was too preoccupied to see anything had not a perception intervened that surpassed the first in violence. She was unable to think afterwards how long she had looked at him before knowing herself as otherwise looked at; all she was coherently to put together was that she had had a second recognition without his having noticed her. The source of this latter shock was nobody less than Kate Croy--Kate Croy who was suddenly also in the line of vision and whose eyes met her eyes at their next movement. Kate was but two yards off--Mr. Densher wasn't alone. Kate's face specifically said so, for after a stare as blank at first as Milly's it broke into a far smile. That was what, wonderfully--in addition to the marvel of their meeting--passed from her for Milly; the instant reduction to easy terms of the fact of their being there, the two young women, together. It was perhaps only afterwards that the girl fully felt the connection between this touch and her already established conviction that Kate was a prodigious person; yet on the spot she none the less, in a degree, knew herself handled and again, as she had been the night before, dealt with--absolutely even dealt with for her greater pleasure. A minute in fine hadn't elapsed before Kate had somehow made her provisionally take everything as natural. The provisional was just the charm--acquiring that character from one moment to the other; it represented happily so much that Kate would explain on the very first chance. This left moreover--and that was the greatest wonder--all due margin for amusement at the way things happened, the monstrous oddity of their turning up in such a place on the very heels of their having separated without allusion to it. The handsome girl was thus literally in control of the scene by the time Merton Densher was ready to exclaim with a high flush, or a vivid blush--one didn't distinguish the embarrassment from the joy--"Why, Miss Theale: fancy!" [...] and [...] "Why, Miss Theale: what luck!" ...|$|E

Besides the variables collected through the questionnaire, the database includes additional information taken from the Labour Force Survey like gender, age, marital status, education, labour market situation (employed, unemployed, retired, home worker, student, other inactive) and nationality.

30|$|We {{now turn}} to the main finding on the {{relationship}} between balanced skill sets and occupational choice. Having more diverse job experiences across Occupations and across Industries raises the probability of starting both for-profit and nonprofit enterprises compared to wage work. As we add more controls, the effects of Occupations and Industries decrease slightly in magnitude but they still raise the probability of both types of entrepreneurship while lowering the probability of wage work, consistent with the predictions from Lazear’s “Jacks-of-All-Trades” theory. More precisely, adding one more <b>occupation</b> <b>held</b> since graduation raises the probability of nonprofit startups by 0.2 % and the probability of initiating a for-profit venture by 2.7 %. Meanwhile, it lowers the probability of working for wages by 2.9 %. Likewise, increasing prior sectoral work experience by one more industry increases the probability of nonprofit entrepreneurship by 0.3 % and for-profit startup by 1.6 %, but it reduces the chance to become a wage worker by 2 %. In contrast with Lazear’s (2005) findings, more specialized coursework did not affect the likelihood of any of the three occupational choices 6. The marginal effects across occupations are virtually zero. Nevertheless, the broad sweep of findings from Table  3 support hypotheses 1 – 3 derived from our extension of Lazear’s ‘Jack-of-all-Trades’ model to include nonprofit entrepreneurship.|$|E
30|$|Green’s work (1999) {{was one of}} {{the first}} to suggest that {{comparing}} the distribution of intended occupations with actual occupational attainments would make it possible to approximate the level of mismatch for immigrants in Canada. Jantzen (2015) applied this approach by using the National Household Survey and Immigration Landing File Linkage Database to determine whether economic principal applicants work in their intended regulated occupations. How (and to what extent) the cross-border transferability of occupational human capital affects earnings was investigated more explicitly in two analytical works (Imai et al. 2011; Warman et al. 2015). By using the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (LSIC), in addition to detailed information on labor market experience during the first 4  years after immigrating, both studies were able to access information on the last <b>occupation</b> <b>held</b> in the source country prior to migrating and the intended occupation identified during the selection process. Both studies found that after immigrating to Canada, immigrants have difficulty finding jobs that utilize the occupational human capital that they obtained abroad. Imai et al. (2011) further calculated the potential loss in immigrants’ earnings due to inability to work in an occupation that matches their source-country occupational skill requirements. They found that predicted mean earnings might have been 21 – 23  % higher at 4  years after arrival.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Investigators {{from such}} {{disparate}} fields as public opinion research and comparative history agree that foreign occupation tends to provoke nationalist awareness. Engaging this {{growing body of}} literature, {{we focus on the}} affective side of nationalism—the feeling of national pride—and argue that foreign domination by itself does not necessarily incite this feeling among all members of the population under occupation. Rather, (a) the perception of the <b>occupation</b> <b>held</b> by the public is related to national pride and (b) this perception is anchored in communal attributes. A survey of Iraqis (n = 2, 700) in 2004 found that the only common factor that is linked to national pride for the Sunnis, Shi’is, and Kurds is attitude against foreign Muslim militants. In addition, for the Sunnis, it was linked to attitudes against foreign presence and in favor of the Baath party. For the Shi’is, national pride was inversely related to their attitudes toward American moral values. For the Kurds, national pride is linked to attitudes toward the political issues over which the Sunnis and Shi’is have consensus—attitudes against foreign presence and disbanding the former Iraqi army, and a rejection of American moral values. Implications for the study of national pride are discussed. Analyzing historical documents, events, and the pronouncements of politi-cal and intellectual elites, and scholarly studies of nationalism in Islami...|$|E
