Bhaktivedanta Swami, who will conduct daily classes in the Bhagavad Gita, discussions, chanting, playing instruments, and devotional dancing in a small temple in the neighborhood.... Swamiji's use of the Hare Krishna Mantra is already known throughout the United States. Swamiji's chanting and dancing is more effective than Hatha or Raja Yoga <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> to Ali Akbar Khan on acid or going to a mixed media rock dance.|$|E
5|$|David Cameron (Conservative {{leader and}} Prime Minister) said:... {{he was an}} {{extraordinary}} man: a great writer, a brilliant speaker, extraordinary in Parliament, and a great life of public and political and parliamentary service. I mean, I disagreed with most of what he said. But he was always engaging and interesting, and you were never bored when reading <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> to him, and the country a great campaigner, a great writer, and someone who I'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many, many years to come.|$|E

25|$|Erickson {{maintained}} that trance is a common, everyday occurrence. For example, when waiting for buses and trains, reading <b>or</b> <b>listening,</b> or even {{being involved in}} strenuous physical exercise, it's quite normal to become immersed in the activity and go into a trance state, removed from any other irrelevant stimuli. These states are so common and familiar {{that most people do}} not consciously recognise them as hypnotic phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Ron Geaves, a {{professor}} in various fields of religion and long-time adherent of Rawat, wrote that Rawat is not a renunciate, {{and that he has}} made great efforts to assert his humanity and take apart the hagiography that has developed around him. According to Geaves Rawat, rather than considering himself a charismatic leader, deemphasizes the sealing of the master disciple relationship, and focuses on correct practice and staying in touch through participation <b>or</b> <b>listening.</b>|$|E
500|$|Some studies use a [...] "probe verification" [...] task {{rather than}} an overt {{acceptability}} judgment; in this paradigm, each experimental sentence {{is followed by a}} [...] "probe word", and subjects must answer whether or not the probe word had appeared in the sentence. [...] This task, like the acceptability judgment task, ensures that subjects are reading <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> attentively, but may avoid some of the additional processing demands of acceptability judgments, and may be used no matter what type of violation is being presented in the study.|$|E

500|$|The {{penalty for}} anyone {{teaching}} <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> to the listed errors was excommunication, [...] "unless they turned themselves {{in to the}} bishop or the chancellor within seven days, {{in which case the}} bishop would inflict proportionate penalties." [...] The condemnation sought to stop the Master of Arts teachers from interpreting the works of Aristotle in ways that were contrary to the beliefs of the Church. In addition to the 219 errors, the condemnation also covered Andreas Capellanus's De amore, and unnamed or unidentified treatises on geomancy, necromancy, witchcraft, or fortunetelling.|$|E
500|$|A {{thorough}} {{study of the}} emendations that Schubert edited into the final versions, in comparison with his sketches, reveals many insights. [...] "Examination of Schubert's sketches for the sonatas reveals him as highly self-critical; moreover, {{it shows that the}} 'heavenly lengths' of the sonatas were actually a later addition, not conceived from the start. In his subsequent corrections, Schubert elaborated on his themes and expanded them, giving them more 'musical space'", in Alfred Brendel's words. In the revision, Brendel continues, [...] "proportions are rectified, details start to tell, fermatas suspend time. Rests clarify the structure, allowing breathing space, holding the breath <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> into silence".|$|E
500|$|Although {{nearly all}} users {{understand}} that the Slender Man is not real, they suspend that disbelief {{in order to become}} more engrossed when telling <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> to stories. This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend dialectic. This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, George Noory's Coast to Coast AM, a radio call-in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man. Two years later, an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune described his origins as [...] "difficult to pinpoint." [...] Eric Knudsen has commented that many people, despite understanding that the Slender Man was created on the Something Awful forums, still entertain the possibility that he might be real.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} by former members that the FLDS Church has excommunicated more than 400 teenage boys for offenses such as dating <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> to rock music. Some former members claim that {{the real reason for}} these excommunications is that there are not enough women for each male to receive three or more wives. Six men, aged 18 to 22, filed a conspiracy lawsuit against Jeffs and Sam Barlow, a former Mohave County deputy sheriff and close associate of Jeffs, for the [...] "systematic excommunication" [...] of young men to reduce competition for wives.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1996, Cuozzo {{appeared}} on Think Tank, a discussion program that aired on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and was hosted by Ben Wattenberg. The show, entitled Is Public Journalism, Journalism?, {{set out to}} discuss {{whether there was a}} new journalism that [...] "sets out to go beyond just the facts and tries to shape the agenda." [...] In commenting on conventional journalism during the show, Cuozzo noted that an underlying assumption of its journalistic elitism is [...] "that the public is incapable of making up its own mind <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> or applying any critical thinking to issues in an environment in which there are many voices being heard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker was {{inspired}} to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, [...] "I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used {{to get the most}} immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> to him play guitar." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{stethoscope}} [...] is {{an acoustic}} medical device for auscultation, <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> {{to the internal}} sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the chest, and two tubes connected to earpieces. It {{is often used to}} listen to lung and heart sounds. It is also used to listen to intestines and blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used for measurements of blood pressure. Less commonly, [...] "mechanic's stethoscopes", equipped with rod shaped chestpieces, are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines (for example, sounds and vibrations emitted by worn ball bearings), such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts. Stethoscopes {{can also be used to}} check scientific vacuum chambers for leaks, and for various other small-scale acoustic monitoring tasks. A stethoscope that intensifies auscultatory sounds is called phonendoscope.|$|E
