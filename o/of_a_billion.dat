5|$|Haumea has an {{orbital period}} of 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an orbital inclination of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit over the course <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years, through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E

25|$|La Plata {{was founded}} in 1882 by Governor Dardo Rocha {{for the purpose of}} {{becoming}} the provincial capital. The equivalent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> (1880s) dollars of British investment and pro-development, education and immigration policies pursued at the national level subsequently spurred dramatic economic growth. Driven by European immigration and improved health, the province's population, like Argentina's, nearly doubled to one million by 1895 and doubled again by 1914. Rail lines connected nearly every town and hamlet in the province by 1914; many developed around the new railway stations.|$|E
25|$|Considerable debts owed to Iran by Israel for {{business}} conducted before the Iranian revolution, {{in the order}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> dollars, were not paid to Iran. Some of the debt comes from oil purchased by Israel, and a larger amount arises from operation of the Trans-Israel oil pipeline and associated port facilities, which were {{a joint venture between}} Israeli companies and the National Iranian Oil Company. The Israeli cabinet decided against paying the debt at a meeting in 1979 and granted legal indemnity to the Israeli companies which owed it. At least one Israeli bank account is known to hold $250 million owed to Iran. Since the 1980s, Iran has been suing in the European courts for payment of the debt and has won several cases. However payment of the debt is legally complicated by the international sanctions against Iran and by the fact that Israel classifies Iran as an enemy state. In May 2015 a European court ordered the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company to pay $1.1 billion to Iran, which Israel refused to do.|$|E

25|$|Terrestrial radiation, for {{the purpose}} of the table above, only {{includes}} sources that remain external to the body. The major radionuclides of concern are potassium, uranium and thorium and their decay products, some of which, like radium and radon are intensely radioactive but occur in low concentrations. Most of these sources have been decreasing, due to radioactive decay since the formation of the Earth, because there is no significant amount currently transported to the Earth. Thus, the present activity on earth from uranium-238 is only half as much as it originally was because of its 4.5 billion year half-life, and potassium-40 (half-life 1.25 billion years) is only at about 8% of original activity. The effects on humans of the actual diminishment (due to decay) of these isotopes is, however, minimal. This is because humans evolved too recently for the difference in activity over a fraction of a half-life to be significant. Put another way, human history is so short in comparison to a half-life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years, that the activity of these long-lived isotopes has been effectively constant throughout our time on this planet.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{departure}} made by Galactic Civilizations II {{from other}} 4X games is its economic system, {{which is very}} different from the systems used in most strategy games. Typically, 4X strategy games receive money based on a tax rate or based on the income of specific tiles in use by a city or planet. Civilization IV uses this system, and most other 4X strategy games use a variant of it. These incomes are increased by economic structures and sometimes by population, and the profit made off this economic income is used to pay maintenance fees and rush-build units. Galactic Civilizations II adds another layer of complexity by requiring that the income of an empire is used to pay for all forms of production. In order to produce one unit of product, be it research or manufacturing, the player must pay credits (usually in denominations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Billion</b> Credits, or BC). It is therefore critical that the player balances the economic income of their empire with their industrial output, and not just with the maintenance of their empire. If the player does not have the economy required to support an industrial planet, then they will have to spend at a deficit, and if the player does not correct their economy, they will eventually go broke. This stands in stark contrast to the Civilization series, where industrial output has nothing to do with the player's economic income.|$|E

500|$|Ann-Marie Madigan and Michael McCourt {{postulate}} that an inclination {{instability in}} a distant massive belt {{is responsible for the}} alignment of the arguments of perihelion of the ETNOs. The inclination instability occurs in a disk of particles in eccentric orbits around a massive object. The self-gravity of this disk causes its spontaneous organization, increasing the inclinations of the objects and aligning the arguments of perihelion, forming it into a cone above or below the original plane. This process requires an extended time and significant mass of the disk, on the order <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years for a 1–10 Earth-mass disk. While an inclination instability can align the arguments of perihelion and raise perihelia, producing detached objects, it does not align the longitudes of perihelion. Mike Brown considers Planet Nine a more probable explanation, noting that current surveys do not support the existence of a scattered-disk region of sufficient mass to support this idea of [...] "inclination instability".|$|E

Brought in a special railroad car to a siding in Pope, New Mexico, it was transported the last [...] to the test site on a trailer pulled by two tractors. By the time it arrived, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower [...] from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.|$|E
500|$|By 2001 {{and nearly}} {{eighteen}} years of stagnant growth, {{many of its}} franchises were {{in some sort of}} financial distress. [...] The lack of growth severely impacted Burger King's largest franchise, the nearly 400-store AmeriKing; the company, which until this point had been struggling under a nearly $300million debt load and been shedding stores across the US, was forced to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The failure of AmeriKing accompanied with declining market position deeply affected the value of the company, and put negotiations between Diageo and the TPC Capital-lead group on hold. The developments eventually forced Diageo to lower the total selling price by almost three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> dollars. After the sale, newly appointed CEO Bradley Blum initiated a program to help the roughly 20 percent of its franchises, including its four largest, who were in financial distress, bankruptcy or had ceased operations altogether. Partnering with the California-based Trinity Capital, LLC, the company established the Franchisee Financial Restructuring Initiative, a program to address the financial issues facing BK's financially distressed franchisees. The initiative was designed to assist franchisees in restructuring their businesses in order to meet financial obligations, focus on restaurant operational excellence, reinvest in their operations and return to profitability.|$|E
