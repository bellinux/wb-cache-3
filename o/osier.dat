The green rosella has at times partaken of the berries of the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), as well as Coprosma and Cyathodes, and even leaf buds of the common <b>osier</b> (Salix viminalis). It may eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids of the genus Schedotrioza, which they extract from leaf galls on the black peppermint (Eucalyptus amygdalina).|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the region is mainly agricultural. Before the fens were drained, the {{harvesting}} of <b>osier</b> (willow) and sedge (rush) and the extraction of peat were important activities, as were eel fishing—from which the settlement's name may have been derived—and wild fowling. The city had been the centre of local pottery production for more than 700 years, including pottery known as Babylon ware. A Roman road, Akeman Street, passes through the city; the southern end is at Ermine Street near Wimpole and its northern end is at Brancaster. Little direct evidence of Roman occupation in Ely exists, although there are nearby Roman settlements such as those at Little Thetford and Stretham. A coach route, known to have existed in 1753 between Ely and Cambridge, was improved in 1769 as a turnpike (toll road). The present day A10 closely follows this route; a southwestern bypass {{of the city was}} built in 1986. Ely railway station built in 1845 is on the Fen Line and is now a railway hub, with lines north to King's Lynn, northwest to Peterborough, east to Norwich, southeast to Ipswich and south to Cambridge and London.|$|E

40|$|Here to work Out of School Youth (<b>OSY)</b> are an {{important}} population in the Migrant Education Program (MEP), yet because of their transiency are {{they are among the}} most difficult group of youth to find and even more complex to serve. This group of migrant youth is divided into two subgroups; Recovery students (aka dropouts) and youth that arrive in the United States primarily to work (aka Here-to Work). This study examined the impact of the MEP practices and services for Here-to-Work (HTW) <b>OSY</b> through the perspective of the youth. The research question posed was How do the identified practices and services impact migrant 18 to 21 year old HTW <b>OSY</b> in the Migrant Education Program, Region XVI, Monterey County Office of Education in California. Specifically, the study sought to find the impact of those strategies and services on HTW <b>OSY.</b> A Participatory Action Research methodology was used with a total of 16 HTW <b>OSY</b> participating in ten interviews and one focus group of six. Findings from the study were divided into five themes: Identification and Recruitment, Program Services, Recommendations, Motivation, Cultural Proficiency. The study concluded that field-based identification and recruitment are critical to locating, enrolling, and serving HTW <b>OSY,</b> the importance of a network of friends and family, the importance of the advocate's role with the HTW <b>OSY</b> and the benefits of health examinations to HTW <b>OSY.</b> The study concluded that HTW <b>OSY</b> are interested in furthering their education and learning English and the importance of the social development MEP services provide for HTW <b>OSY.</b> It was also found that HTW <b>OSY</b> are highly motivated and interested in furthering their education. Recommendations include that the MEP build and/or further develop relationships with local agricultural companies; focus on technology, augment winter programs and continue health services for HTW OSY; include HTW <b>OSY</b> in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of program; develop cultural proficiency among MEP staff; that the California Department of Education and Office of Migrant Education provide consistent technical assistance for serving HTW <b>OSY</b> and that further research be an expansion of this study...|$|R

The UPLOAD JOBS entrepreneurship-training {{program was}} {{implemented}} by the United States Agency for International Development to enable out-of-school youth (<b>OSY,</b> 18 – 24 years) entrepreneurship in Mindanao, Philippines. To effectively manage the program in this international context, this dissertation collected, assessed and contributed to a rare database of context and entrepreneurship-specific information about <b>OSY,</b> respectively. First, a ‘Youth Potential Entrepreneur’ (YPE) questionnaire was developed to gather and report <b>OSY</b> demographics, entrepreneurship characteristics, and personality traits to help customize the program’s design and implementation. Data collected from the YPE questionnaire informed that <b>OSY</b> are educated (i. e., high school diploma) and have potential for entrepreneurship (i. e., positive entrepreneurship motivations, aspirations and personality traits); however, represent necessity entrepreneurs that have minimal entrepreneurship knowledge and access to social, physical and financial resources {{to start a new}} business, respectively. Second, items measuring <b>OSY</b> autonomy, risk-taking propensity, and innovativeness, cited to characterize the ‘successful’ entrepreneur, proved effective as a measurement model to screen their entrepreneurship ‘potential’ for program entry to help manage resources and performance outcomes. Third, a ‘Youth Population Survey’ was developed to assess the program’s screening and performance outcomes by measuring <b>OSY’s</b> entrepreneurship perceptions, attitudes and activities. Data collected indicated that screening differentiated <b>OSY’s</b> responses compared to those who were not screened, and that the program succeeded in fostering new entrepreneurs (i. e., business owners); however, fell short on fostering their positive entrepreneurship perceptions and attitudes. Finally, it was determined that <b>OSY</b> employment (including self-employment) probabilities are significantly influenced by cultural (i. e., family business ownership) and psychological determinants (i. e., risk-taking), informing policy and programs that enabling <b>OSY</b> employment (including self-employment) in this region is complex and may go beyond basic skills and knowledge training that entrepreneurship-training programs provide. Findings suggest that <b>OSY</b> represent a valuable resource of entrepreneurship potential; however, existing measurement tools need to be adapted to <b>OSY</b> context to address the gap between the extant entrepreneurship, psychology and development literature, and the management of <b>OSY</b> and entrepreneurship training programs in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Leaf {{senescence}} is {{an important}} physiological process involving the degradation {{of a number of}} metabolites and their remobilization to new reproductive and storage organs. NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factors are reported as important regulators of the senescence process. Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of the NAC transcription factor gene, <b>OsY</b> 37 (Oryza sativa Yellow 37, ONAC 011) obtained from Oryza sativa cv. indica, and japonica. We created transgenic plants expressing the <b>OsY</b> 37 gene under the control of a strong and constitutive CaMV 35 S promoter. The resulting transgenic plants overexpressing <b>OsY</b> 37 gene showed early heading and precocious senescence phenotype of flag leaves compared with wild-type plants. By contrast, blocking the function of this gene via RNAi (RNA interference) and CRES-T (Chimeric Repressor Silencing Technology) technology, delayed both heading time and leaf senescence. Furthermore, knockdown of <b>OsY</b> 37 expression caused dwarfism and high accumulation of chlorophyll during the vegetative phase. Irrespective of early or delayed senescence, transgenic plants showed reduced grain yields. Our results indicate that <b>OsY</b> 37 acts as a positive regulator of heading and senescence during the reproductive phase in rice. In addition, <b>OsY</b> 37 may be involved in plant development and grain yield...|$|R
