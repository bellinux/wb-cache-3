5|$|As {{attention}} to the role <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> hygiene in promoting public health has grown, {{there has been an}} increase in the number of resources available in print and on the internet. Organizations running public health initiatives include the National Sleep Foundation and the Division <b>of</b> <b>Sleep</b> Medicine at Harvard Medical School, both of which have created public websites with sleep hygiene resources, such as tips for sleep hygiene, instructional videos, sleep hygiene self-assessments, poll statistics on sleep hygiene, and tools to find sleep professionals. A cooperative agreement between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Sleep</b> Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project, with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness.|$|E
5|$|Practice <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> {{hygiene and}} {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> hygiene practices {{can be assessed}} with measures such as the Sleep Hygiene Index, Sleep Hygiene Awareness and Practice Scale, or the Sleep Hygiene Self-Test.

5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with {{low back pain}}. Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Sleep hygiene {{strategies}} include {{advice about}} timing <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> and food intake {{in relationship to}} exercise and sleeping environment. Recommendations depend on knowledge of the individual situation; counselling {{is presented as a}} form of patient education.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, {{hot or cold}} {{environmental}} temperatures {{can reduce}} the proportion <b>of</b> REM <b>sleep,</b> as well as amount <b>of</b> total <b>sleep.</b> In other words, if {{at the end of}} a phase <b>of</b> deep <b>sleep,</b> the organism's thermal indicators fall outside of a certain range, it will not enter paradoxical sleep lest deregulation allow temperature to drift further from the desirable value. This mechanism can be 'fooled' by artificially warming the brain.|$|R

5|$|The {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> is {{not fully}} understood, but there is evidence it allows for metabolic waste {{to be removed from}} the brain, and may permit repair. It may also have a cognitive function, weakening unnecessary connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, or a lack <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary {{to bring about a}} seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E

5|$|For {{many poor}} {{women and men}} whose work hours have {{reached the point where}} they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking.

5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> hygiene recommendations.
