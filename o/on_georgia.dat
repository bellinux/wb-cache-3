5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip <b>on</b> <b>Georgia.</b>|$|E

5|$|After taking {{possession}} {{on his own}} 16-yard line, Georgia quarterback and true freshman Matthew Stafford caused the first turning point of the game as he threw an interception to Brenden Hill of Virginia Tech. Starting deep in Georgia territory, Virginia Tech was further aided by a personal foul <b>on</b> <b>Georgia,</b> which set up a first-and-goal situation for Virginia Tech on the Georgia 6-yard line. A two-yard run by Virginia Tech tailback Branden Ore brought the ball closer to the goal line and ended {{the first quarter of}} play.|$|E

5|$|Georgia began proposing the {{placement}} of international peacekeeping forces in the separatist regions when Russia began to apply more pressure <b>on</b> <b>Georgia</b> after April 2008. The West launched new initiatives for peace settlement, with peace plans being offered and conferences being organised by the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Germany. Georgia accepted the German project for Abkhazia, but the separatists dismissed it. Russia and the separatists did not attend an EU-funded peace conference on Abkhazia. They also dismissed an OSCE offer to renew talks regarding South Ossetia.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their game-winning drive. The offense began slowly; Georgia Tech gained only nine yards in three plays, setting up a crucial fourth-down conversion. A failed try would give Clemson the ball deep in Georgia Tech territory, with little time remaining in the game for Georgia Tech to reply to any score. Instead, the Yellow Jackets converted the fourth down, keeping their drive alive. On the first play after the fourth-down conversion, Nesbitt completed a 21-yard pass to Dwyer, pushing Tech to near midfield. Eight plays later, Dwyer breached the Clemson defense for a 15-yard gain and the go-ahead score. A false start penalty <b>on</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech's two-point conversion try prevented any extra points, but the touchdown's six points were enough to give Georgia Tech a 39–34 lead.|$|E

MD 97 passes commercial areas of high-rise buildings in Silver Spring before heading into residential neighborhoods. The route intersects the northern terminus of MD 390 (16th Street), which heads south and becomes 16th Street Northwest upon entering the District of Columbia. It continues north as a six-lane undivided road with reversible lanes through commercial areas before coming to a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway).|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression saw a {{consistent}} squeeze <b>on</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech's budget, but World War II-inspired research activity combined with post-World War II enrollment more than {{compensated for the}} school's difficulties. Georgia Tech desegregated peacefully and without a court order in 1961, in contrast to other southern universities. Similarly, it did not experience any protests due to the Vietnam War. The growth of the graduate and research programs combined with diminishing federal support for universities in the 1980s led President John Patrick Crecine to restructure the university in 1988 amid significant controversy. The 1990s were marked by continued expansion of the undergraduate programs and the satellite campuses in Savannah, Georgia and Metz, France. In 1996, Georgia Tech {{was the site of}} the athletes' village and a venue for a number of athletic events for the Summer Olympics. Recently, the school has gradually improved its academic rankings and has paid significant attention to modernizing the campus, increasing historically low retention rates, and establishing degree options emphasizing research and international perspectives.|$|E

25|$|The first {{indications}} of a roadway following today's routing of SR372 makes its appearance <b>on</b> <b>Georgia</b> state road maps in 1953, when {{the portion of}} the route in Fulton County appears on state maps as a county route, and which connected in the community of Birmingham with today's New Bullpen Road and then Union Hill Road to meet SR20 east of Canton. By 1966, the Fulton County portion was unchanged, but the portion of today's route from Free Home to Ball Ground and SR5 had been added as a connecting county route. It was 1969 before the entirety of the route had been mapped as connecting routes <b>on</b> <b>Georgia</b> state highway maps; however, no state route designation was extant at the time.|$|E

25|$|The first {{portions}} of the roadway that is signed as SR53 today makes its appearance <b>on</b> <b>Georgia</b> state road maps in 1921, which show {{the portion of the}} route from south of Calhoun, through Fairmount, and on to Jasper. That entire portion was already signed as SR53 at the time; however, this designation was also used in 1921 for the road connecting Calhoun with LaFayette and Chattanooga in Tennessee, which is signed as SR136 today. By 1926, the Calhoun-to-Fairmount portion was shown as having a sand, clay, or topsoil surface, while the Fairmount-to-Jasper portion appeared as being graded but unimproved.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{establishment}} of Soviet rule in Baku in April 1920, Ordzhonikidze, probably acting on his own initiative, advanced <b>on</b> <b>Georgia</b> {{in support of a}} planned Bolshevik coup in Tbilisi. When the coup failed, the Georgian government was able to concentrate all its forces on successfully blocking the Soviet advance over the Georgian-Azerbaijani border. Facing a difficult war with Poland, Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin ordered a start to negotiations with Georgia. In the Treaty of Moscow signed on 7 May 1920, Soviet Russia recognized Georgia's independence and concluded a non-aggression pact. The treaty established the existing borders between the two nations de jure and also obliged Georgia to surrender all third-party elements considered hostile by Moscow. In a secret supplement, Georgia promised to legalize the local Bolshevik party.|$|E
25|$|The final {{stretch of}} the main route of SR53 {{appeared}} in August 1933, when the portion from Winder to Watkinsville was shown as graded but unimproved for the first time. Very little had changed otherwise, and the road surface conditions had remained static since early in 1932. By early in 1935, the only change of note to the route {{was the fact that}} the portion from the Alabama state line to Rome had by then been co-signed with US411. In 1945, only portions of the route were not yet improved to feature hard surface; namely, the stretches from west of Calhoun to Fairmount, and the portion between Winder and Watkinsville were the only unimproved parts. It was 1953 before the entirety of the route was marked <b>on</b> <b>Georgia</b> highway maps as having been covered with hard surface.|$|E
