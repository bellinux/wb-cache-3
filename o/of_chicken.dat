40|$|Propolis and {{bee pollen}} {{belong to a}} group of natural {{substances}} of animal and vegetable origin with a particu¬larly expressed antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Recent studies in the world have pointed out to the possi¬ble application of propolis and bee pollen, each supplement separately or in combination in the certain proportion as additives in broilers feeding whereby the expected effects of these additives on the health <b>of</b> the <b>chickens</b> and the quality of their meat is still not fully investigated, nor unam¬biguously defined. Accordingly, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of propolis and bee pollen (each supplement separately or in combination in the certain proportion) as additives in broilers feeding on: production indicators in <b>chickens,</b> the values <b>of</b> selected blood (hema-tologic and biochemical) parameters in <b>chickens,</b> microbial flora <b>of</b> the intestinal content and the content <b>of</b> the <b>chicken</b> crop and the presence of a selected bacterial pathogens in cloacal swabs <b>of</b> a <b>chickens,</b> the morphology <b>of</b> the liver and intestines <b>of</b> <b>chickens,</b> chicken meat quality, the values of selected indicators in the feces <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> and behaviour, health status, and mortality <b>of</b> <b>chickens.</b> The study was conducted on 200 Ross 308 <b>chickens</b> <b>of</b> equally distributed sex, divided into five groups (control and four experimental groups <b>of</b> <b>chickens).</b> Fattening was saw dust on the wooden floor and lasted for 42 days.

40|$|Background: Anti-ganglioside {{antibodies}} with a {{pathogenic potential}} {{are present in}} C. jejuni-associated Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) patients and are probably induced by molecular mimicry. Immunization studies in rabbits and mice have demonstrated that these anti-ganglioside antibodies can be induced using purified lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS) from C. jejuni in a strong adjuvant. Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate whether natural colonization <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> with a ganglioside-mimicking C. jejuni strain induces an anti-ganglioside response, and to investigate the diversity in anti-ganglioside response between and within genetically different chicken lines, we orally challenged chickens with different C. jejuni strains. Oral challenge <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> with a C. jejuni strain from a GBS patient, containing a LOS that mimics ganglioside GM 1, induced specific IgM and IgG anti-LOS and anti-GM 1 antibodies. Inoculation <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> with the Penner HS: 3 serostrain, without a GM 1 -like structure, induced anti-LOS but no anti-ganglioside antibodies. We observed different patterns of anti-LOS/ganglioside response between and within the five strains <b>of</b> <b>chickens.</b> Conclusions: Natural infection <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> with C. jejuni induces anti-ganglioside antibodies.

40|$|The study {{conducted}} {{in this thesis}} examines the genetic population history <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> in the Indo-Pacific region in order to infer the prehistoric human-mediated translocation <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> and investigate whether the dispersal history <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> in this region parallels the Austronesian expansion. The research focuses on chicken populations found in Island Southeast Asia, Pacific Ocean, and Indian Ocean – regions where Austronesian languages are spoken. The islands and archipelagos found in this region are separated by vast distances of ocean, thus the dispersal <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> within this region is mediated only through human agency. The geographic distribution of genetic variation in <b>chickens</b> <b>of</b> this region is due only to humans translocating chickens during their voyages, thus this genetic information can be utilised to examine {{the expansion of the}} Austronesian-speaking people. A genetic survey that spans two oceans is challenging, thus the study relied mostly on modern chicken DNA and available ancient DNA to reconstruct events that transpired several millennia ago. The use of modern DNA allowed comparison with reference sequences from across the globe, whereas ancient DNA allowed population continuity to be tested – i. e., whether the modern specimen still represents past populations. The phylogeographic and population genetic analyses on these chickens provided unparalleled insights into the prehistoric translocation history <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> in the Indo-Pacific region. These have allowed us to confirm the Philippine homeland <b>of</b> the Polynesian <b>chickens</b> and find the east African proximate population source for chickens in Madagascar. Furthermore, the study supports that chickens were dispersed into the Pacific along with the Austronesian expansion, but not in the Indian Ocean. The study also revealed original insights and highlights the complex picture about the population history and human-mediated dispersals <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> in the Indo-Pacific. This complexity is brought {{by the fact that the}} prehistoric translocation <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> cannot be solely attributed to one dominant human group or expansion event that occurred in the region. Therefore, it is paramount to use archaeological and linguistic narratives to explain the genetics <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> and reach the best inference possible about their history. This research demonstrates the usefulness of using genetic studies on chickens in elucidating the origins and routes of prehistoric translocations and Austronesian expansion in the Indo-Pacific. This study advances our knowledge about prehistoric dispersal <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> in the Indo-Pacific region and will precipitate exciting new avenues of research. Thesis (Ph. D.)

One kilogram of male and female TIC, TICC and BC were maintained in an environmental temperature range of 26 ± 2 °C and 38 ± 2 °C. MCV, MCH and MCHC were investigated on days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 of an experimental period. The results revealed the following information: On day 14 of the experimental period, MCV <b>of</b> the <b>chickens</b> maintained at 38 ± 2 °C was significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> maintained at 26 ± 2 °C (p< 0. 05). MCH <b>of</b> the <b>chickens</b> maintained in the environmental temperature at 38 ± 2 °C was significantly decreased during days 1 - 14 and then increased on day 21 of the experimental period (p< 0. 05). The MCH <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> maintained at 26 ± 2 °C was significantly decreased during days 7 - 21 and then increased on day 28 of experimental period (p< 0. 05). On days 1 and 21, the MCH <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> maintained in the environmental temperature at 38 ± 2 °C was significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> at 26 ± 2 °C (p< 0. 05). The MCHC <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> maintained at 38 ± 2 °C was significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>chickens</b> at 26 ± 2 °C (p< 0. 05). Moreover, the MCHC of the TICC changed less than that of the TIC and BC (p< 0. 05).

5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans <b>of</b> <b>Chicken</b> Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction <b>of</b> <b>Chicken</b> Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of digital marketing and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.|$|E

This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E
