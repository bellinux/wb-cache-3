Randolph sought <b>out</b> <b>people</b> who had known Whitehead and had seen his flying machines and engines.

25|$|In the 20th century, many {{suburban}} areas, {{especially those}} {{not within the}} political boundaries of the city containing the central business area, began to see independence from the central city as an asset. In some cases, suburbanites saw self-government {{as a means to}} keep <b>out</b> <b>people</b> who could not afford the added suburban property maintenance costs not needed in city living. Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and other lending institutions. In some cities such as Miami and San Francisco, the main city is much smaller than the surrounding suburban areas, leaving the city proper with {{a small portion of the}} metro area's population and land area.|$|E
25|$|The Second Sino-Japanese War, {{started in}} 1937, revived a {{perceived}} sense of patriotism {{in the local}} Chinese to China and soon the Singaporean Chinese imposed an embargo against Japanese goods and products in Singapore. During the war, fearing {{for the safety of}} their relatives in China, some of the immigrants returned to China to fight the Japanese, while established entrepreneurs sent economic aid or military equipment to China. After the Japanese took Singapore in 1942, the Kempeitai tracked down many Chinese who aided the Chinese war effort against Japan. However, the Kempeitai's Sook Ching Operation was simply a massacre designed to drive fear into the local populace, so the Kempeitai simply picked <b>out</b> <b>people</b> based on accounts of masked informers, which in many cases were false accounts based on personal vendettas. There were also active anti-Japanese resistance during the war, such as Force 136, headed by Lim Bo Seng.|$|E

25|$|The whites {{dealt with}} this problem of {{potential}} political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, {{nearly half of the}} state population. It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also: (a) be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or (c) own at least 40 acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the American Revolution through the Spanish–American War was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because by 1908 many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, and literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically. In the early 20th century, Progressives promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics. Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to effectively close <b>out</b> <b>people</b> who were illiterate. White, one-party rule was solidified.|$|E

The band promoted the album with a tour across North America and England, featuring old and new songs. The band also did the set-up and sold merchandise themselves. As of August 2002, the album has sold 73,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of February 2015, All Hands on the Bad One has sold 98,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|Generally, {{the party}} wants a stricter {{immigration}} policy, {{so that only}} {{those who are in}} need of protection according to the UN Refugee Convention are allowed to stay in Norway. In a speech in the 2007 election campaign, Siv Jensen claimed that the immigration policy was a failure because it let criminals stay in Norway, while throwing <b>out</b> <b>people</b> who worked hard and followed the law. The party claims the immigration and integration policy to be naïve. In 2009, the party proposed an official goal of reducing accepted asylum seekers by about 90%, from 1,000 to 100 a month, the standards then said to be used in Denmark and Finland, although less than 100 a year was proposed in 2008. In 2008, the party wanted to [...] "avoid illiterates and other poorly resourced groups who we see are not able to adapt in Norway"; which included countries as Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The party opposes that asylum seekers are allowed stay in Norway on humanitarian grounds or due to health issues, and seeks to substantially limit the number of family reunifications. The party has also called for a referendum on the general immigration policy.|$|E

The red unit (Kommando Rot), which was the largest squad, unpacked and sorted the belongings of victims after they had been [...] "processed". The red unit delivered these belongings to the storage barracks, which were managed by the yellow unit (Kommando Gelb), who separated the items by quality, removed the Star of David from all outer garments, and extracted any money sewn into the linings.

500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K.

You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E
500|$|Texas Monthly editor, Joe Nick Patoski {{believed}} [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] {{contained the}} [...] "most popular rhythm [...] coursing through the Latin music world". Patoski further {{wrote that the}} track [...] "honored" [...] it by [...] "updating it with vocal samples, second line drumming from New Orleans, and horn charts inspired by soca from the Caribbean." [...] This was echoed by word for word from author Deborah Paredez on her book on Selena's fandom. Patoski further wrote that the remix version [...] "may have been laced with such exotica as a reggae toastmaster talking over a teeth-rattling bass line", and called it a [...] "electronic mishmash", and a [...] "pan-Caribbean attack that included soca and Hi Life from the Trinidad". Written in the key of G minor, the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 91 beats per minute. The remix version on Dreaming of You has a key signature set in C minor and moves at a moderate 90 bpms. The remix employs a piano, güira, tambourine, French horn and drums. Lyrically, Selena calls on people to dance her new style the [...] "techno cumbia" [...] dance and [...] "humorously" [...] calls <b>out</b> <b>people</b> who can't dance cumbia. Italian essayists Gaetano Prampolini and Annamaria Pinazzi described the lyrics of [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] that [...] "summons everyone to the dance floor".

500|$|Nielsen's {{supporting}} role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! {{was a turning}} point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, [...] "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, [...] "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." [...] In several interviews he reflected on the line: [...] "I thought it was amusing, but {{it never occurred to me}} that it was going to become a trademark. It's such a surprise... the thing comes <b>out,</b> <b>people</b> say, 'What did he say?! Nielsen said he was [...] "pleased and honored that [...] had a chance to deliver that line." [...] As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at No.79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time. In 2012 Empire magazine voted it No.1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010 Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E
