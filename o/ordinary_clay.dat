He was slow of {{utterance}} and movement, and his eyes, pale blue as his hair was pale yellow, seemed filled with an immortal dreaming, the stuff of which no man knew, and himself least of all. Perhaps this appearance of immortal dreaming was due to a supreme and vacuous innocence.

She was of diminutive size, so small that Dick Lomas, by no means a tall man, felt quite large by the side of her. Her figure was exquisite, and she had the smallest hands in the world. Her features were so good, regular and well-formed, her complexion so perfect, her agile grace so enchanting, that she did not seem a real person at all. She was too delicate for the hurly-burly of life, and it seemed improbable that she could be made of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>clay</b> from which human beings are manufactured. She had the artificial grace of those dainty, exquisite ladies in the Embarquement pour Cithère of the charming Watteau; and you felt that she was fit to saunter on that sunny strand, habited in satin of delicate colours, with a witty, decadent cavalier by her side. It was preposterous to talk to her of serious things, and nothing but an airy badinage seemed possible in her company.|$|E

60|$|When {{they had}} been at work about five weeks there was a pole stuck into their heap of dirt, and {{on the top of}} the pole there was a little red flag flying. At about thirty feet from the surface, when they had already been obliged to insert {{transverse}} logs in the shaft to prevent the sides from falling in, they had come upon a kind of soil altogether different from the <b>ordinary</b> <b>clay</b> through which {{they had been}} working. There was a stratum of loose shingle or gravelly earth, running apparently in a sloping direction, taking the decline of the very slight hill on which their claim was situated. Mick, as soon as this was brought to light, became an altered man. The first bucket of this stuff that was pulled up was deposited by him separately, and he at once sat down to wash it. This he did in an open tin pan. Handful after handful he washed, shifting and teasing it about in the pan, and then he cast it out, always leaving some very small residuum. He was intent upon his business to a degree that Caldigate would have thought to be beyond the man's nature. With extreme patience he went on washing handful after handful all the day, while the other two pulled up fresh buckets of the same stuff. He would not pause to eat, or hardly to talk. At last there came a loud exclamation. 'By------, we've got it!' Then Dick and Caldigate, stooping down, were shown four or five little specks in the angle of the pan's bottom. Before the sun had set they had stuck up their little red flag, and a crowd of neighbours was standing round them asking questions as to their success.|$|E

Chemical grouting is however expensive and sometimes the use of cement {{does not lead to}} the desired effect. That is why we are trying to find new materials and methods of injection. Clay and cement are added to a mixture save chemical products. Clay-cement mixes are used not only because they are better quality, but also because these mixtures have a tendency to penetrate better into incoherent sediments that would need an additional sealant of a chemical injection. In order to reduce cost in future, <b>ordinary</b> <b>clay</b> is replaces in the mixture secondary raw materials can be a suitable substitute for <b>ordinary</b> <b>clay</b> to a certain extent. This is true above all for fly ash.

Bentonic clays absorb water and expand greater than any other <b>ordinary</b> plastic <b>clay.</b> The expansiveness of the clay is characterised by the absorbed cation in the clay and the geochemical environment. This paper critically investigates {{factors that contribute to}} the swelling characteristics of bentonite clay and its products. It takes particular view on different types of bentonite used in clay liners and their interaction with saline ground water conditions. The swelling pressure of sodium bentonite in deionised water is demonstrated to be very high. However when it is in a saline environment the magnitude of swelling pressure can be less than halved. A parallel observation is noted under conditions of free swell. These are explained as being a consequence of reduction in the double layer thickness which is further reflected in the reduction of cationexchange capacity when the bentonite is in a saline environment. Variations in cation exchange capacity, consistency limit and free swell of the bentonite products in different saline environment are observed and its significance discussed...|$|R
40|$|Bentonite absorbs {{water to}} a greater extent than any other <b>ordinary</b> plastic <b>clay</b> and as a {{consequence}} it swells depending on the change in its moisture content. This paper aims to give an overview of the swelling characteristic of bentonites with particular observations from that of prehydrated clay mats. How the swelling characteristics vary with the type of clay, water, and the encompassing boundary materials is presented. Accordingly, it examines the swelling response of the clay mat and the pressure exerted when the swelling is both fully and partially restrained. The development of a new apparatus to measure pressures exerted by the clay as a result of the swelling process is also described. A theoretical study is made to postulate how these pressures can be evaluated for field situations. Though bentonites are known to have very high swelling pressures, how this is negated by the compressibility of the composite behaviour with the necessary backfill is demonstrated. Tests show significant differences in swelling behaviour and pressure development when the GCL is in deionized water and sea water environments. Free swell characteristics were similarly affected [...] Unique variation of pressure exerted due to swelling in partially restrained conditions was established with experimental observations made during the study...|$|R

A kinetic alternative was developed {{with the goal}} of finding universal rate constants instead of the site- and depth-specific solubility constants usually associated with the equilibrium approach. The behavior of the two approaches was studied {{within the framework of the}} steady-state soil chemistry model PROFILE using data from Solling, Germany and Gårdsjön, Sweden, two sites with different mineralogy and land use history. The kinetic alternative uses a mass balance to predict Al concentrations. The sources of Al in soil water are deposition, weathering and mineralization. The sinks are leaching and the formation of an aluminosilicate precursor. The precursor slowly transforms into an <b>ordinary</b> <b>clay</b> mineral. Both formation and transformation of the precursor are treated as irreversible processes. The kinetic model introduces a new relationship between pH and Al and produces a systematic pattern of different apparent gibbsite equilibrium constants at different depths.

40|$|Dispersive soils which {{occur in}} many parts of the world are easily {{erodible}} and segregate in water pose serious problems of stability of earth and earth retaining structures. The mechanism of dispersivity of soils is reasonably well understood. However there is simple method to identify the dispersivity of the soils and even more difficult to quantify the dispersivity.

40|$|It {{has been}} well known that flow of pore fluid in {{compacted}} soils will also occur horizontally as well as vertically since the surface of an embankment is a natural drainage boundary. In addition, this flow is ultimately predominant in the horizontal direction in the soil structure because of the layering roller- compacted fill. On the other hand, in consolidation tests on compacted soils as embankment materials, the curvre representing time-dependant settlement relationship has a characteristic shape. This phenomenon {{is very different from}} <b>ordinary</b> saturated <b>clays.</b> The present objected is to extend the one-dimentional consolidation theory to take account of the two dimentional anisotropic one. Considering anisotropy of consolidation behavior and characteristic of compacted soils mentioned above, the author derived an anisotropic consolidation equation and its solution under axi-symmetric cylindrical coordinates. In this treatment, an assumption was made that a stress-strain relation of the soil skeleton was represented by a rheological model comprising a Voigt body. Consequently, a general expression of the strain was proposed for the sum of two parts: the effective stress remaining constant and effective stress varying with time(Eq. (12)). Solutions obtained from the basic equation (Eq. (15) or(16)), that are equations regarding the pore pressure distribution (Eq. (26)), consolidation setttlement(Eq. (27)) and average degree of consolidation (Eq. (28)), were found to be similar to solutions of one-dimensional equation in form except for additional terms due to radial directional effects. From this reasoning, the author indicated that parmeters concerning two-dimensional anisotropic consolidation could be calculated numerically by utilizing parameters obtained from one-dimensional one...|$|R

Relational Aesthetics are integral to my conceptual approach. I value the life my work takes on through the viewer, stemming from the object. A temporal grouping of participants, their reaction and effect, complete the work. Interactions take a democratic approach, giving every viewer a chance, to promote dialogue through shared experience. My work challenges the notions of art and the relation of preciousness and object. Through participation I hope the viewer asks: What is art? What is art for? Why is art the way it is? My process is quick and often crude, yet I place {{it in the context of}} beauty and art. The materials I choose to use: tyvek, a common weatherproofing material, unfired clay, and house paint further question the history of art as precious. I enjoy this raw-aesthetic approach for the questions it poses to art. My art is energetic, often colorful assortments of <b>ordinary</b> materials: <b>Clay</b> for its malleability, tyvek for its lightness and strength, and brightly colored house paints for their playfulness. The objects are created using ordinary materials, because they are easily recognized and understood by my perceived audience, creating a level of comfort that instigates play. The shapes and forms give evidence of the energy and process by which they were created. Like street art, my work is quick and highly dependent on the environment it is occupying. While the work is created in a studio, it is made to expand over any given space often overlapping onto itself. The interactive aspects of the work are heavily rooted in the fluid and fun nature of Fluxus. Explosions of rampant color unabashedly hung from the wall or piled on a surface are the result of the day-to-day thoughts that can’t be organized. From self-destructive paintings to carving and cutting of unfired clay, the art is in a constant progression to an unknown destination.

5000|$|The oldest {{building}} is the ruined chapel {{at the extreme}} west end of the village, of which only the west gable {{and parts of the}} east end remain. The chapel was probably not part of the medieval manor of Westhumble, but was located in the manor of Polesden (centred on Chapel Farm, which is of medieval origin). Reference is made in the Surrey Feet of Fines during the reign of King John 1199-1216 to [...] "Adam the canon in Fecham and Polesdene" [...] a subordinate of the Prior of Merton and it is probable that the chapel was the responsibility of this Canon. The chapel is thought to have been built during the late twelfth or early thirteenth century for the use of villagers, particularly when floods prevented them from reaching the Parish Church in Mickleham. Six skeletons were found during an archaeological survey in 1937 {{and the manner in which}} they were interred suggests that they were <b>ordinary</b> local burials. <b>Clay</b> cooking pots and jugs dating from around 1300 and a silver penny dating from 1544-1547 during the reign of Henry VIII were also found on the site.
