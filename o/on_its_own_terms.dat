5|$|Before the 1912 naval law was passed, Britain and Germany {{attempted}} {{to reach a}} compromise with the Haldane Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard Haldane. The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned {{the idea of a}} decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> which would render it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact adopt this strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact {{to be used as a}} bargaining chip in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman {{blockade}} quickly {{reduced the}} inhabitants to near starvation, and led {{many of them}} to flee the city. When coupled with the restrictions placed on them by the siege, the inability of Venice to properly supply and guard the city, and the violations of their customary rights and rampant profiteering by Venetian officials, a pro-surrender party was formed and gained strength among the inhabitants. The city's Metropolitan, Symeon, encouraged his flock to resist, but by 1426, with Venice's inability to secure peace <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> evident, {{a majority of the}} local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid the pillage accompanying a forcible conquest. Venice's efforts to find allies against the Ottomans also failed, as the other regional potentates either pursued their own course, were themselves antagonistic to the Venetians, or were defeated by the Ottomans.|$|E
25|$|Updike {{was praised}} for his {{literary}} criticism's conventional simplicity and profundity, {{for being an}} aestheticist critic who saw literature <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> and for his longtime commitment {{to the practice of}} literary criticism.|$|E

50|$|The name Sequoia {{sometimes}} {{refers to}} the subfamily Sequoioideae, which includes the still-living S. sempervirens along with Sequoiadendron (giant sequoia) and Metasequoia (dawn redwood). <b>On</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> the <b>term</b> redwood usually {{refers to the}} coast redwood, {{and not to the}} other genera.|$|R
50|$|Medically, {{when used}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> the <b>term</b> seizure implies an epileptic seizure. The lay {{use of this}} word can also include sudden attacks of illness, loss of control, spasm or stroke. Where the {{physician}} is uncertain as to the diagnosis, the medical term paroxysmal event and the lay terms spells, funny turns or attacks may be used.|$|R
25|$|Lee Siegel from Harper's {{felt that}} most critics responded {{mainly to the}} {{marketing}} campaign and {{did not address the}} film <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> Others felt that American censorship took an esoteric film and made it even harder to understand.|$|E
25|$|Poetry has {{consistently}} {{been held in}} extremely high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences filtered through the minds of Chinese literati. In Chinese culture, poetry has provided a format and a forum for {{both public and private}} expressions of deep emotion, offering an audience of peers, readers, and scholars insight into the inner life of Chinese writers across more than two millennia. Westerners also have found in it an interesting and pleasurable field of study, in its exemplification of essential contrasts between the Western world and Chinese civilization, and <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the Protestant Reformation (c. 1517), {{studies of}} Paul’s {{writings}} have been {{heavily influenced by}} Lutheran and Reformed views that {{are said to have}} been ascribed to the negative attributes that they associated with sixteenth-century Roman Catholicism to Second Temple Judaism. These Lutheran and Reformed views on Paul's writings are called “the old perspective” by adherents of the “new perspective on Paul”. The “new perspective” is an attempt to lift Paul's letters out of the Lutheran-Reformed framework and interpret them based on what is said to be an understanding of first-century Judaism, taken <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When X is compact, a set is uniformly equicontinuous if {{and only}} if it is equicontinuous at every point, for {{essentially}} the same reason as that uniform continuity and continuity coincide on compact spaces. Used <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> the <b>term</b> [...] "equiconituity" [...] may refer to either the pointwise or uniform notion, depending on the context. On a compact space, these notions coincide.|$|R
25|$|Mullet Fever was {{released}} in 2002 and featured a more punk-influenced grindcore sound. However, many of the songs included more experimental (for grindcore) styles including rap, hip-hop, jazz, noise and electronic. The album was largely recorded in one session of the band recording their own jam session and some minimal editing afterwards, and may explain why this album stands out <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> in <b>terms</b> of musical style and scope.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, {{the play}} was revived at the Off-Broadway South Street Theater by the Australian Orange Tree Company. The {{director}} was Jerrold Brody, with LIz McDonald as Chrissy. Reviewing this production for The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang wrote that the play [...] "comes encumbered with a history. But viewed {{for the first time}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> modest <b>terms</b> <b>on</b> a bandbox stage, it is full of dramatic fury." ...|$|R
25|$|Murphy concludes that,"Just as the Son of God limited {{himself by}} taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine {{action in the}} world to be in accord with {{rational}} laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E
25|$|In 1878–9 Hughes {{began writing}} The Manual for Co-operators (1881), with Vansittart Neale, for the Co-operative Congress. As a side-product he {{developed}} {{an interest in}} the model village. In 1880, he acquired the ownership of Franklin W. Smith's Plateau City and founded a settlement in America—Rugby, Tennessee—which was designed as an experiment in utopian living for the younger sons of the English gentry. It followed closely on the failed colony Buckthorn (existing about 1872 to 1879), established by another Englishman Charles Lempriere, in western Virginia; this settlement had supposedly been suggested by Hughes. Rugby was also unsuccessful <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> but it still exists and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|AMC Networks {{responded to}} Dish's {{announcement}} of its pending {{removal of the}} channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by former company parent Rainbow Media's Voom HD Networks, {{in which it is}} seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup (the five remaining Voom HD channels were removed from Dish the day after). However, Dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Universities {{offering}} non-official study programmes {{are legally}} bound to clearly differentiate between officially approved and non-officially approved qualifications when naming their offer of non-official qualifications.

50|$|Tetkowski {{earned his}} MFA degree in 1980 from Illinois State University. From 1980 to 1983 {{he held the}} {{position}} of assistant professor at Denison University in central Ohio and in 1983, Tetkowski receives an Individual Artist Fellowship form the Ohio Arts Council. In 1984 he was a resident artist at Artpark in Lewiston, New York. From Ohio he returned to Buffalo, where he was {{an assistant professor at}} the State University College of New York at Buffalo, until 1987. He received a Fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts in 1986. During this time, the scale of his work became a significant concern for Tetkowski. He wanted to fill the viewer's entire field of vision with an object, so that the viewer was forced to confront it <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> and to grapple with the aesthetic issues Tetkowski was exploring, rather than respond to the work as a definable object, such as a vessel. This led to the three and four-foot disks the artist became known for.|$|R
40|$|The Child of an Ancient People" is {{dedicated}} to the memory of Truganini and her people, the victims of what, Benmalek says, is 'a perfect genocide: its victims forgotten, the murderers free of blame'. Though there is a note of hope in the ending, the novel is evidently intended to register, via the vehicle of historical fiction, a fierce protest on behalf of all the dispossessed and persecuted indigenous peoples of the modern world. And <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> uncompromising <b>terms,</b> it succeeds...|$|R
25|$|Despite this revamped {{effort at}} {{fighting}} the enemy <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> U.S. operations remained insufficient at eliminating the tunnels completely. In 1967, General William Westmoreland tried launching a larger assault on Củ Chi and the Iron Triangle. Called Operation Cedar Falls, it {{was similar to}} the previous Operation Crimp, however on a larger scale with 30,000 troops instead of the 8,000. On January 18, tunnel rats from the 1st BN 5th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division uncovered the Viet Cong district headquarters of Củ Chi, containing half a million documents concerning all types of military strategy. Among the documents were maps of U.S. bases, detailed accounts of PLAF movement from Cambodia into Vietnam, lists of political sympathizers, and even plans for a failed assassination attempt on Robert McNamara.|$|E
25|$|Hieroglyphs {{continued}} to be used under Persian rule (intermittent in the 6th and 5th centuries BC), and after Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt, during the ensuing Ptolemaic and Roman periods. It appears that the misleading quality of comments from Greek and Roman writers about hieroglyphs came about, at least in part, {{as a response to}} the changed political situation. Some believed that hieroglyphs may have functioned as a way to distinguish 'true Egyptians' from some of the foreign conquerors. Another reason may be the refusal to tackle a foreign culture <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> which characterized Greco-Roman approaches to Egyptian culture generally. Having learned that hieroglyphs were sacred writing, Greco-Roman authors imagined the complex but rational system as an allegorical, even magical, system transmitting secret, mystical knowledge.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the century the Christchurch City Council was {{strongly}} in favour of bringing the tramways under municipal control but only <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> This ignited suspicion amongst Christchurch City's neighbouring boroughs – through whose territory such a system would have to be built even if only to replace the existing private network – that they would have no control over the running of such a system. A series of tramway conferences were held from the mid-1890s for the local bodies involved to advance the cause of municipalisation but it was not until March 1902 that the City Council acquiesced to the demands of its neighbours for a tramway board with elected members. The Tramway Conference had received an offer to construct and operate an electric tramway system from the British Electric Traction Company (the same company that had the contract for the Auckland system) in February but, despite public support for the proposal, declined as they were already in favour of municipal control.|$|E
50|$|The accords thus {{facilitated}} {{a withdrawal}} by an erstwhile superpower, {{in a manner}} which justified an invasion. They exemplify the delicacy of UN diplomacy when the interests of a great power are engaged. In essence, the accords were a political bailout for a government struggling {{with the consequences of}} a costly error. The UN could not insist that accusations of national culpability were relevant to the negotiations. In the case of Afghanistan, the Soviet Union insisted <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> diplomatic <b>terms</b> as did the United States in a different manner concerning Vietnam.|$|R
25|$|An {{argument}} {{proposed by}} Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because {{it focuses on}} personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can. For Francione, {{this is similar to}} arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> consequentialist <b>terms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The concerto {{has been}} praised by music critics. Andrew Clements of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Each of its three {{movements}} {{was inspired by}} a poem ..., but the concerto stands up well <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> purely musical <b>terms,</b> in a language that, like the first concerto, shows unashamed debts to the great 19th-century piano concerto tradition, while placing them {{in a world that is}} entirely Lieberson's own." ...|$|R
500|$|As he {{does with}} character, Hazlitt observes {{patterns}} he discovers in the plot. He will have nothing of criticising {{it in terms of}} the classical [...] "unities". The plot must be taken <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> If the action is long-drawn-out, [...] "the interest becomes more aerial and refined from the principle of perspective introduced into the subject by the imaginary changes of scene, {{as well as by the}} length of time it occupies." ...|$|E
500|$|Red Zinfandel wines {{have been}} criticized for being too [...] "hot" [...] (too alcoholic), {{although}} modern winemaking techniques have helped make them more approachable. On the other hand, Zinfandel producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood believe that alcohol-removing technologies, such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones, remove a sense of terroir from the wine. If a wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15% alcohol, Peterson argues, it should be accepted <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
500|$|Critics responded {{positively}} to [...] "Nana's Party", with Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times calling it [...] "another cracker", Chater characterising it as another [...] "bullseye", and Julia Raeside and John Dugdale, writing in The Sunday Times, describing it as [...] "another perfectly judged high-wire walk: comedy and tragedy balanced evenly and artfully at all times". Bennion called it [...] "a tightly wound and hugely impressive half hour", and the freelance journalist Dan Owen called it [...] "another great instalment" [...] that [...] "really worked" [...] <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Boo Allen of the Denton Record Chronicle called Ice Cube's xXx {{character}} [...] "a chubby, surly, incomprehensible action hero". Brian Orndorf of FilmJerk.com compared {{watching the}} film to running [...] "headfirst at top speed into a brick wall". David Hiltbrand of the Philadelphia Inquirer said [...] "the plot swings between pathetically implausible and aggressively stupid". Some critics liked the film. Mack Bates of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised Ice Cube's [...] "trademark charisma and street sensibility," [...] while Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "that rare B movie that’s rooted in gut-level stirrings of power and retaliation". Paul Arendt of the BBC said, [...] "Viewed <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> trashy <b>terms,</b> it succeeds brilliantly".|$|R
5000|$|Sir: for men, {{formally}} if {{they have}} a British knighthood or if they are a baronet (used with first name or full name, never surname alone) or generally (used <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own)</b> as a <b>term</b> of general respect or flattery, when it is equivalent in meaning to [...] "Madam" [...] for women (see below). Also used in secondary schools; most tend not to call male teachers [...] "Mr ___", but rather [...] "Sir".|$|R
50|$|In the UK, cycle {{track is}} a roadway {{constructed}} specifically {{for use by}} cyclists, but not by any other vehicles. In Ireland cycle track also covers cycle lanes marked on the carriageway but only if accompanied by a specific sign. In the UK, a cycle track may be alongside a roadway (or carriageway) for all vehicles {{or it may be}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> alignment. The <b>term</b> does not include cycle lanes or other facilities within an all-vehicle carriageway.|$|R
500|$|In 1944, Beecham {{returned}} to Britain. Musically his reunion with the London Philharmonic was triumphant, but the orchestra, now (after his help in 1939) a self-governing co-operative, attempted to hire him <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> as its salaried artistic director. [...] "I emphatically refuse", concluded Beecham, [...] "to be wagged by any orchestra ... I {{am going to}} found one more great orchestra to round off my career." [...] When Walter Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1945, Beecham conducted its first concert. But he was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO.|$|E
500|$|Wilde, who {{had first}} {{set out to}} irritate Victorian society with his dress and talking points, then outrage it with Dorian Gray, his novel of vice hidden beneath art, finally {{found a way to}} {{critique}} society <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> Lady Windermere's Fan was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James's Theatre, packed with the cream of society. On the surface a witty comedy, there is subtle subversion underneath: [...] "it concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure". The audience, like Lady Windermere, are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view. The play was enormously popular, touring the country for months, but largely trashed by conservative critics.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Milford's biography, {{scholars}} and critics began to look at Zelda's work in a new light. In a 1968 edition of Save Me the Waltz, F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli wrote, [...] "Save Me the Waltz is worth reading partly because anything that illuminates the career of F. Scott Fitzgerald is worth reading—and {{because it is the}} only published novel of a brave and talented woman who is remembered for her defeats." [...] But as Save Me the Waltz was increasingly read alongside Milford's biography, a new perspective emerged. In 1979, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin wrote rebutting Bruccoli's position: [...] "Save Me the Waltz is a moving and fascinating novel which should be read <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> equally as much as Tender Is the Night. It needs no other justification than its comparative excellence." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about: how I {{came to the}} {{understanding}} of, to use Talbert’s words, “the pastoral application” of the Book of Revelation, and what that message—or, more accurately, messages—are. First, the meaning of Revelation 1 : 3 will be explored as an up-front clue to the book’s practical intent. Second, I will explain where my renewed brainstorming on the “heeding” front initially took me in regard to a “big picture” sense of Revelation. Third, I will demonstrate how a grand chiastic structuring of the Apocalypse actually has major practical implications. Fourth, I will lay out a “spread chiasm” of the seven beatitudes in Revelation, which provides complementary insights in understanding and obeying the Book’s practical message. Finally, I will briefly summarize my findings and offer a plea for interpreters to allow the Apocalypse to speak <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> practical <b>terms...</b>|$|R
40|$|While presupposing {{that every}} culture evolves based <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> {{specific}} <b>terms,</b> this discussion poses {{the question of}} how one of Russia's main cultural and literary characteristics emerges within these two realms. Following research on historical poetics on permanent theme and motif-related (subject) schemes, which form the basis of oral or written artistic expression and pass from one country to another, the question that poses itself is how these consequent “travelling themes” pass from one (according to A. Flaker) style formation into another, from one phase of literary and cultural devel-opment into another. The analysis addresses the emergence of a specific motif scheme in the creative process of N. V. Gogol that has led to the absurd consciousness, which in turn became, regardless of art form transformations, a kind of a constructive principle of Soviet and Russian culture of the 20 th century...|$|R
5000|$|Price and {{his former}} Dreaming In Stereo bandmate Fernando Perdomo worked {{together}} to co-produce an album for Linda Perhacs entitled The Soul of All Natural Things. It is Perhacs' first album in 44 years. The album was released on March 4, 2014 by Asthmatic Kitty. AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, and Thom Jurek's review states: [...] "The Soul of All Natural Things does stand <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> in <b>terms</b> of quality, but is unmistakably {{an extension of the}} sonic, spiritual continuum Perhacs' began - and probably thought she left - on Parallelograms. Her uncommon, even singular approach to singing, recording, and writing, remains fully in evidence here." [...] In The New York Times' favorable review, Jon Pareles says of Price and Perdomo's production: [...] "They keep the music sounding largely organic without making the album a slavish period piece." ...|$|R
