5|$|Mills came {{to public}} {{attention}} {{when she was}} a model in 1993 and was involved a collision with a police motorcycle in London. The accident resulted in the amputation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> leg below the knee, but she continued to model by using a prosthetic limb and sold her story to a tabloid newspaper.|$|E
5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{attempts}} to change House's drug habits, with little success. After Cuddy makes a bet to prove House's addiction to Vicodin, House concedes to Wilson {{that he has}} an addiction but says that the addiction is not a problem. It is, in fact, Wilson who usually writes House's Vicodin prescriptions (with Cuddy writing a few merely for leverage in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) threatens to jail House for his Vicodin addiction after finding a huge stash in his apartment, Wilson {{attempts to}} convince House to go to rehab as the situation worsens. After Tritter pressures Wilson to testify several times, Wilson reluctantly agrees, unknown to House. Before this, Wilson watches House punch Dr. Robert Chase, insult Cuddy, and incorrectly diagnose {{a child with a}} condition that would have required the amputation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> arm and leg.|$|E
25|$|She was {{estimated}} to be between 20 and 28 years old and had been raped. Basic physical examination showed she was about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed about 118 pounds. The victim was white with possible Hispanic ancestry, as she had brown or black hair and brown eyes. She also had a unique scar on the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand, which was shaped like the letter T. She also had an inch-long scar on the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> thigh.|$|E
25|$|The Lady {{has several}} missing teeth {{due to her}} facial injury. Her left {{alveolar}} plate and part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> jaw were fractured, explaining {{what happened to her}} teeth. One tooth is visible within her mouth. The fracture involved most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> alveolar plate distal to the left first incisor. This incisor is among the missing teeth. The right alveolar plate is in a better condition, though the sockets of the first incisor and the right canine tooth are empty, with these teeth missing. The rest of the teeth are still present, including an nonerupted third molar (wisdom tooth).|$|E

25|$|The {{recovery}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> knee {{took longer}} than expected and it {{forced her to}} miss the rest of 2010, including the year-ending Sony Ericsson Championships and Fed Cup final. Williams ended the year ranked fifth in singles, {{the first time she}} ended a year in the top five since 2002, while playing only nine tournaments. She finished the year ranked eleventh in doubles.|$|E
25|$|During {{the grass}} season, {{she reached the}} quarterfinals in Birmingham. At Wimbledon, {{she was one of}} six seeded female players to be knocked out in the first round, losing to Jana Čepelová in three sets. During her match against Čepelová, Halep {{suffered}} a blister on the middle toe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> foot. After Wimbledon, Halep took a couple of weeks off to regroup and make her game stronger again.|$|E
25|$|The {{left side}} of the lower face {{includes}} a large defect. The defect involves the Lady's left cheek, her left maxillary sinus, her alveolar process, and part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> mandible. There are sharp edges in this bony defect, with no evidence of attempted healing or sclerosis. Fragments of the broken lateral wall of the left maxillary sinus were located within the antral cavity. Fragments for most of the Lady's fractured bones are missing, and were apparently not placed in her tomb.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, O'Donnell {{suffered}} a staph infection after she accidentally cut the middle finger <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand with a knife while cutting a price tag off a fishing pole. The infection incapacitated her for weeks, and nearly resulted in doctors amputating her hand. She later quipped that George W. Bush was {{to blame for the}} infection, saying that she was preparing to go on a fishing trip at the time in order to avoid seeing Bush on television during the then-ongoing 2000 Republican National Convention.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2011, Giffords's husband {{informed}} her that six {{other people had}} been killed in the attack on her, but he did not identify who they were until months later. In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries. She was walking under supervision with perfect control <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> arm and leg, and able to write with her left hand. She was able to read and understand, and spoke in short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|A mustard tin {{containing}} two pawn tickets {{issued to}} Emily Birrell and Anne Kelly was discovered on Eddowes' body. These {{eventually led to}} her identification by John Kelly as his common-law wife, after he read about the tickets in the newspapers. His identification was confirmed by Catherine Eddowes' sister, Eliza Gold. No money was found on her. Though the murder occurred within the City of London, {{it was close to}} the boundary of Whitechapel where the previous Whitechapel murders had occurred. The mutilation of Eddowes' body and the abstraction <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> kidney and part of her womb by her murderer bore the signature of Jack the Ripper and was very similar in nature to that of earlier victim Annie Chapman.|$|E

25|$|Williams {{withdrew from}} the Hopman Cup after {{retiring}} from her singles match against Australia Gold with inflammation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> knee. Her next tournament was the Australian Open, where she was the No. 1 seed and defending champion. She reached the final without dropping a set, including wins over No. 5 Maria Sharapova and No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska, and faced first time Grand Slam finalist Angelique Kerber. She was considered the heavy favorite to win the title, as she had never lost an Australian Open final or semi-final. She also dominated the head-to-head against Kerber, having lost only once in six meetings and having not lost a set to her in four years. However, Serena lost the final in three sets and Kerber won her first Grand Slam title. This marked Williams's first-ever loss in {{the final of the}} Australian Open, as well as her first three-set loss in the final of a Grand Slam. She had previously been 6–0 and 8–0 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and legs}} to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of her}} head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E
25|$|The Princess's {{later life}} {{was marred by}} illness and disability. She had smoked {{cigarettes}} {{since at least the}} age of 15 and had continued to smoke heavily for many years. On 5 January 1985, she had part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> lung removed; the operation drew parallels with that of her father over 30 years earlier. In 1991, she quit smoking, though she continued to drink heavily. In January 1993, she was admitted to hospital for pneumonia. She experienced a mild stroke in 1998 at her holiday home in Mustique. Early the following year the Princess suffered severe scalds to her feet in a bathroom accident, which affected her mobility to the extent that she required support when walking and sometimes used a wheelchair. In January and March 2001, further strokes were diagnosed, which left her with partial vision and paralysis on the left side. Margaret's last public appearances were at the 101st birthday celebrations of her mother in August 2001 and the 100th birthday celebration of her aunt, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, that December.|$|E
