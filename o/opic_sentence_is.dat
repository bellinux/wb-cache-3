50|$|In other words, Athīr {{says that}} if the Liar <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> false, {{which means that the}} Liar falsely {{declares}} that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true; and, if the Liar <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true, which means that the Liar truthfully declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> false. In any case, the Liar <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> both true and false at the same time, which is a paradox.|$|R

5000|$|But now let's try {{assuming}} that the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> false. In order for a conditional to be false, the antecedent condition must be true while the consequent is false. So to assume the falsity of the sentence: [...] "if this <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true, then 'Germany borders China' is true," [...] we must assume that [...] "this <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true" [...] (the antecedent condition), and [...] "it is not true that Germany borders China" [...] (the consequent). Notice, though, that in assuming the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> false, we must assume that the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true. This contradiction means that, in fact, the <b>sentence</b> must <b>be</b> true.|$|R
30|$|Out of 2, 293 {{sentences}}, 7.14  % (153 <b>sentences)</b> <b>were</b> labeled as yes and 92.86  % (2, 140 <b>sentences)</b> <b>were</b> labeled as no.

30|$|We {{used the}} same 15 English <b>sentences</b> as <b>were</b> used in the first experiment. Every <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> {{additionally}} synthesized using the (RES) strategy. Each subject was shown a subset containing 20 samples: 4 different sentences, each synthesized using the 5 different strategies from Table 1.

50|$|The PPs {{in these}} <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> NOT adjuncts, {{nor are they}} arguments. The {{preposition}} in each case is, rather, part of the main predicate. The matrix predicate in the first <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> is under; this predicate takes the two arguments It and the bush. Similarly, the matrix predicate in the second <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> is at; this predicate takes the two arguments The party and seven o'clock. Distinguishing between predicates, arguments, and adjuncts becomes particularly difficult when secondary predicates are involved, for instance with resultative predicates, e.g.|$|R

50|$|The {{verdicts}} and <b>sentences</b> <b>were</b> pronounced {{together with}} all defendants present.

5000|$|A {{conditional}} <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> a <b>sentence</b> {{of imprisonment}} which is {{served in the}} community, usually under very onerous conditions. The common vernacular {{for this type of}} <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> [...] "house arrest." [...] Since its introduction in 1997, its availability has greatly narrowed. Originally a conditional <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> available when the following conditions were met: (1) Court finds imprisonment under two years appropriate; (2) permitting the offender to serve his sentence in the community would not endanger the public; and (3) the imposition of a conditional <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> consistent with the fundamental principles of <b>sentencing.</b> It <b>was</b> not available where for offences carrying a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment.|$|R

50|$|From the {{previous}} lemma, {{the set of}} finitely satisfiable <b>sentences</b> <b>is</b> recursively enumerable. Assume that the set of all finitely valid <b>sentences</b> <b>is</b> recursively enumerable. Since ¬φ is finitely valid iff φ is not finitely satisfiable, we conclude that the set of <b>sentences</b> which <b>are</b> not finitely satisfiable is recursively enumerable. If both a set A and its complement are recursively enumerable, then A is recursive. It follows that the set of finitely satisfiable <b>sentences</b> <b>is</b> recursive, which contradicts Trakhtenbrot's theorem.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a special}} grammar {{phenomena}} in Liangshan Yi such that grammartical relations can be changed through tone change. When personal pronouns combine with verbs, from the view of personal pronouns, the <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> in SV pattern if personal pronouns are mid-level tones, while the <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> in OV pattern when personal pronouns are sub-high tones. From the view of verbs, the <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> in SV pattern if verbs are low-falling tones while the <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> in OV pattern when verbs are sub-high tones. This paper discusses how case relations can be marked with grammatical tone in the Yi language...|$|R

2500|$|In {{theoretical}} linguistics, [...] a speaker's judgement on the well-formedness of {{a linguistic}} utterance—called a grammaticality judgement—is {{based on whether}} the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> produced and interpreted {{in accordance with the}} rules and constraints of the relevant grammar.
