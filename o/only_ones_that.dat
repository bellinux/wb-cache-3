5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the March 1605 {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> were seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. That conclave saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto as valid.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females are the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former {{can be used in}} territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

5|$|The SL95s make up 32 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the older}} SL79. The SL95s {{are the only}} {{bidirectional}} trams, and therefore the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> can operate on the Ullevål Hageby Line, that is served by lines 17 and 18. Since line 13 {{is a continuation of}} line 17 at Sinsen, the SL95s also operate on that line. Due to a too-small curve radius on the Briskeby Line, the SL95s do not operate on any of the lines to Majorstuen. They run on the Ullevål Hageby-, Ekeberg-, Sinsen-, Grünerløkka–Torshov-, Lilleaker- and Skøyen lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> were seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. Baronius was the favourite candidate. His odds of being elected were 10:100 according to Roman bookmakers, who took bets on the election despite prohibition of the practice by Gregory XIV. Baronius received 23 votes during the first scrutiny, which was considered good because many electors who supported him had cast their first ballots for friends. Baronius was the candidate favoured by France, and had the backing of the French cardinals. He was also the first choice candidate of Pietro Aldobrandini, the nephew of Clement VIII, who sought to elect a cardinal who was created by his uncle such as Baronius.|$|E
5|$|This effusive {{display of}} respect and remembrance {{on the part of}} Ranavalona's friends was not {{mirrored}} by subsequent actions of the French colonial administration in Madagascar. In June 1925, eight years after the queen's death, the Governor-General of Algeria informed the Governor-General of Madagascar by letter that payments for the maintenance of Ranavalona's tomb were in default. He urged the colonial government in Madagascar to provide funds for the upkeep of the dilapidated tomb, emphasizing that such neglect was unworthy of the queen's memory and the government of France alike. The request was twice refused and the tomb was never refurbished. In November 1938, Ranavalona's remains were exhumed and re-interred in the tomb of Queen Rasoherina at the Rova of Antananarivo in Madagascar. A fire on the night of 6 November 1995 severely damaged the royal tombs and destroyed most of the other buildings at the site. The lamba-wrapped remains of Ranavalona III were the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> could be saved from the flames. These have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E
30|$|The {{definition}} of riming pairs in poetry {{depends on the}} notion of the syllable rime, which does not include the pre-nuclear glide G. Of the four proposals, the CV analysis is the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has no segmentation boundary between G and the nuclear vowel, and so it is the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> cannot properly define the syllable rime.|$|R

25|$|Humans {{were not}} the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> needed {{protection}} from gas clouds. Horses and mules were important methods of transportation that could be endangered if they came into close contact with gas.

This caused many researchers to develop masks that could be used on animals such as dogs, horses, mules, and even carrier pigeons.|$|E

These and other companies wanted to convert WTVJ into an independent station or a Fox affiliate, for a price far lower than KKR's asking price. The only way that KKR could make such a large profit was to sell WTVJ to another network, as some potential buyers {{had no interest in}} keeping CBS while the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> could purchase the station for the asking price were ABC and NBC.|$|E
25|$|Windows 9x is {{designed}} as a single-user system. Thus, the security model is much less effective {{than the one in}} Windows NT. One reason for this is the FAT file systems (including FAT12/FAT16/FAT32), which are the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> Windows 9x supports officially, though Windows NT also supports FAT12 and FAT16 (but not FAT32) and Windows 9x can be extended to read and write NTFS volumes using third-party Installable File System drivers. FAT systems have very limited security; every user that has access to a FAT drive also has access to all files on that drive. The FAT file systems provide no access control lists and file-system level encryption like NTFS.|$|E
25|$|Eastern {{hemisphere}} The 10th, 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd houses. A subject who {{has most}} {{of his or her}} planets in this hemisphere will be a self-starter who chooses their own path through life and sets their own boundaries. They are not happy being a burden to other people, or being kept by someone else. They also have the burden themselves of being an initiator at work and in their personal life, as little is likely to be done for them by others. When the planets are in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd houses, the subject is likely to be very self-absorbed and convinced that his or her own opinions are the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> matter.|$|E

25|$|Due to the region's {{relatively}} sparse population, {{federal and}} provincial electoral {{districts in the}} region are almost all extremely large geographically. The federal electoral district of Sudbury and the provincial electoral districts of Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie are the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> are comparable in size to an electoral district in Southern Ontario, while at the other extreme the districts of Kenora and Timmins—James Bay are both geographically larger than the entire United Kingdom. One consequence of this, for example, is that a politician who represents a Northern Ontario riding in the Canadian House of Commons or the Legislative Assembly of Ontario must typically maintain a much higher budget for travel and office expenses than one who represents a small urban district does.|$|E
25|$|Grammar school pupils {{were given}} the best {{opportunities}} of any schoolchildren in the state system. Initially, they studied for the School Certificate and Higher School Certificate, replaced in 1951 by General Certificate of Education examinations at O-level (Ordinary level) and A-level (Advanced level). In contrast, very few students at secondary modern schools took public examinations until {{the introduction of the}} less academic and less prestigious Certificate of Secondary Education (known as the CSE) in the 1960s. Until the implementation of the Robbins Report in the 1960s, children from public and grammar schools effectively monopolised access to universities. These schools were also the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> offered an extra term of school to prepare pupils for the competitive entrance exams for Oxford and Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|After being rescued, Mulch gives Artemis {{the disk}} {{that had been}} passed off as a gold medallion, which Butler was given earlier in the book. Artemis views the disk and regains his memories. He is {{overcome}} with guilt {{of what he had}} done to the fairies but to Holly the most and for the first time, he apologizes for kidnapping her. He realises that Holly, Butler, and Mulch were the only friends he had. Together, the four friends take on Opal Koboi, knowing that they are the <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> know she's escaped. It becomes a more difficult task with the LEP on their tail, who still thinks Holly is the one who killed the Commander. The new Commander refuses to believe anything, despite the fact that everyone knows Root was like a father to Holly.|$|E
