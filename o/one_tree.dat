5|$|In 1902, two Port Orford cedar {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} east side of City Hall. <b>One</b> <b>tree</b> was planted on the north side and the second tree on the south side of the {{building}} to reinforce the symmetrical aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open stairwells.|$|E

5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals are {{associated}} with C.australis in healthy ecosystems. The most common epiphytes are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern Asplenium, and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. Astelia species and Collospermum often establish in the main fork of the tree, and <b>one</b> <b>tree</b> can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include Griselinia lucida, {{as well as a}} range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—Phanaerochaeta cordylines and Sphaeropsis cordylines—occur almost exclusively on C.australis.|$|E

5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any <b>one</b> <b>tree,</b> one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.|$|E
5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch forages alone, {{in pairs}} {{or in small}} groups of four to five individuals, though an unusual gathering of 21 individuals was observed in <b>one</b> <b>tree</b> in Bhutan. It often takes part in mixed-species foraging flocks, and has been notably observed feeding with the Himalayan cutia (Cutia nipalensis) and the velvet-fronted nuthatch (Sitta frontalis) – two other species that prospect for food on tree trunks. Other foraging flock partners surveyed are the long-tailed broadbill (Psarisomus dalhousiae), the lesser racket-tailed drongo (Dicrurus remifer), the maroon oriole (Oriolus traillii) and the white-browed scimitar babbler (Pomatorhinus schisticeps).|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are often}} planted in town environments {{where they are}} known as street trees or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through evapotranspiration, absorb {{greenhouse}} gasses and pollutants, intercept rainfall and {{reduce the risk of}} flooding. It has been shown that they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes. In London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to <b>one</b> <b>tree</b> for every resident.|$|E

5|$|Carol {{maintained}} its intensity {{as it moved}} inland, and its winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Hampshire. <b>One</b> <b>tree</b> fell onto a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80mph (130km/h) in Augusta, Maine. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or fell onto power lines. Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed power lines left several counties without power or telephone services. The winds flattened hundreds of acres of corn in North Livermore, and throughout the state, there was heavy damage to the apple crop. Damage to the apple crop amounted to $1.7million. While moving west of Maine, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, including a report of 2.15inches (63mm) in 12hours. Along the coast, high waves damaged boats. In Maine, the hurricane killed three people, injured at least eight, and caused $10million in damage, the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. Carol lost this distinction 10days later when Hurricane Edna caused $15million in damage in the state.|$|E
5|$|Moderate winds blew {{down about}} 1,600trees in the district, 23 of which fell onto houses. The United States National Arboretum lost many mature trees and azaleas {{on the bank}} of the Anacostia River. The winds also downed many power lines, leaving 129,000customers without power. Many streets were blocked by the fallen trees and power lines. At the White House, the winds downed <b>one</b> <b>tree</b> in the front garden, though there was no damage to the {{building}} itself. The storm surge resulted in flooding at the Washington Navy Yard. There, the marina was damaged, and some buildings and cars in low area garages were flooded. Five people were rescued from cars in flood waters during the storm, and several roads were closed due to the flooding. Throughout the district, the passage of Isabel created approximately 30,000pounds (13,600kg) of debris. Damage in Washington, D.C., totaled $125million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|On October 18, several {{thunderstorms}} {{already developed}} during the morning hours and continued to intensify during the afternoon. Just after 11:00 am EDT, one tornado in downtown Pensacola, Florida caused some extensive damage {{to the roof of}} a Baptist church as well as portions of Cordova Mall but there were no reported injuries at the Church and daycare center. During the early evenings severe weather affected the Louisville, Kentucky Metro area in which tree damage and power outage were reported throughout the area and a possible tornado at around 7:00 pm EDT near the Crescent Hill area which was later confirmed as a brief EF0. Still in the region, <b>one</b> <b>tree</b> fell over a passing car but the motorist escaped injuries although he was trapped for several minutes inside. The Louisville power authority, the LG reported as much as 2,500 homes without power mostly in St. Matthews and Crescent Hill areas. More storms rolled through much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys {{during the second half of}} the evening and overnight with more storms in Michigan.|$|E

5|$|The falling trees downed {{power lines}} and poles, causing power outages and some {{property}} damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with <b>one</b> <b>tree</b> severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{winds were}} also felt {{throughout}} Nova Scotia. Winds peaked at 70mph (115km/h) in Lockeport, the strongest winds {{observed in the}} Canadian province. In Yarmouth, the storm's gusts were clocked at 60mph (100km/h) in Yarmouth. Trees were uprooted {{as a result of}} the strong winds. <b>One</b> <b>tree</b> fell into a home in Melville Cove, damaging the home's roof. Cabins were damaged in Summerville, and the garage of a lodge in Digby was blown out. A barn and associated equipment were destroyed in Pembroke. The strong winds also blew down numerous communication lines, disrupting telecommunication services across Nova Scotia. Downed wires in Halifax caused a fire which scorched five buildings. Traffic in the city was also disrupted by the winds. In addition to infrastructure, crops were also heavily damaged. In Digby County, grain and corn plantations were damaged. Grain crops in Cumberland County also saw heavy losses. In Annapolis Valley, an important agricultural region in western Nova Scotia, 600,000barrels of apples were lost, resulting in CA$1.5million in damages. The lost apple production accounted for roughly half of the entire apple yield for the agricultural region. Despite the hurricane's rapid movement through the Canadian Maritimes, the storm still produced heavy rainfall. In Halifax, 3in (75mm) of rain was reported over the duration of the hurricane. However, 3.5in (90mm) of rain fell in Yarmouth in a 24-hour period.|$|E
