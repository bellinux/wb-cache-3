The authors of the Handbook of British Chronology Third Edition say he was named bishop of Hereford in 1056, holding the see until he resigned it in 1060, but other sources say that he merely administered the see while it was vacant, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was bishop of Hereford from 1055 to 1060.|$|E

5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney {{was so close to}} an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the idea that he was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was trying to clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E

Kirby, who notes that Bede wrote nothing that could imply that Ecgric was a Christian, in contrast to his praise of Sigeberht’s efforts to establish Christianity in East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|The helmet of {{the arms}} was not {{specified}} in the charter, but the engraver sketched out a peer's helmet on the final design, which is used. This {{is contrary to the}} heraldic rules, as a society or corporation normally has an esquire's helmet; it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule, which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> used the peer's helmet as a compliment to Lord Brouncker, a peer and the first President of the Royal Society.|$|E

5|$|Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, {{including}} {{numbers from}} France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's. The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship {{of that name}} had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, the Claimant had provided the wrong name for Ospreys captain, and the names he gave for two of Ospreys crew were found to belong {{to members of the}} crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in Ospreys log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Waddington was {{appointed}} chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled {{that there was no way}} that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in any way responsible.|$|E

5|$|Further details {{concerning}} Sejanus' fall {{are provided}} by Cassius Dio, writing nearly 200 years later in his Roman History. It appears that, when Tiberius heard to what extent Sejanus had already usurped his authority in Rome, he immediately took steps to remove him from power. However, he realised that an outright condemnation could provoke Sejanus to attempt a coup. Instead, Tiberius addressed a number of contradictory letters to the Senate, some of which praised Sejanus and his friends and some of which denounced them. Tiberius variously {{announced that he would}} arrive in Rome the next day <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was at the point of death. He stepped down as consul, forcing Sejanus to do the same and conferred an honorary priesthood upon Caligula, rekindling popular support for the house of Germanicus. The ensuing confusion was successful in alienating Sejanus from many of his followers. With the intentions of the emperor no longer clear, it was now deemed a safer course of action at Rome to withdraw from overt support to Sejanus until the matter was clearly settled.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} {{safe under}} the protection of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds that he was executed by the Zunbīl himself, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds that he was confined to a remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that he threw himself {{from the top of the}} castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, Oberscharführer Bruno Kittel {{demanded that}} Gens hand over Yitzhak Wittenberg, {{a leader of}} the FPO. Although Wittenberg was arrested, he was freed by FPO members. Gens' {{reaction}} to this was to spread word that unless Wittenberg turned himself in, the Germans would destroy the ghetto. The ghetto residents supported Gens in this dispute. On 16 July, Wittenberg turned himself in. What happened next is unclear: some sources report that Wittenberg committed suicide while in custody, possibly with a cyanide pill provided by Gens; others state that Wittenberg was poisoned by Gens then turned over to the Gestapo, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was tortured to death by the Gestapo and given a cyanide pill by Gens' second-in-command.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 303, {{following}} a series of rebellions in Melitene (Malatya, Turkey) and Syria, a second edict was published, ordering the arrest and imprisonment of all bishops and priests. In the judgment of historian Roger Rees, there was no logical necessity for this second edict; that Diocletian issued one indicates that he was either unaware the first edict was being carried out, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt it was not working {{as quickly as he}} needed it to. Following the publication of the second edict, prisons began to fillthe underdeveloped prison system of the time could not handle the deacons, lectors, priests, bishops, and exorcists forced upon it. Eusebius writes that the edict netted so many priests that ordinary criminals were crowded out, and had to be released.|$|E
5|$|Judith Quiney died by 9 February 1662, {{the day of}} her burial and a {{week after}} her 77th birthday. She outlived her last {{surviving}} child by 23years. She was buried in the grounds of Holy Trinity Church, but the exact location of her grave is unknown. Of her husband, the records show little of his later years. It has been speculated that he may have died in 1662 or 1663, when the parish burial records are incomplete, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have left Stratford-upon-Avon. He is known to have had a nephew, living in London, who by this time was holding the lease to The Cage.|$|E

Godzilla and Friday the 13th were considered, but the Predator received the most support. Artist Fernando Ruiz was at the summit and liked the premise, but did not believe it would actually be made, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be involved if it was.|$|E
