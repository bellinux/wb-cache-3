5|$|The {{international}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> was problematic. The month-long {{world tour}} encountered wide-scale anti-Chinese protests. After trouble in London involving attempts by protesters {{to put out}} the flame, the torch was extinguished in Paris the following day. The American leg in San Francisco on 9 April was altered without prior warning to avoid such disturbances, although there were still demonstrations along the original route. The relay was further delayed and simplified after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake hit western China.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} proposed route {{would have}} taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make the portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> in Taiwan appear {{to be part of}} the torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route. This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> route, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> design <b>of</b> a radio {{resource}} management scheme for relay-based systems depends on <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> and on <b>the</b> deployment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relays.</b> In addition <b>the</b> multiantenna techniques utilized {{in the system}} {{have to be taken}} into account. Therefore we introduce and motivate first <b>the</b> main properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> and <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> deployments considered in our work. The main motivation to deploy relays is to save costs while reaching a similar performance as less dense BS only deployments or to increase <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> a BS deployment cost efficiently by adding <b>relays.</b> Hence, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following design choices are motivated by cost considerations.|$|R

In 1920, the Canadian Air Board sponsored a project to conduct the first Trans-Canada flight to determine the feasibility of such flights for air mail and passenger services. Rivière du Loup to Winnipeg was flown by Leckie and Major Basil Hobbs in a Felixstowe F.3 and the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> was completed using several of the CAF's DH-9As. All aircraft were part of the Imperial Gift. Although not considered suitable for the harsh Canadian weather, the Imperial Gift aircraft soldiered on into the 1930s; the last aircraft in service, an Avro 504K, was retired in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{configuration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> tracks {{is evidence}} of the original plans to build {{an extension of the}} Queens Boulevard Line further east into Queens. The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to extend the line to Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The upper level was to be extended eastward while the lower level tracks were always intended to be relay tracks. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe outage {{probability}} and {{bit error rate}} averaged over <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>relays</b> in Nakagami- m fading channels are analyzed for full and partial relay selection (RS) schemes. This analysis considers a random number <b>of</b> <b>relays</b> caused by <b>the</b> <b>relay's</b> own on-off traffic. Based on this analysis, optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relaying</b> time is performed, and <b>the</b> optimal values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relaying</b> time are obtained. Numerical results show that there do exist locally optimal values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relaying</b> time for different system settings. For average {{outage probability}}, the optimal value increases when the threshold increases, the m parameters decrease, or partial selection is used instead of full selection. For an average bit error rate, the optimal value increases when the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases, the m parameters decrease, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>relays</b> increases, or partial selection is used instead of full selection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{practical}} {{large scale}} relay networks, {{it is often}} an unfeasible task to adapt <b>the</b> strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> to each source/sink pair communicating through the network. In this paper we consider <b>the</b> strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> as fixed and chosen in advance. In this context, it is a crucial problem for the source node transmitting information, to know <b>the</b> strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> in <b>the</b> network. Therefore we optimize <b>the</b> transmit strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source node, assuming only partial relay information knowledge, i. e., channel state information and relay strategies. We also study <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> getting complete relay information from certain <b>relays</b> only, derive <b>the</b> reduction in the problem uncertainty due to this knowledge and evaluate numerically <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network.

5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay.</b> After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in the relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{dropped the}} torch off in Bari at 12:30pm on 19 July. It was run north through several Italian cities before {{crossing}} the Simplon Pass into Brig, Switzerland on 23 July. From {{there it was}} run west until leaving the country at Perly-Certoux, and entering France at Saint-Julien-en-Genevois. The route then detours from the direct route to take in Luxembourg and into Belgium before re-entering France at Lille on 28 July, finally departing the country at Calais. HMS Bicester carried the torch across the English Channel to Dover, arriving at 8:25pm on 28 July. It travelled through several towns in the South East of England until it arrived at Wembley, where it arrived only thirty seconds late after the entire journey. That delay may have only been in the final few hundred yards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> down Olympic Way outside of Empire Stadium as {{the pressure of the}} crowds on the torch carrier and their escorts reduced the pace to walking speed. Special celebrations were held at each border crossing, and at Pierre de Coubertin's tomb in Lausanne, Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{prominent}} Western Australian businessman and politician Max Evans, Evans had a late start to his swimming career, making his debut at the Australian Championships {{in his hometown}} of Perth, aged 17. Despite placing second in the 100m breaststroke, he was not selected for Australia, and instead travelled to the United Kingdom to train under David Haller. During this period, he quickly improved his times and rose from outside the top 200 into the top 25 in the world rankings. Evans returned to Australia in 1980 and qualified for the Olympics in both the 100m and 200m breaststroke. A sprinter, he won the 100m in an Australian record time and showed a preference for shorter events, which required less training mileage. Evans gained a reputation for often doing fewer training laps than his coach asked of him. Having rebuffed Australian government pressure to boycott the Moscow Olympics in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Evans won bronze in the 100m breaststroke. His career peak came in the 4×100m medley relay, when he outsplit his opponents in the breaststroke leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay,</b> bringing Australia into contention for its eventual win, which remains the only time that the United States has not won the event at Olympic level.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of distributed generation (DG) units in distribution systems increases the fault current level, which disrupts the existing coordination time interval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protective overcurrent <b>relays.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ways for decreasing DG effects on <b>the</b> coordination <b>of</b> protective devices is re-coordination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> by installing unidirectional fault current limiter (UFCL) between the main grid (upstream network) and the microgrid (downstream network). The UFCL does not limit fault current contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upstream network when fault occurs in downstream but limits fault current contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> downstream network when fault {{occurs in the}} upstream.
