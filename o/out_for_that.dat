Meanwhile, in the men's vault, three athletes finished in joint third place and so were awarded a bronze medal each, resulting in five medals being handed <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> one event.|$|E
5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs {{had raised}} the issue of Soviet espionage as far back as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense of threat from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E

In June 2010, the Max Weinberg Big Band Tour began with a show in Red Bank, New Jersey's Count Basie Theater. Weinberg said that he was booking appearances by his big band through 2011 and that with regard to O'Brien, [...] "I literally have not thought about it. There have been no discussions.

It received critical acclaim, including a perfect 5/5 from musicOMH. NME rated it 9/10 and wrote in a review, [...] "By turns beguiling and enthralling, this is an extraordinary album." [...] Howling Bells peaked in the Top100 of the UK Albums Chart and just outside the Top50 of the Australian Albums Chart. At the time, it was the fastest selling album on the Bella Union label. The release appeared on Album of the Year lists {{for a number of}} different publications.

500|$|... "Journey to Regionals" [...] {{was filmed}} in April 2010, with fans of Glee invited through Facebook and Twitter {{to attend the}} filming of Regionals at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, California. In the episode, both Josh Groban and Olivia Newton-John reprise their roles from earlier in the season, {{appearing}} as themselves to judge the Ohio Regionals round of show choir competition alongside Sue and Rod Remington. Series creator Ryan Murphy explained: [...] "The theme of Regionals is celebrity judges. Sue is now a nationwide celebrity. And Olivia and Josh only like choirs that sing their songs, so that's funny. They {{wanted to do something}} that played against what people think about them... to play against type. So we gave them an opportunity. And it's funny to have Sue as a judge when she doesnâ€™t really know about , and she has it <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> darn Glee club." ...|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta and Kavner {{were asked}} to voice the lead roles of Homer and Marge Simpson as they were regular cast members of The Tracey Ullman Show on which The Simpsons shorts appeared. Cartwright auditioned for the part of Lisa, but found that Lisa was simply {{described}} as the [...] "middle child" [...] {{and at the time}} did not have much personality. She then became more interested in the role of Bart, so Simpsons creator Matt Groening let her try <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> part instead, and upon hearing her read, he gave her the job on the spot. Smith had initially been asked by casting director Bonita Pietila to audition for the role of Bart, but Pietila then realised that Smith's voice was too high, Smith was given the role of Lisa instead, although she almost turned it down. When the show was commissioned for a full half-hour series, Shearer joined the cast and performed multiple roles. Groening and Sam Simon asked Shearer to join the cast as they were fans of his radio show. Azaria was only a guest actor in the first season, but became permanent in season 2. He first appeared in [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", re-recording Christopher Collins's lines as Moe Szyslak. As he joined later {{than the rest of the}} cast, Groening still considers Azaria the [...] "new guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series gave early {{exposure}} to, {{and generated}} breakthrough Australian hits for, international artists including ABBA, Meat Loaf, Blondie, Boz Scaggs, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna and Michael Jackson; sometimes {{years before they}} became international stars. Meldrum made overseas trips and formed friendships with many artists, enabling Countdown to gain international exclusives. His on-screen performances were sometimes criticised for rambling and incomprehensible commentaries or interview questions. When providing an album review he would often hold the album awkwardly {{in front of the}} cameras with lights glaring off its surface making it difficult to see. In an early [...] "Humdrum" [...] segment, Meldrum told viewers to [...] "Go out and buy it" [...] when reviewing an album. Shrimpton was furious, since ABC policy prohibited direct endorsements, so [...] "do yourself a favour" [...] became Meldrum's standard recommendation. Other catchphrases that he added to the vernacular are [...] "So watch <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> one", [...] "So there you go!" [...] and [...] "A good mate of mine".|$|E

2500|$|Martin had {{not made}} a film or {{recorded}} since 1984, and Sinatra felt that the tour {{would be good for}} Martin, telling Davis, [...] "I think it would be great for Dean. Get him <b>out.</b> <b>For</b> <b>that</b> alone it would be worth doing". Sinatra and Davis still performed regularly, yet had not recorded for several years. Both Sinatra and Martin had made their last film appearances together in 1984's Cannonball Run II, a film which also starred Davis. This marked the trio's first feature film appearance since 1964's Robin and the 7 Hoods. Martin expressed reservations about the tour, wondering whether they could draw as many people as they had in the past. After private rehearsals, at one of which Sinatra and Davis had complained about the lack of black musicians in the orchestra, the tour began at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena on March 13, 1988, to a sold-out crowd of 14,500.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} 1656 that a real start on the chapel was made, when {{building}} operations began in earnest. The historical record of the construction, and the various problems that presented themselves, were recorded in a book entitled [...] "The Book of Accounts for the New Buildings, in Brasenose College, in Oxford, begun Anno Dm 1656". Discovered in the Victorian era among the College's documents, it was originally {{the work of the}} then Bursar, Mr. Houghton, who seems to have had the entire management of the business side of the undertaking in his hands. His powers were formally recognized by the College on 4 November 1657, when it is decreed that Mr. Houghton to have sole charge of [...] "finishing the new Chappell, and building a new Library upon a cloyster with buttresses ace. to ye modell and to receive such sumes of money as shall be issued <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> purpose out of the common chest for which he is to give an account to the Society once every month." ...|$|E
2500|$|A costermonger was {{a street}} seller {{of fruit and}} vegetables. The term, which derived from the words [...] (a type of apple) and , i.e. [...] "seller", came to be {{particularly}} associated with the [...] "barrow boys" [...] of London who would sell their produce from a wheelbarrow or wheeled market stall. Costermongers have existed in London {{since at least the}} 16th century, when they were mentioned by Shakespeare and Marlowe and were probably most numerous during the Victorian era, when there were said to be over 30,000 in 1860. They gained a fairly unsavoury reputation for their [...] "low habits, general improvidence, love of gambling, total want of education, disregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar slang language". Two examples of their slang are referring to potatoes as [...] "bog-oranges" [...] likely developed from the phrase [...] "Irish fruit" [...] also referring to potatoes and [...] "cool the delo nammow" [...] which means 'watch <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> old woman' with the words essentially backwards; cool (look), delo (old) and nammow (woman).|$|E

[...] At the events, the host would hire a speaker {{to speak for}} the family in the proceedings. [...] For special potlatches, a special platform would be constructed, around 10 or 15 feet high, 5 feet wide, where the host and his speaker would pile a number of blankets, either bought or made by the hosts own family, and distribute the blankets to the guest. [...] The speaker would call out names of guests, usually highly respected or high ranking, taking a blanket and throwing it <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> guest. [...] Typically a crowd would amass below, ready for the falling blankets, waiting for it to fall. [...] While the blanket came down, the other guests would have knives and spears ready to tear apart the blanket. [...] Thus, the blanket would be torn and split up into multiple pieces. [...] After attended a few potlatches, the guests would procure enough wool to construct their own blanket.
