40|$|Flash {{memory is}} {{reaching}} scaling limitations rapidly due to reduction of charge in floating gates, charge leakage and capacitive coupling between cells which cause threshold voltage fluctuations, short retention times, and interference. Many new memory technologies are being considered as alternatives to flash memory {{in an effort}} to overcome these limitations. Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistor (FeFET) {{is one of the main}} emerging candidates because of its structural similarity to conventional FETs and fast switching speed. Nevertheless, the performance of FeFETs have not been systematically compared and analyzed against other competing technologies. In this work, we first benchmark the intrinsic performance of FeFETs and other memories by simulations in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of FeFETs. To simulate realistic memory applications, we compare memories on an array structure. For the comparisons, we construct an accurate delay model and verify it by benchmarking against exact HSPICE simulations. Second, we propose an accurate model for FeFET memory window since the existing model has limitations. The existing model assumes symmetric <b>operation</b> <b>voltages</b> but it is not valid for the practical asymmetric <b>operation</b> <b>voltages.</b> In this modeling, we consider practical <b>operation</b> <b>voltages</b> and device dimensions. Also, we investigate realistic changes of memory window over time and retention time of FeFETs. Last, to improve memory window and subthreshold swing, we suggest nonplanar junctionless structures for FeFETs. Using the suggested structures, we study the dimensional dependences of crucial parameters like memory window and subthreshold swing and also analyze key interference mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work {{involves}} optical and RF (radio frequency) applications of novel microactuation and self-assembly techniques in MEMS (Microelectromechanical systems). The scaling of physical forces into the micro domain is favorably used to design several types of actuators that can provide large forces and large static displacements at low <b>operation</b> <b>voltages.</b> A self-assembly method based on thermally induced localized plastic deformation of microstructures has been developed to obtain truly three-dimensional structures from a planar fabrication process.

40|$|Electrocaloric device {{structures}} {{have been}} developed as multilayer ceramics (MLCs) based on fundamental research carried out on PMN- 8 PT bulk ceramics. Two different MLC structures were prepared with nine layers each and layer thicknesses of 86 μm and 39 μm. The influence of the device design on its properties has been characterized by microstructural, dielectric, ferroelectric, and direct electrocaloric measurement. For direct characterization two different methods, ie temperature reading (thermistor and thermocouple) and heat flow measurement (differential scanning calorimetry), were used. A comparison of results revealed a highly satisfactory agreement between the different methods. This study confirms that MLCs are promising candidates for implementation into energy-efficient electrocaloric cooling systems providing large refrigerant volume and high electrocaloric effect.

50|$|A TVS diode {{is a type}} of Zener diode, {{also called}} an {{avalanche}} diode or silicon avalanche diode (SAD), which can limit voltage spikes. These components provide the fastest limiting action of protective components (theoretically in picoseconds), but have a relatively low energy absorbing capability. Voltages can be clamped to less than twice the normal <b>operation</b> <b>voltage.</b> If current impulses remain within the device ratings, life expectancy is exceptionally long. If component ratings are exceeded, the diode may fail as a permanent short circuit; in such cases, protection may remain but normal circuit operation is terminated in the case of low-power signal lines. Due to their relatively limited current capacity, TVS diodes are often restricted to circuits with smaller current spikes. TVS diodes are also used where spikes occur significantly more often than once a year, since this component will not degrade when used within its ratings. A unique type of TVS diode (trade names Transzorb or Transil) contains reversed paired series avalanche diodes for bi-polar operation.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to make a}} dynamic system representation of a long HVAC subsea cable, to investigate the use of controlling the <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> to optimize the active power transmission of the cable. The dynamic representation is based on the simplified model presented in Variable Transmission Voltage for Loss Minimization in Long Offshore Wind Farm AC Export Cables [1]. The paper is a static analysis investigating the potential of minimizing the losses for a long HVAC cable, by using either fixed or variable voltage control. The system presented in [1] consists of an offshore wind farm (OWF) connected to a grid onshore through an AC cable. The analysis of the system only considers the cable side of the system by representing the OWF and the grid, with their respective transformers with on-line tap-changers (OLTC), as voltage sources, V 1 and V 2 respectively. This is made possible by assuming the transformers as ideal. The <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> is controlled by the voltage source V 2. The variable <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> is optimized to the produced active power from V 1. By continuously adjusting the voltage scaling to the instantaneous active power production, the operation current is kept within the operation limit of the cable. The result of the analysis is that the cable losses are minimized by controlling the <b>operation</b> <b>voltage.</b> The variable <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> is found to have the highest loss reduction. The dynamic representation of [1] made in the thesis, substitutes the transformers with OLTC, with back-to-back DC converters. The voltage regulation will then be faster. The dynamic representations for fixed and variable <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> were made in Simulink. The voltage source representing the OWF V 1, was made as a voltage source with a voltage source converter (VSC) as a control loop to control the active power output of the voltage source. The voltage source representing the grid V 2, was made as a voltage source with a fixed input for the fixed <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> model. The variable <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> model had a control loop, which adjusted the <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> based on the active power received at the grid side of the cable to create a more realistic model. It did not however continuously adjust the voltage scaling. The performance and viability of the system were investigated for several power production and fixed voltage levels. The performance was considered by calculating the cable efficiency. The viability of the system was considered by measuring the operation current and voltage to see if they were within the cable s operation limits. Most of the simulations were found to have exceeded the current limit of the cable, and none of the simulations had as high cable efficiency as in [1]. The only simulations that did not exceed the current limit was the low production levels for variable <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> and low fixed <b>operation</b> <b>voltage.</b> The low fixed <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> simulations where found to have the highest operation area for power produced and the highest cable efficiency. The difference in results between the simulations in this Thesis and [1] {{can be explained by the}} high charging currents, which suggest that the cable selected for the simulations is not equal to the one in [1]. The use of voltage control to optimize the power transmission was however found to work as the simulations showed that low operation voltages gave the highest cable efficiency for low production and high <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> gave the highest cable efficiency for high production...|$|E

30|$|The {{advantage}} of NW as a semiconducting channel in FeFET memory devices is the sensitive changes in conductance and the inherently small scale of each device, {{leading to a}} high memory device density. Single-crystalline nanowires and nanotubes often feature greater mobility and lower swing, allowing FET devices to operate at higher speed and lower power consumption. Because NW FETs function in accumulation and depletion modes, they allow lower <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> than thin-film FETs operating in inversion mode. Lower <b>operation</b> <b>voltage</b> in FeFETs can reduce the depolarization field in the ferroelectric layer and the charge trapping induced at the semiconducting/ferroelectric interface, leading to a longer memory state retention time [1, 2]. Furthermore, to form an omega-shaped-gate FeFET structure [20], the Si NW was coated with P(VDF-TrFE). Without a gate dielectric layer, the polarization of the ferroelectric layer will affect directly {{on the surface of}} the NW. This provides a more effective electric field with respect to the NW FET than the omega-shaped-gate and planar-gate FETs. FeFET devices are also expected to exhibit a lower <b>operation</b> <b>voltage,</b> higher field effect mobility, higher transconductance, and higher ION/IOFF ratio than the other devices [20].|$|E

The <b>operation</b> <b>voltages</b> of the N-SET 1 and N-SET 2 behaviors are ~− 2.5 and ~− 4  V, respectively. Both the N-SET 1 and N-SET 2 behaviors can result in hard breakdown. The statistical results of <b>operation</b> <b>voltages</b> extracted from 80 devices show that the voltage distribution of N-RESET and N-SET 1 have an obvious overlap and the voltage distribution of N-SET 2 is close to that of N-Forming. In order to reveal {{the nature of the}} CFs, the temperature dependences of the CFs after N-SET 1 and N-SET 2 behaviors were measured to compare with that of the P-Forming and N-Forming devices. The results show that the CF of N-SET 1 behavior has a similar temperature coefficient with that of P-Forming behavior, while the CF of N-SET 2 behavior has a close temperature coefficient with that of N-Forming behavior. Based on these results, we demonstrated that the N-SET 1 behavior is dominated by Cu CF reformation caused by the Cu CF overgrowth phenomenon while the N-SET 2 is related to the formation of oxygen vacancy CF. Finally, a mechanism based on the coexistence of the ECM and VCM effects is proposed to explain the two kinds of N-SET behaviors.|$|R
