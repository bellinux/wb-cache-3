The Shimer theater program produces plays complementing its curriculum, offering anyone who wants to participate the chance to do so. Recent productions have included Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest.</b> Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E

On October 4, 1896 Rüedi was unanimously elected {{a member of the}} local health resort club. He regularly participated in the meetings and made numerous proposals, e.g. the erection of an artificial toboggan run. On June 22, 1897 Rüedi suggested to introduce a street lighting.

Numerous newspaper and magazine articles, documentary films, and children's books on Gullah culture, have been produced, in addition to popular novels set in the Gullah region. In 1991 Julie Dash wrote and directed Daughters of the Dust, the first feature film about the Gullah, set {{at the turn of the}} century on St. Helena Island.

25|$|Research {{scientists}} {{are the primary}} audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make {{many of the most}} important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public.

There are also sections on books and arts. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying supplementary material on the journal's website.|$|E
25|$|Although Bellingham {{is smaller}} than {{neighboring}} metropolitan areas such as Seattle, Vancouver, or Victoria, {{the city and its}} surrounding region offer many attractions which are popular for both residents and visitors. The Whatcom Museum of History and Art sponsors exhibits of painting, sculpture, local history, and is an active participant in the city's monthly Gallery Walks which are pedestrian tours of the historic buildings of the city, offering history and art lessons for local schools and adult groups, and historic cruises on Bellingham Bay. The Bellingham Railway Museum is where one may find educational displays explaining the history of railroading in Whatcom County, as well as model trains, and a freight-train simulator. The SPARK Museum of Electrical Invention, formerly known as the American Museum of Radio and Electricity, is a unique local establishment which features a collection of rare artifacts from 1580 into the 1950s, providing educational resources about the history of electronics and radio broadcasting.

500|$|On February 4, 1819, the {{committee}} delivered its {{draft of the}} constitution and the society adopted the document, which provided that the organization should be known as the Polemic Society of Romney. The society's constitution also specified that the officers should consist of a president, secretary, and treasurer, each of whom was to be selected by a ballot vote. The constitution further stipulated that each member was to pay dues of 50 cents per month, and that the society had the authority to levy further financial contributions from its members as it deemed necessary. The funds collected were to cover the society's operating costs, and the remaining funds were to be used in purchasing books for the library. Under the constitution, the society's meetings were to be held weekly. Following each meeting's business session, a debate or other literary exercises were to be held consisting of topics <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> of the members. No political or religious discussions were to take place during the debates unless they were of an abstract nature or in general terms. Profane language and [...] "spirituous liquors" [...] were also forbidden from the society's meetings, with each offense being punishable with a fine of one dollar. The society's first elected officers were Charles T. Magill as president, William C. Wodrow as secretary, and John Temple as treasurer.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades the interplay between Services <b>of</b> <b>General</b> Economic <b>Interest</b> and the EU law of {{competition}} and State aid has shifted from near anonymity to the centre stage of political and legal debate. This reflects the apparent reorientation of the European Union’s objectives from those of a purely economic nature to ones more social and cohesion-oriented. The inclusion of Article 14 TFEU in the ‘Principles’ part of the Treaty coupled with the evolution of the European Court of Justice’s approach towards the services in question places the issue beyond purely competition law. The paper examines the concept <b>of</b> Services <b>of</b> <b>General</b> Economic <b>Interest</b> {{in the light of the}} evolution of delimitation of vertical competences and responsibilities between Member States and EU. It addresses the dynamic evolution of the legal environment <b>of</b> Services <b>of</b> <b>General</b> Economic <b>Interest</b> and tackles the issue whether this process could be regarded as the birth and development of a communautaire concept of public services...|$|R
