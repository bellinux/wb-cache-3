25|$|The {{findings}} of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment {{are not likely to be}} effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> seem to be in a no-win situation.|$|E

[...] It was soon revealed that the Zeng Jia Township had failed to reach its enforcement quotas under the one-child policy for the past two years, so it had received a [...] "yellow card" [...] warning. [...] Desiring to remove the warning, town officials decided to crack down on enforcement in June 2012.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} {{helped push}} their romance into [...] "top gear". Kate {{went to the}} police station to see Mark and they ended up kissing in front of his colleagues. McGregor called his first on-screen kiss with Brewer [...] "awkward". Mark liked Kate as she was [...] "a pretty easy-going girl who doesn't let too much get to her", but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work. He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it, but I think it's because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> and where they are in life. At one point Kate's having driving lessons, and I'm working as a detective who's moved up through the ranks quickly, so we do seem quite different in age, but it's better left unsaid I think!" [...] He added that Mark and Kate's relationship [...] "may not be the easiest of rides." ...|$|E
500|$|California has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 63 out of 100, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] based on seventeen reviews. AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung dubbed the record [...] "their best in 15 years," [...] considering it [...] "a return {{to form and}} an admirable maturation of the band's classic pop-punk sound... It's not a desperate grasp at youth and faded glory, but rather a reflective look back and an expert execution <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> best." [...] Gav Lloyd from Rock Sound wrote that [...] "Blink-182 have delivered an album that recalls everything that makes this band great and gives it all a fresh twist, {{the end result is}} California being amongst the best albums they've ever produced." [...] NME Charlotte Gunn felt California [...] "has the humour, pace, emotion and huge choruses of a classic Blink record." [...] Evan Lucy at Alternative Press felt it [...] "upbeat, hooky and, above anything else, a total blast." [...] Exclaim!s Josiah Hughes was more critical, calling it [...] "uneven and disjointed" [...] and [...] "hard to take in as one larger whole".|$|E

2500|$|Religious {{discrimination}} is valuing or treating {{a person or}} group differently because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> or do not believe or because of their feelings towards a given religion. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of the Balkans, known as the [...] "rayah" [...] or the [...] "protected flock", was discriminated against under the Ottoman Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' in order to emphasize the Christian population's inferior status {{to that of the}} Muslim rayah.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{propensity}} theorists (e.g. Ronald Giere) do {{not explicitly}} define propensities at all, but rather see propensity {{as defined by}} the theoretical role it plays in science. [...] They argue, for example, that physical magnitudes such as electrical charge cannot be explicitly defined either, in terms of more basic things, but only in terms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> (such as attracting and repelling other electrical charges). [...] In a similar way, propensity is whatever fills the various roles that physical probability plays in science.|$|E

The Claros judge upheld her request and declared: [...] "As a judge, I {{have a duty to}} declare that her right to citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore that women enjoy the same political rights as the laws grant to male citizens, with the only restrictions expressly determined such laws, because no inhabitant is deprived <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not prohibit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Information is {{presented}} through {{the design of}} digital media, engaging with multimedia to offer a multimodal principle of composition. Standard words and pictures can be presented as moving images and speech {{in order to enhance}} the meaning of words. Joddy Murray wrote in [...] "Composing Multimodality" [...] that both discursive rhetoric and non-discursive rhetoric should be examined in order to see the modes and media used to create such composition. Murray also includes the benefits of multimodality, which lends itself to “acknowledge and build into our writing processes the importance of emotions in textual production, consumption, and distribution; encourage digital literacy as well as nondigital literacy in textual practice. Murray shows a new way of thinking about composition, allowing images to be “sensuous and emotional” symbols <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> represent, not focusing so much on the “conceptual and abstract.” ...|$|E

They then proceed to have a coffee break, during which Foley's character begins pondering the point <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> [...] "We travel 250,000 light years across the universe, abduct humans, probe them anally, and release them." [...] McDonald's alien does not understand why the other is questioning the leadership of the [...] "Great Leader". Foley's alien goes on to say that in the 50 years they've been doing this, the only thing they've learned is that [...] "one in 10 doesn't really seem to mind" [...] and that he suspects their [...] "Great Leader" [...] may be [...] "just some sort of twisted ass freak". Foley argues that they should at least probe political or religious leaders instead of [...] "any idiot in a pickup truck".|$|E

6000|$|But {{the worst}} and widest {{impediment}} still remains. It is the predominance of a popular philosophy, at once the counterfeit and the mortal enemy of all true and manly metaphysical research. It is that corruption, introduced by certain immethodical aphorisming eclectics, who, dismissing not only all system, but all logical connection, pick and choose whatever is most plausible and showy; who select, whatever words can have some semblance of sense attached to them without the least expenditure of thought; in short whatever may enable men to talk <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not understand, with a careful avoidance of every thing that might awaken them to a moment's suspicion of their ignorance. This alas! is an irremediable disease, for it brings with it, not so much an indisposition to any particular system, but an utter loss of taste and faculty for all system and for all philosophy. Like echoes that beget each other amongst the mountains, the praise or blame of such men rolls in volleys long after the report from the original blunderbuss.

6000|$|Yet Herr Parish avers that, in all calculations, it {{is assumed}} that {{hallucinations}} are equally readily recalled whether impressive or not! Once more, the Report says (p. 246), 'It is not the case' that coincidental (and impressive) hallucinations are as easily subject to oblivion as non-coincidental, and non-impressive ones. The editors therefore multiply the non-coincidental cases by four, arguing that no coincidental cases (hits) are forgotten, while three out of four non-coincidentals (misses) are forgotten, or may be supposed likely to be forgotten. Immediately after declaring that the English authors suppose all hallucinations to be equally well remembered (which is the precise reverse <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> say), Herr Parish admits that the authors multiply the misses by four, 'influenced by other considerations' (p. 289). By what other considerations? They give their reason (that very reason which they decline to entertain, says Herr Parish), namely, that misses are four times as likely to be forgotten as hits. 'To go into the reason for adopting this plan would lead us too far,' he writes. Why, it is the very reason which, he says, does not find favour with the English authors! ...|$|E
