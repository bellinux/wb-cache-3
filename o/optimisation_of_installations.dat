40|$|Abstract. While current {{atmospheric}} Cherenkov <b>installations</b> consist <b>of</b> {{only a few}} telescopes each, future installations will be {{far more}} complex. Monte Carlo simulations have become an essential tool for the design and <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> such <b>installations.</b> The CORSIKA air-shower simulation code and the sim_telarray code for simulation of arrays of Cherenkov telescopes {{have been used to}} simulate several candidate configurations of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) in detail. Together with other detailed and simplified simulations the resulting data provide the basis for the ongoing <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> CTA over a wide energy range. In this paper, the simulation methods are outlined and preliminary results on a number of configurations are presented. It is demonstrated that the initial goals of the CTA project can be achieved with available technology, at least in the medium and high energy range (about 100 GeV to 100 TeV) ...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{a number}} of methods exist for the {{analysis}} of site availability and weather downtime via metocean exceedance, there is little available for the detailed analysis of holistic marine energy installation projects. Given the magnitude of expenditure relating to the <b>installation</b> phase <b>of</b> marine energy extraction it is essential that significant cost reduction is achieved in this area. This thesis presents methods {{for the analysis of}} marine operations, considering not just the at site work but the project as a whole. The methods developed consider multiple facets <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> in a geo-spatially diverse environment and utilize multiple resources, for example vessels. Consideration of not only the efficiency of work at site, but also the accessibility of the site due to vessel station keeping, mooring and transit limits is included. By considering the project in its entirety work may be scheduled in a realistic manner; including simultaneous operations and at site transit to any of multiple working locations. These methods, packaged as a whole, represent a valuable new tool for utilisation in this area. Novel application of the methods developed is demonstrated and highlights the value, importance and power of this type of analysis. Two marine energy installations are considered as case studies; the Wave Hub in south west England, and a tidal installation at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney. These applications demonstrate the knowledge which may be gained and, explicitly in the latter case, the significant cost reductions which may be achieved through the essential <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> operations using this newly developed analysis tool.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} to the <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> composite wing structures. The goal {{of this research is}} to design a wing structure, which uses passive load alleviation to reduce the aeroelastic loads acting on the wing, thus resulting in a lighter wing structure and hence a lighter aircraft. This passive load alleviation can be achieved by using the directional sti ness properties of composite materials to tailor the aeroelastic response of the wing. This inherently result in a large design freedom for the designer, making it a challenge to explore the aeroelastic design space e�ciently. Therefore a multi- delity multidisciplinary approach to the <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> a composite wing structure is proposed, which employs a two-step optimisation procedure. The rst step is the <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> the wing structure using a low- delity nonlinear aeroelastic beam model. The result <b>of</b> this <b>optimisation</b> is then used for a more detailed <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> the wing structure using a shell model coupled to doublet-lattice method aerodynamics implemented in Nastran. A comparison between the beam model and the shell model clearly shows the validity of this approach, thus making it suitable for the <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> aeroelastically tailored wingbox structures...|$|R

40|$|At a time {{of strong}} {{challenges}} for shipping in relation to economic and environmental performance, the potential of waste heat recovery {{has been identified as}} among the most important technologies to lower fuel consumption. This paper presents the comparison of four different procedures for the <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> a combined Diesel and organic Rankine cycle system with increasing attention to the ship operational profile and to the inclusion of engine control variables in the optimisation procedure. Measured data from two years of operations of a chemical tanker are used to test the application of the different procedures. The results indicate that for the investigated case study the application <b>of</b> an <b>optimisation</b> procedure which takes the operational profile into account can increase the savings <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> an organic Rankine cycle from 7. 3 % to 11. 4 % of the original yearly fuel consumption. The results of this study further show that (i) simulating the part-load behavior of the ORC is important to ensure its correct operations at low engine load and (ii) allowing the engine control strategy to be part <b>of</b> the <b>optimisation</b> procedure leads to significantly larger fuel savings than the <b>optimisation</b> <b>of</b> the waste recovery system alone...|$|R
