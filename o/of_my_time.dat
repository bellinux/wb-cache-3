25|$|As a cricketer he was {{the most}} talented player <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time,</b> a guy who had {{extraordinary}} talents in every facet of cricket. In hindsight he probably didn't reach the heights that he should have, based on his cricket ability, but the guys who played with him and against him will recognise he was a fantastic player, who was dynamic in anything he did in cricket. When he was on he was unplayable. He bowled a swinging ball, he could hit the ball a mile, throw it like a bullet and he was a fantastic catcher either close to the wicket or in the outfield – a supreme cricketer. He was a very popular person, Gus, a bit of a larrikin and very much liked by everyone. He didn't take life all that seriously, played for the enjoyment of it.|$|E
500|$|In late 1989, Henson {{entered into}} {{negotiations}} {{to sell his}} company to The Walt Disney Company for almost $150 million, hoping that, with Disney handling business matters, he would [...] "be able {{to spend a lot}} more <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> on the creative side of things." [...] By 1990, he had completed production on a television special, The Muppets at Walt Disney World, and a Disney World (later Disney California Adventure Park as well) attraction, Muppet*Vision 3D, and was developing film ideas and a television series titled Muppet High.|$|E
500|$|By the mid 1970s, Hershey concluded, [...] "I've been so {{tied up with}} David [...] {{that people}} have {{forgotten}} that I am me. I spend 50 percent <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> working with David." [...] She had, in 1974, guest-starred in a two-part episode of Carradine's television series Kung Fu. She played, {{under the direction of}} Carradine, a love interest to his character, Kwai Chang Caine, during his time at the Shaolin temple. She also appeared in two of Carradine's independent directorial projects, You and Me (1975) and Americana (1983), both of which had been filmed in 1973. Her father, Arnold Herzstein, also appeared in Americana.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{the family moved}} to another {{tenement}} block, this time in Scotstoun, and Wark's father secured employment at nearby Albion Motors. The new home accommodated a back yard in which Wark played football from the age of six. He said [...] "ootball seemed to occupy 99 per cent <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> as a youngster" [...] as he tried to emulate his brother Alex, who had become a professional at St Mirren. Wark attended Scotstoun Primary School, where he became captain of the football team. On moving to secondary school, he was selected for the Glasgow Schools representative team. [...] He also played for Drumchapel Amateurs at the under-14 level, where he was, for a period, managed by David Moyes' father, also named David.|$|E
500|$|Phil Harrison of Time Out {{said that}} [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] feels [...] "slightly anodyne despite its sweetly vicious climax." [...] Gail Mitchell of Billboard {{magazine}} {{described it as}} [...] "slick, [...] wicked". Mike Joseph of PopMatters was much less impressed, giving the song a negative review: [...] "The dreary 'Kitty Kat' {{is a waste of}} four minutes <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time.</b> Pharrell Williams, who produced this song, needs to be told that his glory days are two years behind him if not more." [...] This was somehow echoed by Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic who wrote: [...] "Pharrell's other contribution to the album is the regrettably plain 'Kitty Kat,' a slower track that gives further credence to the view that he cannot cope when thrust outside his comfort zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Its {{depiction}} of Japanese culture {{was met with}} widespread criticism, which has included suggestions of racism, with Lavigne stating: [...] "I love Japanese culture and I spend half <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> in Japan. I flew to Tokyo to shoot this video...specifically for my Japanese fans, WITH my Japanese label, Japanese choreographers AND a Japanese director IN Japan." [...] Hiro Ugaya, a Tokyo-based journalist and media commentator, assumed that [...] "images of cultures outside of one's own in mass media are always different from the reality. [...] When you're {{trying to reach the}} majority of consumers, images tend to be lowest common dominator". Nobuyuki Hayashi, also a well-known Tokyo-based tech and social media expert, commented that most of the reactions on Twitter were favorable, adding that people who blamed Lavigne for racism are non-Japanese, but society from Japan did not take it seriously.|$|E

500|$|Kiedis wrote {{much of the}} song's lyrics {{during a}} period when he felt distraught and emotionally drained. He had {{maintained}} sobriety for roughly three years and felt that this had distanced him from his bandmates. While the group worked on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante and Flea often smoked marijuana together, ignoring Kiedis, who felt that Frusciante was [...] "no longer in [...] world." [...] Driving home after rehearsal in April 1991, Kiedis thought of his heroin and cocaine addiction during his relationship with former girlfriend Ione Skye: [...] "the loneliness that I was feeling triggered memories <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> with Ione and how I'd had this beautiful angel of {{a girl who was}} willing to give me all of her love, and instead of embracing that, I was downtown with fucking gangsters shooting speedballs under a bridge." ...|$|E
500|$|Potter {{produced}} two books per annum for Warne, but by 1910 she was juggling {{the demands of}} aging parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was the only book Potter published in 1910. She wrote a friend on New Year's Day 1911: [...] "I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I spent most <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had {{originally}} been classified 4F, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, [...] "I spent most <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia.|$|E
