5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E

25|$|Ward {{was sentenced}} to 33 months in prison, {{followed}} by three years of probation, and ordered to make restitution of $200,000 {{to one of the}} defrauded insurance companies. Upon his release, Ward sued the AHSA, which had barred him from attending its sanctioned shows. He claimed that it was his right, as a private citizen and no longer a member of the AHSA, to watch his son compete in equestrian events. In 2000, the Supreme Court of New York found that argument meritless, ruling that Ward's membership in AHSA {{at the time of his}} criminal conduct, plus his promise to be bound by the organization's rules, authorized the AHSA to discipline him, regardless <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> membership status.|$|E

25|$|On 30 August, the Italian President Giorgio Napolitano {{announced}} {{he had not}} selected Berlusconi {{as one of the}} new four lifetime senators, which are granted the privileges of being a lawmaker for life with some protected legal immunity, meaning they can continue working in politics even after being convicted guilty for criminal offences that otherwise would lead to ban from serving one of the public offices. A Senate committee will begin its deliberations on 9 September, to decide if Berlusconi's public office ban shall start immediately or by the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> legislative term.

25|$|While Senator Pete Domenici had {{declared}} that he would seek re-election in New Mexico, {{he changed his mind}} and announced on October 4, 2007 that he was retiring at the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> term due to a degenerative brain disorder. Domenici normally would have been expected to win re-election easily, having won his current term with the support of two out of three New Mexico voters; however, he is to be investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for his role in firing U.S. Attorney David Iglesias. Domenici's role in the developing scandal had reduced the probability he would have been re-elected, and a SurveyUSA poll showed his approval ratings at 41%, with 54% disapproving. The potential scandal may have also contributed to his decision to leave the Senate.|$|E
25|$|After Gordon's Confederates {{surprise}} attack on Fort Stedman in the pre-dawn hour of March 25, 1865 had some initial success, a Union counterattack at the Battle of Fort Stedman recaptured the fort {{and forced the}} Confederates {{to return to their}} lines and give up their advance picket line, including much of the western part of that line in the afternoon at the Battle of Jones's Farm. The Confederates suffered about 4,000 casualties which they could ill afford. After the defeat at Fort Stedman, Lee knew that he could not detach part of his army and be able to maintain the defenses of Petersburg and Richmond.

25|$|The {{departure}} from Melbourne – {{just one year}} into a three-year deal with the club – {{was the end of}} a tumultuous period for Gleeson, who had been supporting his wife through a successful battle with breast cancer. Gleeson was left emotionally drained and on the lookout for his next professional challenge. For a time he found that challenge elsewhere, working with the Australian Football League's North Melbourne and Hawthorn football clubs as a skills coach during 2012–13. It was an interesting change of scenery and, in many ways, a year of growth for Gleeson. Under masterful coach Alastair Clarkson, Hawthorn was on the precipice of a golden era of premiership success and it was there that Gleeson learned some of the key elements <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> coaching philosophy. He learnt the importance of core sporting-team principles such as empowering players to lead a team's culture and standards.|$|E
25|$|Pearce first ran for {{agricultural}} commissioner in 1948 on the intra-party ticket of former Governor Sam Houston Jones of Lake Charles, who was handily defeated by another former governor, Earl Kemp Long. Pearce {{lost to the}} Long candidate, W. E. Anderson, a farmer from Tangipahoa Parish {{who had worked for}} more than three decades in the Agriculture Department. Another candidate in the 1948 primary was Leon Mitchell of Jonesboro in Jackson Parish, a former star track runner at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge who was unaffiliated with any gubernatorial candidate. Anderson was nominated again for a second term in 1952 but died before the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> term. At the time on friendly terms with Pearce, Long appointed Pearce to finish Anderson's term. Pearce then won a special election in 1952 and served during the term of the anti-Long Governor Robert F. Kennon of Minden.|$|E
25|$|Police interviewed Edith Grimes, who {{stated the}} man her sister knew as Frederick Hudson was {{actually}} named Frederick Nodder, who had adopted the surname Hudson as an alias, since becoming {{the subject of}} an affiliation order. Grimes described Nodder as being a brutish and squalid drunkard with poor personal hygiene and few friends, who worked primarily as a motor mechanic and lorry driver in Retford. Nodder had, Grimes stated, deserted his wife many years before he had lodged with them. However, she claimed and to be unaware <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> address, and to have not seen him for several months (this was contradicted by a neighbour of the Grimes family, who recalled seeing a lorry driver fitting Nodder's description at their home shortly after Christmas 1936). Enquiries in public houses and garages in Retford quickly led officers to the Retford haulage firm with which Nodder was employed; this firm was able to provide police with Nodder's current address on Smeath Road in the Nottinghamshire village of Hayton.|$|E

500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – {{what he describes as}} a personal experience or event. When we talk with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, we are only looking to be heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E
