5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E

5|$|As the greenstone belts were forming, volcanoes ejected tephra {{into the}} air which settled as sediments to become {{compacted}} into the greywackes and mudstones of the Knife Lake and Lake Vermilion formations. Greywackes are poorly sorted mixtures of clay, mica and quartz that may be derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier.

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{close-up}} imaging and mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries were made during Galileos primary mission. Galileo observed {{the effects of a}} major eruption at Pillan Patera and confirmed that volcanic eruptions are composed of silicate magmas with magnesium-rich mafic and ultramafic compositions. Distant imaging of Io was acquired for almost every orbit during the primary mission, revealing large numbers of active volcanoes (both thermal emission from cooling magma <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> volcanic plumes), numerous mountains with widely varying morphologies, and several surface changes that had taken place both between the Voyager and Galileo eras and between Galileo orbits.|$|E

Two Hellenistic and one Israelite stratum were identified by them on the mound. Between 1989-2000, large-scale excavations were held by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) under the direction of Prof. Amos Kloner and conducted mainly in the Lower City of Maresha, concentrating both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> on the subterranean complexes.

5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> became the second human to {{set foot on the}} Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{events are}} {{continually}} occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are {{those associated with}} micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations.

Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>and</b> these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution.

5|$|In late June, Korvettenkapitän Karl Bartenbach, {{head of the}} Flanders Flotilla, used UB-6 to test {{a theory}} that British {{defenses}} in the Straits of Dover—anti-submarine nets and mines—were not insurmountable. On the evening of 21 June, UB-6 departed Zeebrugge for a round-trip to Boulogne. UB-6 sailed past Dunkirk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> made Boulogne {{in the early morning}} of the 22nd, having to crash dive once during the voyage when discovered by a British destroyer. UB-6 immediately made the return trip and arrived safely at Zeebrugge later the same day. Three other UB I boats, , , and , soon followed with patrols in the Channel, but bad weather and fog hampered the boats and none had any success. Even though no ships were sunk during these forays into the English Channel, by successfully completing their voyages, the submarines helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover.|$|E
5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>and</b> had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals dying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>and</b> water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of the}} cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E

5|$|The {{contracted}} {{batch of}} 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, {{with plans to}} increase {{the mass of the}} CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>and</b> allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.|$|E
5|$|The game's water effects {{received}} substantial upgrades {{because of}} the large role naval battles play in The Battle for Middle-earth II. The developers endeavored to make the surface of oceans and lakes look realistic by using techniques similar to those applied in films when creating computer-generated ocean water. The digital water simulates deep ocean water by reflecting its surroundings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>and</b> wave technology was used to create large waves along coastlines to immerse the player in the game experience. Lost towns, corals, and fish were added underwater to add to the effect. Water was chosen as the first graphical component of The Battle for Middle-earth II to take advantage of DirectX 9 programmable shaders. These additions were part of an overall Electronic Arts strategy to continue the Lord of the Rings experience that began with the trilogy film series.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes {{the fact that a}} water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
