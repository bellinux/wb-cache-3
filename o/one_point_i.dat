5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

"At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> asked Ellen Page {{before we}} started shooting, ‘hat do you think Juno listens to?’ And she said [...] She went on my computer, played the songs, and I {{fell in love with}} it. Diablo and I {{discussed}} putting a Moldy Peaches song in it where the characters would sing to each other. I got in touch with Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches and she started sending me her work, which was beautiful, and that became a lot of the soundtrack." ...|$|E
500|$|Jansch's music, and {{particularly}} his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced {{a range of}} well-known musicians. His first album (Bert Jansch, 1965) was much admired, with Jimmy Page saying, [...] "At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> was absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch. When I first heard that LP, I couldn't believe it. It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing. No one in America could touch that." [...] The same debut album included Jansch's version of the Davy Graham instrumental [...] "Angie." [...] This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style. The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) The Sallyangie.|$|E

500|$|Before {{principal}} photography, {{the cast}} and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts. Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention. [...] "At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," [...] says Moore. Despite the actors wearing the same clothes for days on end, Moore told the Los Angeles Times, park personnel never appeared to notice them, save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were paparazzi harassing a celebrity family.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter {{had just}} made Dark Star but {{no one wanted to}} hire him as a director, so he assumed that he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the {{intention}} of making Escape later. After the success of Halloween, Avco-Embassy signed him and producer Debra Hill to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film {{that he was going to}} make to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, [...] "This was basically a straight action film. And at <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see." [...] He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film school days at University of Southern California who played [...] "The Shape" [...] in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Blitz {{wanted the}} film's music to be [...] "sweet {{and a touch}} melancholy and just a step out of rhythm", demonstrating Hal's sense of himself in the world, and to express his teenage angst while [...] "maintain an {{underlying}} sweetness". While writing the Rocket Science script, Blitz had been listening to indie rock band Clem Snide's music and suggested {{the use of their}} music on the soundtrack to the HBO executive producers. He contacted Clem Snide's lead singer Eef Barzelay to use some of the band's songs, but Barzelay says [...] "it just made more sense for me to write original instrumental music", and composed the incidental score himself. When choosing instruments, he tried to create sounds that would match Hal's awkwardness. [...] "I had this little ukulele that I never played... And Jeffrey [...] had gotten a little bee in his bonnet about the accordion... and then at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> started using a kazoo." [...] One of his original songs, [...] "I Love the Unknown", was chosen from the 1999 album Your Favorite Music.|$|E

500|$|Black soon {{signed with}} RCA {{at that time}} {{considered}} one of the [...] "most aggressive" [...] labels in country music. His first album, Killin' Time, was released in 1989. [...] Each song on the album was penned at least in part by Black; four of them were attributed solely to him, while the rest were collaborations with Nicholas. [...] In a departure from most other country albums, Black used his road band instead of session musicians to record Killin' Time. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one on the Billboard Country Albums chart and certified platinum in 1990. He made his debut in 1989 with the single, [...] "A Better Man", which reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in early June. This marked the first time in 14 years that a debut single by a male artist had peaked {{at the top of the}} chart. In total, five singles off of his debut album reached number one, the first time any country artist had accomplished this feat. Black won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for best newcomer in 1989. At the end of the year, his singles, [...] "A Better Man" [...] and [...] "Killin' Time" [...] place number one and number two on the year-end country singles charts. [...] It had been 36 years since another artist had claimed both top spots in a single year. Looking back at the early stages of his career, Black recalled: [...] "'At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> knew I crossed this line out of obscurity and I felt like no matter what happened from that point on I would always be remembered for [...] "Killin' Time." [...] There was this kind of mixed feeling of remorse and excitement.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Walker wrote, [...] "At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> learned Transcendental Meditation. This was 30-something years ago. It took {{me back to}} the {{way that}} I {{naturally}} was as a child growing up way in the country, rarely seeing people. I was in that state of oneness with creation {{and it was as if}} I didn't exist except as a part of everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chase {{enjoyed the}} role because it {{allowed him to}} play {{a wide variety of}} {{different}} characters. He said in an interview, [...] "I love props, like wigs and buck-teeth and glasses. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> wear an Afro and play basketball with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. There were some scenes where I didn't recognize myself." [...] The comedian enjoyed working with director Ritchie because he gave him the freedom to improvise: [...] "It all began when [...] Tim Matheson asked me what my name was. Right away, with a straight face: 'Ted Nugent'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's working {{title was}} Strawberries for Pigs, a name {{inspired}} by the reception the band's newer music received from some of their older fans. As Vanian explained, [...] "we were playing {{a lot of new}} material, and we had an audience that didn't want to hear about anything, they just wanted to hear Neat Neat Neat and New Rose nothing else. And they wanted to just smash everything. And they weren't interested in hearing music at all. So at <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> turned around and said, 'It's like giving strawberries to a fucking pig, this gig, you know?' And that stuck in our minds, and we used it".|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Welch {{appeared}} with Frank Sinatra in the detective film Lady in Cement, {{a sequel to}} the film Tony Rome (1967). She played the socialite Kit Forrest, the romantic interest of Tony Rome. Welch said later wittily that she catches the film {{from time to time}} and now realizes Kit Forrest was an alcoholic: [...] "I'm watching this movie and I'm thinking, 'What the hell has she got on?' At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> had this epiphany: 'Oh, she's an alcoholic!' I didn't know that. How could I miss that?" [...] She reportedly was so smitten with Sinatra that she forgot to act: [...] "I think I was just so enamoured with Frank Sinatra, you know. He's hypnotic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, if {{you were}} my son, I would not interfere," [...] he added gravely. [...] "I only feared your not knowing what you were about.

2500|$|Shamrock {{was portrayed}} badly on the show, feuding with his fighters and often {{appearing}} uninterested. Shamrock admitted to doing {{a poor job}} with his fighters: [...] "I failed them miserably, completely. So I {{have to figure out}} a way to get this...back in the driver's seat", Shamrock said during the show. Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> was the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion's Den fighters. My reputation doesn’t have to be spoken for or defended. The UFC and Spike TV did what they thought they needed to do for ratings, but in the end, my fans, my family and my God know exactly who I am." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peres told Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson that he {{had been}} born {{as a result of a}} blessing his parents had {{received}} from a chassidic rebbe and that he was proud of it. Peres' grandfather, Rabbi Zvi Meltzer, a grandson of Rabbi Chaim Volozhin, had a great impact on his life. In an interview, Peres said: [...] "As a child, I grew up in my grandfather's home. … I was educated by him. … My grandfather taught me Talmud. It was not as easy as it sounds. My home was not an observant one. My parents were not Orthodox but I was Haredi. At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> heard my parents listening to the radio on the Sabbath and I smashed it." [...] When he was a child, Peres was taken by his father to Radun' to receive a blessing from Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (known as [...] "the Chofetz Chaim"). As a child, Peres would later say, [...] "I did not dream of becoming president of Israel. My dream as a boy was to be a shepherd or a poet of stars." [...] He inherited his love of French literature from his maternal grandfather.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Gainsbourg and English actress Jane Birkin began a {{relationship}} {{when they met}} {{on the set of}} the film Slogan. After filming, he asked her to record the song with him. Birkin had heard the Bardot version and thought it [...] "so hot". She said: [...] "I only sang it because I didn't want anybody else to sing it", jealous at the thought of his sharing a recording studio with someone else. Gainsbourg asked her to sing an octave higher than Bardot, [...] "so you'll sound like a little boy". It was recorded in an arrangement by Arthur Greenslade in a studio at Marble Arch. Birkin said she [...] "got a bit carried away with the heavy breathing – so much so, in fact, that I was told to calm down, which meant that at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> stopped breathing altogether. If you listen to the record now, you can still hear that little gap." [...] There was media speculation, as with the Bardot version, that they had recorded live sex, to which Gainsbourg told Birkin, [...] "Thank goodness it wasn't, otherwise I hope {{it would have been a}} long-playing record." [...] It was released in February 1969. The single had a plain cover, with the words [...] "Interdit aux moins de 21 ans" [...] (forbidden to those under 21), and the record company changed the label from Philips to Fontana.|$|E

2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside."
