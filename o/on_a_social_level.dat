25|$|Acrobatic Rock'n'Roll – Popular in Europe, acrobatic rock'n'roll is popularly {{associated}} with Russian gymnasts who {{took up the}} dance, though it is popular throughout Europe today. It is a performance dance and sport rather than a social dance, though {{there are people who}} remove the acrobatic stunts to dance it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
25|$|High costs {{may also}} be a factor and {{research}} by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claimed a much lower cost methodology (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which may be suitable for some fertility treatment. At the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, the prevention and treatment of infertility was accepted into the program of action for reproductive healthcare. Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control, but also <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> <b>level</b> as well. Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations, and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues. Currently, fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little-to-no treatment is available through public health sectors. The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible. Additionally, counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment, and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well. While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations (such as sub-Saharan African countries), a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention. The lack of fertility treatment is problematic, and high birth and population rates are every reason to implement treatment options rather than reject them.|$|E

It is intended {{to fill a gap}} in both disciplines: on the one hand, documentary studies need to discuss contemporary portrayals of disability, practices of disabled filmmakers and industry policies that determine access, inclusion and representation; on the other hand, disability studies need to adopt more explicit methodologies that explore film texts, authorship and spectatorship in order to assess the current situation of disability in the television and independent documentary sector. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> more <b>social</b> <b>level,</b> the purpose of this volume is to address the medial construction of disability and reduce ‘otherness’ as a phenomenon of cultural stigmatisation...|$|R

50|$|It is {{hypothesised}} that repression may be {{one method}} used by individuals to cope with traumatic memories, by pushing them out of awareness (perhaps as an adaptation via psychogenic amnesia) to allow a child to maintain attachment to a person on whom they are dependent for survival. Researchers have proposed that repression can operate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> <b>level</b> as well. Psychogenic amnesia, now renamed dissociative amnesia, is found to increase in incidence after psychologically traumatic events such as war and natural disaster, {{which is consistent with}} the repression hypothesis.|$|E
40|$|The {{individual}} rights and freedoms of man must not be consigned to possibilities {{of the human mind}} to experience ideas, thoughts and convictions only within oneself. Humanising modernity precisely has the task to broaden the frontiers of the mind and spread them into the domain of freedom of opinion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> political, <b>social</b> <b>level.</b> Each person has to feel safe and {{has to be able to}} speak freely about any subject under the sun all over the world. At the same time, a person has to be able to resist any behaviour or action imposed by ‘authority’ that goes against a universal secular morality. Following this definition universality and individualism are a logical combination, and are therefore diametrically opposed to fundamentalism and extremism, and also to those trends within conservatism, communitarism and nationalism that wish to subjugate human freedom to tradition, the community or the people...|$|R

40|$|Privacy law {{relies on}} the {{argument}} that consent does not entail any relevant impediments for the liberty of the consenting individual. Challenging this argument, we experimentally investigate whether consent to the publication of personal information in cyberspace entails self-coercion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> norm <b>level.</b> Our {{results suggest that the}} monetary benefits from consent constitute a price that people are willing to accept for increased compliance with social norms. Providing people with a prior consent option is sufficient to generate chilling effects (i. e., a reduction of norm-deviant behavior). However, nudging people towards potential publicity does not increase the value they place on privacy. We also test how the default design of the right to deletion of personal information (right to be forgotten) affects chilling effects and privacy valuations. Surprisingly, the right to be forgotten does not reduce chilling effects. Moreover, individuals tend to stick with the status quo of permanent information storage...|$|R
