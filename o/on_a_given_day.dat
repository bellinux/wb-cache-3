5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day.</b> Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E
5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day,</b> the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E

5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day.</b> This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E

25|$|Tides are {{commonly}} semi-diurnal (two high waters and two low waters each day), or diurnal (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day</b> are typically {{not the same}} height (the daily inequality); these are the higher high water and the lower high water in tide tables. Similarly, the two low waters each day are the higher low water and the lower low water. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the equator.|$|E
25|$|Much {{research}} has been done on the foraging behavior of the red harvester ant. Three types of workers are most involved in the foraging process: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day,</b> nest patrollers emerge first from the nest to assess the safety and profitability of foraging. The colony gets the majority of its water from the metabolism of the fats in seeds. If food is scarce, or if it is a particularly hot day, the energy and water benefits of foraging may be outweighed by its energy and water costs. In this case, the colony may be forced to rely on its extensive food stores. Seeds may be stored in the nest for months or even several years.|$|E
25|$|Probability {{distributions}} {{are generally}} {{divided into two}} classes. A discrete probability distribution (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is discrete, such as a coin toss or a roll of dice) can be encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes, known as a probability mass function. On the other hand, a continuous probability distribution (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range (e.g. real numbers), such as the temperature <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day)</b> is typically described by probability density functions (with the probability of any individual outcome actually being 0). The normal distribution is a commonly encountered continuous probability distribution. More complex experiments, such as those involving stochastic processes defined in continuous time, may demand the use of more general probability measures.|$|E

30|$|There {{are three}} {{essential}} difficulties in constructing an arbitrage-free option price function from the available bid-ask quotes. First, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> trading <b>day,</b> the bid-ask quotes of <b>an</b> option contingent <b>on</b> <b>an</b> underlying asset are known {{only for a}} limited number of unevenly distributed strike prices. Second, high bid-ask spreads are observed for the options with the strike price far from the current underlying asset price which makes finding the right price more challenging. Third, the observed quotes are not always free from an arbitrage opportunity. It is crucial to have an option price function which does not allow for any arbitrage, to avoid any mispricing.|$|R

500|$|Although {{the tour}} {{was listed as}} co-sponsored by MTV, the group decided against {{explicit}} corporate sponsorship; band members, especially drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., were uncertain that the tour would be profitable.

In order to defray the heavy expenses of the Pacific shows, U2 asked for large guarantees from local promoters up front, rather than sharing the financial burden as they had in the past.

500|$|Rejewski studied these related {{pairs of}} letters. For example, {{if there were}} four {{messages}} that had the following indicators on the same day: BJGTDN, LIFBAB, ETULZR, TFREII, then {{by looking at the}} first and fourth letters of each set, he knew that certain pairs of letters were related. B was related to T, L was related to B, E was related to L, and T was related to E: (B,T), (L,B), (E,L), and (T,E). If he had enough different messages to work with, he could build entire sequences of relationships: the letter B was related to T, which was related to E, which was related to L, which was related to B (see diagram). This was a [...] "cycle of 4", since it took four jumps until it got back to the start letter. Another cycle on the same day might be AFWA, or a [...] "cycle of 3". If there were enough messages <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day,</b> all the letters of the alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes. The cycles would be consistent for one day, and then would change to a different set of cycles the next day.

40|$|An {{automatic}} {{process is}} developed {{to determine the}} normal condition regain time (NCRT) using the traffic flow data for <b>a</b> <b>given</b> snow event. To reflect the different traffic flow behavior during day and night time periods, two types of the normal conditions are defined for each detector station. The normal condition for day time is defined with the average speed-density patterns under dry weather conditions, while the time-dependent average speed patterns are used for representing night time periods. In particular, the speed-density functions for the speed recovery and reduction periods were calibrated separately for <b>a</b> <b>given</b> location to address the well-known traffic hysteresis phenomenon. The resulting NCRT estimation process determines the NCRT as {{the time when the}} speed level <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> snow <b>day</b> recovers to the target level of the normal recovery speed at the corresponding density for the day time periods. The sample application results with the snow routes in Twin Cities, Minnesota, show the promising possibilities for the estimated NCRT values to be used as the reliable operational measures, which could address the subjectivity and inconsistency issues associated with the current bare-lane regain times determined through visual inspections...|$|R
