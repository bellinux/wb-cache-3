5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more <b>occupants,</b> and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the <b>occupant(s)</b> of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the <b>occupants</b> (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E

He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could.

Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's <b>occupants</b> refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the <b>occupants</b> had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish an in-depth understanding of task-related <b>occupant</b> behaviors toserve {{as the basis for the}} design of an occupant-building interaction interface. Building simulations arefrequently used to design buildings and predict energy performance. Yet, all of these assumptions are relatedto <b>occupant</b> behavior and interactions with the building. In an occupant-controlled environment, anunderstanding of the <b>occupant</b> decision-making process must be represented in the simulation task lists. Current task lists assume general <b>occupant</b> behaviors based on averages, and lack the details required for thisunderstanding. This paper looks to strike a balance between simplicity and complexity in the generation oftask lists to establish a process for developing an understanding of <b>occupant</b> behavior at a greater level ofdetail than current practice. A contextual task analysis questionnaire characterizes <b>occupant</b> behavior toprovide the link between the building, <b>occupant,</b> and task. Generation of a sample task list demonstrates howa detailed understanding of task-related <b>occupant</b> behaviors can be effectively used as the basis of anoccupant-building control scheme...|$|R

This thesis develops aframework for evaluating sources of <b>occupant</b> presence data for use in energy management. Theproject starts with a classification of potential <b>occupant</b> data sources using characteristicsrelevant to energy management, such as spatial and temporal granularity.

As a practical assessment of this correlationframework several <b>occupant</b> data sources were evaluated in field studies at two office sites inNorthern California. At one site purpose-built data sources were installed at workstations whilethe other relied on existing, found, network-based data sources.

In view of growing concerns {{on the effectiveness of}} building designs, in terms of space utilization, equipment sizing, energy performance and consumption, <b>occupant</b> loads have been specified in some building regulations, design guides and codes of practice. However, an <b>occupant</b> load would be varied {{from time to time and}} difficulties would be encountered in determining it to certain accuracy at the building design stage.

The obtained evaluation result indicates that both the blended Markov chain model and the closest distance Markov chain achieved similar performance with the Jensen Shannon metric while the blended Markov chain model achieved better performance for other metrics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{estimation}} of <b>occupant</b> injury risk at crash accident {{is one of}} the most important assessments for the vehicle crashworthiness performance. The design of safety devices such as <b>occupant</b> restraining system also depend on the kinematics of <b>occupant</b> and its injury risk. The real world in-depth accident investigation provides detailed and realistic information of vehicle damage and <b>occupant</b> injury as well as the accident conditions. This paper introduces a statistical analysis of NASS/CDS database and domestic accident data to correlate speed change, vehicle damage extend, and <b>occupant</b> injury at frontal crash. The maximum crush extend shows a linear relationship with the effective impact speed. The injury risks of the <b>occupant</b> with and without restraining were also respectively quantified with the crush extend. This result can be effectively used for the emergent rescue of crash victims with automatic crash notification system...|$|R
