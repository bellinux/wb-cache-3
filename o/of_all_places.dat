5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>places.</b> A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E

25|$|Since 1999 {{there is}} a Tour of Flanders for cyclotourists, {{organized}} annually {{on the day before}} the professional event. Cycling fanatics can ride the entire 250km course starting on Bruges' city square, but most favour one of the shorter distances of 127km or 71km, which starts and finishes in Oudenaarde. Because of its growing success, the number of participants has been restricted to 16,000 in recent years, in order to secure riders' safety on the roads. Tickets are usually sold out months before the race and half <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>places</b> are assigned to non-Belgian participants.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} paper, the algorithm is presented more formally using a substitution style instead {{of side effects}} in the method above. In the latter form, the side effect invisibly takes care <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>places</b> where a type variable is used. Explicitly using substitutions not only makes the algorithm hard to read, because the side effect occurs virtually everywhere, but also gives the false impression that the method might be costly. When implemented using purely functional means or {{for the purpose of}} proving the algorithm to be basically equivalent to the deduction system, full explicitness is of course needed and {{the original}} formulation a necessary refinement.|$|E
25|$|Even if the {{expression}} > always evaluates to true at run-time, most type checkers will reject {{the program as}} ill-typed, because it is difficult (if not impossible) for a static analyzer to determine that the else branch will not be taken. Conversely, a static type checker will quickly detect type errors in rarely used code paths. Without static type checking, even code coverage tests with 100% coverage {{may be unable to}} find such type errors. The tests may fail to detect such type errors, because the combination <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>places</b> where values are created and all places where a certain value is used must be taken into account.|$|E

25|$|In December 1999, in {{response}} to strong criticism of the Ottoman decree, President Mubarak issued a decree making the repair <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>places</b> of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code. The decree is significant symbolically because it places churches closer to an equal footing with mosques before the law. The practical impact of the decree has been to facilitate significantly church repairs; however, Christians report that local permits still are subject to security authorities' approval. The approval process for church construction continued to be time consuming and insufficiently responsive to {{the wishes of the}} Christian community. As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{energetic}} {{reforms and}} personal popularity among the midshipmen, Holloway's three-year tour as superintendent ultimately was too brief {{to reverse the}} Naval Academy's entrenched cultural bias against academic achievement. A more durable legacy was the series of yawl races Holloway initiated to promote seamanship and competitive sailing, dubbed the Holloway trophy races after the award for the winning midshipman skipper. Holloway also addressed the dismal living conditions of the enlisted men based at the Academy by upgrading their quarters from trailer parks to a village of Wherry housing units {{on the north shore}} of the Severn River. He declared that a midshipman's first lesson must be concern for enlisted men's welfare and that Annapolis <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>places</b> must set the example.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011 the Japanese Ministry of Science {{launched}} a phone hotline {{to deal with}} concerns about radiation exposure outside Fukushima Prefecture. Concerned Japanese citizens had been walking with Geiger-counters through their locality in search <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>places</b> with raised radiation levels. Whenever a site was found with a radiation dose at one meter above the ground more than one microsievert per hour and higher than nearby areas, this should be mentioned at the hotline. One microsievert per hour is the limit above this topsoil at school playgrounds would be removed, subsidized {{by the state of}} Japan. Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. When radiation levels would remain more than one microsievert higher than nearby areas even after the cleaning, the ministry offered to help with further decontamination. On the website of the ministry a guideline was posted on how to measure radiation levels in a proper way, how to hold the dosimeter and how long to wait for a proper reading.|$|E

500|$|From Maiorescu, Filitti {{borrowed}} the essential sociological concept of [...] "forms without content", criticizing all modernization {{which did not}} take into account local realities, writing: [...] "After seven decades of bourgeois forms, without a bourgeoisie, with all that maelstrom of laws and regulations, which has grown to cover 20,000 pages , the tally shows that [...] the villages <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>places</b> have registered no profit, although [...] Romania is, at heart, nothing but one giant village." [...] In his post-Junimist studies, Filitti angrily noted that the PNL regime had only increased the ranks of the bureaucracy (and implicitly enlarged their political machine), perpetuating etatism. He proposed measures to counter this trend by encouraging a [...] "rural bourgeoisie", [...] "self-reliant", determined to reemerge [...] "from the darkness and routine" [...] of country life, and, in time, capable of supporting a national industry.|$|E
