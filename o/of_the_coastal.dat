5|$|Following {{his service}} in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he {{returned}} to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to Cyprus. At the time, the Cyprus Emergency was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastal</b> towns of Paphos and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against EOKA guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who were motivated by the money they would receive to fight them.|$|E

5|$|Historians like Milcíades Peña {{consider}} this historical {{period of the}} Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastal</b> cities was destined to overseas markets. Rodolfo Puiggrós consider it instead a feudalist society, based on work relations such as the encomienda or the slavery. Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but an hybrid system result of {{the interaction of the}} Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, still living in the prehistory.|$|E
5|$|In Belize, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the entire country at 0000UTC on October12. It was discontinued about nine hours later. The Government of Belize suspended school classes, as the buildings were being used as storm shelters. Voluntary evacuations were recommended for residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastal</b> cayes. A small craft warning was declared along the coast and advised marines to take precautions. At Punta Negra, the National Guard of Belize evacuated residents on October13. However, no impact was reported in Belize.|$|E

5|$|Takalik Abaj was reoccupied at the {{beginning}} of the Middle Preclassic. This was probably by Mixe–Zoquean inhabitants, as evidenced by the plentiful Olmec-style sculpture at the site dating to this period. The construction of public architecture had probably begun by the Middle Preclassic; the earliest structures were made of clay, which was sometimes partially burned in order to harden it. Ceramics from this period belonged to the local Ocosito tradition. This ceramic tradition, although it was local, showed strong affinities with the ceramics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastal</b> plain and foothills of the Escuintla region.|$|E

5|$|The Mirabello group {{engaged the}} Austro-Hungarian cruisers at 07:00, but were heavily outgunned, and instead {{attempted}} to shadow the fleeing cruisers. At 07:45, Rear Admiral Acton's ships encountered the destroyers Csepel and Balaton. After 20 minutes, the Italian destroyers {{were able to}} close {{the distance to the}} Austro-Hungarian ships; the two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from Csepel struck Aquila and disabled the ship's boilers. By this time, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers were under the cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastal</b> batteries at Durazzo, and were able to make good their escape.|$|E

The northwestern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastal</b> strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El Despoblado ("The Unpopulated"); it is generally referred to now as the Isthmus Coast Region (Spanish: Istmo-Costa).|$|E
