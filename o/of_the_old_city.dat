5|$|In {{the center}} of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city {{consists}} of eight quarters, {{laid out in a}} mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh — the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>city,</b> whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey.

5|$|Tel Aviv {{gained in}} status, while Haifa {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} the role as regional capital. The opening of Ashdod as a port exacerbated this. Tourism shrank when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing Tiberias as a tourist centre. Nevertheless, Haifa's population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration from the former Soviet Union boosted the population by a further 35,000.

5|$|Arafat's {{first visit}} to Jerusalem came when his father, unable to raise seven {{children}} alone, sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother's family in the Moroccan Quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>City.</b> They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them {{to be taken care}} of by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; when he died in 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E
5|$|The 12th SS Panzer Division (by {{the end of}} {{the battle}} the division's {{infantry}} strength had been reduced to that of a battalion)—claimed over the course of two days to have destroyed 103 British and Canadian tanks for the loss of 20. On entering Caen the Anglo-Canadian troops found it in ruins, with four-fifths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>City</b> reduced to rubble by the 7 July bombings. The debris that choked the streets made it almost impossible for British armour to manoeuvre through the northern half of the city, preventing Second Army from exploiting I Corps's success. Without possession of the terrain flanking the south of the city, no further gains could be made within Caen so by mid-afternoon on 9 July, Operation Charnwood was over.|$|E

Dhaka {{is also home to}} over 300,000 Bihari refugees, who are descendants of migrant Muslims from eastern India during 1947 and settled down in East Pakistan. The correct {{population is}} ambiguous; although official figures estimate at least 40,000 residents, it is estimated that there are at least 300,000 Urdu-speakers in all of Bangladesh, mostly residing in refugee camps in Dhaka.|$|E
