In 1986, the U.S. Congress <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Technology {{transfer}} {{between academic}} institutions and private industry represents an important means for {{growth in the}} economy {{as well as an}} important and growing revenue stream for universities. Still, as a relatively new phenomenon in the United States (mainly dating back to the 1980 passage of the Bayh-Dole Act) many questions remain concerning the optimal level of institutional support to be provided by university <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> transfer. This study investigated marketing practices employed by successful (in terms of licensing revenues earned) institutional <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> transfer. In addition, this study investigated decision-making about which new technology to patent and whether profitability and benefit to humanity factored into the decisions. ^ The directors (or a director 2 ̆ 7 s designee) <b>of</b> institutional <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> transfer were interviewed via semi-structured interviews, and the common factors related to technology transfer success were used to generate a comparative perspective on academic technology transfer. In particular, it was discovered that the formulas for the faculty share of royalty income varied widely and highly successful institutions had generous royalty sharing formulas. Also, while the combined list of marketing services offered by institutional <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> transfer is impressive, most of the institutions surveyed were actively working to expand their marketing efforts. ^ When considering new inventions or technology for patenting, an overwhelming majority <b>of</b> the top <b>technology</b> transfer institutions cited commercial potential as the main criteria. Further, commercial potential was considered analogous to public benefit. As a related finding, the mission <b>of</b> making <b>technologies</b> available to society was growing in importance. ^ In the area of innovations, the use of collaboration or partnerships to bundle intellectual property for the purposes of creating more salable or valuable technology was becoming more widely practiced. ^ Finally, as evidenced by their contacts with the institutional <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> transfer, potential new faculty hires were becoming increasingly interested in factoring in institutional support for technology transfer in advance of accepting a new academic position. ...|$|R
