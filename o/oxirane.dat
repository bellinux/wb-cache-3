5|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism for the}} Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the carbonyl or imine group. A negative charge is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} step, {{and usually}} the last, in {{the synthesis of}} β-blockers consists of adding a propanolamine side chain. This can be done following two paths which both involve alkylation of an appropriate phenoxide with epichlorohydrin (ECH). The first way is shown as the upper way in figure 5. It consists of phenoxide reacting at the <b>oxirane</b> and resulting in an alkoxide, that displaces the adjacent chloride {{to form a new}} epoxide ring. The second way is shown as the lower route in figure 5. It consists of displacement of the halogen directly with a SN2 reaction to give the same glycidic ether. When following both pathways, the central chiral carbon preserves its configuration, which is an important part to consider when synthesizing enantiomerically defined drugs. The ring opening of the epoxide ring in glycidic ether is done with an appropriate amine, such as isopropyl amine or tert-butylamine, and leads to the aryloxypropanolamine compound that consist of a secondary amine. This amine is typically known as the structural requirement for the β-adrenergic blocking activity.|$|E

40|$|Recessive Stargardt's macular {{degeneration}} is a blinding disease of children caused by mutations in the ABCA 4 (ABCR) gene. Mice with a knockout mutation in abcr accumulate toxic lipofuscin pigments in ocular tissues, similar to affected humans. The major fluorophore of lipofuscin is the bis-retinoid, N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A 2 E). In the current study, {{we sought to}} define the effect of increasing light on A 2 E accumulation. We crossed the abcr–/– mutation onto an albino background. The retinoid profiles in albino mice indicated higher retinal illuminance than in pigmented mice exposed to similar ambient light. Unexpectedly, A 2 E levels were not higher in the albino mice. Also, A 2 E levels in abcr–/– mice reared under cyclic light at 30, 120, or 1, 700 lux were similar. Thus, increased retinal illuminance was not correlated with higher A 2 E. A 2 E {{has been shown to}} undergo light-dependent oxidation to yield a series of A 2 E epoxides or <b>oxiranes.</b> These <b>oxiranes</b> react with DNA in vitro, suggesting a potential mechanism for A 2 E cytotoxicity. We analyzed ocular tissues from abcr–/– mice for A 2 E <b>oxiranes</b> by mass spectrometry. Unlike A 2 E, the <b>oxiranes</b> were more abundant in albino vs. pigmented abcr–/– mice, and in abcr–/– mice exposed to increasing ambient light. These observations suggest that both the biosynthesis of A 2 E and its conversion to <b>oxiranes</b> are accelerated by light. Finally, we showed that the formation of A 2 E <b>oxiranes</b> is strongly suppressed by treating the abcr–/– mice with Accutane (isotretinoin), an inhibitor of rhodopsin regeneration...|$|R
