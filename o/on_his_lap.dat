5|$|A {{male figure}} {{depicted}} holding certain {{objects such as}} a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held {{in any of the}} icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his ten avataras, which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar walking over a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow herder playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, lifting a hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (Vamana), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).|$|E
5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Parvati (called Gauri here) is {{described}} as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when she saw her own reflection in the crystal-like breast of Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara. Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati's jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva's locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b> To pacify Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.|$|E
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

5|$|Three {{camera angles}} were used during Lorne's {{scene in the}} F-302. To save costs, one of the camera angles was {{operated}} by Kavan Smith himself, who held it <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b> Elsewhere, the producers {{wanted to make the}} control chair rotate as Sheppard flies the city to make it different than any other actions involving the control chair. A stunt {{towards the end of the}} episode was used where Weir gets thrown after the beam grazes the tower. The stunt was not originally approved by the producers. A stuntwoman doubled Higginson as Weir during the sequence. The scene was rehearsed several times before filming the actual sequence. During the actual sequence, the stuntwoman wore a plastic mask to prevent the flying glass from injuring her face.|$|E
5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII observation post for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding the eruption. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post trailer with a notebook <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> smiling.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version of}} the legend depicts Vithoba {{appearing}} before Pundalik as the five-year-old Bala Krishna (infant Krishna). This version is found in manuscripts of both Puranas, Prahlada Maharaj, and the poet-saints, notably Tukaram. The remaining {{version of the}} Pundalik legend appears in Sridhara and as a variant in the Padma Purana. Pundalik, a Brahmin {{madly in love with}} his wife, neglected his aged parents as a result. Later, on meeting sage Kukkuta, Pundalik underwent a transformation and devoted his life to the service of his aged parents. Meanwhile, Radha, the milkmaid-lover of Krishna, came to Dwarka, the kingdom of Krishna, and sat <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b> Radha did not honour Rukmini, the chief queen of Krishna, nor did Krishna hold Radha accountable for the offence. Offended, Rukmini left Krishna and went to the forest of Dandivana near Pandharpur. Saddened by Rukmini's departure, Krishna searched for his queen and finally found her resting in Dandivana, near Pundalik's house. After some coaxing, Rukmini was pacified. Then Krishna visited Pundalik and found him serving his parents. Pundalik threw a brick outside for Krishna to rest on. Krishna stood on the brick and waited for Pundalik. After completing his services, Pundalik asked that his Lord, in Vithoba form, remain on the brick with Rukmini, in Rakhumai form, and bless His devotees forever.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they {{pull up to the}} front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her to try to convince them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car came}} back in on lap 32, with Rosberg leading the field at the flying restart, quickly pulling out a two-second {{advantage}} over Hamilton. Sergio Pérez was {{the winner of the}} restart, moving up three places into 11th and moving up another position several laps later. On lap 39, Button moved ahead of Felipe Nasr into seventh position. After keeping the gap at around two seconds for a number of laps, a mistake by Rosberg saw Hamilton close back up to him, allowing him to use the drag reduction system to attempt an overtake manoeuvre. Several drivers decided to change tyres for a second time around lap 50, including Valtteri Bottas on lap 52, while Nico Hülkenberg took his third stop a lap before, serving a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pitlane in the process. On lap 55, Hamilton {{was the first of the}} leading duo to come in for a pitstop, followed by Rosberg a lap later. A quicker stop for Rosberg and a mistake by Hamilton <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> after pitting saw Rosberg emerge from his stop ahead. Verstappen was in the lead, soon followed closely by the two Mercedes drivers. On lap 58, Räikkönen overtook Ricciardo for fourth place, while Verstappen was staying in the lead with soft compound tyres he fitted on lap 15. He lost the lead to Rosberg however on lap 61, with Hamilton getting past him as well soon after. As the Mercedes duo battled for the race win, several drivers retired in the closing stages of the race, including Hülkenberg and Massa. Räikkönen was closing in to Verstappen in third, while Pascal Wehrlein edged closer to Bottas in tenth place as well. On the last lap, Hamilton attempted to overtake Rosberg into turn two. Hamilton went to the outside but Rosberg turned into the corner late on the inside and both cars touched, damaging Rosberg's front wing and pushing Hamilton off the track. They almost touched again as Hamilton rejoined the track. Hamilton eventually got ahead into turn three as Rosberg nursed his damaged car to the finish line. He was relegated to fourth position as both Verstappen and Räikkönen moved past him over the course of the lap. Further behind, Pérez retired, elevating Wehrlein into the last point-scoring position in tenth.|$|E

When his father gave him a Silvertone guitar, his small thumb and fingers were too short to make it around the neck, so he played it <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> like the Dobro.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing {{pediment}} on {{the southern}} library shows Śiva seated on the summit of Mount Kailāsa, his mythological abode. His consort Umā sits <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> and clings anxiously to his torso. Other beings are also present {{on the slopes of}} the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise men and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Rāvaṇa. He is shaking the mountain in its very foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise men and mythological beings discuss the situation or pray. According to the legend, Śiva stopped Rāvaṇa from shaking the mountain by using his toe to press down on the mountain and to trap Rāvana underneath for 1000 years.|$|E
25|$|Adrian Quaife-Hobbs locked his tyres <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> {{and took}} eighth. Bird {{improved}} {{late in the}} session to secure ninth and Frijns rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Calado was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten as his best time was 1.451 seconds slower than Leimer's pace. However he was demoted ten places on the grid for causing an accident in the previous round {{of the season in}} Sepang. Trummer thus moved into eleventh and Palmer started from twelfth. The next two positions on the grid were filled by Cecotto and Abt. Sergio Canamasas set the sixteenth-fastest time but was sent {{to the back of the}} grid after being adjudged by the race stewards to have deliberately forced Kevin Ceccon off the track while attempting to pass him after qualifying ended. Kevin Giovesi was also penalised after the stewards ruled that he impeded Cecotto between the ninth and tenth turns and dropped three places on the grid. Mitch Evans was the only driver to be affected by problems as his car was affected by electrical problems and consequently pulled off into one of the track's run-off areas. This meant Evans was restricted to starting from sixteenth. The rest of the field lined up as Ceccon, Leal, René Binder, Jake Rosenzweig, Nathanaël Berthon, Pål Varhaug, Rio Haryanto and Daniël de Jong.|$|E

25|$|Friday evening's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times {{determined the}} starting {{order for the}} first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. In contrast to previous years, qualifying was held in night time conditions, the first such occurrence in the GP2 Series. The track was less dusty {{than it had been}} in practice, and multiple drivers stood in pole position throughout the duration of the half hour session. Palmer clinched his first pole position of the season and the second of his GP2 Series career with a time of one minute and 38.865 seconds. He flat spotted his first set of tyres and was aware with the second set equipped he would challenge for the pole position. Palmer was joined on the grid's front row by Vandoorne who recorded a lap three-hundredths of second slower than his rival. Vandoorne was temporarily investigated by the stewards for exceeding track limits at turn thirteen, but no action was prompted. Abt took third having been unable to improve <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> time. Richelmi improved towards the end of the session and secured fourth. Haryanto took fifth ahead of sixth-placed Stefano Coletti. Early pace setter Evans fell once the field bettered their times and managed seventh.|$|E
25|$|Lotterer in the No. 8 Audi was fastest on the car's first timed lap and {{remained}} quickest {{with an average}} time of one minute and 39.444 seconds to clinch the team's second pole position of the season. The car was joined on the grid's front row by the sister Audi of di Grassi, Jarvis and Duval. Jarvis had his fastest time revoked after spinning at the NGK chicane late in qualifying because he had violated track limits. Porsche's No. 1 vehicle took third with Webber and Timo Bernhard behind the wheel; Webber was unable to improve <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> time, misjudged his braking point and went across the NGK chicane, while Bernard was delayed by LMP2 vehicles on both his laps. They were ahead of the team's second entry, driven by Lieb and Jani, and both Toyota cars took fifth and sixth. Lieb had no electrical boost on his first lap, while on his second attempt, he braked early for the chicane. Davidson attributed his car's position to having one timed lap and being delayed by traffic, while Sébastien Buemi stated {{it was due to}} Toyota placing their focus on the race which compromised their qualifying performance. Sarrazin was unable to push hard because of the damp track. The two Rebellion cars rounded out the LMP1 qualifiers in seventh and ninth; they were separated by the No. 4 ByKolles Racing car of Simon Trummer, Oliver Webb and Pierre Kaffer.|$|E

500|$|Pee-wee's small glen plaid suits seemed ridiculous {{during the}} 1980s, {{but since the}} late 1990s have made him a [...] "style icon", with fashion houses and {{designers}} like Christopher Bailey, Ennio Capasa, Miuccia Prada, Viktor & Rolf, and Thom Browne creating tightly cut suits with high armholes and short trousers that have been compared to Pee-wee's. In early 2007 Nike released a collection of Nike SB sneakers called [...] "Fallen Heroes". The collection was loosely inspired by Milli Vanilli, MC Hammer, Vanilla Ice, and Pee-wee Herman. Pee-wee's sneakers use a gray and white color scheme with red detail, with an illustration on the insole {{of a man in}} a suit sitting alone in a theatre with his hand <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> suggesting Reubens' 1991 theatre arrest.|$|E
500|$|Brown also {{acknowledges}} significant {{debts to}} Jack Jackson's historical comics, Hergé's The Adventures of Tintin, and the extremely exaggerated style of Larry Gonick's Cartoon History of the Universe. [...] He says {{he referred to}} Jack Hamm's How to Draw Animals when drawing the horses that appear frequently throughout the book, which were rendered running with their legs splayed, as an artist may have depicted them {{in the days before}} the influence of Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of bodies in motion. [...] Brown drew each of the 1325 panels separately on watercolour paper on a block of wood he placed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> in lieu of a drawing table, which allowed him seamlessly to rearrange, insert, and delete panels as he saw fit. [...] The drawings were finished using both a thin ink brush (no larger than size 0) and dip pen with a Hunt 102 nib and black ink.|$|E

Above him is inscribed a quote from Psalm 33 reading [...] "Ipse dixit, et facta sunt: ipse mandāvit, et creāta sunt"For he spake and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. The Earth is encapsulated in a transparent sphere recalling the traditional depiction of the created world as a crystal sphere held by God or Christ.
