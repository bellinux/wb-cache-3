500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the spring}} {{training}} in 2006, Feldman was feeling confident {{that he was going to}} make the parent club's 25-man roster. A week before Opening Day he was called into Manager Buck Showalter's office. But instead of telling Feldman he had made the team, for the first 10 minutes Showalter and the team's pitching coach Mark Connor spoke on and <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> Feldman had had a solid spring training — but needed to work on some things. Feldman couldn't believe it but eventually thought, [...] "Holy smoke, I’m going down [...]" [...] Suddenly, unable to continue the prank any longer, Showalter burst out laughing: [...] "Pack your bags, rookie, you’re coming with us!" ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Bill Oakley {{suggested}} the episode's barbecue scenes. Cohen's first draft contained a more philosophical argument between Lisa and Homer about eating meat, but Oakley told Cohen {{that the story}} needed something more specific {{to serve as the}} basis of Homer and Lisa's dispute. George Meyer, a writer known among the staff for his [...] "bizarre physical jokes", contributed the idea of the barbecue pig getting caught in the spillway and flying into the air. Cohen credits writer John Swartzwelder for inspiring the scene in which Homer finds it impossible to believe that bacon, ham, and pork chops could possibly come from the same animal. [...] According to Cohen it was based on a real statement made by Swartzwelder, who was going on and <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> amazing the pig is for the variety of cuts of meat that come from it.|$|E

We put it down {{to the fact that he}} could not forget, but the real reason, I now know, was that he considered that girls were a nuisance on the links and in the tennis-court. I suppose a plus two golfer and a Wildingesque tennis-player, such as Wilton was, does feel like that. Personally, I think that girls add to the fun of the thing. But then, my handicap is twelve, and, though I have been playing tennis for many years, I doubt if I have got my first serve--the fast one--over the net more than half a dozen times.|$|E
