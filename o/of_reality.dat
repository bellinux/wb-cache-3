5|$|The {{analogy of}} a game was first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate the epistemic unity of language.

5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part <b>of</b> <b>reality,</b> thus asserting God's existence.|$|E

Characteristics <b>of</b> augmented <b>reality</b> from the point of view of visual perception reflect primarily the form and the nature of the added information, cognitive difficulty of processing information presented to a user, its decoding and processing, properties <b>of</b> augmented <b>reality</b> systems and their potential applications in education...|$|R

5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master <b>of</b> <b>Reality,</b> Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E
5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets <b>of</b> <b>reality.</b>|$|E

By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E

Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E
