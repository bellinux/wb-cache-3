5000|$|Sectoral output for an {{industry}} or combination of industries ("sector") {{is the value}} of the sector's gross output minus the value of shipments within the sector from one establishment to another. Value here is measured for a specified time period and usually in units of nominal money. It may be converted to constant units by multiplying by a price index to adjust for changes in prices over time and changes in quality of the goods and services produced.A sectoral output measure is conceptually different from measures of gross output or value-added output. Gross output for the sector consists of sales, or receipts, and <b>other</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> plus commodity taxes and changes in inventories. Value-added measures exclude the value of intermediate inputs such as material, energy, and services, whether from the same industry or others. Thus gross output is larger than sectoral output which is larger than value-added output.Sectoral output is the measure of output used in [...] "KLEMS" [...] multifactor measures of productivity, which attempt to account for all direct inputs to production: capital services (K), labor services (L), energy (E), materials purchased (M), and services purchased (S)When calculating labor productivity, a value-added measure of output should be used to avoid counting other inputs (like purchased materials) as if they were created by the labor and capital applied within the sector.The definition of the sectoral output has been attributed to Frank M. Gollop.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{reforms of}} China’s {{financial}} system have significantly changed the country’s financial sector. One noteworthy phenomenon {{is that many}} nonfinancial firms have obtained equity stakes in financial institutions. This study investigates the motivations behind and economic consequences of this recent proliferation of investments in financial institutions by nonfinancial listed firms. We find that the motivations for holding equity stakes in financial institutions include alleviating the pressure of industry competition, reducing transaction costs, and diversification to reduce risk. These investments, however, have double-edged effects {{on the performance of}} the investing firms. While their investment income increases, their operating income and overall return on assets decrease, as the investment income cannot compensate for the decrease in <b>other</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income.</b> The investing firms’ cost of debt also increases, their cash-holding decreases, and stock price performance does not improve after investing in financial institutions. These effects contrast with the enthusiasm nonfinancial listed firms have for investing in financial institutions. The empirical findings in this study can inform financial industry regulators and decision-makers in listed firms. We advise nonfinancial firms to be cautious when considering investing in financial institutions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{estimates}} and compares {{the efficiency of}} 18 full-fledged Islamic banks in 5 of Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The time period between 2006 and 2011 is selected in order to capture the impact of Global Financial Crisis on Islamic banks. Moreover, this paper uses five environmental variables to control cross-country differences in {{the environment in which}} banks operate. The study employs SFA distance functions and intermediation approach to measure the technical and cost efficiency of these banks. The results suggest that, on average, the technical efficiency scores widely fluctuated between 62 % and 95 %. The low scores in 2007 and 2008 are attributed to the fact that GCC countries were among the countries that have suffered from the financial crisis. The banks in Saudi Arabia and Qatar performed better than the other GCC countries banks due to their natural economies of scale and economies of scope. In contrast, U. A. E. banks had the lowest efficiency scores because of the significant exposure to construction and real estate sector. The results also suggest that increase in Loans and operating expenses have positive impact, while increase in <b>other</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> and personal expenses have negative impact on banks efficiency level. However, there is substantial room for improvement in cost efficiency of these Islamic banks...|$|E
40|$|Greece {{was one of}} the Eurozone {{countries}} that was hit the hardest by the crisis and there is a real threat that the risk overflow from the Greece home markets could have negative consequences on the activities of their subsidiaries in Serbia since they account for 14 % of total assets of the banking sector in Serbia. The initial reasons for entering the Serbian market were versatile, the most important ones being the high interest margins, untapped debt potential of the corporate and retail sectors and a search for new clients. The data about the performance of Greek bank subsidiaries are mixed. The ROAA and ROAE data show that they are below average, but had a positive trend before the crisis. On the other hand, the data on the net interest margin (NIM) show that before crisis the Greek subsidiaries had NIM above the industry average. After the crisis, the NIM decreased, but most of the banks are still above the average. Negative profitability figures mean that a bank is unable to generate income (net interest income or <b>other</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income)</b> to the level necessary to cover the expenses, even though the NIM of Greek bank subsidiaries is above the banking sector average...|$|E

This research motivated by Febrianto and Widiastuty’s research (2006) which tested 3 points of accounting i. e. gross <b>income,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> and net income. However, looked from econometric side comparison between 3 points of accounting is not relevant. This fact based on reality that gross income is not final result in income statement, {{so it would}} be refracted if putted in value relevance model. This refraction resulted from proportion of marketing cost components and administrations are not counted in profit determination. Because of that, this research used <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> net income and transitory earning as independent variable and stock return as dependent variable. These research hypotheses are: First, <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> net income and transitory earning having value relevance for stock exchange.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} value {{relevance}} of fair value {{gains and losses}} for an international sample of banks. We investigate if the value relevance of fair value gains and losses increases or decreases with bank risk. One possibility is that, as risk increases, the scope for subjectivity in fair value estimates increases thereby potentially rendering the numbers less useful. However {{another possibility is that}} the relevance of faithfully reported fair values increases as risk increases. We ask which of the two opposing forces is greatest. Using hand collected data we construct a model of bank returns based on the most important components of a bank’s net income. We disaggregate net income into profits before taxes, loan loss provisions, fair value gains and losses, and <b>other</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income.</b> We also distinguish between the operating profits and loss provisions of retail and corporate banking lines of business. The main finding is that the value relevance of fair value gains and losses is positively related to the level of bank risk prior to the crisis. During the crisis there is also evidence of a similar positive relationship, but {{it is not possible to}} draw firm conclusions for reasons we discuss. As a complement to the main result we find that the fair value gains/losses of banks that elect to use the fair value option for assets that could have been accounted for in terms of amortized costs are more value relevant and persistent. From a policy viewpoint our results suggest that, since fair value gains and losses of banks are especially informative for risky banks, such gains and losses should be separately accounted for according to line of business...|$|E
