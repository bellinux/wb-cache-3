5|$|In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, {{children}} are shown cards {{and asked to}} sort them based on two different dimensions (e.g. by color, such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) simultaneously into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow foods, blue animals and blue foods). This task {{appears to be more}} difficult as research has shown that seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions simultaneously. These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> dimensions simultaneously. This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven.|$|E

Love Hina Again Soundtrack was released on April 3, 2002. Two collections of vocal songs featuring the female cast members were released: Love Hina – Hinata Girls Song Best was released on March 16, 2001 and Love Hina – Hinata Girls Song Best 2 was released on October 3, 2001. Many of the songs featured <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> albums were written by Ritsuko Okazaki, who released the self cover album Love Hina Okazaki Collection on December 16, 2001. Two live concerts called Love Live Hina were performed by the Japanese cast members.

5|$|Two {{forms of}} {{berkelium}}(III) bromide are known: one with berkelium having coordination 6, {{and one with}} coordination 8. The latter is less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350°C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> crystal forms: the structure of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples was probed by X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of berkelium-249 had beta decayed to californium-249. No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3—249CfBr3 transformation. However, other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to 249CfBr2, but the former could not – this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides. The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs {{at a rate of}} 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties. Beside a chemical contamination, 249Cf, being an alpha emitter, brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice and the resulting self-heating. The chemical effect however can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results.|$|E
