5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages for {{marriage}} were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to marry at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To encourage families to marry off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried {{women between the ages}} of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> marry a person who had the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back to a common ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters marry kings and even the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> take it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E

5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of the}} Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E
5|$|To get to Ottawa, several {{thousand}} miles away, the club {{had to get}} to Whitehorse by overland sleigh, catch a train from there to Skagway, Alaska, then catch a steamer to Vancouver, B.C. and a train from there to Ottawa. On December 18, 1904, several players set out by dog sled and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a 330-mile trek to Whitehorse. At first the team made good progress, but the weather turned warm enough to thaw the roads, forcing the players to walk several hundred miles. The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road. At Whitehorse, the weather turned bad, causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their steamer in Skagway. The next <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> dock for three days due to the ice buildup. The club found the sea journey treacherous, and it caused seasickness amongst the team. When the steamer reached Vancouver, the area was too fogged in to dock, and the steamer docked in Seattle. The team from there caught a train to Vancouver, from which it left on January 6, 1905, arriving in Ottawa on January 11.|$|E

30|$|Researchers {{recognized}} {{early on}} that not all problems can be solved this quickly, {{and they had a}} hard time figuring out exactly which <b>ones</b> <b>could</b> and which <b>ones</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> There are several so-called NP-hard problems, which cannot be solved in polynomial time, even though nobody can prove a super-polynomial lower bound.|$|R
25|$|Sparta was an oligarchy. The {{state was}} ruled by two {{hereditary}} kings of the Agiad and Eurypontid families, both supposedly descendants of Heracles and equal in authority, so that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> act against {{the power and}} political enactments of his colleague.|$|E
25|$|Five days later, on 5 December 1645 {{a second}} {{earthquake}} occurred, {{said to be}} of the same magnitude as the first. This time there were no fatalities, {{due to the fact that}} most of the buildings had already collapsed and the population was prepared. The city was left in such condition that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> walk through it.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time the {{constant}} threat of Scottish and Spanish conflict, culminating in the Spanish Armada of 1588, hung over the iron trade and gave it resilience: <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have enough cannons. That fact, combined with the new age of exploration and the rise of England's naval power, meant that there was an almost unlimited demand for the new armaments.|$|E

The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army's 48-hour ultimatum vowing that the president is sticking with his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. Defense Minister General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi was also said to have told Morsi that he would impose a military solution if a political <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be found by the next day.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{become a}} non-Jew {{in the eyes}} of the Nazi {{government}} by seceding from one's Jewish congregation, becoming non-practicing, marrying outside the religion, or converting to Christianity. In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws forbade new marriages of people classified as Jews with people of other classifications. Earlier contracted marriages between spouses of different classifications (so-called mixed marriages; Mischehe) provided the Jewish-classified spouse with an uncertain protection from some discriminations and atrocities.|$|E
25|$|In his youth, Felix Adler {{was being}} {{trained to be}} a rabbi like his father, Samuel Adler, the rabbi of the Reform Jewish Temple Emanu-El in New York. As part of his education, he {{enrolled}} at the University of Heidelberg, where he was influenced by neo-Kantian philosophy. He was especially drawn to the Kantian ideas that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> prove the existence or non-existence of deities or immortality and that morality could be established independently of theology.|$|E

25|$|In his book, Enemies of Soulwinning, Jack Hyles {{taught that}} <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be born again unless the King James Version was used {{somewhere along the}} line in that person's life. He did not teach Landmarkism/Baptist successionism (the belief that the Baptist church is the {{original}} church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at Pentecost), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor Constantine in AD 313.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the number}} of {{subjects}} offered was large, choices were limited as each school could offer only a few subjects on the list for budget constraints, restrictions on combinations of subjects and the actual time allowed to cover the large syllabus of different subjects. In addition, some of the subjects were unpopular. <b>One</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> tAle the A and AS of a subject at the same examination. Students could take a maximum of 7 AL and/or AS subjects in one examination, {{but only a few}} students actually took 7 subjects from 2004.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{entered the}} final as strong favourites to win. Australia {{had a strong}} record at home, winning 24 of their last 26 games and former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden {{suggested}} New Zealand would struggle with the larger field size at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), especially after playing all their tournament games on the smaller New Zealand grounds. At the MCG Australia had won their last six matches, although they did lose {{the last time they}} played New Zealand there in 2009.

25|$|The {{third and}} final stage of armed {{resistance}} began with the Beipu uprising in 1907 in which Saisiyat Aboriginals and Hakka people revolted against the Japanese. Between this and the 1915 Tapani Incident thirteen smaller armed uprisings took place. In many cases, conspirators were discovered and arrested before planned uprisings could even occur. Of the thirteen uprisings, eleven occurred after the 1911 Revolution in China, to which four were directly linked. Conspirators {{in four of the}} uprisings demanded reunification with China, conspirators in six planned to install themselves as independent rulers of Taiwan, and conspirators in <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> decide which goal to pursue. The objectives of the conspirators in the other two cases remain unclear.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started {{claiming}} in 1846 {{that only}} those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed {{that under the}} previous Ottoman system, citrons could only be planted in Parga {{under the control of}} Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, and those were thus the only citrons known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since the rules have been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and pay only a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are new, no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be sure whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking.|$|E
25|$|After Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount (Elizabeth de Sodington Blount, née Elizabeth Anne Mould Williams) {{created the}} Universal Zetetic Society in 1893 in England {{and created a}} journal called Earth not a Globe Review, which sold for twopence, {{as well as one}} called Earth, which only lasted from 1901 to 1904. She held that the Bible was the {{unquestionable}} authority on the natural world and argued that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be a Christian and believe the Earth is a globe. Well-known members included E. W. Bullinger of the Trinitarian Bible Society, Edward Haughton, senior moderator in natural science in Trinity College, Dublin and an archbishop. She repeated Rowbotham's experiments, generating some interesting counter-experiments, but interest declined after the First World War. The movement gave rise to several books that argued for a flat, stationary earth, including Terra Firma by David Wardlaw Scott.|$|E
