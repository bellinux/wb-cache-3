2500|$|British {{test pilot}} Eric [...] "Winkle" [...] Brown flew Fw 190A-4/U8 jabo version. Brown commented {{the view from}} the cockpit was better than in the Spitfire, P-51 Mustang and the Bf 109 owing to the nose down {{position}} of the aircraft in flight. The sloping frontal windscreen provided 50mm of protection. [...] A further 8mm armoured seat and 13mm head and shoulder armour afforded the Fw 190 pilot great protection. Take off was easy; 10° of flap and power to 2,700rpm and 23.5lb in. boost made the run very similar to the Spitfire IX. Un-stick was found to be 112mph and the fighter had a habit of swinging to port. Speed in the climb was set at 161mph, a rate of 3,000 feet per minute. Brown praised the lack of trimming requirements in flight. However, Brown criticised the lack of trim controls. If a member of the ground crew had moved the tab, or it had been adjusted from another source, it could result in an <b>out-of-trim</b> flight performance at high speeds. Brown praised the high rate of roll. Aileron response was excellent from stall up until 400mph (644km/h), when they became heavy. The elevators were heavy at all speeds, particularly above 350mph (563km/h) when they became heavy enough to impose tactical restrictions on the fighter as regards to pullout from low-level dives. The heaviness was accentuated because of nose down pitch which occurred at high speeds when trimmed for low-speeds. Brown praised the fighter overall; its control harmony [...] was superb. The solid gun platform also made it a potent dogfighter. Brown listed some limitations; it was difficult to read and fly on instruments (why is not explained) and it had harsh stall characteristics. Stall speed was a high 127mph (204km/h). Stall came without warning. The port wing drops violently that the 190 almost inverts itself. If it was pulled into a G-turn it would spin into the opposite banking turn and an incipient spin was the result. Landing stall on the Fw 190 was much more easily dealt with; the intense buffeting resulted in the wing dropping to starboard gently, at roughly 102mph (164km/h).|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{airships}} {{often make}} use of aerodynamic lift by using their elevators to set a nose-up attitude so that {{the main body of}} the airship provides some lift as it flies along; however, this is typically done to counteract minor <b>out-of-trim</b> conditions, and it is as likely that the nose may need to be pointed down to reduce lift.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} stall-spin {{scenarios}} occur on takeoff (departure stall) and during landing (base to final turn) because of insufficient airspeed during these maneuvers. Stalls also occur during a go-around manoeuvre if the pilot does not properly {{respond to the}} <b>out-of-trim</b> situation resulting from the transition from low power setting to high power setting at low speed. Stall speed is increased when the wing surfaces are contaminated with ice or frost creating a rougher surface, and heavier airframe due to ice accumulation.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley free-flight tunnel at low-subsonic speed to determine the static stability, control effectiveness, and damping in roll and yaw of a model with a low-aspect-ratio unswept wing and two different fuselage forebodies at angles of attack from 0 deg to 90 deg. Results were obtained with a fuselage configuration having a long pointed nose and a shorter rounded nose. Although the wing stalled at an angle of attack of about 12 deg, maximum lift did not occur until an angle of attack of about 40 deg or 50 deg was obtained. The static longitudinal stability of the model having a short rounded nose was greater than that of the model having a longer pointed nose over the entire angle-of-attack range. The pointed-nose model had large <b>out-of-trim</b> yawing moments above an angle of attack of about 40 deg. Shortening and rounding the nose of the model delayed these <b>out-of-trim</b> yawing moments to slightly higher angles of attack. Both models were directionally unstable above an angle of attack of about 20 deg, but both had positive effective dihedral over virtually the entire angle-of-attack range. At the higher angles of attack the pointed-nose model had generally better damping in roll than that of the rounded-nose model. Both models had very high damping in yaw at an angle of attack of about 50 deg or 60 deg...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the concept of}} a propulsion controlled aircraft (PCA), discusses pilot controls, displays, and procedures; and presents the results of a PCA piloted simulation test and evaluation of the B 747 - 400 airplane conducted at NASA Ames Research Center in December, 1996. The purpose of the tests was to develop and evaluate propulsion control throughout the full flight envelope of the B 747 - 400 including worse case scenarios of engine failures and out of trim moments. Pilot ratings of PCA performance ranged from adequate to satisfactory. PCA performed well in unusual attitude recoveries at 35, 000 ft altitude, performed well in fully coupled ILS approaches, performed well in single engine failures, and performed well at aft cg. PCA performance was primarily limited by <b>out-of-trim</b> moments. 1. 0 INTRODUCTIO...|$|E
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of a flight investigation conducted on a typical high-wing personal-owner airplane to determine the effect of control centering springs on apparent spiral stability. Apparent spiral stability is the term used to describe the spiraling tendencies of an airplane in uncontrolled flight as affected both by the true spiral stability of the perfectly trimmed airplane and by <b>out-of-trim</b> control settings. Centering springs were used in both the aileron and rudder control systems to provide both a positive centering action and a means of trimming the airplane. The springs were preloaded so that when they were moved through neutral they produced a nonlinear force gradient sufficient to overcome the friction in the control surface at the proper setting for trim. The ailerons and rudder control surfaces did not have trim tabs that could be adjusted in flight...|$|E
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been made}} {{to determine the effects of}} unsymmetrical horizontal-tail arrangements on the power-on static longitudinal stability of a single-engine single-rotation airplane model. Although the tests and analyses showed that extreme asymmetry in the horizontal tail indicated a reduction in power effects on longitudinal stability for single-engine single-rotation airplanes, the particular "practical" arrangement tested did not show marked improvement. Differences in average downwash between the normal tail arrangement and various other tail arrangements estimated from computed values of propeller-slipstream rotation agreed with values estimated from pitching-moment test data for the flaps-up condition (low thrust and torque) and disagreed for the flaps-down condition (high thrust and torque). This disagreement indicated the necessity for continued research to determine the characteristics of the slip-stream behind various propeller-fuselage-wing combinations. <b>Out-of-trim</b> lateral forces and moments of the unsymmetrical tail arrangements that were best from consideration of longitudinal stability were no greater than those of the normal tail arrangement...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{failures}} of aircraft {{primary flight control}} systems and structural damages to aircraft during flight have led to catastrophic accidents with subsequent loss of lives (e. g. DC- 10, B- 747, C- 5, B- 52, and others). Following the DC- 10 accident at Sioux City, Iowa in 1989, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended 'Encourage {{research and development of}} backup flight control systems for newly certified wide-body airplanes that utilize an alternate source of motive power separate from that source used for the conventional control system. ' This report describes the concept of a propulsion controlled aircraft (PCA), discusses pilot controls, displays, and procedures; and presents the results of a PCA piloted simulation test and evaluation of the B 747 - 400 airplane conducted at NASA Ames Research Center in December, 1996.

40|$|Automatic {{landings}} {{have been}} performed routinely for many years. However the design of flare and landing control systems with a suitable performance and {{a high level of}} reliability remains a very difficult task. In the present scenario, the increasing in the landing capacity of airports is mandatory by limiting the time each aircraft occupies the runway. To limit the occupancy time, the reduction of touchdown zone is essential since landings too close of the exit could result in a missed exit and therefore in a decreasing of landing rate. Give this context, the present work aims to propose an autoland flare law development for a 50 seat regional jet using Linear Quadratic Regulator technique. An accurate flare path, good rejection to turbulence, simplicity in implementation and, moreover, improved longitudinal touchdown dispersion are some of desirable features of design. In development of autoland control system, full feedback was used as control law configuration. Simulations were performed with non-linear model of the aircraft based on the equations of rigid body movement. The gains of LQR flare law were obtained though global optimization using Genetic Algorithms. The robustness of resulting close-loop system was tested with respect to ground-effect, wind shear and <b>out-of-trim</b> conditions. The performance of LQR flare law was compared with Model-Following design. Steady wind and turbulence models were used as disturbances for stochastic evaluation of the methods. The explicit flare trajectory defined in space, not in time, resulted on the improved touch down dispersion achieved by LQR design...|$|E
40|$|A free-flight 0. 12 -scale rocket-boosted {{model of}} the North American MX- 770 (X- 10) missile has been tested in flight by the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division of the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory. Drag, {{longitudinal}} stability, and duct performance data were obtained at Mach numbers from 0. 8 to 1. 7 covering a Reynolds number range of about 9 x 10 (exp 6) to 24 x 10 (exp 6) based on wing mean aerodynamic chord. The lift-curve slope, static stability, and damping-in-pitch derivatives showed similar variations with Mach number, the parameters increasing from subsonic values in the transonic region and decreasing in the supersonic region. The variations were {{for the most part}} fairly smooth. The aerodynamic center of the configuration shifted rearward in the transonic region and moved forward gradually in the supersonic region. The pitching effectiveness of the canard control surfaces was maintained throughout the flight speed range, the supersonic values being somewhat greater than the subsonic. Trim values of angle of attack and lift coefficient changed abruptly in the transonic region, the change being associated with variations in the <b>out-of-trim</b> pitching moment, control effectiveness, and aerodynamic-center travel in this speed range. Duct total-pressure recovery decreased with increase in free-stream Mach number and the values were somewhat less than normal-shock recovery. Minimum drag data indicated a supersonic drag coefficient about twice the subsonic drag coefficient and a drag-rise Mach number of approximately 0. 90. Base drag was small subsonically but was about 25 percent of the minimum drag of the configuration supersonically...|$|E
40|$|The {{maneuver}} control stability {{characteristics of}} an aircraft are a flying qualities parameter of critical importance, to ensure structural protection {{as well as}} adequate predictability to the pilot. Currently, however, maneuver stability characteristics are not uniquely addressed in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 25, for transport aircraft. In past transport category certification programs, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has used a combination of requirements (longitudinal control, vibration and buffeting, high-speed characteristics, and <b>out-of-trim</b> characteristics) to ensure safe and controllable maneuver stability characteristics over a range of flight conditions and airplane configurations. Controversies exist regarding each of these regulations, however, and considerable expenditures in terms of design studies and testing time have resulted from the requirements. It is also recognized that additional engineering guidance is needed for identifying acceptable nonlinear maneuver stability characteristics, particularly {{as they relate to}} relaxed stability, highly augmented transport configurations. The current trend in large aircraft design is toward relaxed, or even negative, static margins for improved fuel efficiency. The advanced flight control systems developed for these aircraft, in many instances, have rendered current aforementioned maneuver stability criteria either too stringent or of little practical use. Current design requirements do not account for these advanced designs. The objective was to evaluate a broad spectrum of linear and nonlinear longitudinal stability characteristics to generate data for defining satisfactory and unacceptable maneuver characteristics, as defined by pilot opinion. Primary emphasis was placed on two techniques of varying column force per normal acceleration. This study was a joint venture with four pilots participating; one from NASA, one from the FAA, and two from industry...|$|E
