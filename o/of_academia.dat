5|$|His career {{stalled in}} the 1970s because {{he refused to}} swear {{allegiance}} to the Romanian Communist Party and was forced out <b>of</b> <b>academia</b> for his sympathies towards Israel. When Librescu requested permission to emigrate to Israel, the Academy of Science of Romania fired him. In 1976, a smuggled research manuscript that he had published in the Netherlands drew him international attention in the growing field of material dynamics.|$|E

5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) {{was founded}} on 28 December 1924, when about 75 {{linguists}} met to select officers, ratify a constitution, and present papers {{in order to facilitate}} communication within the field of linguistics. The foundational members included 31 women, most of whom worked as educators rather than as scholars at research institutions. By 1935, half of the female foundational members had left the society—a rate similar to that of male members—largely due to the professionalization of the field of linguistics that disproportionately affected women as most worked outside <b>of</b> <b>academia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, {{the pair}} find Snow {{fighting}} a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays {{the fall of}} Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair {{then go to the}} city <b>of</b> <b>Academia</b> on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart.|$|E
