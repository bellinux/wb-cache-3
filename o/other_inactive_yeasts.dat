In addition, triangle tests were performed at different times during wine aging (among 1 and 9 months) to determine the sensory differences between wines with and without glutathione <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> preparations. Descriptive sensory analysis with a trained panel was carried out when sensory differences in the triangle test were noticed. In addition, consumer tests were performed in order to investigate consumers acceptability of wines. Results revealed significant sensory differences between control and glutathione <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> wines after 9 months of aging. At that time, glutathione <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> wines were more intense in fruity aromas (strawberry, banana) and less intense in yeast notes than control wine. The impact of the glutathione <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> in the aroma might be the consequence of different effects that these preparations could induce in wine composition: modification of yeast byproducts during fermentation, release of volatile compounds from <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast,</b> interaction of wine volatile compounds with <b>yeast</b> macromolecules from <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> and a possible antioxidant {{effect of the}} glutathione released by the <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> preparation on some specific volatile compounds.

A small group of RIPs (cofactor-dependent RIPs) require ATP and tRNA to reach maximal activity on isolated ribosomes.

Direct binding seems to be required for resistance as an inactive AVR-Pia allele did not bind RGA 5 -A. A small Avr interaction domain with homology to the Avr recognition domain in the rice R protein Pik- 1 was identified in the C terminus of RGA 5 -A.
