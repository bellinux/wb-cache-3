5|$|Much of the {{character}} of the buildings in the town derives from the use of local stone, much of it from the Town Quarry. Notable among the architects working in the 19th century was Hans Price (1835–1912). Many examples of his work are still to be seen: the Town Hall, the Mercury Office, the Constitutional Club (originally the Lodge of St Kew), villas and numerous other domestic dwellings. The Odeon Cinema by Thomas Cecil Howitt is notable for fully retaining many Art Deco features both internally and externally, and retaining its original theatre organ, a Compton from 1935. It {{is believed to be the}} only cinema organ in the West Country left working in its original location and is still in regular use. Other organs by Compton in Weston-super-Mare can be found at Victoria Methodist Church and All Saints' Church by George Bodley (modelled <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Downside Abbey).|$|E

2500|$|It was {{recorded}} in Rabbi Joshua ben Levi's notebook that a person born {{on the first day}} of the week (Sunday) will lack one thing. The Gemara explained that the person will be either completely virtuous or completely wicked, because <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day (<b>in</b> [...] ) God created the extremes of light and darkness. A person born on the second day of the week (Monday) will be bad-tempered, because <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day (<b>in</b> [...] ) God divided the waters (and similarly division will exist between this person and others). A person born on the third day of the week (Tuesday) will be wealthy and promiscuous, because <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day (<b>in</b> [...] ) God created fast-growing herbs. A person born on the fourth day of the week (Wednesday) will be bright, because <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day (<b>in</b> [...] ) God set the luminaries in the sky. A person born on the fifth day of the week (Thursday) will practice kindness, because <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day (<b>in</b> [...] ) God created the fish and birds (who find their sustenance through God's kindness). A person born on the eve of the Sabbath (Friday) will be a seeker. Rav Nahman bar Isaac explained: a seeker after good deeds. A person born on the Sabbath (Saturday) will die on the Sabbath, because they had to desecrate the great day of the Sabbath <b>on</b> <b>that</b> person's account to attend to the birth. And Rava son of Rav Shila observed that this person shall be called a great and holy person.|$|R

25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them to tell it and did so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a good listener.) He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Ivory carvings, {{often for}} book covers, {{drew on the}} diptychs of Late Antiquity. For example, {{the front and back}} covers of the Lorsch Gospels are of a 6th-century Imperial triumph, adapted to the triumph of Christ and the Virgin. However they also drew on the Insular tradition, {{especially}} for decorative detail, whilst greatly improving <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> terms of the depiction of the human figure. Copies of the scriptures or liturgical books illustrated on vellum and adorned with precious metals were produced in abbeys and nunneries across Western Europe. A work like the Stockholm Codex Aureus ("Gold Book") might be written in gold leaf on purple vellum, in imitation of Roman and Byzantine Imperial manuscripts. Anglo-Saxon art was often freer, making more use of lively line drawings, and there were other distinct traditions, such as the group of extraordinary Mozarabic manuscripts from Spain, including the Saint-Sever Beatus, and those in Girona and the Morgan Library.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Chomsky and Herman revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence and {{published}} it with South End Press as the two-volume The Political Economy of Human Rights. In this they compared U.S. media {{reactions to the}} Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. They argued that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Cambodia, a U.S. enemy. Taking a particular interest in the situation in East Timor, Chomsky testified on the subject {{in front of the}} United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization in both 1978 and 1979, and attended a conference on the occupation held in Lisbon in 1979. The following year, Steven Lukas authored an article for the Times Higher Education Supplement accusing Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot. Although Laura J. Summers and Robin Woodsworth Carlsen replied to the article, arguing that Lukas completely misunderstood Chomsky and Herman's work, Chomsky himself did not. The controversy damaged his reputation, and Chomsky maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies about him in order to defame him.|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying me, as much as I wanted to yell at her for automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (more <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season.

[...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|Palpatine/Darth Sidious is {{a central}} {{character}} in Genndy Tartakovsky's [...] micro-series, which is set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The character's likeness in the series is based <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, and he is voiced by Nick Jameson. In the first chapter, Palpatine is informed by Obi-Wan Kenobi that the Jedi have discovered that the InterGalactic Banking Clan has established battle droid factories on the planet Muunilinst. Palpatine agrees to send a strike force that includes Anakin Skywalker, and suggests that Anakin be given [...] "special command" [...] of Obi-Wan's fighters. Yoda and Obi-Wan initially speak against the idea, but reluctantly concede. In the seventh chapter, a holographic image of Sidious appears shortly after Dooku trains Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress. Sidious orders Ventress to track down and kill Anakin. He remarks to Dooku that Ventress is certain to be defeated, but that the point of her mission is to test Anakin. In the final chapters, a hologram of Sidious again appears and orders General Grievous to begin {{an assault on the}} galactic capital. Later, the Separatist invasion of Coruscant begins and Palpatine watches from his apartment in the 500 Republica. Grievous breaks through the Chancellor's window and attempts to kidnap him, leading to a long chase while Palpatine is protected by Jedi Shaak Ti, Roron Corobb and Foul Moudama. After Grievous apprehends the Jedi, Palpatine is taken on board the Invisible Hand, setting the stage for Revenge of the Sith.|$|E
