50|$|In early 2005, Intel {{originally}} {{encountered the}} problem of memory bandwidth. As more cores are added, the memory bandwidth remains the same due to size constrictions, effectively bottle necking the CPU.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents a scalable mass-manufacturable waveguide platform {{that can make}} use of an <b>optical</b> <b>bus</b> to provide an on-chip long-range communication channel. This <b>optical</b> <b>bus</b> is combined with an adiabatic transfer technique to provide robust and highly coherent transfer between waveguides. The potential for this robust transfer is explored {{in the context of}} sensitive quantum information processing and the designs for several important quantum gates are introduced. The addition of the <b>optical</b> <b>bus</b> allows multi-dimensional coupling that is not possible within current planar waveguide platforms. Shallow ridge waveguides are fabricated using a standard silicon photonics platform. The propagation loss due to the lateral leakage was characterised over a range of waveguide widths and operating wavelengths. Losses as low as 0. 087 dB/mm can be achieved by considering the lateral leakage effect during waveguide design. A new approach to long-range coupling is described that combines the lateral leakage effect observed in shallow ridge waveguides with an adiabatic transfer technique. This platform enables the transport of light between two waveguides over surprising distances using radiation within the silicon slab as an <b>optical</b> <b>bus.</b> Due {{to the nature of the}} adiabatic protocol, the bus is minimally excited and the transport is highly robust. The ability of the bus is further demonstrated by introducing an intermediate waveguide between the pair that can be isolated and completely bypassed from the interaction. The adiabatic <b>optical</b> <b>bus</b> is then extended to quantum information applications that can perform operations on photonic qubits. Several important gate designs are described that can produce a Hadamard, 50 : 50 and 1 / 3 : 2 / 3 beam splitter and a non-deterministic controlled NOT gate, with calculations showing one and two-photon gate operation. This is the first adiabatic gate demonstration that required a quantum description for photons. In summary, this thesis introduces an <b>optical</b> <b>bus</b> that is suitable for fabrication in mass-manufacturable silicon integrated photonic waveguides. The application of an adiabatic protocol ensures the robust transfer of information using this bus. The high fidelity transport can be exploited for the development of integrated photonic quantum gates...|$|E

40|$|Snooping tag {{bandwidth}} {{is one of}} {{the resources}} that limits the number of processors that can participate in a cache-coherent snooping system. In this paper, we evaluate a type of coherence protocol called subspace snooping, which decouples the snoop tag bandwidth from the address bus bandwidth. In subspace snooping, each processor snoops a set of logical channels, which are a subset of the total snoopable address busses in the system. Thus, each processor snoops a subset of the address space, reducing the number of tag matches required for a system of a given size. By dynamically assigning both processors and cache lines to channels, we support dynamic formation of subspaces, with the goal of having only sets of processors that share data snooping on each given channel. Subspace snooping aligns best with systems for which the address bus bandwidth greatly exceeds the snooping tag bandwidth. Snooping optical interconnects exhibit such characteristics, providing enormous transmission bandwidth, but which quickly become limited by snooping tag energy and bandwidth as the number of processors increases. <b>Optical</b> <b>busses</b> can be subdivided into logical channels using either wave-division or time-division multiplexing, making them good candidates for a subspace snooping implementation. We evaluate a range of subspace snooping protocols on six parallel scientific benchmarks, running on an execution-driven simulator.
