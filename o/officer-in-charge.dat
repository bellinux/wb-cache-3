5|$|McNicoll's two-year term as Fleet Commander {{concluded}} on 6 January 1964, {{at which}} point {{he returned to the}} Naval Board as Fourth Naval Member and Chief of Supply. However, this post proved short-lived with his appointment as Flag <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> East Australia Area, headquartered at the land base HMAS Kuttabul in Sydney, from June that year. In the 1965 New Year Honours, McNicoll was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) {{decided to}} set up a central head of the {{development}} for the Games. Thus, the Afro-Asian Games Secretariat was set up at the Greenlands Guest House to organize, monitor and manage all the activities related to the Games. 17 functional organizing sub-committees were formed to oversee the development of the venues and other infrastructure. The various functions were divided within these committees. The special <b>officer-in-charge</b> of the Games was Sabyasachi Ghosh, while the Secretary-General of the Games was Ali Moradi.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Commonwealth nursery and Westbourne Woods {{arboretum}} {{was started}} in 1914, and a temporary camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. Thomas Charles Weston was <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> (Afforestation Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the arboretum for their suitability to Canberra's environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation {{of more than two}} million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area. Most of the original Westbourne Woods arboretum is now leased to the Royal Canberra Golf Club, with the remainder forming part of Weston Park. The Yarralumla nursery is still active, albeit on a smaller scale and functioning as a retail nursery selling both wholesale and direct to the public.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 1942, the {{evacuation}} of the 2/2nd Australian Independent Company from Timor along with 150 Portuguese people {{was approved by the}} Allied Land Forces Headquarters. In response to this, Commodore Cuthbert Pope, the Naval <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> Darwin, organised an operation utilizing HMA Ships Kuru, Castlemaine and Armidale. The operation was to involve the three ships undertaking two voyages each, the first to take place on the night of 30 November/1 December and involve a trip to Betano, Timor, in which the ships were to land 50 fresh Dutch guerrillas in the area along with supplies, and simultaneously withdraw 190 Dutch soldiers as well as the 150 Portuguese refugees. The second excursion was to be carried out on the night of 4/5 December, and entail the extraction of the 2/2nd Independent Company.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the U.S. in June 1919, he was {{assigned}} to Mitchel Field on Long Island, New York. The following August he went to Speedway, Indiana, for duty as supply officer of the Aviation Repair Depot. In July 1920, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Service of the Regular Army and in September became a test officer at the Fairfield, Ohio, Air Intermediate Depot. In May 1922, he went to Washington, D.C. where he served as <b>officer-in-charge</b> of gasoline and oil supply systems in the Office of the Chief of Air Service. In 1923, he piloted one of the six Army planes that flew from the U.S. to San Juan, Puerto Rico, on a goodwill tour.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Junior Grade Clarence Samuels, born on Bohio, Panama, {{enlisted in}} the Coast Guard on July 16, 1920 and became a {{naturalized}} citizen of the United States on July 21, 1923. On May 12, 1939 he was appointed a chief photographer's mate becoming not only the first Hispanic of African descent photographer in the Guard, but also only the second photographer in {{the entire history of}} the Service. On July 29, 1944, he assumed command of Lightship No. 115, operating in the Panama Sea Frontier. Thus, he became the first admitted Hispanic of African descent to command a cutter, as well as the first one to be an <b>officer-in-charge</b> of a Coast Guard vessel during wartime. Samuels entered the Coast Guard as a seaman 2nd Class and reached the rank of lieutenant (as a part of the massive demobilization of the Coast Guard following the end of hostilities, his lieutenancy was revoked and he was dis-rated to chief photographer's mate). Samuels retired from the Coast Guard on September 1, 1947.|$|E
5|$|Relinquishing his {{position}} with the Navy Office in 1962, Becher {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. In January 1964 he returned to Australia, and was made Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. During his time in this role Becher became embroiled in the controversy that followed the collision of HMA Ships Voyager and Melbourne, which took place in February that year. Prior to giving evidence before the Royal Commission that had been established to investigate the incident, Becher had discussed events with Melbournes Commanding Officer, Commander Ronald Robertson. The discussion became public knowledge, and led to suggestions of conspiracy. Becher stated to the commission that Melbourne should have questioned Voyagers final movements; his evidence is alleged to have influenced the Royal Commissioner, Sir John Spicer, to place a degree of blame on Robertson. In 1965, Becher assumed his final command as Flag <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> East Australia Area, before retiring from the Royal Australian Navy on 6 March 1966.|$|E
5|$|With Petre {{on active}} duty, Harrison {{took on the}} main {{responsibility}} for providing basic flying training to the pilots {{of the first three}} squadrons to be formed in Australia for overseas service. Many of his students would go on to play a prominent role in the future Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), including Bill Anderson, Harry Cobby, Adrian Cole, Frank McNamara, Lawrence Wackett, and Henry Wrigley. Having graduated twenty-four new pilots by the end of 1915, Harrison was able to establish the first AFC squadron, designated No.67 (Australian) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps; it was however commonly known as No.1 Squadron AFC from its inception, and officially so from 1January 1918. The unit departed for Egypt in March 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel E.H. Reynolds. Nos. 3 and 4 Squadrons AFC were formed at Point Cook in late 1916 to operate in France following advanced training in England. In addition to his instructional and administrative duties, Harrison put his mechanical abilities to use initiating the building of aero engines in Australia and maintaining the CFS's complement of airframes; according to Wackett, only Harrison had the skill to keep the obsolescent machines in the air. He was appointed <b>officer-in-charge</b> of CFS in June 1917 with the temporary rank of major; this was made permanent in September 1918. The CFS was disbanded at Point Cook on 31December 1919.|$|E

25|$|A {{complement}} of about 10 Navy and Marine officers and enlisted men, under an <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> (usually a Lieutenant or Lieutenant Commander), handled {{the administration and}} military activities. Two members of the original ad hoc committee received such assignments: William Grogan, raised in rank to Lieutenant Commander, went to Grove City, and Sidney Stock returned to Utah State. At other schools, the <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> was often a faculty member with a reserve commission who had returned to active duty. A senior faculty member from each school was assigned to have overall instructional responsibility.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Buddhist monastic sites {{emerged in the}} Deccan region during the Satavahana period. However, the exact {{relations}} between these monasteries and the Satavahana government is not clear. The Pandavleni Caves inscription issued {{during the reign of}} Kanha states that the cave was excavated by maha-matra (<b>officer-in-charge)</b> of the shramanas (non-Vedic ascetics). Based on this, Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya concludes that Kanha favoured Buddhism, and had an administrative department dedicated to the welfare of Buddhist monks.|$|E
25|$|As the war continued, men {{trained in}} the ETP Secondary Schools were being rotated out of the fleet and {{overseas}} bases. Some of these, particularly those with prior teaching experience, were assigned at colleges to augment the regular faculties. These men brought a new perspective to the instructional program, giving the students a picture of things to come. They officially reported to the <b>Officer-in-Charge,</b> but, as teachers, were under the civilian Director of Instruction.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1943 a V-1 {{flying bomb}} (numbered V83, {{probably}} launched from a Heinkel He 111) crashed on Bornholm during a test – the warhead was a dummy made of concrete. This was photographed or sketched by the Danish Naval <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> on Bornholm, Lieutenant Commander Hasager Christiansen. This {{was the first}} sign British Intelligence saw of Germany's aspirations to develop flying bombs and rockets which were to become known as V-1 and V-2.|$|E
25|$|On January 13, 2011, Light Rail Transit Authority Chief Rafael S.

25|$|The RMS {{facilities}} on the NRL campus {{had been}} considerably expanded {{in the years}} immediately preceding the war; by early 1941, the entering class had increased to 135 men. After {{the start of the war}} and the initiation of the ETP, a new class began every two months. In August 1942, Wallace Miller was increased in rank to Commander, and made <b>Officer-in-Charge.</b> At the same time, Nelson Cooke was commissioned a Lieutenant (jg) and named <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> of the remaining Primary School. When the Primary School at Bellevue was transferred to the College of the Ozarks in January 1944, Cooke was increased in rank to Lieutenant (later Lieutenant Commander) and named the Executive Officer of ARM Bellevue. The student complement increased to about 1,200 men, mainly Navy but with about 15 percent Marines. The course length eventually increased to 28 weeks with a new class every two weeks, resulting in a peak in 1945 of close to 2,400 men attending. At the end of 1946, ARM Bellevue closed with the training being taken up at Great Lakes; this marked the end of the Radio Materiel School that had operated for 22 years. Since the start of WWII and the ETP, the school had graduated an estimated 8,000 men.|$|E
25|$|The Swami {{received}} an anonymous threat {{only a week}} before his assassination. Ashram authorities also filed a First Information Report (or FIR) with the local police. However, no steps were taken to provide appropriate security cover to Swamiji, despite ample evidence that there were very real threats being made on his life {{and the lives of}} those he served. The Government of Odisha would later admit that lapses might have occurred in his security and would place Kandhamal Superintendent of Police Nikhil Kanodia and <b>officer-in-charge</b> of Tumudibandha police station Jena under suspension.|$|E
25|$|As more {{electronic}} equipment {{was added to}} the Navy, the RMS increased in size and the curriculum was divided into two parts. A Primary element of three months covered the mathematics and basic theory, and a five-month Secondary element included some further theory but centered on laboratory work in hardware. Radar {{was added to the}} curriculum in 1940, upgrading the instruction to Secret-level Classified information. Chief Radio Electrician Nelson M. Cooke was responsible for the Primary element, and Lieutenant Commander Wallace J. Miller was the <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> of the overall RMS.|$|E

25|$|After {{completion}} of his bachelor's degree, Elkins joined the ANARE team that wintered over at Mawson Station in Australian Antarctic Territory, East Antarctica in 1960. The wintering party comprised 33 expeditioners including 12 {{members of the}} RAAF Antarctic Flight; the <b>Officer-in-Charge</b> was Hendrick Geysen. That year, Elkins {{was part of a}} mechanised and sledging field party that travelled from Mawson Station to the Napier Mountains in Enderby Land, East Antarctica. The men of this expedition, led by fellow Antarctic explorer Syd Kirkby, conducted the first geological surveys of that area of the continent. The highest of this small group of mountains, Mount Elkins, was subsequently named after Dr. Elkins.|$|E
25|$|After the 1986 People Power Revolution, Duterte was {{appointed}} <b>officer-in-charge</b> vice mayor by president Corazon Aquino. In 1988, {{he ran for}} mayor and won, serving until 1998. He set a precedent by designating deputy mayors that represented the Lumad and Moro peoples in the city government, which was later copied {{in other parts of}} the Philippines. In 1998, because he was term-limited to run again for mayor, he ran for the House of Representatives and won as Congressman of the 1st District of Davao City (under the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino coalition). In 2001, he ran again for mayor in Davao and was again elected for his fourth term. He was re-elected in 2004 and in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The New Deal and the National Cancer Act of 1937 {{transformed}} public health, and Scheele's career. Reassigned to Washington, DC during 1936, Scheele came to {{the attention}} of then-Surgeon General Thomas Parran, Jr. and one of his top lieutenants, Joseph Walter Mountin, who choose Scheele to join a new Division of Public Health Methods. After a brief field assignment in public health administration (Acting County Health Officer, Queen Anne's County, Maryland), Scheele was sent by Mountin for clinical training (1937–1939) in New York City at the Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases (now the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center).

25|$|Lawrence {{graduated}} from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1981. A distinguished flight school graduate, she was designated as a Naval Aviator in July 1982. Lawrence has more than 1,500 hours of flight time in six different types of helicopters and has made more than 800 shipboard landings. While assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 6 (HC-6), {{she was one of}} the first two female helicopter pilots to make a long deployment to the Indian Ocean as part of a carrier battle group. After completion of a master's degree program at MIT and Woods Hole in 1988, she was assigned to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 30 (HSL-30) as <b>Officer-in-charge</b> of Detachment Alpha.

25|$|Lieutenant General Zaini Mohamad Said went up {{the hill}} with 43 Army Commando {{personnel}} in four armoured personnel carriers followed by 16 infantrymen after Deputy Superintendent Police Abd Razak bin Mohd Yusoff and his personnel spent two odd hours negotiated and persuaded Amin to surrender. Later, DSP Abd Razak bin Mohd Yusoff informed Zaini that the Al-Ma'unah's group leader has agreed to surrender. When they reached there, about 15 Al Ma'unah members surrendered the stolen weapons but {{refused to give up}} their parangs which they claimed to be inscribed with Quran verses but later relented. Abd Razak bin Mohd Yusoff was also awarded the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa for his bravery as a role of mediator in the incident. Abdul Razak was the <b>officer-in-charge</b> of the Parachute Branch, Pasukan Gerakan Khas, Royal Malaysian Police.|$|E
25|$|The design {{specifications}} for Point Baker included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction {{was used to}} save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces {{were a part of}} the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the <b>officer-in-charge</b> and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.|$|E
