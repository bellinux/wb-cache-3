5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{the novel}} focuses on the 1950s timeline, which follows Paul's adventures. After meeting with Paul, Rossi disappears; smears of blood <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> and the ceiling of his office are the only traces that remain. Certain that {{something}} unfortunate has befallen his advisor, Paul begins to investigate Dracula. While in the university library he meets a young, dark-haired woman reading a copy of Bram Stoker's Dracula. She is Helen Rossi, the daughter of Bartholomew Rossi, and she has become an expert on Dracula. Paul attempts to convince her {{that one of the}} librarians is trying to prevent their research into Dracula, but she is unpersuaded. Later, the librarian attacks and bites Helen. Paul intervenes and overpowers him, but he wriggles free. The librarian is then run over by a car in front of the library and apparently killed.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{his service}} in the war, Gardiner was given an honours degree by the University, {{and he did not}} have to finish his fourth year of studies.

Gardiner was not impeded by the accelerated schedule, and he placed first in the class of 1920. He received the Chancellor Van Koughnet scholarship, a $400 cash prize and the Law Society's gold medal. Gardiner treasured the gold medal, and kept it <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> for the length of his career.|$|E

25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, {{but this is}} a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk.</b> Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.|$|E
25|$|Several {{times during}} the episodes {{produced}} during the writer's strike, O'Brien would kill time by spinning his wedding ring <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> which he previously only did during rehearsals. His personal best was 41 seconds, achieved during an un-aired rehearsal. After several unsuccessful on-air attempts to break his record, during the show originally broadcast on February 9, 2008, O'Brien broke his record for endurance ring spinning, setting a time of 51 seconds by coating his wedding ring with Vaseline and spinning it on a Teflon surface. The feat was accomplished {{with the help of}} MIT physics professor Peter Fisher. These episodes are considered by most fans to be the magnum opus of O'Brien's television career, considering the spontaneity of each episode.|$|E
25|$|Cohl's {{financial}} situation deteriorated during the Great Depression and he endured years of severe poverty. While his peer, George Méliès {{was awarded the}} Legion of Honor medal in 1931, scant attention was given Cohl's pioneering work in animated film. In the spring of 1937, {{at the age of}} 80, his face was lightly burned when a candle <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> set fire to his beard. During a couple of months stay at a charity hospital, the young film journalist René Jeanne helped organize a benefit screening of his work, which played at the Champs-Elysées Cinema on January 19, 1938, the day before Cohl's death, two weeks after his 81st birthday. Coincidentally, Georges Méliès died hours later. Cohl's ashes are kept in the columbarium of the Père-Lachaise Cemetery, in Paris.|$|E

25|$|In 1786, {{following}} Frederick's death, Lagrange received similar invitations {{from states}} including Spain and Naples, and {{he accepted the}} offer of Louis XVI to move to Paris. In France he was received with every mark of distinction and special apartments in the Louvre were prepared for his reception, and he {{became a member of}} the French Academy of Sciences, which later became part of the Institut de France (1795).

25|$|Westlake {{now has a}} full clock schedule: Making {{the skin}} last longer than 99 minutes, visiting Julie, {{studying}} his enemies and even mimicking their voice patterns- in order to assume their identities to cause confusion and sow dissension. This culminates in him impersonating Durant himself, causing confusion among the mobster and his henchmen. When Westlake and Julie have a date at the carnival, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper and inadvertently reveals to Julie that there is indeed something wrong with him. She follows him as he flees (his 99 minutes were up,) and when she discovers his discarded mask, she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him, and after discovering the Bellasarious Memorandum <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> {{while he was on}} the phone, confirms he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake.|$|E
25|$|In the night, {{just after}} the end of the meeting, Grandi met with Duke Pietro d'Acquarone: the meeting lasted until 6:00, and Grandi gave to the Duke one of the two copies of the OdG. At 7:00, d'Acquarone {{informed}} the King. The King at 9:00 called Badoglio, and told him that he would be the successor to Mussolini. The operation was due to start on 29 July. In the morning, Mussolini went to work at 8:00 as usual. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> he found a letter from Tullio Cianetti, withdrawing his vote for the OdG Grandi. Then, he ordered a search for Grandi several times, but although this was in his office at Montecitorio, he let reply that he was not in Rome. It can be thought that the Duce wanted to give him the task to make contact with the Allies to prepare an armistice. Then Mussolini contacted the royal household in order to request an audience with the King, to report on the previous night's meeting. This call unsettled the plans of the King, who after several discussions decided to arrest the Duce on that same day. The audience was then given at 17:00 at Villa Savoia.|$|E
