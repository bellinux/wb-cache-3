5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>condition.</b> Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E

5|$|As {{expected}} by Voltaire, Candide has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, {{the book was}} widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy, political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naïveté. However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>condition,</b> the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it. Today, Candide is recognized as Voltaire's magnum opus and is often listed {{as part of the}} Western canon; it is among the most frequently taught works of French literature. The British poet and literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith listed Candide as one of the 100 most influential books ever written.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{inspiration}} for Tristan und Isolde was the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, notably his The World as Will and Representation, to which Wagner had been introduced in 1854 by his poet friend Georg Herwegh. Wagner later called this the most important event of his life. His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer's philosophy, a deeply pessimistic view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>condition.</b> He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
