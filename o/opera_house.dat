5|$|Minneapolis {{has been}} a {{cultural}} center for theatrical performances since the mid 1800s. Early theaters included the Pence <b>Opera</b> <b>House,</b> the Academy of Music, the Grand <b>Opera</b> <b>House,</b> the Lyceum, and later the Metropolitan <b>Opera</b> <b>House,</b> which opened in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Paoli kept busy {{performing}} in Italy, South America and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) {{where she was}} running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to sing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> and the Metropolitan <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some attribute this {{to the fact that}} Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned <b>opera</b> <b>house.</b> From the U.S., the tenor would visit Curaçao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.|$|E
5|$|After being {{threatened}} with closure in 1989 the cinema {{was taken over}} by Leeds City Council, who created the Grand Theatre and <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> Limited, an independent company within the council which looks after the Picture House along with the Grand Theatre and <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> and the City Varieties.|$|E
50|$|There are ten <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> in the Czech Republic. The most {{important}} {{are the two}} <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> in Prague - National Theatre (Prague) and Prague State Opera.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} other <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> in Bohemia - in Plzeň, České Budějovice, Liberec and Ústí nad Labem - {{and four other}} <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> in Moravia - in Brno, Ostrava, Olomouc and Opava.|$|R
50|$|Although stage, {{lighting}} and other production aspects of <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> often {{make use of}} the latest technology, traditional <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> have not used sound reinforcement systems with microphones and loudspeakers to amplify the singers, since trained opera singers are normally able to project their unamplified voices in the hall. Since the 1990s, however, many <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> have begun using a subtle form of sound reinforcement called acoustic enhancement (see below).|$|R
5|$|Although {{the arena}} opened in 1994 (and the {{original}} arena was demolished in 1999), renovations on the <b>opera</b> <b>house</b> {{did not begin}} until 2007. This was more than 15 years after the initial development plan. The Peabody <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> (named for corporate contributor Peabody Energy) reopened on October 1, 2011, with performances by Jay Leno and Aretha Franklin.|$|E
5|$|Buxton {{has many}} notable {{buildings}} such as 'The Crescent' (1780–1784), modelled on Bath's Royal Crescent, by John Carr, 'The Devonshire' (1780–1789), 'The Natural Baths', and 'The Pump Room' by Henry Currey. The Pavilion Gardens were opened in 1871. Buxton <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> {{was designed by}} Frank Matcham in 1903 and is the highest <b>opera</b> <b>house</b> in the country. Matcham was the theatrical architect who designed the London Palladium, the London Coliseum, and the Hackney Empire.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1975, Baxter was {{part-time}} and unpaid {{chairman of}} the Sydney <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> Trust. He had recently retired from the UNSW, but the job was no sinecure. The architect, Jørn Utzon, had left, construction was behind schedule and over budget, and specialist staff needed to be recruited. Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, and brought the Sydney <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E

5|$|In 1790, a new Royal <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> was {{proposed}} {{to be built}} in Leicester Square. The scheme was led by The Prince of Wales, Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford and James Cecil, 1st Marquess of Salisbury and aimed to re-establish London as a centre for Italian opera and ballet, with an <b>opera</b> <b>house</b> to rival those in mainland Europe. The <b>opera</b> <b>house</b> was never built, as the royal patent needed at that time to license a theatre was refused. The plans for the original design are preserved in Sir John Soane's Museum, while a 1790 painting by William Hodges, which displays the finished design, belongs to the Museum of London.|$|E

50|$|Robert Allman {{was born}} in Melbourne in 1927. He studied in Paris and sang at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden for three seasons from 1955. He then moved to Germany, where he sang in over a dozen <b>opera</b> <b>houses.</b> He also sang in <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> {{including}} Zurich, New Orleans, Singapore and Vienna.|$|R
5000|$|Eberson {{began his}} theatre design work with traditional, small town <b>opera</b> <b>houses.</b> One {{of the first}} designs was in Hamilton, Ohio, {{where he and his}} family lived. Theatre {{historian}} David Naylor described Eberson as [...] "an architectural Johnny Appleseed for Sunbelt theater-goers." [...] He designed traditional <b>opera</b> <b>houses</b> and theatres throughout the South.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, another smash-hit {{album was}} {{released}} by the artist, titled [...] "Habaytak Ana", which helped reveal Ayach's vocal capabilities and establish him as a respected artist. The album included numerous hits, and led him to perform at the prestigious <b>Opera</b> <b>Houses</b> of Cairo and Alexandria in Egypt. Ayach was the first Arab artist to perform at both <b>Opera</b> <b>Houses,</b> selling out both venues and gathering three generations in one place. His successful performances at the Egyptian <b>Opera</b> <b>Houses</b> won him the title of [...] "Amir Al Tarab" [...] (the prince of Tarab) by the Egyptian media.|$|R

5|$|After Isaacs left, {{there was}} a period of {{managerial}} instability, with three chief executives in three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who moved into the job from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on the management of the <b>opera</b> <b>house</b> she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the <b>opera</b> <b>house,</b> including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the <b>opera</b> <b>house.</b> He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some surprise when he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's {{personal}} interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the Royal <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells. During the war, {{as a member of}} CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was its founding chairman in 1946. Unsurprisingly, from the start the two organisations that received the largest grants from the new body were the Royal <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> and Sadler's Wells.|$|E
5|$|Large outdoor music festivals in {{the summer}} and autumn are popular, such as Glastonbury, V Festival, and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The most {{prominent}} <b>opera</b> <b>house</b> in England is the Royal <b>Opera</b> <b>House</b> at Covent Garden. The Proms – a season of orchestral classical concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall in London – is a major cultural event in the English calendar, and takes place yearly. The Royal Ballet is one of the world's foremost classical ballet companies, its reputation built on two prominent figures of 20th-century dance, prima ballerina Margot Fonteyn and choreographer Frederick Ashton.|$|E
