500|$|When {{the group}} arrived in California, Nirvana {{did a few}} days of {{pre-production}} where the band and Vig tightened up some of the song arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart Studios sessions was the song [...] "Polly", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes; if the takes were not satisfactory at that point, they would move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed. Cobain used a variety of guitars, from Stratocasters to Jaguars, and Novoselic used a black 1979 and natural 1976 Gibson Ripper. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain's phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on the song [...] "In Bloom" [...] by telling him [...] "John Lennon did it." [...] While the sessions went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: [...] "He'd be great for an hour, and then he'd sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour." ...|$|E

6000|$|Why, I asked myself, am I not a poet, or verse-maker, {{so as to}} say my {{farewell}} in numbers? My answer was, Because I am {{too much}} occupied in seeing.

5000|$|Since 2011, he {{has also}} got into bicycle racing, in 24-hour events. For the 2016 season Martin decided not to race in the TT {{for the first time}} in 11 years, opting instead for a {{mountain}} bike race. He was uncertain if the decision would lead him to retire from road racing, mountain bike racing, or if he would go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> do <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> but said [...] "if I do race on the roads it will be with TAS".|$|R

I travelled for a year with a touring company. That was hard work, too, but I liked it. After that came dressmaking, which was harder and which I hated. And then I had my first stroke of real luck.' ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, Liu had {{achieved}} relative {{success as a}} computer scientist but still felt frustrated with his career. While his work on magnetic data storage was important, it lacked direct practical applications. He said, [...] "We were the top computer technology research organization in China. We developed the first electron-tube computer and the first transistor computer. But we only produced one of each. Then we went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> develop <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> The work was just filed away." [...] Liu was also anxious about his economic circumstances; In 1984, Liu had a growing family but an income of only 100RMB per month.|$|R

6000|$|What is this smoking that {{it should}} be {{considered}} a crime? I believe in my heart that women are jealous of it, as of a rival. They speak of it as of some secret, awful vice that seizes upon a man, and makes him a pariah from genteel society. I would lay a guinea that many a lady who has just been kind enough to rend the above lines lays down the book, after this confession of mine that I am a smoker, and says, [...] "Oh, the vulgar wretch!"

2500|$|Later {{on in the}} letter, Gottlieb {{stated that}} he still had faith in Toole {{as a writer and}} that he wished to hold onto the {{manuscript}} in case he or Toole would be able to see a way around his objections. Toole decided that it would be best for Gottlieb to return the manuscript, saying [...] "Aside from a few deletions, I don't think I could really do much to the book now—and of course even with revisions you might not be satisfied." [...] Toole made a trip to New York to see Gottlieb in person; however, he was out of town and Toole came back disappointed. He felt that he had embarrassed himself by giving a rambling, uncomfortable speech explaining his situation to one of Gottlieb's office staff. He returned home having left a note for Gottlieb to call him, and they later talked for an hour on the phone. In this conversation Gottlieb re-iterated that he would not accept the novel without further revision. He suggested that Toole move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> writing <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> an idea which Toole ultimately rejected.|$|R

One aspect of the paper explores the continuing high attrition among women and minorities and how that is produced. The other aspect focuses on the more general reluctance of associates generally, and especially those from elite schools, to imagine the law firm apprenticeship as anything more than a stage they are expected <b>to</b> go through <b>on</b> their way <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> The few who stay to battle for partnership are those who are best able to - or hungriest and therefore most willing - to put in the time and those who get support at home and work for the extraordinary effort that it takes...|$|R

It seems strange {{for him to come}} here for the vacation, instead of going to his guardian's, as usual, and altogether he had an air of sadness and depression, not like a youth, especially such an active one. I am afraid something is wrong; those engaging people are often unstable. One thing I forgot to tell you. We were walking through that belt of trees {{on the east side of}} the hill, when he suddenly called out to ask how came the old ash-tree to be marked. Markham answered in his gruff way, it was not his doing, but the Captain's. He turned crimson, and began some angry exclamation, but as Markham was going <b>on</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>something</b> <b>else</b> about it, he stopped him short, saying, 'Never mind! I dare say it's all right. I don't want to hear any more!' And I don't think he spoke much again till we got into the village. I am afraid there is some misunderstanding between the cousins.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tush!" [...] said Smith. [...] "And {{possibly}} bah! Do {{you suppose}} that {{the sort of man}} who runs Broster Street is likely to care a darn about publicity? What does it matter to him if the papers soak it to him for about two days? He knows they'll drop him and go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> on the third, and he knows he's broken no law. No, there's something more in this business than that. Don't think that this bright boy wants to hush us up simply because he is a sensitive plant who can't bear to think that people should be cross with him. He has got some private reason for wanting to lie low." ...|$|E
60|$|Tranquilized {{as to the}} future, {{after his}} {{interview}} with Mr. Sebright, Oscar presented himself at his best {{during the time of}} which I am now writing. Lucilla's main reliance in her days in the darkened room, was on what her lover could do to relieve and to encourage her. He never once failed her; his patience was perfect; his devotion was inexhaustible. It is sad to say so, in view of what happened afterwards; but I only tell a necessary truth when I declare that he immensely strengthened his hold on her affections, in those last days of her blindness when his society was most precious to her. Ah, how fervently she used to talk of him when she and I were left together at night! Forgive me if I leave this part {{of the history of the}} courtship untold. I don't like to write of it--I don't like to think of it. Let us get <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{have told}} you some of his faults, reader: as to his good points, {{he was one of}} the most honourable and capable men in Yorkshire; even those who disliked him were forced to respect him. He was much beloved by the poor, because he was {{thoroughly}} kind and very fatherly to them. To his workmen he was considerate and cordial. When he dismissed them from an occupation, he would try to set them <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> or, if that was impossible, help them to remove with their families to a district where work might possibly be had. It must also be remarked that if, as sometimes chanced, any individual amongst his [...] "hands" [...] showed signs of insubordination, Yorke--who, like many who abhor being controlled, knew how to control with vigour--had the secret of crushing rebellion in the germ, of eradicating it like a bad weed, so that it never spread or developed within the sphere of his authority. Such being the happy state of his own affairs, he felt himself at liberty to speak with the utmost severity of those who were differently situated, to ascribe whatever was unpleasant in their position entirely to their own fault, to sever himself from the masters, and advocate freely the cause of the operatives.|$|E
5000|$|The Gargantua, nicknamed [...] "Garg", is a {{gigantic}} upright creature that can crush opponents with fire and sheer force. It is mostly blue in color, has a crocodile-like head, a thick back plating which resembles an armadillo, and has one yellow eye that glows red when it perceives a hostile unit. In place of hands, {{it has two}} claw like appendages which can be opened to emit jets of intense heat. These claw weapons are designed to open vertically, not horizontally. Though the flamethrower weapon is short-ranged, it is still effective, known to blow up machinery, as in Half-Life: Uplink. Gargantuas can make loud roars that can damage structures. An example of the loud roars is in Uplink, near the ending sequence before the player gets trapped, the creature's loud roar makes a vent that the player is crawling through collapse. It can also send a shock wave towards its opponents by powerfully stomping the ground. This shock wave, which appears as a red dot that shoots red sparks behind it, increases in speed as it travels and can traverse vertical structures. The Gargantua moves fast and is very strong: it can smash or toss large obstacles from its path with ease. Gargantuas are very determined pursuers, and wait patiently for their target {{to come out of}} an area they cannot reach for a considerable amount of time before moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> do <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R

60|$|When I laid my pen {{down after}} {{concluding}} Part V it pleased {{me to think}} that I had written the last word, that, my task finished, I was free to go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> But I was not yet wholly free of the jackdaws; their yelping cries were still ringing in my mental ears, and their remembered shapes were still all about me in their black dress, or cassock, grey hood, and malicious little grey eyes. The persistent images suggested that my task was not properly finished after all, {{that it would be better}} to conclude with one of those anecdotes or stories of the domesticated bird which I have said are so common; also that this should be a typical story, which would serve to illustrate the peculiar daw sentiment--the affectionate interest we take in him, not only in spite of his impudence and impishness and naughtiness, but also to some extent because of these same qualities, which find an echo in us. Accordingly I set myself to recall some of the latest anecdotes of this kind which I had heard, and selected the one which follows, not because it was more interesting as a daw story than the others, but mainly on account of the shrewd and humorous and dramatic way in which it was related to me by a little boy of the working class.|$|E
