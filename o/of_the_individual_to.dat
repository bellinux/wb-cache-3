5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> focus on the present moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
5|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II {{constructed}} {{at least}} five known stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, and 40. Stelae 9, 10, and 11 were all erected in front of or near Structure J-3. Stela 11, which was erected in August of 731 AD, is of the niche variety, meaning it depicts the ruler seated in a small hollow, or niche, and it was erected to commemorate the accession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> the position of ajaw. The monument shows the ajaw flanked by subjects, witnesses to the ceremonies explored {{on the face of}} the stela. The expanse in front of the stone slab is designated as a space for offerings, denoted by the depiction of a sacrificed human near the bottom of the monument. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was in good condition, and some pigment was still visible. The glyphs on the upper right have been weathered, but the sides are largely intact. In the 1960s, looters cut the fallen monument into two halves for easier removal. The top portion is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, whereas the bottom half is in a private collection in Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} the freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> choose {{right or wrong}} and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta {{in the world and}} in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E

25|$|In {{literature}} {{several factors}} are named for explaining why language competence is decreasing. Many researchers, however, regard {{the level of}} competence of the learner as essential for attrition. It is said that the higher the level of competence, the less attrition will occur. Thus, {{a reference to the}} theory of the critical threshold can be drawn. Similar to this theory it is claimed, that according to conducted studies, the higher the level of competence of the learner {{at the end of the}} incubation period, the fewer will be lost. Therefore duration, success and intensity of the language instruction or language input in general is vitally important. Weltens (1987) divides the factors influencing language attrition into three categories: characteristics of the acquisition process (method of instruction, length of exposure, proficiency before attrition, relationship between L1 and the FL), characteristics of the attrition period ('post exposure' and length of the attrition period), and learner characteristics. The second category are sociopsychological factors, as the attitude towards the target language and culture and aligned with the motivation for acquiring the language. Further, factors, which are settled in the language environment, should be considered as well, e.g. the status and prestige of the language are meaningful, too. Another frequent occurring factor is age. A variable that seems to be quite important, especially observing language attrition in children. Even though children are regarded as the better foreign language learner, their cognitive development is less progressed compared to adults. Further, usually they haven't learned to write or read in any language, and usually particularly not in the second language at all. Therefore their literacy skill in the L2 is very limited if not even there yet. Cohen (1989) conducted a study observing young children. He found out, that the attrition in an 8-year-old boy was stronger than the one in his 12-year-old sister. Tomiyama, suggested on the basis of her findings, that these children might not lose their knowledge of the L2 completely, moreover the access to such information is inaccessible and may vanish with time passing by. At the beginning of the 80s another, so far unnoticed factor, was introduced into the research field. Socioaffective factors as attitude, orientation and motivation are now accounted. On account of that, he established a socio-educational model of language acquisition. Thereby motivation and attitude influence the workload <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> keep their language competence. Further, individuals, who have positive attitudes towards the target language, seek possibilities and opportunities during the incubation period to retain their language competence (Gardner 1987: 521). However, the factor motivation is hardly considered examining language attrition. Especially during the last 10–15 years it became more and more acknowledged in the field of language acquisition rather than attrition. Only Gardner considered motivation as a possible factor influencing attrition. Even until today it is hardly recognised as an influencing factor and therefore exist only a few studies about motivation and its effects.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant magazine, Keith Uhlich {{gave the}} season an overall rating of four stars out of five. Uhlich {{described}} {{the season as}} [...] "a divisive run of episodes that, for many viewers, blasphemously rewrites what came before", but favourably compared it to the fiction works of Jorge Luis Borges. Uhlich felt that the episodes in the season were [...] "challenging" [...] and celebrated the abilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> forge a life for themselves. DVD Talk's Randy Miller also awarded the season an overall {{four out of five}} stars, finding that although its concern about the then-coming millennium made it very much a product of its time, it did not seem to have suffered from this and held up well in retrospect. Miller considered Henriksen's portrayal of Frank Black to have been [...] "masterful"; however, he felt that the retcon of its second season finale alienated viewers and led to its dwindling popularity.|$|E
500|$|Michael Walzer {{claimed that}} the growth of {{religious}} toleration in Western nations arose amongst other things, from the general recognition that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability, piety, self-limitation, and sectarian discipline which marked {{most of the men}} who claimed the rights of conscience. Walzer also argued that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral code or as sincere belief, risked encouraging an anarchy of moral egotisms, unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with shared moral knowledge: derived either from the connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> a universal spiritual order, or from the common principles and mutual engagements of unselfish people. Ronald Dworkin maintains that constitutional protection of freedom of conscience is central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it: [...] "Freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of reflection, and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is ignored. A good life need not be an especially reflective one; most of the best lives are just lived rather than studied. But there are moments that cry out for self-assertion, when a passive bowing to fate or a mechanical decision out of deference or convenience is treachery, because it forfeits dignity for ease." [...] Edward Conze stated it is important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body; indeed both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way and conversely [...] "repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of guilt." ...|$|E
