The treatment of harvested fresh grape juice has a big influence on end product quality.

The use of natural <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> (NGM) in the laboratory under simulated enological conditions is the best experimental approach and most precise way to study how wine yeast cope with stress conditions in the winery environment (Rossouw et al.

40|$|Analytical NoteThe present work {{describes}} {{the development and}} validation of a high pressure microwave-assisted mineralization procedure for the determination of metals in <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> by spectrometric techniques. Metals of special oenological and food safety importance (Al, Co, Cu, Cd, Pb) were used as model elements to achieve the optimum working conditions. The study was conducted by monitoring their concentration in experimental samples by ETAAS. Different combinations of HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 were tested and an optimal volume of 1 mL of each reagent, added to 2 mL of sample, was selected for further studies. In comparison with experimental conditions described in literature for the mineralization of <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and wine by HPMW, the proposed procedure requires very low reagent consumption. Time and temperature were regarded as factors in the optimization study of microwave oven program, resulting in 72 minutes of extension including ventilation. The procedure trueness and precision were evaluated using <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and wine samples. For each element three different levels of addition were performed. The recovery range was from 94 % (Co) to 113 % (Pb) in <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and from 96 % (Cu) to 128 % (Al) in wine.

40|$|Cultivable {{acetic acid}} {{bacteria}} (AAB) {{are used as}} oxidising bacteria in several biotechnological applications (e. g vitamin C, dihydroxyacetone, gluconate, ketogluconates synthesis) {{as well as in}} fermentative processes (vinegar). Troubles about their isolation and cultivation in laboratory media has been well reported. The viable but not cultivable state seems mainly influenced by environmental stress conditions and current isolation methods allow to access only a small subset of AAB population. Also the handling and preservation of strains isolated from high selective sources is still a hard practice. Among vinegars, traditional balsamic vinegar is made through cooking the <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> in which spontaneous alcoholic fermentation and acetic oxidation take place, then it is aged to be bottled. Cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> is characterized by very low pH and high sugars content. In previous works we observed high selective pressure of cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> on AAB growth and the loss of strains viability under laboratory conditions. Moreover culture independent studies by PCR/DGGE, highlighted that only easier cultivable strains are isolated from cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> by conventional culture-dependent methods. In this study AAB strains were isolated from cooked <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> by plating system using three isolation media, molecular characterized by PCR/RFLP analysis and partial sequencing of rDNA region. To test the ability to carry out the oxidation process in high selective substrates, cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> wine and “Passmore and Carr” medium, with different pH, titrable acidity, soluble solids and ethanol content, were used as substrates.

The purge and trap system provided the necessary sensitivity for the analysis of low-boiling point compounds, such as acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate, and the liquid–liquid extraction method allowed for the analysis of a great number of medium to high boiling point volatile compounds, such as phenylethyl alcohol, hexanoic and octanoic acids, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate.

40|$|The {{influence}} of nitrogen compounds in <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> {{on the content}} of sulphur compounds of wines was studied. Different vinifications were performed with the addition of methionine (20 mg l− 1) and/or cysteine (40 mg l− 1) to <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> before alcoholic fermentation. Six <b>grape</b> <b>musts,</b> with different nitrogen composition, from cultivars of the ‘Vinhos Verdes’ Region, in Portugal, were used. Addition of methionine to <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> enhanced the content of wines in 3 -(methylthio) - 1 -propanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester, 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid and some unidentified sulphur compounds. Increase of cysteine concentration in musts led to the production of wines with high levels of hydrogen sulphide and cis- 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophene- 3 -OL and also unidentified sulphur compounds; however, the content of 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid in the wines decreased considerately with the addition of cysteine to <b>grape</b> <b>musts.</b> This work showed that cultivars from the Vinho Verde Region show different sulphur compound contents. Avesso wines, elaborated from <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> with low amino acids level, presented the highest total sulphur compounds content.

In contrast, Trajadura wines, produced from a must rich in amino acids, presented a low total sulphur compounds content; however, these wines were also characterised by high concentrations of 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester and hydrogen sulphide...|$|R
