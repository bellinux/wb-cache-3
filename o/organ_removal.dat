25|$|Giammarinaro {{is widely}} {{credited}} for having raised the political {{profile of the}} fight against trafficking, but also for having put forward {{a number of important}} and previously lesser-well known areas for advocacy and action: promoting a human rights based approach to combating human trafficking, preventing the trafficking of children, raising the visibility of trafficking for labour exploitation and specifically, domestic servitude, including in diplomatic households; broadening the partnership to include especially NGOs and other civil society actors in combating trafficking; promoting the implementation of the non-punishment of victims who were compelled to commit unlawful activities; highlighting the linkages between discrimination, social justice and human trafficking, and identifying the scope and scale of trafficking in human beings for <b>organ</b> <b>removal,</b> among other areas. In 2011, Giammarinaro was interviewed on CNN's Freedom Project - Ending Modern Slavery by Jim Clancy, drawing attention to the growing problem of trafficking for labour exploitation and child trafficking in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The first {{transplant}} in {{the modern}} sense – the implantation of organ tissue in order to replace an organ function – was a thyroid transplant in 1883. It was performed by the Swiss surgeon and later Nobel laureate Theodor Kocher. In the preceding decades Kocher had perfected the removal of excess thyroid tissue in cases of goiter to an extent {{that he was able}} to remove the whole organ without the person dying from the operation. Kocher carried out the total removal of the organ in some cases as a measure to prevent recurrent goiter. By 1883, the surgeon noticed that the complete removal of the organ leads to a complex of particular symptoms that we today have learned to associate with a lack of thyroid hormone. Kocher reversed these symptoms by implanting thyroid tissue to these people and thus performed the first organ transplant. In the following years Kocher and other surgeons used thyroid transplantation also to treat thyroid deficiency that appeared spontaneously, without a preceding <b>organ</b> <b>removal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thyroid {{transplantation}} {{became the}} model for a whole new therapeutic strategy: organ transplantation. After {{the example of the}} thyroid, other organs were transplanted in the decades around 1900. Some of these transplants were done in animals for purposes of research, where <b>organ</b> <b>removal</b> and transplantation became a successful strategy of investigating the function of organs. Kocher was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1909 for the discovery of the function of the thyroid gland. At the same time, organs were also transplanted for treating diseases in humans. The thyroid gland became {{the model for}} transplants of adrenal and parathyroid glands, pancreas, ovary, testicles and kidney. By 1900, the idea that one can successfully treat internal diseases by replacing a failed organ through transplantation had been generally accepted. Pioneering work in the surgical technique of transplantation was made in the early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, with Charles Guthrie, with the transplantation of arteries or veins. Their skillful anastomosis operations and the new suturing techniques laid the groundwork for later transplant surgery and won Carrel the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. From 1902, Carrel performed transplant experiments on dogs. Surgically successful in moving kidneys, hearts, and spleens, {{he was one of the}} first to identify the problem of rejection, which remained insurmountable for decades. The discovery of transplant immunity by the German surgeon Georg Schöne, various strategies of matching donor and recipient, and the use of different agents for immune suppression did not result in substantial improvement so that organ transplantation was largely abandoned after WWI.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis 'Public Opinion Toward the Tissues and <b>Organs</b> <b>Removal</b> for Transplantation Purposes', as {{the title}} suggests, aims at examining the public opinion on the given topic. The objective of the paper was to research how the society perceives the removal of tissues and organs, {{as well as the}} level of public awareness in this field. The bachelor thesis is divided into the theoretical and practical part. The theoretic part is dealing with the current conditions of the tissues and <b>organs</b> <b>removal</b> for the purposes of transplantation. This part is divided into three main chapters. Main topics covered by the bachelor thesis are the medical, ethical and legal issues related to the tissues and <b>organs</b> <b>removal.</b> The aim of the practical part was to examine the public opinion on the removal of tissues and organs for the purposes of transplantation. Another objective was to find out whether the society is sufficiently informed about the issue, mainly from the legal point of view. Given the fact that the law 285 / 2002 Sb. (the transplant law), which has changed the field fundamentally, was introduced almost 12 years ago, I was interested whether the public has sufficient information on the principles of the assumed agreement with the <b>organ</b> and tissue <b>removal.</b> The two determined hypotheses were: Hypothesis 1. The public agrees with the removal of tissues and organs for the purposes of transplantation as a way of saving someone´s life. Hypothesis 2. The majority of respondents {{does not want to be}} registered in the National Register of Persons Refusing Posthumous Donation of Tissues and Organs (NROD). The thesis highlighted some issues concerning the removal of tissues and organs for the purpose of transplantation and examined opinions and the level of knowledge of the public in the health-related, ethical and legal matters...|$|R

40|$|Many {{problems}} must {{be solved}} before auxiliary liver transplantations {{can be performed}} successfully in animals and in humans. The most important is the atrophy of the graft. To investigate {{the cause of this}} atrophy we have done experiments with seven series of dogs. We performed <b>organ</b> <b>removals</b> (splenectomy, pancreatectomy) and shunts (splenocaval derivation, mesenterico-caval shunt, spleno-mesentericocaval shunt). Five to eight dogs were used in each series. Hepatic biochemical tests, determination of hepatic blood flow (by 198 Au, 90 Kr, Bengal Rose, Indocyanine Green) and serial liver biopsies before and after surgery (and in the long survivals) were included in the study. Results have shown a flow decrease of 32. 3 % ± SD 12. 0 and 20. 6 % ± SD 5. 2 after mesenterico and spleno-cava derivations. Histologically, a swollen cytoplasm was encountered (probably due to this important flow decrease); but we did not find any modifications of the cells (atrophy) nor of their fat and glycogen contents. On the other hand, after pancreatectomy (flow decrease of 14. 2 % ± SD 7. 6) we found liver cord atrophy, bile retention, important fatty degeneration and disappearance of glycogen. All of these modifications were avoided by giving insulin subcutaneously after pancreatectomy. These results suggest that graft atrophy after auxiliary liver transplantation {{is due in part to}} an insufficient supply of insulin...|$|R

Several sources of regulation have been tested: nitrogen availability in soil (3 mM NO 3 -, 6 mM NO 3 -, 15 mM NO 3 - and lift of the limitation in nitrogen), nitrogen demand linked to elongation of plant <b>organs</b> (<b>removal</b> of young leafs, removal of all spikes, removal of all secondary spikes), blooming (use of three different ecotypes with different blooming patterns), photosynthesis reduction (shading during three days). For each treatment, the growth (total biomass and total leaf area) and total nitrogen intake have been measured. Our resultsshow that there is no nitrogen uptake halt before or after blooming, except when nitrogen nutrition is limiting. The comparison of nitrogen uptake between three ecotypes indicates that flowering doesn’t affect nitrogen uptake. Regulation of nitrogen uptake depends on nitrogen availability: the lifting of nutrition limiting nitrogen stimulates nitrogen uptake. The reduction of photosynthesis confirms that sugar availability regulates the absorption of nitrogen. We have not succeeded in stopping plant growth and study its effect. Uptake nitrogen in post-flowering is mainly regulated bynitrogen availability in soil, the demand for plant growth and nutritional status of the plant...|$|R

40|$|The Republic of Croatia is {{a country}} with the system of presumed consent {{donation}} of organs and tissues after death, where {{the consent of the}} family, according to law, {{is not one of the}} conditions for <b>organ</b> or tissue <b>removal</b> for transplantation purposes. However, the consent is a condition required by the Codex of Medical Ethics and Deontology. The author primary proposes harmonization of the Codex with current legislation. Accordingly, this paper primarily analyses the typology of the Codex, ethical issues and ethical and positivist reasons to harmonize the Codex with current legislation. Furthermore, although the author in the first place considers that the Codex should be in line with legislation, he also considers the provision of family consent for <b>organ</b> and tissue <b>removal</b> itself flawed and poorly developed. In this regard, the author considers the comparative legislation and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, analyses current provisions of the Codex in the part of the removal and transplantation of organs and tissues from deceased persons, states the facts that the Codex should contain so as to make the mechanism of family consent for <b>organ</b> and tissue <b>removal</b> and donation after death more effective. In fact, if the author’s original proposal for harmonization of the Codex with the current legislation is not accepted, a more detailed and precise elaboration of the mentioned current provisions of the Codex will be suggested. This will include exact definition of the family and relatives, exact deadlines and ways of informing the family, but also refining the concept of “ethical“ according to the Codex in part of the organ and tissue donation and removal from the deceased person...|$|R
