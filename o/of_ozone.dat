5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>ozone</b> is nonuniform both {{in space}} and time. Local ozone concentration vary with altitude, latitude, longitude, and season. Two year ozonesonde data, January 1981 to December 1982, observed at four Canadian stations and 2. 5 year backscattered ultraviolet experiment data on the Nimbus- 4 satellite, April 1970 to August 1972, observed over five American stations were used to study {{the relationship between the}} total ozone, vertical height distribution <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> mixing ratio, vertical height distribution <b>of</b> half total <b>ozone,</b> and the local tropopause height. The results show that there is a postive correlation between total ozone in Dobson Units and the tropopause height in terms of atmospheric pressure.

5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independence—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits.

40|$|Three {{independent}} {{examples are}} discussed which suggest that photochemical ozone {{production in the}} troposphere {{can be observed in}} the tropics from an analysis <b>of</b> total <b>ozone</b> data.

Third, an analysis of the distribution of carbon monoxide obtained from a Space Shuttle platform is strongly correlated with the concurrent distribution <b>of</b> total <b>ozone</b> between 5 deg S and 10 deg N.

40|$|SUMMARY. The role <b>of</b> {{atmospheric}} <b>ozone</b> {{to protect}} the living organism from the ul-traviolet radiation is well known. It saves the earth from the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun. Some stable chlorine gases released by the human activities going above the earth eat up the <b>ozone</b> layer. Depletion <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> layer is a great threat to the human society. In this paper, we discuss the lethal effects <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> depletion and compute {{the upper and lower}} β content confidence limits for an extreme value distribution and show that this can be used to calculate the upper and lower tolerance limits to the level <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>ozone</b> layer. The technique is explained by a data set. 1...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the inter-annual {{variability}} <b>of</b> total <b>ozone</b> in the polar regions of both hemispheres is highly correlated with the flux of planetary waves into the stratosphere. In order to estimate the relative importance of transport and chemistry on the inter-annual variability <b>of</b> high latitude <b>ozone,</b> we use a chemical transport model (CTM) together with observations from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) and the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). We find that the expected inter-annual variability <b>of</b> total <b>ozone</b> in the northern hemisphere in the absence <b>of</b> polar <b>ozone</b> depletion is not significantly different from the observed variability, in contrast to the southern hemisphere, where chemical ozone depletion is the dominant effect. However, the large uncertainty of the planetary wave flux in current meteorological analyses is a limiting factor for modeling the inter-annual variability <b>of</b> total <b>ozone...</b>|$|R
