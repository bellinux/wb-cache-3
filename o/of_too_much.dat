25|$|If these homeostats are compromised, then a {{respiratory}} acidosis, or a {{respiratory alkalosis}} will occur. In {{the long run}} these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO3− concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the hyperventilation syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the blowing off <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> CO2 from the blood into the outside air.|$|E
25|$|The idea of scientifically dating {{the shroud}} had first been {{proposed}} in the 1960s, but permission had been refused because the procedure at the time would have required the destruction <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fabric (almost 0.05 sq m ≅ 0.538 sq ft). The development in the 1970s of new techniques for radio-carbon dating, which required much lower quantities of source material, prompted the Catholic Church to found the Shroud of Turin Research Project (S.Tu.R.P.), which involved about 30 scientists of various religious faiths, including non-Christians.|$|E

25|$|Calcium channel blocker {{toxicity}} is {{the taking}} <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of the medications known as calcium channel blockers (CCBs) either by accident or on purpose. This often causes a slow {{heart rate and}} low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. Some CCBs can also cause a fast heart rate {{as a result of}} the low blood pressure. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and shortness of breath. Symptoms usually occur in the first six hours but with some forms of the medication may not start until 24 after hours.|$|E
25|$|In a {{meta-analysis}} of 88 studies, drinking soda correlates with {{a decrease in}} milk consumption along with the vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, calcium, protein and other micronutrients. Phosphorus, a micronutrient, {{can be found in}} cola-type beverages, but there may be a risk in consuming too much. Phosphorus and calcium are used in the body to create calcium-phosphate, which is the main component of bone. However, the combination <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> phosphorus with too little calcium in the body can lead to a degeneration of bone mass.|$|E
25|$|Introduction <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> siRNA {{can result}} in nonspecific events due to {{activation}} of innate immune responses. Most evidence to date suggests that this is probably due to activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR, although retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) may also be involved. The induction of cytokines via toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) has also been described. One promising method of reducing the nonspecific effects is to convert the siRNA into a microRNA. MicroRNAs occur naturally, and by harnessing this endogenous pathway {{it should be possible}} to achieve similar gene knockdown at comparatively low concentrations of resulting siRNAs. This should minimize nonspecific effects.|$|E

25|$|For {{a bicycle}} to travel {{at the same}} speed, using a lower gear (larger {{mechanical}} advantage) requires the rider to pedal at a faster cadence, but with less force. Conversely, a higher gear (smaller mechanical advantage) provides a higher speed for a given cadence, but requires the rider to exert greater force. Different cyclists may have different preferences for cadence and pedaling force. Prolonged exertion <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> force in too high a gear at too low a cadence can increase the chance of knee damage; cadence above 100 rpm becomes less effective after short bursts, as during a sprint.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{decision-making}} process surrounding the stadium, including its design and cost, was heavily criticised, both by supporters, {{media and the}} political opposition in Gothenburg. Points of criticism included the big mystery making and hastiness around the decision, the lack of visions including the tight budget, and the involvement <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> politics in the process. Some of the criticism was addressed: the budget was increased slightly to allow closed corners, but several issues were never discussed. One such issue was having Brøndby Stadion as an inspiration for the stadium, since this arena later {{had to go through}} an overhaul since the commercial areas were deemed insufficient.|$|E

25|$|Since thiazide diuretics {{affect the}} {{transport}} of electrolytes and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fluid can cause volume depletion and hypotension. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and hyperuricemia (high uric acid). These may result in dizziness, headache, or heart arrhythmias (palpitations). Serious, though rare, side effects include aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, agranulocytosis, and angioedema. Metolazone, like other thiazide diuretics, may unmask latent diabetes mellitus or exacerbate gout, especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, are sulfonamides; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides ("sulfa allergy") may also be allergic to metolazone.|$|E
25|$|Too Much Johnson, a 1938 comedy film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Welles. Designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury Theatre stage presentation of William Gillette's 1894 comedy, the film was not completely edited or publicly screened. Too Much Johnson was considered a lost film until August 2013 news reports that a pristine print was discovered in Italy in 2008. A copy restored by the George Eastman House museum was scheduled to premiere October 9, 2013, at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival, with a U.S. premiere to follow. A single performance <b>of</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> Johnson, on February 2, 2015, at the Film Forum in New York City, was a great success. Produced by Bruce Goldstein and adapted and directed by Allen Lewis Rickman, it featured the Film Forum Players with live piano.|$|E
25|$|Tory {{propaganda}} {{was built}} in part on a foundation of anti-Dutch and anti-Habsburg xenophobia, but Britain was being drained of its resources, and many thought the country had borne {{too much of the}} burden pursuing their allies' interests while being denied any advantage for itself. Domestically, Oxford had the backing of the Queen, the war-weary public, the House of Commons; support from the House of Lords was secured by the expedient of the Queen creating 12 new Tory peers. Nevertheless, the Whigs and some Tory Lords refused to accept the possibility of Philip V remaining in Spain, and persisted in supporting the Habsburg bloc as a counterbalance to powerful France. To others, Charles VI's succession as Holy Roman Emperor and inheritor of the Habsburg lands meant supporting his claim to the Spanish succession had long ceased to be politically desirable. The danger <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power accumulating to Austria had convinced many, including Daniel Defoe, the chief Whig propagandist, to re-think Grand Strategy.|$|E

25|$|The Stackelberg and Cournot {{models are}} similar because in both {{competition}} is on quantity. However, as seen, {{the first move}} gives the leader in Stackelberg a crucial advantage. There is also the important assumption of perfect information in the Stackelberg game: the follower must observe the quantity chosen by the leader, otherwise the game reduces to Cournot. With imperfect information, the threats described above can be credible. If the follower cannot observe the leader's move, {{it is no longer}} irrational for the follower to choose, say, a Cournot level of quantity (in fact, that is the equilibrium action). However, it must be that there is imperfect information and the follower is unable to observe the leader's move because it is irrational for the follower not to observe if it can once the leader has moved. If it can observe, it will so that it can make the optimal decision. Any threat by the follower claiming that it will not observe even if it can is as uncredible as those above. This is an example <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> information hurting a player. In Cournot competition, it is the simultaneity of the game (the imperfection of knowledge) that results in neither player (ceteris paribus) being at a disadvantage.|$|E
25|$|Newborn {{screening}}: Newborn screening is used {{just after}} birth to identify genetic disorders {{that can be}} treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth {{and sent to the}} lab for analysis. In the United States, newborn screening procedure varies state by state, but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for phenylketonuria (a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and congenital hypothyroidism (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in kids and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. Newborn screening can detect the presence of PKU, allowing kids to get put on a special diet right away to avoid the effects of the disorder.|$|E
