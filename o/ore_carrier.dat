5|$|The overall cargo {{weight is}} the {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} design of an <b>ore</b> <b>carrier,</b> since the cargo is so dense. Coal carriers, on the other hand, are limited by overall volume, since most bulkers can be completely filled with coal before reaching their maximum draft.|$|E
5|$|During their RAAF service, the Chinooks also {{undertook}} {{a range of}} non-military tasks. The helicopters frequently formed part of the Australian Defence Force's response to natural disasters, including by delivering food for people and livestock cut off by floods. They were also used for civilian construction tasks such as emplacing lighthouses and carrying air conditioning plants {{to the top of}} tall buildings. On two occasions Chinooks supported Queensland Police Service drug eradication efforts in remote parts of the state by transporting fuel for RAAF Iroquois helicopters and carrying seized narcotics. In August 1981, two CH-47s lifted containers from the cargo ship Waigani Express to enable the vessel to be refloated after it ran aground in the Torres Strait. A similar operation was undertaken to free the Anro Asia when it ran aground near Caloundra, Queensland, in November the same year. Another unusual task was conducted in December 1981 when a Chinook transported two bulldozers onto a grounded iron <b>ore</b> <b>carrier</b> near Port Hedland, Western Australia, so that they could be used to reposition the ship's load.|$|E

500|$|The Home Fleet tried {{another attack}} on Tirpitz later on 23 April, but bad weather {{prevented}} any attack from being made {{that day and}} for the next several days.

Another attack on Tirpitz by the Home Fleet had to be abandoned on 15 May because of poor weather.

The front page of that day's Port Huron Times-Herald extra edition read, [...] "BOAT IS PRICE— DIVER IS BAKER— SECRET KNOWN".

One of the escorting Wildcats was damaged by gunfire during {{the attack and}} returned to Ranger. Schleswig was beached to avoid sinking, and later salvaged and brought to Bodø for repairs.
