5|$|Indian cavalry {{participated in}} actions {{on both the}} Western and Palestinian fronts {{throughout}} the war. Members of the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions were active on the Western Front, including in the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and at the Battle of Cambrai. A charge by the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Division ended successfully at the Battle of Cambrai despite being against a position fortified by barbed wire and machine guns. This successful ending was an unusual <b>occurrence</b> <b>during</b> the war. Several Indian cavalry divisions joined Allenby's troops {{in the spring of}} 1918 after being transferred from the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|The report {{typically}} {{begins with}} an introduction, summarising the most significant birds occurring during the year, and discussing any current issues relating to the committee's work.

Late-accepted records and decisions to reject a previously identified record are included. This section of the report contains painted illustrations and photographs of some of the birds. The report lists records that have not been accepted, often noting the most significant that remain under consideration.|$|E
5|$|Tupaia miocenica was {{described}} in 1997 by French paleontologists Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg in {{a report on the}} fossil mammals of Li Mae Long, a Miocene site in Thailand. The animal is known from a single tooth, which according to Mein and Ginsburg's comparisons most closely resembles the living treeshrews of the genus Tupaia. The specific name, miocenica, refers to the animal's <b>occurrence</b> <b>during</b> the Miocene. Only a few other fossil treeshrews are known, and T.miocenica is the only fossil species from Thailand. When it {{was described}}, it was the only Miocene representative of Tupaia, but a second species, Tupaia storchi, was named from the Late Miocene of Lufeng, China, in 2012.|$|E
5|$|When {{the parts}} for a Hamilcar were {{completed}} and the glider was erected, it was flown to RAF North Luffenham in Rutland {{to have its}} specific cargo placed on board, {{and it was then}} flown to RAF Tarrant Rushton, which had been selected as the Hamilcar training and operational base in November 1943. It was not possible to tow the glider empty, so any empty gliders usually carried Universal Carriers or concrete blocks as ballast. Training with the Hamilcar appears to have taken place primarily at RAF Tarrant Rushton, and began sometime between the end of 1943 and the first months of 1944. Hamilcar training began with dual instruction, where an instructor accompanied the pilots for several hours, and then moved onto flying solo flights. Most of this training consisted of 'circuits and bumps', where the pilots practised controlling the glider as it took off from an airfield under tow, and then landing it after the tow rope was detached; cross-country navigation was also practised. It was common practice for members of airlanded units to be inside the gliders as cargo when training took place, although there is evidence that tank crews only acted as cargo for one or two flights, probably due to the risk of accidents which might cost the lives of specialised troops and equipment. Those flights that tank crews did experience usually consisted of gliders landing on carefully marked airfields instead of the open countryside to minimise the risks involved, and also make recovery of the glider easier. Accidents do not seem to have been a common <b>occurrence.</b> <b>During</b> training by 'C' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment, part of the Army Air Corps, which specialised in flying Hamilcars, over 2800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew. Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries, with seven pilots killed during the training.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} suggests the photograph was staged.

25|$|The {{assessed}} {{risk of a}} dive would {{generally be}} considered unacceptable if the diver {{is not expected to}} cope with any single reasonably foreseeable incident with a significant probability of <b>occurrence</b> <b>during</b> that dive. Precisely where the line is drawn depends on circumstances.

25|$|The race {{started with}} a bang, as Senna's hopes at a home Grand Prix victory were dashed after a clash with Berger in the first turn. In what {{would prove to be}} a regular <b>occurrence</b> <b>during</b> the season, the {{semi-automatic}} transmission in the Ferrari 640 allowed Berger to get a lightning start from 3rd on the grid and he attempted to go inside of Senna and Patrese into the turn. Patrese got through unscathed and in the lead of his record breaking 177th Grand Prix start whilst Berger was out on the spot (the first of 10 straight retirements for the Austrian driver) while Senna was forced to pit for repairs and would finish the race 2 laps down in 11th place.|$|E
25|$|An area of {{the east}} face of 67,400 m² was laser-scanned, {{creating}} 22 overlapping computer images, with measurements accurate to between 3 and 5cm. Careful computer analysis revealed that in the twelve-month period between scans, the measured area had lost 536 m³ of rock. This is comparable to an erosion rate across the entire measured {{area of the}} face of 8.4mm per year – a figure significantly greater than those found in rock walls of high-altitude permafrost in Switzerland and Greenland. The project concluded that the higher rock fall rate exhibited on the Tour Ronde {{and elsewhere in the}} Mont Blanc massif was linked to the degradation in permafrost which would have held the mountain together more effectively, but which now exposed it to greater weathering through the freeze-thaw cycle of water, with maximum <b>occurrence</b> <b>during</b> warm summers.|$|E
