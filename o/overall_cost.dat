The cost for repairing the damaged houses was estimated at $484.8million. Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The cost for rebuilding roads was higher than their damage cost due to planning for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid {{to a level of}} 550MW, or 91.7% of what it was before Mitch struck.

5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, {{resulting in an}} almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget. However, in 2005, Malawi was the recipient of over US$575million in aid. The Malawian government faces challenges in developing a market economy, improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing HIV/AIDS problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 {{under the leadership of}} President Mutharika and Financial Minister Gondwe. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase.

5|$|The storm left 80,000 Mississippi Power Company {{customers}} without electricity; most of Jackson County's 126,000 {{residents were}} affected by the outage. Operations at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula were halted due to the power outage and widespread damage to the shipyard's buildings and cranes, {{and at least two}} other shipyards in the state {{were affected by}} the hurricane. Additionally, the storm forced the temporary closure of the Chevron USA refinery at Pascagoula. Facilities at Horn Island in the Gulf Islands National Seashore, Buccaneer State Park, and the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge required repairs following the storm; at the latter, damages included the cost of healing a Florida sandhill crane's injured leg. Thirty seafood processing plants were damaged, and one was destroyed. The Red Cross estimated that 200 single-family houses in the state were destroyed, and some 13,200 were damaged, 1,200 of them heavily. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 390 mobile homes and damaged another 2,290. The <b>overall</b> <b>cost</b> of damage in Mississippi alone approached $1 billion.|$|E

40|$|Background: Laparoscopic {{hepatectomy}} is progressively gaining popularity. However, it {{is still}} unclear whether the laparoscopic approach offers cost advantages compared with the open approach, especially when major hepatectomies are required. Data providing useful insights into {{the costs of the}} laparoscopic approach for clinicians and hospitals are needed. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the financial implications of the laparoscopic approach for two standardized minor and major hepatectomies: left lateral sectionectomy and right hepatectomy. Methods: A cost comparison analysis of patients undergoing laparoscopic right hepatectomy (LRH) and laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (LLLS) versus the open counterparts was performed. Data considered for the comparison analysis were operative costs (theatre cost, consumables and surgeon/anaesthetic labour cost), postoperative costs (hospital stay, complication management and readmissions) and <b>overall</b> <b>costs.</b> Results: A total of 149 patients were included: 38 patients underwent LRH and 46 open right hepatectomy (ORH); 46 patients underwent LLLS and 19 open left lateral sectionectomy (OLLS). For LRH the mean operative, postoperative and <b>overall</b> <b>costs</b> were £ 10, 181, £ 4, 037 and £ 14, 218; for ORH the mean operative, postoperative and <b>overall</b> <b>costs</b> were £ 6, 483 (p < 0. 0001), £ 10, 304 (p < 0. 0001) and £ 16, 787 (p = 0. 886). Regarding LLLS, the mean operative, postoperative and <b>overall</b> <b>costs</b> were £ 5, 460, £ 2, 599 and £ 8, 059; for OLLS the mean operative, postoperative and <b>overall</b> <b>costs</b> were £ 5, 841 (p = 0. 874), £ 5, 796 (p < 0. 0001) and £ 11, 637 (p = 0. 0001). Conclusion: Our data support the cost advantage of the laparoscopic approach for left lateral sectionectomy and the cost neutrality for right hepatectomy. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose some {{mathematical}} models to plan a Next Generation Sequencing experiment to detect rare mutations in pools of patients. A mathematical optimization problem is formulated for optimal pooling, with respect to minimization of the experiment cost.

The proposed solutions are devised in pursuance of the following advantages: (i) the solution guarantees mutations are detectable in the experimental setting, and (ii) the cost of the NGS experiment and its biological validation using Sanger sequencing is minimized.
