25|$|The {{earliest}} {{motion picture}} stocks were <b>orthochromatic,</b> and recorded {{blue and green}} light, but not red. Recording all three spectral regions required making film stock panchromatic to some degree. Since <b>orthochromatic</b> film stock hindered color photography in its beginnings, the first films with color in them used aniline dyes to create artificial color. Hand-colored films appeared in 1895 with Thomas Edison's hand-painted Annabelle's Dance for his Kinetoscope viewers.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1921 Weston used an <b>orthochromatic</b> sheet film, {{but when}} {{panchromatic}} film became {{widely available in}} 1921 he switched to it {{for all of his}} work. According to his son Cole, after Agfa Isopan film came out in the 1930s Weston used it for his black-and-white images {{for the rest of his}} life. This film was rated at about ISO 25, but the developing technique Weston used reduced the effective rating to about ISO 12.|$|E
25|$|Since G protein–coupled receptors {{are known}} to {{activate}} Signal transduction in cells, {{it should not be}} surprising to find MC1R involved in development. As one example at the cellular level, preventing signalling by MC1R stopped erythropoiesis from proceeding from the polychromatic cell stage (poly-E in the figure) to the <b>orthochromatic</b> cell stage (ortho-E in the diagram). The same report showed that neutralizing antibodies to MC1R prevented phosphorylation of STAT5 by erythropoietin, and that MC2R and MC5R were also involved, as shown in their model.|$|E
2500|$|The {{multiple}} series Stieglitz called Equivalents combined {{two very}} {{important aspects of}} his photography: the technical and the aesthetic. He was a master at both, but with Equivalents he succeeded in bringing his skills to a new level. On the technical side, Stieglitz had been fascinated by the special problems of photographing clouds ever since the summer of 1887, when he took his first pictures of clouds over Lake Como in Italy. Until the 1920s most photographic emulsions were <b>orthochromatic,</b> which meant they were primarily sensitive to light on the blue end of the spectrum. This made photographing clouds particularly difficult because unless special filters were used the sky would appear very light and the clouds would be lost against it. Over the years Stieglitz repeatedly took photographs of clouds using <b>orthochromatic</b> emulsions, but he reported [...] "Every time I developed [...] I was so wrought up, always believing I had nearly gotten what I was after – but had failed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} {{also affects}} black-and-white photography. Although {{there are no}} colors in the photograph, chromatic aberration will blur the image. It can be reduced by using a narrow-band color filter, or by converting a single color channel to black and white. This will, however, require longer exposure (and change the resulting image). (This is only true with panchromatic black-and-white film, since <b>orthochromatic</b> film is already sensitive to only a limited spectrum.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthochromatic</b> film {{remained}} dominant {{until the}} mid-1920s due to Kodak's lack {{of competition in}} the panchromatic market. In 1925, Gevaert introduced an <b>orthochromatic</b> stock with limited color sensitivity and a fully panchromatic stock, Pan-23. In 1926, Kodak lowered the price of panchromatic stock to parity with its <b>orthochromatic</b> offering and the panchromatic stock began to overtake the <b>orthochromatic</b> stock's market share within a few years. Similar panchromatic film stocks were manufactured by Agfa and Pathé, the shift to panchromatic stocks had largely been completed by 1928, and Kodak discontinued <b>orthochromatic</b> stock in 1930.|$|E
5000|$|Eastman, Agfa, Gevaert, and DuPont all {{manufactured}} bipack film {{stocks for}} use in colour processes from the 1920s onwards. Two strips of film, one <b>orthochromatic</b> and having a very thin and superficial red dye layer on its emulsion, and one panchromatic, would be exposed together with their emulsions pressed into close contact, the <b>orthochromatic</b> one nearest the lens. The <b>orthochromatic</b> negative ended up reversed from the normal handedness, [...] but as the two negatives were often contact-printed onto one duplitized film for subsequent colour-toning, as in the Prizma process, this often worked {{to the advantage of}} the laboratory.|$|E

5000|$|In chemistry, orthochromasia is the {{property}} of a dye or stain to not change color on binding to a target, as opposed to metachromatic stains which change color. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek [...] (correct, upright), and chromatic (color). Toluidine blue {{is an example of a}} partially <b>orthochromatic</b> dye, as it stains nucleic acids by its <b>orthochromatic</b> color (blue), but stains mast cell granules in its metachromatic color (red).|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{tricyclic}} thiazines (e.g. toluidine blue, {{methylene blue}} and azure A etc.), which are metachromatic due to switching from monomeric to stacked aggregates, Alcian blue is apparently <b>orthochromatic.</b> In common with Astra blue {{and other similar}} dyes, this property {{that it does not}} change color either by change in concentration or by combination with substrates, makes it very suitable for microspectrophotometry. The apparent lack of metachromasia is not because it is truly <b>orthochromatic</b> but because [...] "it is already fully metachromatic" [...] in aqueous solution.|$|E

5000|$|Howe's {{earliest}} {{discovery was}} the use of black velvet to make blue eyes show up better on the <b>orthochromatic</b> film stock in use until the early 1920s. <b>Orthochromatic</b> film was [...] "blue blind"; it was sensitive to blue and green light, which showed as white on the developed film. Reds and yellows were darkened. Faced with the problem of actors' eyes appearing washed out or even stark white on film, Howe developed a technique of mounting a frame swathed with black velvet around his camera so that the reflections darkened the actors' eyes enough for them to appear more natural in the developed film.|$|E

50|$|Benjamin Joseph Edwards (1838 - 1914) was {{a pioneer}} in photography. Edwards worked on the {{construction}} and design of instantaneous shutters and originated the method of intensifying plates with mercuric iodide. He was the first, in 1887, to make <b>orthochromatic</b> plates in Britain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthochromatic</b> film proved {{troublesome}} for motion pictures, rendering pink skies as perpetually overcast, {{blond hair}} as washed-out, blue eyes nearly white, and red lips nearly black. To some degree {{this could be}} corrected by makeup, lens filters, and lighting, but never completely satisfactorily. But even those solutions were unusable for additive color motion picture systems like Kinemacolor and Prizma color, which photographed on black-and-white stock behind alternating color filters. In those cases, negative film stock after it arrived from the manufacturer had to be passed through a color-sensitizing solution, a time-consuming process that increased the film's cost from 3 cents per foot to 7 cents. Eastman Kodak, the supplier of motion picture film, introduced a panchromatic film stock in September 1913, available on special order for photographing color motion pictures in additive systems. Cameramen began using it for black-and-white films too in 1918, primarily for outdoor scenes. The company introduced Kodak Panchromatic Cine Film as a regular stock in 1922. The first black-and-white feature film photographed entirely on panchromatic stock was The Headless Horseman (1922). But panchromatic stock was more expensive, and not until the prices were equalized by competition in 1926 did it become used more widely than <b>orthochromatic</b> stock. Kodak discontinued manufacturing general-purpose <b>orthochromatic</b> motion picture film in 1930.|$|E
50|$|A bi-pack color process, the {{photographer}} loaded a standard camera with two film stocks, an <b>orthochromatic</b> strip dyed red, plus a panchromatic strip behind it. The ortho film stock recorded only blue and green, while its red filtration passed red {{light to the}} panchromatic film stock.|$|E
5000|$|Cinecolor, a bi-pack color process, the {{photographer}} would load a standard camera with two films, one <b>orthochromatic,</b> dyed red, and a panchromatic strip behind it. Color light would expose the cyan {{record on the}} ortho stock, which also acted as a filter, exposing only red light to the panchromatic film stock.|$|E
50|$|A {{panchromatic}} emulsion produces a realistic reproduction {{of a scene}} as it appears to the human eye. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic, but some types are <b>orthochromatic</b> and are not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide emulsions are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made <b>orthochromatic</b> while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic. However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Panchromatic stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906. The switch from <b>orthochromatic</b> film, however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost {{two to three times}} as much, and had to be developed in darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.|$|E
50|$|In her street {{photography}} Blondeau {{would often}} use <b>orthochromatic</b> film to make prints. This film {{is clear and}} yields a high contrast. Subtle gray tones and details are lost. This effect provides the viewer with a stark, concentrated reality. Any information gained from the image must be read solely from the highlights and shadows.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthochromatic</b> {{films were}} first {{produced}} by Hermann Wilhelm Vogel in 1873 by adding {{small amounts of}} certain aniline-based dyes to photographic emulsions, which until that time had been sensitive to blue light only. This work was extended by others including Josef Maria Eder, who introduced {{the use of the}} red dye erythrosine in 1884.|$|E
50|$|The {{progression}} of lens design for later emulsions is of practical importance {{when considering the}} use of old lenses, still often used on large-format equipment; a lens designed for <b>orthochromatic</b> film may have visible defects with a color emulsion; a lens for panchromatic film will be better but {{not as good as}} later designs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthochromatic</b> {{photography}} {{refers to}} a photographic emulsion that is sensitive to only blue and green light, and thus can be processed with a red safelight. The increased blue sensitivity causes blue objects to appear lighter, and red ones darker. A cyan lens filter (which removes red light) {{can be used with}} standard panchromatic film to produce a similar effect.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1923, Robert Flaherty took both a {{black-and-white}} {{camera and a}} Prizma color camera to Samoa, hoping to film part of his documentary film Moana (1925) in that process, but the Prizma camera malfunctioned and no color footage was shot. (Moana became famous as the second feature film shot using panchromatic black-and-white film rather than <b>orthochromatic.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Many modern cameras include {{sophisticated}} multi-segment metering {{systems that}} measure the luminance of {{different parts of}} the scene to determine the optimal exposure. When using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter, for example <b>orthochromatic</b> black-and-white or infrared film, the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film.|$|E
50|$|Rubylith {{consists}} of two films sandwiched together. The bottom layer is a clear polyester backing sheet; the top layer is a translucent, red-(ruby-)coloured, sheet. The top layer can be cut with a knife and peeled away from the bottom layer. The top layer's colour is light-safe for <b>orthochromatic</b> films (which are sensitive to blue and green light but insensitive to red light).|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, {{developments}} in film technology produced films sensitive to red and yellow light, known as <b>orthochromatic</b> and panchromatic, and extended that through to near infra-red light. These gave a truer reproduction of human perception of lightness across the color spectrum. In photography, therefore, actinic light must now be referenced to the photographic material in question.|$|E
