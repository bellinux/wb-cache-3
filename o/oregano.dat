5|$|Hummus is {{a staple}} in Palestinian side dishes, in {{particular}} in hummus bi tahini, in which boiled, ground beans are mixed with tahini (sesame paste) and sometimes lemon juice. Hummus is often slathered in olive oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, <b>oregano</b> and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank. Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting {{in an entirely different}} dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and brownish color.|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, <b>oregano,</b> and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
25|$|Za'atar (Zahter) a {{traditional}} Levantine Arabic paste of spiced thyme, <b>oregano,</b> and sesame seeds, mixed with olive oil, spread on flat (called pide or in English pita) bread.|$|E
25|$|Many of Nicaragua's dishes include {{indigenous}} {{fruits and}} vegetables such as jocote, mango, papaya, tamarindo, pipian, banana, avocado, yuca, and herbs such as cilantro, <b>oregano</b> and achiote.|$|E
25|$|These core crops were {{augmented}} by vegetable gardens (cabbage, onion, garlic, lentils, chick pea, beans) and herb gardens (sage, mint, thyme, savory, <b>oregano).</b> Orchards included those of fig, almond, apple, and pear trees. Oil-seed {{plants such as}} linseed, sesame, and poppy were also grown.|$|E
25|$|D. ambrosioides {{is used as}} a leaf vegetable, herb, and {{herbal tea}} for its pungent flavor. Raw, it has a resinous, {{medicinal}} pungency, similar to <b>oregano,</b> anise, fennel, or even tarragon, but stronger. The fragrance of D. ambrosioides is strong but difficult to describe. A common analogy is to turpentine or creosote. It has also been compared to citrus, savory, and mint.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} a vast {{selection}} {{of different types of}} dishes, such as kebab, kibbeh, dolma, hummus, ful halabi, za'atar halabi, etc. Ful halabi is a typical Aleppine breakfast meal: fava bean soup with a splash of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and Aleppo's red peppers. The za'atar of Aleppo (thyme) is a kind of <b>oregano</b> which is very popular in the regional cuisines.|$|E
25|$|The typical meal could {{consist of}} plantains, black beans and rice, ropa vieja (shredded beef), Cuban bread, pork with onions, and {{tropical}} fruits. Black beans and rice, {{referred to as}} moros y cristianos (or moros for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, <b>oregano,</b> and bay leaves are the dominant spices.|$|E
25|$|The {{land was}} not {{suitable}} for large-scale grazing or extensive agriculture. Local grapes and wines were mentioned in inscriptions and on coins. But Pliny and other contemporary writers did not mention grapes and wines at the island. Most exports were via sea, and both necessities and luxuries had to imported, again by sea. Unlike in Athens, {{it is unclear whether}} Tenedos ever had a democracy. Marjoram (<b>Oregano)</b> from Tenedos was one of the relishes used in Greek cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Since {{they are}} prone to candida infections this is best {{addressed}} in their diet. Remove everything from their diet that encourage fungal growth, like refined flour (most commercial egg foods are flour based) and sugar (most ripe fruits). Add as many natural antifungals to their diet as you can. Fresh crushed garlic is an excellent antifungal. Also herbs like <b>oregano,</b> thyme and rosemary. With proper husbandry and a more natural approuch to their diet Scarlet-chested parakeets prove to be hardy and long lived.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the long}} coastline, much of the state’s cuisine is based on seafood, {{including}} species not normally eaten {{in other parts of}} Mexico such as manta rays. <b>Oregano</b> and a local herb called damiana are common seasonings. The latter is also used as a flavoring for a local liquor. Traditional dishes include breaded and fried clams, machaca and generally accompanied by flour tortillas. Local fruits include dates, green papaya in syrup, along with guavas and pitahaya. Santa Rosalia is known for its production of breads.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, {{spaghetti}} {{is often}} {{served with a}} distinct, slightly sweet yet flavourful meat sauce (the base {{of which would be}} tomato sauce or paste and ketchup), frequently containing ground beef or pork and diced hot dogs and ham. It is spiced with some soy sauce, heavy quantities of garlic, dried <b>oregano</b> sprigs and sometimes with dried bay leaf, and afterwards topped with grated cheese. Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in sopas, a local chicken broth soup.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 20,000 {{hectares}} of forest {{which can be}} cut and include species such as pine, oyamel, juniper, white cedar and red cedar, oak, poplar, strawberry trees, mesquite and more. In areas without logging, {{there are a number}} of species of plants with medicinal properties, including wild <b>oregano,</b> cat´s claws and more, which produce a harvest of about 500 tons per year. Wild foodstuffs include maguey, nopal cactus, pitayo fruit, yuccas and more, which usually give a more abundant harvest once every four years. Wild herbs area generally harvested between August and November. Another product is the production of willow branches, which is supplied as raw material to communities such as Tequisquiapan for crafts.|$|E
25|$|One such dish is mais moulu (mayi moulen), {{which is}} {{comparable}} to grits that can be eaten with sauce pois (sòs pwa), a bean purée made from one of many types of beans such as kidney, pinto, chickpeas, or pigeon peas (known in some countries as gandules). Mais moulin can be eaten with fish (often red snapper), or alone depending on personal preference. Some of the many plants used in Haitian dishes include tomato, <b>oregano,</b> cabbage, avocado, bell peppers. A popular food is banane pesée (ban-nan'n peze), flattened plantain slices fried in cooking oil (known as tostones in the Spanish-speaking Latin American countries). It is eaten both as a snack {{and as part of}} a meal, and is often eaten with tassot and griot (deep-fried goat and pork).|$|E
25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas. It entails {{manifold}} types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras (offal, or the cow's inner parts), morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes also a provoleta (a piece of provolone cheese cooked on the grill with <b>oregano)</b> are eaten first. Then comes the choripán (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two slices of bread), and lastly meat such as asado de tira, vacío (flank steak), lomo (tenderloin), colita de cuadril (rump), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entraña (innards); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|E
25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, <b>oregano,</b> pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, <b>oregano,</b> rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E
25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, <b>oregano</b> and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% reduction in yield. The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into food-grade polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|E
500|$|Labneh is a yogurt-based {{white cheese}} common {{throughout}} the Balkans and the Middle East. It is sold plain, with za'atar, or in olive oil. It is often eaten for breakfast with other cheeses and bread. In {{the north of}} the country, Labneh balls preserved in olive oil are more common than in the central and the southern parts. [...] Adding spices like za'atar, dried <b>oregano</b> or sumac and herbs like thyme, mint or scallions is common when preserving the Labneh balls. [...] It is especially common to eat them during breakfast because meat is usually not eaten in the morning.|$|E
500|$|The cuisine of the Ottoman Empire—which {{incorporated}} Palestine in 1516—was partially {{made up of}} {{what had}} become, by then a [...] "rich" [...] Arab cuisine. After the Crimean War, in 1855, many other communities including Bosnians, Greeks, French and Italians began settling in the area especially in urban centers such as Jerusalem, Jaffa and Bethlehem. These communities' cuisines contributed {{to the character of}} Palestinian cuisine, especially communities from the Balkans. Until around the 1950s-60s, the main ingredients for rural Palestinian cuisine was olive oil, <b>oregano</b> and bread baked in a simple oven called a taboon. Author G. Robinson Lees, writing in 1905, observed that [...] "The oven is not in the house, it has a building of its own, the joint property of several families whose duty is to keep it always hot." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in Mojo magazine, John Harris {{describes}} [...] "This Guitar" [...] as a [...] "serviceable sequel" [...] {{in which}} Harrison [...] "1) does a neat Dylan impression, and 2) plays yet another lovely slide solo". Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years reissues of Harrison's catalogue, New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid says the track is [...] "a much better song than it seemed at the time", while <b>Oregano</b> Rathbone of Record Collector cites {{it as an}} example of how each of Harrison's Apple albums after the critically acclaimed All Things Must Pass [...] "contains shivery moments of release".

Freezing temperatures in the lowlands almost never occur. In February 2011, the Mexican government recorded a low in Yécora of −12C.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a named wine is from the lyrical poet Alkman (7th century BC), who praises [...] "Dénthis," [...] a wine from the western foothills of Mount Taygetus in Messenia, as [...] "anthosmías" [...] ("smelling of flowers"). According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Limnio was almost certainly the Lemnia grape described by Aristotle as a speciality of the island of Limnos, which was probably {{the same as the}} modern-day Lemnió varietal, a red wine with a bouquet of <b>oregano</b> and thyme.

2500|$|Beginning in the 1970s, Guatemala became heavily {{invested}} on hydropower {{with the}} construction of large hydroelectric dams. The Chixoy hydroelectric project provides about 15% of the country's power. As of 2013, hydropower accounted for 47% of Guatemala's total electricity generation, with oil, diesel and biomass-fired plants accounting for the rest. The National Institute of Electricity (INDE) (El Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion) encouraged the private sector to build over 1,000 megawatts (MW) of new hydropower in Guatemala. Additionally, INDE constructed the following projects: 340MW Chulac, 130MW [...] Xalala, 135-MW Serchil, 69MW <b>Oregano,</b> 60MW Santa Maria II, 59MW Camotan, and the 23MW El Palmar.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} the name Oregon has Spanish origins. The term [...] "orejón" [...] comes from the historical chronicle Relación de la Alta y Baja California (1598) written by the new Spaniard Rodrigo Motezuma and made reference to the Columbia River when the Spanish explorers penetrated into the actual North American territory that {{became part of the}} Viceroyalty of New Spain. This chronicle is the first topographical and linguistic source with respect to the place name Oregon. There are also two other sources with Spanish origins, such as the name <b>Oregano,</b> which grows {{in the southern part of}} the region. It is most probable that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, as there are some populations in Spain such as [...] "Arroyo del Oregón" [...] (which is situated in the province of Ciudad Real), also considering that the individualization in Spanish language [...] "El Orejón" [...] with the mutation of the letter [...] "g" [...] instead of [...] "j".|$|E
