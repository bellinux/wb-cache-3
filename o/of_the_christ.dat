5|$|Australian-American actor Mel Gibson is {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the episode; his voice was impersonated by André Sogliuzzo. Gibson directed the film The Passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> (2004) and, in the episode, is seen making a sequel entitled Passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> 2: Crucify This. The fictional sequel {{is a combination of}} The Passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> and Rush Hour (1998), and stars Chris Tucker, who starred in Rush Hour, and Jim Caviezel who portrayed Jesus in The Passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ.</b>|$|E
5|$|Biblical {{scenes and}} figures {{depicted}} in the Church of the Holy Mother of God include the worshiping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> child as the eucharistic victim (the Melismos) in {{the lower part of}} the apse, the raising of Lazarus, the Annunciation, Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, the Passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> in the upper part of the cella, the Descent from the Cross, the mourning of Jesus, and the Dormition of the Theotokos on the west wall. The north and south walls of the cella, as well as the wall piers, bear frescoes of saints, including rare images of military saints on horseback. Murals of Saint Petka and Saint Nicholas were painted in the upper reaches of the narthex, in the south and the north tower respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 Ge {{returned}} to Florence and would paint not only Herzen's portrait {{but also the}} Messengers of the Resurrection and the first version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> on the Mount of Olives.

2500|$|<b>The</b> {{tradition}} <b>of</b> venerating <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead <b>Christ</b> traces {{its origin}} {{to the early}} Church. [...] <b>The</b> earliest articles <b>of</b> veneration are <b>the</b> Sudarium <b>of</b> Oviedo and <b>the</b> Shroud <b>of</b> Turin, <b>the</b> very shroud {{believed to have been}} used in burying <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead <b>Christ.</b> Several representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead <b>Christ</b> became common in the fifteenth century. When Spain introduced Christianity to the Philippines, they brought several representative images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead <b>Christ.</b> Known by such names as Santo Sepulcro (Holy Sepulcher), Santo Cristo Yacente (Lying Holy Christ), Santo Retiro (Holy Retirement), Santo Entierro (Holy Burial), the most common portrayal is that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead <b>Christ</b> lying in state on a stately bier, a very popular icon in the Philippines.|$|R

5|$|In antiquity, many {{infants with}} disabilities were either killed or abandoned.

5|$|Many Christians {{believe the}} star was a miraculous sign {{to mark the}} birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> (or Messiah). Some theologians claimed that the star {{fulfilled}} a prophecy, known as the Star Prophecy. Astronomers have made several attempts to link the star to unusual astronomical events, such as a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, a comet or a supernova.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{appearance}} of the icon is unclear: although the early image has been interpreted as a bust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> Pantocrator type, late Byzantine references, such as coins by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and the Deesis mosaic in the Chora Church, use the term for depictions of a standing Christ on a pedestal.|$|E

5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> Child. The Virgin’s right arm mirrors the arm of the satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located on the shoulders of the satyr, a position similar to the Christ Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E
5|$|While Aronofsky's {{other movies}} have evoked {{significant}} emotional response, {{they were still}} far from the turmoil aroused by Noah. It was screened {{for the first time}} on March 28, 2014, and despite its PG-13 rating, it has quickly been recognized by Box Office Mojo as one of the most controversial movies of the last 35 years along with such titles as The Passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> or The Da Vinci Code. Noah has been banned in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Indonesia on religious grounds with other countries following suit.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ,</b> a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E

5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} The Passion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled the Passion of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor. The film garnered praise from critics and audiences alike, as well as various accolades.|$|E

In the first section, <b>the</b> Imitation <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> is studied in the following ways. <b>The</b> various strands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Imitation tradition are analysed, <b>the</b> Imitation <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> is studied as an instance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human practice <b>of</b> Imitation, <b>the</b> Christological issues are investigated, as also is the relationship between Imitation and Christian theology. In the second section Bonhoeffer's notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Imitation <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> is studied in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues raised in the first section. Thus Bonhoeffer's place in the Imitation tradition is assessed, and more light shed on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Imitation <b>of</b> <b>Christ...</b>|$|R
