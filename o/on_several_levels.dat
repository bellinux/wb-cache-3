5|$|The series {{affected}} Square's business <b>on</b> <b>several</b> <b>levels.</b> The commercial {{failure of}} Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within resulted in hesitation and delays from Enix during merger discussions with Square. Square's decision to produce games {{exclusively for the}} Sony PlayStation—a move followed by Enix's decision with the Dragon Quest series—severed their relationship with Nintendo. Final Fantasy games were absent from Nintendo consoles, specifically the Nintendo 64, for seven years. Critics attribute the switch of strong third-party titles like the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games to Sony's PlayStation, {{and away from the}} Nintendo 64, as one of the reasons behind PlayStation being the more successful of the two consoles. The release of the Nintendo GameCube, which used optical disc media, in 2001 caught the attention of Square. To produce games for the system, Square created the shell company The Game Designers Studio and released Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, which spawned its own metaseries within the main franchise. Final FantasyXIs lack of an online method of subscription cancellation prompted the creation of legislation in Illinois that requires internet gaming services to provide such a method to the state's residents.|$|E

Another major task of the group is to investigate and re-evaluate the status of the information structure primitives (topic, focus, contrast, etc.) as cross-linguistically valid categories. To achieve this, the members of the group combine extensive corpus analysis of the data in their respective languages with production experiments; all findings are further cross-checked through standard information structure tests (question-answer pairs, aboutness tests, association with focus sensitive items).|$|E

40|$|After {{introducing}} general concepts about model transformations, two presentations {{provide an}} overview of the MARTE profile. Model-driven implementations of software and hardware architectures are then given, covering the most common aspects of Model-Driven Development for Distributed Real-Time Systems: structuring architectures using components, mapping between different levels of abstraction, designing hardware and software architecture, evaluation and validation through tests and performance analysis. In the context of Distributed and Real-time Embedded Systems (DRES), system developers are faced with reducing system development cost and time while developing correct (relating to safe and QoS properties) and increasingly complex systems. To take up this challenge, Model-Driven Development (MDD) advocates the intensive uses of models and model transformation <b>on</b> <b>several</b> <b>level</b> of abstractions.
