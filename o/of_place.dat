5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>place</b> cells. The dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E
5|$|As planned, Mayweather boards Horizon and {{receives}} {{a warm welcome}} {{from most of the}} crew, including his mother Rianna. He also finds out that his brother, Paul, has been named acting captain, but he doesn't seem to be coping well with his new responsibilities. Mayweather offers to make a few repairs and upgrades to systems on the ship, but Paul tells him to stop, making him feel uneasy and out <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> Soon afterwards, the ship suddenly comes under attack, and a homing device is placed on the hull. Mayweather then recommends a boost in the ship's fighting capability, but Paul insists that the safest course is to flee to the nearest port and yield the cargo as needed.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E

5|$|At Battle of Novi, his {{division}} {{was part of}} Laurent Saint-Cyr's right wing. At the battle itself, his troops {{were the only ones}} properly positioned; the rest of the French army was otherwise out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and unready for battle. He and Saint-Cyr held the center of the French line, beating off two Russian assaults. After the French defeat at Novi, he went with Saint-Cyr to Savona, where he participated in operations around Genoa. Eventually, he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany, culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden.|$|E
5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E
5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes slip out <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on {{what part of the}} dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E

50|$|During {{the period}} covered by this report, there were no reports that any {{religious}} groups encountered significant difficulties in obtaining approval for construction <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>of</b> worship.

The distance limitation has begun to be enforced but applies only to new construction <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>of</b> worship and not to offices of religious organizations. The order requires that religious teachings respect other religious groups.|$|R

5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride <b>of</b> <b>place</b> goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain {{that it would be}} best to send me as far away as possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E

Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse, who is voiced by Pamela Hayden.

It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name, Van Houten, which he got {{from one of his}} wife's friends.|$|E
5|$|Misterioso was {{released}} in 1958 by Riverside Records to a mixed critical reaction; reviewers complimented Monk's performance but were critical of Griffin, whose playing they felt was out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> with the quartet.

5|$|Olivia Mary Manning CBE (2 March 1908– 23 July 1980) was a British novelist, poet, {{writer and}} reviewer. Her fiction and non-fiction, {{frequently}} detailing journeys and personal odysseys, were principally set in England, Ireland, Europe and the Middle East. She often wrote from her personal experience, though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing.

5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out <b>of</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Place d'Armes {{is one of}} {{the largest}} squares in the city of Calais, adjoins the watchtower, and during medieval times was once the heart of the city.

After the reconquest of Calais in 1558 by Francis, Duke of Guise, Francis II gave Calais the right to hold a fair twice a year on the square, which still exists today, as well as a bustling Wednesday and Saturday market.|$|E
