500|$|Immediately to {{the west}} of the town is Brownhills Common, a [...] {{heathland}} which once formed part of Cannock Forest (also known as [...] "Canke Wood"). Although the forest was felled in the 15th and 16th centuries, the spread of heather and the grazing of sheep led to the creation of a huge area of heathland. The area was affected by mine workings but has now returned to a more natural state and lizards and dragonflies may be observed. The area now supports various habitat types, with the heathland mixing with marshy grassland, with scattered scrub and pools. In 1926, when ownership of the Common was transferred to the local Council, a large area of barren land at the eastern end, closest to the town, was landscaped, with new trees planted. Lying south of the Common, Birch Coppice is a large area of predominantly oak and birch woodland, which, although crossed by a now-dismantled railway line, mostly escaped the destruction caused to <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas</b> by mining and other industry.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} area of woodland {{is by far}} the oldest, {{in particular}} the very old oak pollards near Oaks Road. <b>Other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas</b> are comparatively recent, and the small pine plantations near the southern boundary were only established during the mid-19th century.|$|E

5000|$|Toxicodendron rydbergii {{the western}} poison ivy, is {{a species of}} Toxicodendron in the cashew family.

[...] It can be found growing in forests, and <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas,</b> usually near streams and rivers.|$|E
50|$|The regent parrot or rock pebbler (Polytelis anthopeplus) is a bird of {{the parrot}} family (Psittacidae). It has {{predominantly}} yellow plumage {{with a green}} tail. The bird is found primarily in eucalyptus groves and <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas</b> of subtropical southwestern Australia, {{as well as in}} a smaller area of subtropical and temperate southeastern Australia. Seeds make up the bulk of its diet. Regent parrots are popular in captivity.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} popular forms of {{wildlife}} observation, birdwatching, is typically performed as a recreational pleasure. Those looking to birdwatch typically travel into a forest or <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> with a pair of binoculars in hand to aid the process. Birdwatching has become all the more important with the amount of deforestation that has been occurring in the world. Birds are arguably {{the most important factor in}} the balance of environmental systems: [...] "They pollinate plants, disperse seeds, scavenge carcasses and recycle nutrients back into the earth." [...] A decrease in the total number of birds would cause destruction to much of the environmental system. The plants and trees around the world would die at an alarming rate which would, in turn, set off a chain reaction that would cause many other animals to die due to the environment change and habitat loss.|$|R
5|$|Tall eucalypts {{that are}} {{emergent}} over <b>other</b> trees in <b>wooded</b> <b>areas</b> are selected for roosting sites. It {{is here that}} the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter from {{the heat of the}} day. They often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather.|$|R
50|$|Botrychium montanum is {{a species}} of fern in the family Ophioglossaceae known by the common names western goblin and {{mountain}} moonwort. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to northern California to Montana, where it grows in the dark understory of coniferous forests and <b>other</b> moist <b>wooded</b> <b>areas.</b> This is very small plant growing from an underground caudex and sending one thin gray-green leaf above {{the surface of the}} ground. The leaf is less than 8 centimeters tall and is divided into a sterile and a fertile part. The sterile part of the leaf has irregularly shaped angled leaflets. The fertile part of the leaf is very different in shape, with grapelike clusters of sporangia by which it reproduces.|$|R
50|$|This {{species can}} be found in the {{countries}} of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and the Guianas. It lives in swampy habitats and <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas</b> which are flooded. It is mostly aquatic and is an excellent climber. It spends most of its time basking on branches overhanging the waterways so that if trouble was to arise it would be a quick drop into the safety of the water.|$|E
50|$|The Yanty Creek Nature Trail is on {{the eastern}} end of the park and the trailhead is {{accessible}} by the park road. There is parking for about six cars at the trailhead. The trail is stone or mulch and winds around in a loop. Informational placards are provided along the way. The Shoreline Trail is a paved trail that runs along the lake east to west, passing by the beaches. There are several other small trails within the campgrounds and <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the mid 1980s, {{three young}} women {{disappeared}} from the Claremont area. In 1985 and 1986, the skeletal remains {{of two of the}} women were recovered within about a thousand feet of each <b>other</b> in a <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> in Kelleyville, New Hampshire. The condition of the remains made the cause of death difficult to determine, but certain factors pointed to multiple stab wounds. Between the recovery of the first and second bodies, a 36-year-old woman was stabbed to death in a frenzied attack inside her home in Saxtons River, Vermont. Ten days later, the remains of the third missing woman were found; postmortem examination again revealed evidence of multiple stab wounds.|$|R
5000|$|The park {{consists}} of a drive-thru area, where the visitors can {{get close to the}} animals and feed them, and walking areas. One of the walking areas is an elevated boardwalk where visitors will see primarily carnivores such as lions and tigers, and the <b>other</b> is a <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> called the [...] "Farm of the Five Continents", which displays farm animals from around the world including donkeys and miniature horses, as well as emus and rheas. Parc Safari also has a small water park, which has a couple of small slides and some fountains. There is also a pool which is like a river with real stones on the bottom, fake caves, and quick rapids. People go through the [...] "river" [...] on small aquatic flotation devices.|$|R

30|$|Non-timber forest {{products}} are goods of biological origin other than timber, derived from forests, <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas</b> and trees outside forests (FAO Forestry 1999). In this context non-timber {{forest products}} include all kinds of animals, resin, tannin, medicinal and industrial plants and non-food products including materials or plant parts having medicinal properties, are edible and of industrial use (Noubissie et al. 2008). In recent years, issues related to {{non-timber forest products}}, particularly the conservation of their natural habitat {{as well as their}} production, has attracted considerable interest in the world. The main reasons are the role of these products in providing livelihood and food for rural communities in order to reduce poverty along with supporting various environmental goals such as conservation of biodiversity (FAO Forestry 1999). Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are accepted as a veritable means of achieving poverty alleviation because of their role in sustaining this livelihood, for food security and environmental objectives such as biodiversity conservation (FAO Forestry 1999).|$|E
