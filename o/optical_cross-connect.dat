We then investigate the tradeoff between the depth and the complexity of an <b>optical</b> multicast <b>cross-connect</b> using the model. Upper and lower complexity bounds are proved. In the process, we also give a generic recursive construction {{that can be used}} to construct optimal and near-optimal distributors.

5000|$|An optical {{add-drop}} multiplexer (OADM) is {{a device}} used in wavelength-division multiplexing systems for multiplexing and routing different channels of light into {{or out of}} a single mode fiber (SMF).

50|$|Traditional {{transport}} networks {{are made of}} optical fiber-based links between telecommunications offices, where multiple wavelengths are multiplexed to increase {{the capacity of the}} fiber. The wavelengths are terminated on electronic devices called transponders, undergoing an optical-to-electrical conversion for signal Reamplification, Reshaping, and Retiming (3R). Inside a telecommunications office, the signals are then handled to and switched by a transport switch (aka <b>optical</b> <b>cross-connect</b> or optical switch) and either are dropped at that office, or directed to an outgoing fiber link where they are again carried as wavelengths multiplexed into that fiber link towards the next telecommunications office. The act of going through Optical-Electrical-Optical (O-E-O) conversion through a telecommunications office causes the network to be considered opaque. When the incoming wavelengths do not undergo an optical-to-electrical conversion and are switched through a telecommunications office in the optical domain using all-optical switches (also called photonic cross-connect, optical add-drop multiplexer, or Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) systems), the network is considered to be transparent. Hybrid schemes that leverage optical bypasses and provide limited O-E-O conversions at key locations across the network, are referred to as translucent networks.|$|E

40|$|IP over {{optical network}} {{architectures}} have been extensively discussed within {{the research literature}} {{over the past few}} years. However, although signaling protocols between IP routers and <b>optical</b> <b>cross-connect</b> networks have been standardized, large IP backbones are not typically deployed over <b>optical</b> <b>cross-connect</b> networks with automatic reconfigurability features, such as automatic restoration or dynamic establishment of new IP links. One of the most important criteria in determining whether an IP backbone should be carried over such an <b>optical</b> <b>cross-connect</b> network is economic viability. In this article we analyze and explore four architectures for a typical large ISP backbone. In contrast with some other published claims, our results suggest it is more economically attractive to bypass an intermediate cross-connect network, given current equipment and IP backbone network design requirements. However, for ISPs who also provide a large volume of private line services, we propose an integrated architecture for IP over <b>optical</b> <b>cross-connect</b> networks that may provide an attractive alternative for providing rapid and cost-effective restoration from network failures...|$|E

40|$|Existing Internet {{infrastructure}} {{is moving toward}} the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical network, where the wavelength converters are playing major role. The coupling of IP routers with wavelength-selective <b>optical</b> <b>cross-connects</b> supports the <b>optical</b> WDM networking. Because optical wavelength routing is transparent to IP, packets can bypass traditional forwarding and can be routed directly through the <b>optical</b> <b>cross-connects.</b> This results in very high throughput and low delay. This approach shares features with label switching, but wavelengths are a much more scarce resource than labels. Optical switches take larger time to switch than electronic switches, and wavelength conversions are expensive. So wavelength “label ” swapping is not easily done. In an optical environment the Wavelength “label ” assignments must consider the practical limitations of these devices.

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>cross-connects</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components in the dense wavelength division multiplexer based optical networks. The crossconnects suffer from crosstalk due to the different wavelength light path channels during the switching process leading to the deterioration in bit error rate (BER) and hence in the system performance. This paper presents the study of impact of coherent and incoherent crosstalk and power penalty on the <b>optical</b> <b>cross-connects</b> in WDM Networks. The effect of accumulation of coherent crosstalk at different stages of crossconnect has been also investigated and analyzed for the blocking probabilities. Results of coherent and incoherent crosstalk are compared to identify their impact on the working of the cross-connect. The results show that the crosstalk increases with increase in either the number of wavelengths per fiber or the number of input fibers. The result also illustrates decrease in the interference penalty by correlating the crosstalk contributions with each other at the appropriate phase angle. We show that an acceptable blocking probability due to crosstalk is achievable for active wavelengths in the WDM network. The present study can be used to model the possible number of routing stages in such networks. ...|$|R

Then, selected network nodes can perform both waveband as well as traffic grooming operations and our goal is to assess the improvement on network performance brought by these additional capabilities. Specifically, the influence of the MG-OXC multi-granularity on the blocking probability is evaluated for 16 classes of service over a network based on the NSFNet topology. A mechanism of fairness in bandwidth capacity is also added to the connection admission control to manage the blocking probabilities of all kind of bandwidth requirements. Comprehensive computational simulation are carried out to compare eight distinct node architectures, showing that an adequate combination of waveband and single-wavelength ports of the MG-OXCs and OXCs allow a more efficient operation of a WDM optical network carrying multi-rate traffic.
