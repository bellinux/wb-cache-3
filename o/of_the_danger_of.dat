5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club {{and turned it into}} a research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E
5|$|Manstein favoured an {{immediate}} pincer {{attack on the}} Kursk salient after the battle at Kharkov, but Hitler was concerned that such a plan would draw forces away from the industrial region in the Donets Basin. In any event, the ground was still too muddy to move the tanks into position. In lieu of {{an immediate}} attack, the OKH prepared Operation Citadel, the launching {{of which would be}} delayed while more troops were gathered in the area and the mud solidified. Meanwhile, the Red Army, well aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> encirclement, also moved in large numbers of reinforcements, and their intelligence reports revealed the expected locations and timing of the German thrusts.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, {{opened up the}} possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be done. Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, explaining {{the possibility of a}}tomic bombs, and warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> a German nuclear weapon project. He convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it, lending his fame to the proposal. This resulted in support by the U.S. government for research into nuclear fission, which became the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|When the Manhattan Project assumed {{responsibility}} {{for the development of}} nuclear weapons in September 1942, it also assumed {{responsibility for}} the development of suitable countermeasures. At the time, the threat posed by the German nuclear energy project was taken very seriously. Consideration was given to issuing a public warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> a German nuclear attack on the United States, but the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., considered the likelihood of this to be sufficiently remote that he rejected the notion of taking so drastic a step.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, Olga was in Russia at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, in which the Allied or Entente Powers including Russia, Britain and France fought against the Central Powers including Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. She decided to stay in Saint Petersburg and establish a military hospital to support the Russian war effort. Olga created a clinic at Pavlovsk Palace where she cared for wounded soldiers with her sister-in-law, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna. Other members of the imperial family, such as Princess Helen and Olga's granddaughter Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna founded field hospitals at the front. As the war continued, Olga {{became aware of the}} growing crisis in Russia, and attempted to warn Tsarina Alexandra in 1916 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> revolution but the Russian empress refused to listen. A few weeks later, Olga attracted the fury of the Tsarina after signing a petition asking for a pardon for her grandson, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, who had been exiled to the Persian front for his involvement in the assassination of Alexandra's favorite mystic, Grigori Rasputin.|$|E

5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of}} a room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

25|$|The {{rescue effort}} by {{drilling}} was put off on Monday 1 May because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> another collapse. It {{was decided to}} use a raise borer anchored in concrete, with the last load of the concrete being delivered before dawn on Wednesday, 3 May 2006. The machine cut a horizontal tunnel one metre round. Later that day {{it was announced that}} the drilling to go the final 12 metres would commence within hours. At about 6:45 p.m., drilling of a 20cm pilot hole for the raise borer commenced. Using the normal procedure for this machinery, a pilot hole was drilled, for the larger diameter borer to follow. This took more than three days to complete. According to Beaconsfield mine manager Matthew Gill, the quartz rock which was drilled through was 5 times harder than concrete. The drill was capable of drilling through it at 1 metre per hour, but it was going much more slowly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> further rock falls, at a rate of around 460 millimetres per hour.|$|E

25|$|With an {{interest}} in army training and the cadet services, in May 1947 Prior-Palmer moved a new clause to the National Service Bill which would give an incentive {{to those who were}} called up for National Service after achieving a level of efficiency in the cadets. In March 1948 he went on a Parliamentary delegation to East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar). Later that year he warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> invasion of the United Kingdom by air, and urged the creation of a force to tackle it.|$|E
25|$|The disease spread {{rapidly in}} the area, and the local {{government}} hospital was overwhelmed. At that hospital 12 nurses died despite having the world's only Lassa fever isolation ward, according to the U.N. The hospital proved instrumental early on, detecting the first case {{in the country and}} supporting the release of a research paper on Ebola. However, the growing number of cases there led to infection and loss of Sierra Leone's hemorrhagic fever expert, Doctor Khan, and the normal functioning of the hospital was disrupted because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> getting infected by the disease.|$|E
25|$|Despite this conclusion, the German airport {{authorities}} took {{legal action against}} Captain Thain, as the one pilot who had survived the crash.
