In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>role.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August 22, 2016, Yi {{signed a}} one-year, $8 million {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Lakers, returning to the NBA {{for the first time}} since 2012. Lakers head coach Luke Walton considered Yi to be the team's best-shooting big man during the preseason, but did not provide Yi with much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>role.</b> Yi averaged 3.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in 10.7 minutes per game over six contests with the Lakers during the preseason. Feeling he would have better opportunities elsewhere, Yi requested a release from the Lakers prior to the start of the regular season. The Lakers waived him on October 24, 2016.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to England the {{expedition}} was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> they envisaged {{for their own}} National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and had {{opened the way for}} all the expeditions that followed.|$|E

5|$|After her repairs were completed, {{the ship}} {{spent most of}} 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was {{transferred}} to the Far East after the start of the Pacific War in December. Exeter was generally tasked with escorting convoys to and from Singapore during the Malayan Campaign and continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to invade the Dutch East Indies. Later that month, she was assigned to the Striking Force of the joint American-British-Dutch-Australian Command and took on {{a more active role in}} the defence of the Dutch islands. The culmination of this was her participation in the Battle of the Java Sea later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept Japanese invasion convoys. Exeter was crippled early in the battle and did not play much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> as she was forced to withdraw. Two days later, she attempted to escape inbound Japanese forces, but was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the Second Battle of the Java Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{during the}} {{contract}} {{negotiations between the}} city the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise {{could not be reached}} over issues like health insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.|$|E

First, describing the form category and define the linguistics hierarchy in a lingual unit which is contain {{first and second}} persona pronoun on the hadith text translation. Second, describing the function which is residing a lingual unit contains {{the first and the}} second persona pronoun in the hadith translation text. Third, determine the role which is reside in a lingual unit contain the first and the second persona pronoun in the hadith text translation. The sort of this research is qualitative descriptive. The sources of the data are documents or archives about information which is written in the hadith text translation. The method of collecting data in this research is using the method of scrutinize and record. At first the researcher scrutinize the hadith text translation, then identify the data which is contain the first and the second persona pronoun, and then classify and record by identifying the hadith text translation which is contain the first and the second persona pronoun, and the last is analyzing it. The data analysis method is using parable and apportion method. Apportion method is used to describe lingual hierarchy which is contain PP 1 and PP 2 in hadith text translation, and the parable method is used to analyze the function, category, and the role in hadith text translation. There are three results in this thesis, first is linguistics hierarchy and category form in <b>a</b> lingual unit <b>of</b> PP 1 and PP 2 in the hadith text translation that is word and phrase. Lingual unit which contain word cover the word of noun. Lingual unit which contain phrase cover Noun Phrase, Prepotional Phrase, Enclitic, Verb Phrase, Attributive Phrase, and Adjective Phrase. Second, the function that fulfilled by <b>a</b> unit <b>of</b> lingual which is contains of PP 1 and PP 2 are Subject, Predicate, Object, and Complement. Third, the function that fulfilled by <b>a</b> unit <b>of</b> lingual which is contains PP 1 and PP 2 in the hadith translation text are <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> subject, <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> experience, <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> direction/destination, <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> accusative, <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> deed, <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the way, <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> time, <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> participation, and <b>a</b> <b>role</b> comparison...|$|R

By 1881, A & G Murray had become registered as a limited liability company and the running of it was mostly {{in the hands of}} manager Herbert Dixon, who had joined the company in 1876, as the Murray family played less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>role.</b> Under Dixon the company modernised and used new technology and was the reason for the firm's continued success. The use of new, more efficient technologies resulted in the further reduction of the workforce so that by 1897, A & G Murray only employed 500 people. In 1887, Fireproof Mill and Doubling Mill were leased by A & G Murray Ltd to C E Bennet.|$|E
5|$|Rivera was a {{dominant}} reliever throughout his career, pitching with a consistency and longevity uncharacteristic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> commonly marked by volatility and high turnover. In his 17-year tenure as the Yankees' closer, Rivera compiled considerable career numbers. A 13-time All-Star, {{he is the}} major leagues' all-time regular season leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). He pitched in 1,115 regular season games, which is fourth-most in MLB history, the most in AL history, and the most by a right-handed pitcher. Rivera holds or shares several records for the most seasons of reaching various save milestones, including seasons with at least: 20 saves (sixteen); 25 saves (fifteen consecutive, sixteen non-consecutive); 30 saves (nine consecutive, fifteen non-consecutive); 35 saves (twelve); 40 saves (nine); and 50 saves (two). Rivera's career ERA (2.21) and WHIP (1.00) are the lowest of any MLB pitcher in the live-ball era (minimum 1,000 innings pitched), making {{him one of the}} top pitchers since 1920 at preventing hitters from reaching base and scoring. He recorded an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, tying him with Walter Johnson for the most such seasons (minimum 60innings pitched each). Rivera also ranks first in career adjusted ERA+ (205), a statistic that adjusts ERA for league and ballpark to allow comparisons of pitchers on the same baseline.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{head of the}} Exchequer {{for much}} of its {{existence}} was the Lord High Treasurer, who was tasked with collecting royal revenues. Originally a clerk, he was supervised by the Chief Justiciar, and only became head of the court after this position was abolished {{during the reign of}} Henry III. During the reign of Elizabeth I the Treasurer's other duties began to increase, and he played less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the Exchequer's affairs. By the 17th century, the Lord High Treasurer had been replaced by a dedicated Treasurer of the Exchequer (although earlier writs show that the Lord High Treasurer had been independently given this title), who was ceremoniously presented with a white staff by the monarch. The Treasurer, while active in the revenue side of the Exchequer, played little or no active role in the Exchequer of Pleas.|$|E
