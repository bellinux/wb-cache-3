Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) {{is set to}} marry Abigail (Anastasia Griffith) in two days. Snow White wishes there were {{a way to get}} Charming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> as she is still in love with him. Red suggests she see Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) and Snow takes her advice. Rumpelstiltskin takes some water and a piece of Snow's hair to make a potion that will make her forget Charming. He warns that love is a powerful disease and the cure must be extreme.|$|E
5|$|We were {{supposed}} to be with her in the studio for a couple of days. She kindly invited us to stay a little longer. We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
25|$|In reality, Faith {{was stolen}} by Nick's brother Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), {{who gave her}} to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) to raise as her own after he caused Ashley to miscarry. Without {{knowledge}} of this, Sharon romanced and married Adam. After reuniting with Faith, Nick and Sharon grew even closer. Nick and Phyllis broke up and got a divorce, leading him to reunite with Sharon. He proposed to her, and she accepted. However, Sharon could not get Adam <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and slept with him in New Orleans. Nick left Sharon after she cheated, {{and she began to}} devote her time to get charges against Adam for the murder of his ex-wife Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone).|$|E

25|$|A {{locomotive}} cut {{the car in}} half, killing {{my father}} instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, {{as if trying to}} discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E
25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|At half-past seven, Kate met Mrs. Lacy in the school-room, {{read the}} Psalms and Second Lesson, and learnt some answers to {{questions}} on the Catechism, to be repeated to Lady Barbara on a Sunday. For so far from playing at cards in a bird-of-paradise turban all Sunday, the aunts were quite as particular about these things as Mr. Wardour-- more inconveniently so, the countess thought; for he always let her answer his examinations <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>head,</b> and never gave her answers to learn by heart; [...] "Answers that I know before quite well," [...] said Kate, [...] "only not made tiresome with fine words." ...|$|R

'Father {{and mother}} kept Berta to school, you understand, sir,' {{explained}} the more thoughtful Sol, 'because {{she was such}} a quick child, and they always had a notion of making a governess <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Sums?

50|$|She {{is further}} terrified {{to see that}} she is wearing a blood-stained blue dress, which {{contains}} in one of its pockets $10,000.

60|$|She {{had written}} her letter with great care. When {{the offer was}} made to her, she could not bring herself to throw Lady Amelia to the winds and marry the man, as it were, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>head.</b> Lady Amelia had been the tyrant <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life, and so she strove hard to obtain her tyrant's permission. She used all her little cunning in showing that, after all, Mr Gazebee was not so very plebeian. All her little cunning was utterly worthless. Lady Amelia's mind was too strong to be caught with such chaff. Augusta could not serve God and Mammon. She must either be true to the god <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cousin's idolatry, and remain single, or serve the Mammon <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own inclinations, and marry Mr Gazebee.|$|R

It's to call ME--it's never used for anything else. She taught it to me, {{and told me}} what it says: 'IT IS I, SOLDIER--COME!' and when those thrilling notes come floating down the distance I hear them without fail, even if I am two miles away; and then--oh, then you should see my heels get down to business! ...|$|R
60|$|Lawrence's walks, {{although}} very invigorating {{on account}} of the fine, sharp air, were not entirely cheering, for they gave him an opportunity to think that he was making no progress whatever in his attempt to study the character of Junius Keswick. He had entrusted the search for that gentleman's address to Mr Candy's cashier, who had informed him, most opportunely, that she was about to set out on a wedding tour, and that she had possessed herself of clues of much value which could be readily followed up in connection with the projected journey. But a fortnight or more had elapsed without his hearing anything from her, and he had {{come to the conclusion that}} hymeneal joys must have driven all thoughts <b>of</b> business <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|The anxious {{expression}} on her face deepened as she listened to one of anguish and despair; and then, almost before I concluded, she suddenly lifted her hands to <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> uttering a low, sobbing cry, and would have fallen on the rock had I not caught her quickly in my arms. Once more in my arms--against my breast, her proper place! But now all that bright life seemed gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her; <b>her</b> <b>head</b> fell on my shoulder, and there was no motion in her except at intervals a slight shudder in her frame accompanied by a low, gasping sob. In a little while the sobs ceased, the eyes were closed, the face still and deathly white, and with a terrible anxiety in my heart I carried her down to the cave.|$|R

60|$|Gyp {{began to}} play the dance. The pale blurr in the {{darkness}} stirred. The moonlight fell on the girl now, standing with arms spread, holding out her drapery--a white, winged statue. Then, like a gigantic moth she fluttered forth, blanched and noiseless flew over the grass, spun and hovered. The moonlight etched <b>out</b> the shape <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> painted <b>her</b> hair with pallid gold. In the silence, with that unearthly gleam of colour along the sunflowers and on the girl's head, {{it was as if}} a spirit had dropped into the garden and was fluttering to and fro, unable to get out.|$|R

I hate her character, her feelings, and herself [...] when I am away from her, but she interests me when I am with her, and [...] to see her poor careworn face is dismal, in spite of reason and [...] speculation upon her extraordinary conduct. She appears to me in a [...] state very (little) short of insanity, and my aunt describes it as at [...] times having been decidedly so."] ...|$|R
60|$|IT {{was blowing}} a {{moderate}} gale, and the “Aurania,” steaming {{at full speed}} into it, rolled viciously. A half‐moon shone out low down beneath wisps of whirling cloud, and the big black seas shook their frothing crests high aloft against the silvery light as they swept in long succession <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the night. The steamer met them with dipping forecastle from which the spray blew aft in clouds, lurched and hove her streaming bows high above the froth, rolled until one rail seemed level with the sea, and slid down into the hollow, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> which <b>her</b> <b>head</b> swung slowly up to meet the onslaught of the next. Bitter spray was flying everywhere, her decks ran water; {{but it was only}} between foremast and forecastle head she shipped it in cascades, and little groups of passengers stood where they could find shelter. They had finished their dinner with some difficulty, and because the vessel rolled so that it was not an easy task to keep one’s seat or footing had found their attempts to amuse themselves below a waste of effort.|$|R
