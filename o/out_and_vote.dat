2500|$|In 1965 Alice Wainwright, who was {{the first}} woman to serve on the Miami City Commission, decided to not seek re-election. Athalie Range became a {{candidate}} for the vacant seat, the first African-American to run for the City Commission. She won a plurality in the primary election, although not a majority. In the runoff election, Range's opponent, a white man named Irwin Christie, sent a sound truck through white neighborhoods the day before the election broadcasting the message that if the white people did not get <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>vote,</b> they would have a black woman making laws for them. Athalie Range would later say, [...] "His campaign decided to play the race card, which took me out of contention." [...] Many black voters had been allowed to take time off from work to vote in the primary, but were not allowed to do so for the runoff. Range lost the runoff, receiving about 17,000 votes, while Christie received about 18,000. Christie later apologized to Range for the way he had run his campaign, and she accepted the apology.Dunn.

40|$|I {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} uncertainty about candidates' ideological positions and institutionally imposed costs of voting on the likelihood that an individual turns <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>votes.</b> I do this using a simple model of turnout <b>and</b> <b>vote</b> choice that reflects the combined, simultaneous nature of vote decision-making. I show {{that the impact of}} eliminating the registration deadline and instituting DMV registration in the 1972 - 2000 presidential elections would have been less than that of eliminating uncertainty. Furthermore, I show that these changes would have had quite different impacts on the outcome of each election. The increased number of votes due to eliminating registration deadlines would generally have advantaged the Democratic candidates whereas the increased number of votes due to eliminating uncertainty would have advantaged candidates of both parties fairly equally {{over the course of the}} elections studied. This suggests that it may be more feasible to increase turnout with policies that aim to reduce uncertainty rather than with policies that aim to reduce registration barriers...|$|R

40|$|Available online 29 April 2016 This paper {{analyses}} how disaffection {{with the}} EU influenced individuals' likelihood of turning <b>out</b> to <b>vote</b> <b>and</b> of casting {{a vote for}} a Eurosceptic party in the 2014 EP elections, and how these relationships were moderated by the Eurosceptic partisan supply of each country. We argue that {{the degree to which}} political parties oppose European integration, as well as the ideological leaning of Eurosceptic parties, should influence both the likelihood of disaffected citizens turning <b>out</b> to <b>vote,</b> <b>and</b> their likelihood of voting for a Eurosceptic party. Our empirical findings show that, {{in the presence of a}} party that is strongly opposed to European integration, disaffected citizens are more likely to turn <b>out</b> to <b>vote</b> <b>and</b> to <b>vote</b> for a Eurosceptic party provided that this party also shares their ideological leaning in the left-right dimension. These results indicate that Eurosceptic parties are important actors for the politicization of the European integration conflict and for the Europeanization of EP elections, but, at the same time, they suggest that opposition to European integration is subordinate to the traditional left-right conflict.

After the results were announced Campbell stated, [...] "People were tired of the status quo government - that's the folks who came <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>voted</b> for us.

25|$|He {{returned}} to Great Britain in 1767, where he once more {{became involved in}} the politics of the East India Company. He had previously been {{one of a number of}} his family to support Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive in 1764, but by 1767 Clive was persecuting George's brother John Johnstone, who was at this time a member of the company's council in Bengal. George Johnstone spoke <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>voted</b> against Clive, gaining a reputation as an orator. He sought election to Parliament on the back of this reputation, and after securing the patronage of Sir James Lowther was elected to represent Cockermouth in 1768. He became part of the parliamentary group supporting Lowther's interests, and retained his membership after his election to the constituency of Appleby in 1774. He continued to be active in the politics of the East India Company, using his parliamentary position to make speeches attacking the North Ministry's schemes for Indian reform, and laying the blame for the chaos in Bengal at Clive's door. He found favour for doing so with the company's court of proprietors, who made him chair of a proprietary committee aiming to block plans for company reform. Despite these efforts, the Prime Minister, Lord North, was able to pass an act regulating the East India Company in 1773.|$|R
