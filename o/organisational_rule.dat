Effective monitoring is crucial for successful development of staff in the organisation. Staffing metrics {{provide insight into the}} quality of monitoring, informing the organisations about the performance of its own staff. A study of staff evaluation was conducted at the Faculty of Quantitatives Sciences, Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), to monitor staff performances in faculties based on metrics that will be a guideline to lead monitoring through five major issues: Self Improvement, Decision Making, Communicativeness, Teaching, and Research. Through questionnaires and interviews, the statistical analysis provided output in the context of how work culture among lecturers have been practised during the monitoring process. For this purpose, the delevoped Staff Evaluation and Monitoring Programme (StEMP) was modified to process the metrics value and visualise information, such as percentage of work done by lecturer by category. Then, the output could be used to support decision-making activities by the faculty. As a conclusion, this study explains how the metrics were used to assist the monitoring process and measure lecturers’ performance periodically...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{architecture}} of a multi-agent system can naturally {{be viewed as}} a computational organisation. For this reason, we believe organisational abstractions should {{play a central role in}} the analysis and design of such systems. To this end, the concepts of agent roles and role models are increasingly being used to specify and design multi-agent systems. However, this is not the full picture. In this paper we introduce three additional organisational concepts — <b>organisational</b> <b>rules,</b> <b>organisational</b> structures, and organisational patterns — that we believe are necessary for the complete specification of computational organisations. We view the introduction of these concepts as a step towards a comprehensive methodology for agent-oriented systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} of building processes is related {{not only to}} the level of performance required but also to their organizational structure. Conditions of turbulence in which constructors operate on site closely interact with the performance of the construction process and particularly with the risk of non-conformance of a building to the performances required. Interaction is characterised by the stability of the organisational structure or its capacity to adapt to environmental variability. A technical risk organisational factor analysis in construction processes can lead construction management to design organisational structures capable of reacting to environmental conditions in which "on site" production operations develop, and also able to increase the {{reliability of}} the building process. Working on organisational interfaces can lead not only to changes in detail design, but also in performances required to each operator, in order to obtain higher efficiency levels. Based on case studies conducted on sequential organisational structures of the building process, a set of <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> is proposed for implementation in experimental "lean construction" processes. <b>Organisational</b> <b>rules</b> based on risk organisational factors analysis can lead to the designing of a "lean" organizational structure of construction processes.

40|$|Corporate {{responsibility}} (CR) {{has often}} been criticised as a decoupled organisational phenomenon: a publicly espoused rule that is not followed in daily organisational practices. We argue that a crucial reason for this criticism arises from the dominant in-house assumption of CR literature, which mitigates tensions and contradictions in organisational life by claiming that integrated rules result in coupled practices. We aim to provide new insights by problematising this in-house assumption and by examining how members of two organisations discursively make sense of CR, as a daily rule-bound practice, via three strategies: integration, differentiation and fragmentation. We elaborate the contemporary literature on CR as a daily organisational practice by examining the significance of discursive sensemaking for <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> for further development and learning regarding CR. We then discuss the significance of our results for understanding CR as a coupled/decoupled phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A safety policy {{defines the}} set of rules that governs the safe {{interaction}} of agents operating together {{as part of a}} system of systems (SoS). Agent autonomy can give rise to unpredictable, and potentially undesirable, emergent behaviour. Deriving rules of safety policy requires an understanding of the capabilities of an agent as well as how its actions affect the environment and consequently the actions of others. Methods for multi-agent system design can aid in this understanding. Such approaches mention <b>organisational</b> <b>rules.</b> However, there is little discussion about how they are derived. This paper proposes modelling systems according to three viewpoints: an agent viewpoint, a causal viewpoint and a domain viewpoint. The agent viewpoint captures system capabilities and inter-relationships. The causal viewpoint describes the effect an agent’s actions has on its environment as well as inter-agent influences. The domain viewpoint models assumed properties of the operating environment...|$|R

Using an interpretative phenomenological methodology for the study analysis, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with telephone agents working in a call centre outlet in Lagos state, Nigeria. Based on the emotional labour theory, enquires were made about general outcomes experienced from conforming to <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> of emotional management during customer service encounters. Findings confirmed that the adversarial impact of affective conformity tends to threaten the positive intentions of these mandatory components of service work. Thus, a proposed theoretical model emerged from the study’s interpretive accounts Based on these significant research findings, detailed practical implications were discussed on ways in which call centre businesses operating in a non-Western context can extenuate poor affective deliveries arising from mismanagement of emotional labour...|$|R

40|$|International audienceConstructing {{rules for}} work that foster both {{health and safety}} and {{efficient}} production entails, in many organisations, the introduction of procedures, tools and techniques implemented by specialists. The purpose {{of this is to}} combat the amateur practices and lack of expertise supposedly found not only amongst employees, but also in their managers. This chapter argues that, on the contrary, field managers possess knowledge about working conditions and are actors who are necessarily involved in organising those conditions as well as the work of their teams. In so doing, they protect employees from or expose them to the real and varying circumstances of work. This is the role that needs to be reinforced in order for safety rules to become a real part of work cultures and working practices. However, the forms of power in organisations increasingly limit the recognition of this expertise in the work of managers. The chapter advocates the importance of giving managers power to set situated <b>organisational</b> <b>rules,</b> instead of making these the exclusive prerogative of central management departments...|$|R

30|$|Argyris (1977) {{mentions}} the double bind {{between the two}} <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> “hide errors” and “reveal errors”. In both cases, the employee {{runs the risk of}} punishment – either for not revealing the error if it is discovered later or for revealing it, as this brings the group and the organisation in trouble or it damages “just” him-/herself because of being blamed to name the error and thereby de-mask the superficially intact brilliant surface which has to stay untouched in a double bind-system. In such a system any detection or correction of errors is, according to Argyris (1977), highly unlikely. He also cites a practical case where organisational members just scratched the surface of a problem instead of getting {{to the bottom of the}} problem at hand in order to avoid naming their real intentions. A member of this process is cited by Argyris (1977) with the words: “Why don’t they say that they want to control this place?” The answer would be: because the double bind-play’s core purpose is exactly to disguise the root of its one and only reason: to control processes and others to reign over them.|$|R
40|$|Political {{parties are}} {{essential}} institutions {{for the proper}} functioning of a democratic society and perform important functions {{for the promotion of}} democracy by mobilizing citizens and linking them to government. In order to effectively carry out these functions, political parties are expected to incorporate these ideals in their own internal processes and functioning. Intra-party democracy, as an element of participatory democracy, is widely perceived as necessary {{for the development of a}} democratic culture in the wider society. The attainment of these democratic ideals depends on the extent to which processes of effective membership participation are formally stipulated in the <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> and practically implemented in political party processes. This paper examines the state of internal party democracy among political parties in East Africa. It seeks to expand existing knowledge on intra-party democracy in Africa with specific reference to how processes of institutionalisation, inclusiveness and (de) centralisation influence levels of participatory democracy among political parties in the region.

In a mentoring relationship there are two actors, a mentor and a mentee.

The author examines {{the transformation of the}} mentor, mentee and their social environment as well as the process of transmission of knowledge. She points out that the significance of a mentoring relationship lies less in the transmission of knowledge than in the mentor’s and mentee’s joint creation of new knowledge. She stresses the importance of action, the main drive for learning. A mentoring relationship includes communication and reciprocity as well as transmission of knowledge by means of predominantly non-informal edu- cational programmes, as well as learning and relationship building. It has several phases, some of which are more interactive than others, with more cognitive dissonance and with richer emotions...|$|R

The examination of different definitions of talent management and knowledge management {{is crucial for}} capturing their practical impact on central human resource development practices such as education, training, and development. The main aim of the paper is to identify key factors that describe the main approaches to talent management (TM) and ensuring knowledge continuity (EKC), based on analysis of current approaches of organisations in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The results reveal three possible approaches to employees and organisational development. The first type of organisation develops employees within their own <b>organisational</b> <b>rules,</b> {{the second type of}} organisation does not support development of employees in any way, and the third type of organisation does not affect employees’ development but the employees develop themselves - these can be characterized as ‘knowledge employees’. The paper identifies the practical benefits for organisations resulting from talent management and ensuring knowledge continuity. Knowledge continuity and its development guarantee that knowledge is retained within an organisation. Knowledge needs to be transferred to relevant successors who can participate in a talent management programme...|$|R

We explore the phenomenon in four technology-focused and research leading (in the national context) universities in Estonia, India, Portugal and the UK. We argue that participants in interactions (despite {{the fact that they}} maintain their core operations in different institutional fields) possess common knowledge bases, and shared norms and cognitive frameworks. In many cases however, the emergence of <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> to facilitate interactions do not lead to the institutionalisation of the processes at work: restricting the scope of both existing interactions and their advancement and offering a central role to nonpracticing entities.

40|$|In {{advancing}} the intellectual debate in gender equity and {{diversity in the}} construction industry, feminist institutionalism is {{being used as a}} new lens to understand the failure of formal policies to shift the intransigent gender imbalance. Feminist institutionalism allows new insights into how hidden informal <b>organisational</b> <b>rules,</b> practices and narratives operate in conjunction with formal rules in achieving gender diversity and equity. However, the adoption of feminist institutionalism as a conceptual framework raises new methodological questions. While formal rules are created, communicated and enforced through official and highly visible channels, informal rules, norms and procedures are created, communicated, and enforced outside officially sanctioned channels and are often &# 39;hidden&# 39; from view. The power of ethnographic methods to reveal such &# 39;under-the-surface&# 39; institutions is well established in the social and political sciences but not in construction. This paper makes a methodological contribution in response to the practical constraints of doing ethnography in the construction industry, by describing the merits of rapid ethnography within the context of feminist institutionalism. It concludes that while rapid ethnography has its limitations, it has significant potential as an unexplored methodology to tackle the persistent problem of gender equality in the construction industry and other social issues in construction management research...|$|R

Drawing on the view of management accounting as <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> and routines, it aims to suggest various ways in which inertia can become more pronounced when new accounting rules challenge existing routines. Design/methodology/approach – A longitudinal case study was conducted {{at one of the}} largest banks in The Netherlands. This bank introduced a program called “Results Oriented Management”, which produced various new management accounting rules. Findings – The paper identifies various ways in which inertia manifested itself when new management accounting rules were introduced. Moreover, the paper shows that ambiguity and contradictions {{play an important role in}} the presence of inertia. Research limitations/implications – The identification of individual-level habits and scripts is a difficult undertaking. Through a focus on the performative and ostensive aspects of routines, some of the processes of inertia and change on an individual level are identified. This is a relevant method for students of management accounting change. Originality/value – Although it is well known that routines can produce inertia, the process by which this inertia is manifested and how this affects the adoption of new management accounting rules is still unclear.

40|$|Research {{over the}} last decade on local {{government}} in South Africa has highlighted that some municipal councils under the political leadership of the Africa National Congress (ANC) have shown weak political leadership, coupled with strong patronage systems, rent-seeking and corruption which have {{had an impact on the}} institutional functionality of municipalities in South Africa. Although patronage politics have been predominantly used to analyse the dynamics of post-apartheid local government ANC politics and councillor representation, this prevents us from understanding the representational focus of ANC councillors in decision-making processes. This paper offers an ethnographic insight into experiences of ANC councillors and the political complexities involved in council decision-making. Using ethnographic research, this paper will analyse how a political decision by the ANC provincial party, which was supported by the ANC regional party at local level – to erect a statue of Nelson Mandela in one of the municipalities in the Northern Cape – generated tensions amongst ANC councillors who strongly viewed their primary role as promoters of better ‘service delivery’ rather than approving the allocation of scarce municipal resources for erecting a statue. The paper reveals how the dominant presence of ANC sub-regional structures at local level contribute to the complex interaction of both ANC party political and municipal <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> and norms that influence and shape councillors’ choices in decision-making. ...|$|R
50|$|Interpretation of {{graphics}} is loosely {{analogous to}} the process of reading text, while generation of graphics is the counterpart of writing text. However, these analogies are imperfect, as text and graphics are based on very different symbol systems. For example, whereas text is structured according to formal <b>organisational</b> <b>rules</b> that apply irrespective of the content, {{this is not the case}} for graphics. With text structure, the units of information (words) are expected to be organised according to broad conventions (such as being sequenced in orderly rows starting from top left and progressing down the page). However graphics are not subject to a similarly stringent set of structural conventions. Instead, it is the content itself that largely determines the nature of the graphic entities and the way they are arranged. For example, the form and spatial arrangement of the items that comprise the actual subject matter being represented in the graphic are used as the basis for the graphic entities and structure that are displayed in the graphic. This is not the case with written text where the words and their arrangement bear no resemblance to the represented subject matter.Because of these and other fundamental differences between text and graphics, it is appropriate that the processes involved in comprehension and production of graphics are clearly distinguished from those involved in comprehension and production of text.|$|R
