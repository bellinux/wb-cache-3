5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, Peterson {{had become one}} of the largest home {{electronics}} dealerships in Portland, alongside Smith's Home Furnishings, Stereo Super Stores, Montgomery Ward and Sears. Peterson went on to open stores in Eugene, Gresham, Hillsboro, North Portland and as far away as Spokane, Washington but later closed these stores, citing an inability to offer the personal service by appearing on the floor alongside his sales staff. The Petersons' children also worked in the business, daughter Kathy as a personnel manager and son Keith as a partner in an affiliated electronics import-export business, <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Boston.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1943, Lockwood had {{received}} enough reports from submarine officers to convince him the Mark 6 was significantly flawed. On 24 June 1943, he formally ordered all submarines <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Pearl Harbor to deactivate the magnetic influence feature. However, Christie was still committed to the exploder, and ordered Fremantle boats to continue using the influence feature. Submarines operating between the two commands were required to either enable or disable it, depending on which command area they were in. This difference of opinion strained {{relations between the two}} admirals.|$|E

5|$|In May 1934, {{following}} {{reports of}} a Japanese spy <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Dutch Harbor, the United States Navy dispatched Edwin T.

The result {{of this investigation was}} the arrest of the only Japanese man in the region, as well as the town's only prostitute, a woman accused of conspiring with the Japanese man. During the 1930s, a number of United States governmental committees, boards and reports concluded that air bases in the Aleutians would be for the most part impractical due to the region's inclement weather.|$|E

5|$|With {{the plans}} purchased, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began the {{intricate}} political negotiations to assign the six boats—to be designated U-27 to U-32—between Austrian and Hungarian firms. Of the initial order of six boats, two were {{allocated to the}} Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Pola Navy Yard, and the balance to the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius in Fiume. The Navy ordered the first six boats of the class on 12 October 1915.|$|E
5|$|Arriving {{back in the}} United States in 1919, {{she began}} to {{undertake}} training and patrol duties, including at one point to the Caribbean {{with a number of}} other U.S. ships. During this year, she also saw a refit in Norfolk Navy Yard where five 5-inch guns were removed and three additional 3-inch/50 caliber AA guns were added, bringing the total to five. The secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch/51 caliber guns. In late 1919, she sailed to the Pacific Ocean and joined the newly formed United States Pacific Fleet. She continued to conduct training and patrol duties in the Pacific until the mid-1930s when she was transferred again to the Atlantic, and began <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the North Atlantic, with the exception of several occasional trips to the West Coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Gordon, <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Khartoum, helped extricate many loyal {{civilians who}} {{remained}} in Sudan, but refused ultimately to abandon the city. Contrary to his orders, he retained a small force in Khartoum and determined to give battle with the Mahdi before relinquishing control. Accordingly, Mahdist forces besieged Khartoum in March 1884, isolating the city {{from the outside world}} and placing a dire timer upon Gordon to surrender. After much delay, the British government reluctantly dispatched a relief expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley that would rapidly follow the Nile to Khartoum. Wolseley's column arrived on 28 January 1885, two days after Khartoum had fallen and General Charles Gordon's head delivered to the Mahdi.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1946, McAloney was {{involved}} in an investigation {{into a series of}} engine failures experienced by RAAF aircraft. The inquiry led him to visit operational and transport units throughout Australia, in an attempt to determine whether the issues were the result of substandard maintenance or defective components. He returned to his duties at the Directorate of Technical Services on the investigation's conclusion. Made squadron leader in March 1950, he attended a land/air warfare course the following year. McAloney was posted to Singapore in June 1952 as the technical officer to the Changi-based No.90 (Composite) Wing, formed specifically for service in the Malayan Emergency. The attachment proved short lived with the disbandment of No.90 Wing in December, at which point McAloney transferred to No.1 Squadron, then <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Tengah.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the razing of the Citadel of Saigon, Định organised his local levies into a guerrilla force that initially numbered between 500 and 1000 men, <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Thuan Kieu. They were armed with bladed spears, fire lances, knives, sabres, bamboo sticks and swords, trained and on call as necessary. As a local notable who was respected for his leadership and military ability, Định naturally assumed a lead role in the partisan movement that responded to Tự Đức's appeals for popular resistance against European aggression. In the initial phase of the conflict, the local militias concentrated on evacuating the populace from areas that had {{been taken over by}} the French, while urging those who chose to stay to not cooperate with the Europeans. Snipers were deployed into French areas to assassinate isolated soldiers.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{outreach}} {{efforts are}} coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, {{which was established}} in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program. To that end, STScI operates the HubbleSite.org website. The Hubble Heritage Project, <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images {{of the most interesting}} and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and emphasizes the aesthetic nature of Hubble images. The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full-color image.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{aircraft}} {{first met}} US aircraft in combat during the Battle of Suwon Airfield, in which {{seven of the}} 13 North Korean aircraft were destroyed. The North Korean Lavochkin La-7 and Ilyushin Il-10 aircraft were easily outmatched by the superior North American F-82 Twin Mustang and F-80C Shooting Star aircraft, which also had better-trained pilots. The planes of the 8th Fighter Wing, which were attempting to defend Suwon to allow evacuation of UN civilians encountered repeated harassing attacks from North Korean aircraft <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Heijo Airfield in Pyongyang. Heijo was the KPAF's main base, but {{in the first few}} days in the war the US aircraft only had authorization to defend themselves if attacked, they could not conduct offensive operations into North Korea.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 1848 the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad—Chicago's first railroad—began <b>operating</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a depot on {{the west}} side of the Chicago River, near the corner of Canal and Kinzie Streets. Though the City of Chicago had {{authorized}} the railroad to construct a bridge across the north branch of the river as early as July 17, 1848, it was not until 1851 that the railroad began to purchase the land needed to build the Wells Street Station to the east of the river. In order to access the new station a floating pontoon bridge designed by Jenks D. Perkins was built across the north branch at roughly the same location as the earlier pedestrian bridge. This bridge—the first railroad bridge in Chicago—was completed in 1852, allowing trains to access the railroad's new Wells Street Station and subsequently industry on the north bank of the Chicago River as far as the Ogden Slip and Navy Pier.|$|E
