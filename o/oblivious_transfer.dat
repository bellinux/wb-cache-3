40|$|We show an {{efficient}} secure two-party protocol, based on Yao’s construction, which provides security against malicious adversaries.

Our construction is based on applying cut-and-choose techniques to the original circuit and inputs. Security is proved according to the ideal/real simulation paradigm, and the proof is in the standard model (with no random oracle model or common reference string assumptions). The resulting protocol is computationally efficient: the only usage of asymmetric cryptography is for running O(1) <b>oblivious</b> <b>transfers</b> for each input bit (or for each bit of a statistical security parameter, whichever is larger).

40|$|Many {{deployments}} of secure multi-party computation (MPC) {{in practice}} have used information-theoretic three-party protocols that tolerate a single, semi-honest corrupt party, since these protocols enjoy very high efficiency. We propose {{a new approach}} for secure three-party computation (3 PC) that improves security while maintaining practical efficiency that is competitive with traditional information-theoretic protocols. Our protocol is based on garbled circuits and provides security against a single, malicious corrupt party. Unlike information-theoretic 3 PC protocols, ours uses a constant number of rounds. Our protocol only uses inexpensive symmetric-key cryptography: hash functions, block ciphers, pseudorandom generators (in particular, no <b>oblivious</b> <b>transfers)</b> and has performance that is {{comparable to that of}} Yao’s (semi-honest) 2 PC protocol. We demonstrate the practicality of our protocol with an implementation based on the JustGarble framework of Bellare et al. (S&P 2013). The implementation incorporates various optimizations including the most recent techniques for efficient circuit garbling. We perform experiments on several benchmarking circuits, in different setups.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{framework}} to design secure two-party computation protocols for exponentiation over integers and over ZQ where Q is a publicly-known prime. Using our framework, we realize efficient protocols in the semi-honest setting. Assuming {{the base is}} non-zero, and the exponent is at most Q/ 2 for the ZQ case, our protocols consist of at most 5 rounds (each party sending 5 messages) and the total communication consists of a small constant number (≤ 18) of encrypted/encoded elements in ZQ. Without these assumptions, our protocols are still more efficient than a protocol recently proposed by Damg˚ard et al. in TCC 2006 (24 vs. > 114 rounds, ≈ 279 ℓ+ 12 t for an error rate of 2 −t vs. > 110 ℓ log ℓ secure multiplications, where ℓ is the bit length of the shares). Our protocols are constructed from different instantiations of our framework with different assumptions (homomorphic encryption or <b>oblivious</b> <b>transfers)</b> to achieve different advantages. Our key idea is to exploit the properties of both additive and multiplicative secret sharing.

40|$|Abstract. The Cut-and-choose {{paradigm}} gives by far {{the most}} popular and efficient secure two-party computation protocols in the standard malicious model, able to offer s bits of security with only s copies of garbled circuits in the one-time execution scenario [33]. Nielsen, Orlandi et al. [48, 13] have even proposed the seminal idea of LEGO-style cut-and-choose to further reduce the number of circuit copies to less than s while still keep constant round complexity. However, a substantial gap still exists between the theoretical idea of LEGO cut-and-choose and a practical implementation, e. g., [48] is not compatible with free-XOR and uses expensive asymmetric key operations for soldering, while [13] leaves the important building-block of soldering unspecified. In this work, we introduce XOR-Homomorphic Interactive Hash and propose an efficient implemen-tation of this primitive by combining Reed-Solomon encoding and k-out-of-n <b>oblivious</b> <b>transfers.</b> We show how to apply this primitive to solve the performance-critical wire-soldering problem and propose a new LEGO-style cut-and-choose protocol. Comparing to previous LEGO-style protocols, ours only requires a single (as opposed to “a majority of”) correctly garbled gate in each bucket to guarantee security against malicious adversaries. Plus, through integrating Half-Gates garbling, we double the chance a “bad ” gate being detected in the check stage (compared to MiniLEGO [13]). Our constructio...|$|R

The proof can be based on any bit commitment scheme with {{a particular set of}} properties. We suggest an efficient implementation based on factoring. We also present a 4 -move perfect zero-knowledge interactive argument for any NP-language L. On input x 2 L, the communication complexity is O(jxj c) Δ max(k; l) bits, where l is the security parameter for the prover 1.

Results for general computations follow from this. As a function of the security parameters, our protocols have the smallest known asymptotic communication complexity among general proofs or arguments for NP.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new steganographic {{paradigm}} for digital images in raster formats.

This type of embedding {{will lead to more}} secure schemes because now the attacker must distinguish statistical anomalies that might be created by the embedding process from those introduced during the image acquisition itself. Unlike previously proposed schemes, this new approach, that we call stochastic modulation, achieves <b>oblivious</b> data <b>transfer</b> without using noise extraction algorithms or error correction. This leads to higher capacity (up to 0. 8 bits per pixel) and a convenient and simple implementation with low embedding and extraction complexity. But most importantly, because the embedding noise can have arbitrary properties that approximate a given device noise, the new method offers better security than existing methods. At the end of this paper, we extend stochastic modulation to a content-dependent device noise and we also discuss possible attacks on this scheme based on the most recent advances in steganalysis...|$|R
