40|$|Objective: To compare {{effectiveness}} {{and costs of}} gauze-based vs <b>occlusive,</b> moist-environment <b>dressing</b> principles. Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Patients: Two hundred eighty-five hospitalized surgical patients with open wounds. Intervention: Patients received occlusive (ie, foams, alginates, hydrogels, hydrocolloids, hydrofibers, or films) or gauze-based dressings until their wounds were completely healed. Main Outcome Measures: Primary end points were complete wound healing, pain during dressing changes, and costs. Secondary end point was length of hospital stay. Results: Time to complete wound healing {{did not differ significantly}} between occlusive (median, 66 days; interquartile range [IQR], 29 - 133 days) and gauze-based dressing groups (median, 45 days; IQR, 26 - 106 days; log-rank P =. 31). Postoperative wounds (62 % of the wounds included) healed significantly (P =. 02) quicker using gauze dressings (median, 45 days; IQR, 22 - 93 days vs median, 72 days; IQR, 36 - 132 days). Median pain scores were low and similar in the occlusive (0. 90; IQR, 0. 29 - 2. 34) and the gauze (0. 64; IQR, 0. 22 - 1. 95) groups (P = 32). Daily costs of occlusive materials were significantly higher (occlusive, (sic) 6. 34 [US $ 9. 95] vs gauze, (sic) 1. 85 [US $ 2. 90]; P <. 001), but nursing time costs per day were significantly higher when gauze was used (occlusive, (sic) 1. 28 [US $ 2. 01] vs gauze, (sic) 2. 41 [US $ 3. 78]; P <. 001). Total cost for local wound care per patient per day during hospitalization was (sic) 7. 48 (US $ 11. 74) in the occlusive group and (sic) 3. 98 (US $ 6. 25) in the gauze-based group (P =. 002). Conclusions: The <b>occlusive,</b> moist-environment <b>dressing</b> principle in the clinical surgical setting does not lead to quicker wound healing or less pain than gauze dressings. The lower costs of less frequent dressing changes do not balance the higher costs of occlusive materials. Trial Registration: trialregister. nl Identifier: 5626473...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVETo compare <b>occlusive</b> {{hydrocolloid}} <b>dressing</b> (OHD; Karayahesive) and {{gauze dressing}} (GD) {{with regard to}} the cost and incidence of wound infection after abdominal surgery. METHODSA total of 134 patients who underwent incisions were randomized to have their wounds dressed with either OHD or GD. OHD was left on until the sutures were removed, and GD was changed everyday postoperatively. The cost calculations represent the number of dressings required for each treatment group as determined by the frequency of required dressing changes and cost per dressing. RESULTSThere were no differences between the groups regarding the need for dressings to be changed or the incidence of infection. OHD was less expensive and complicated than GD, which needed to be changed everyday (p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONThe results suggest that OHD is less expensive to use than GD, and the risk of wound infection is not increased compared to GD...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we showed {{that the use of}} a newly developed, highly water vapor permeable, PEU wound dressing accelerates the epithelization of partial-thickness wounds more than an <b>occlusive</b> wound <b>dressing</b> (OpSite) in comparison with air exposure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the distribution of fibrin(ogen), fibronectin, and type IV collagen during the epithelization process under these three conditions. The breathable PEU film enabled coagulation of the wound exudate, preserving it into a semi- solid gelatinous state. This coagulum layer contained an abundant amount of fibrin(ogen) and fibronectin. In wounds occluded with OpSite film, depositions of fibrin(ogen) and fibronectin were less extensive. Migrating keratinocytes contained intracellular depositions of fibrin(ogen), suggesting that these cells phagocytize components of the provisional fibrin matrix during wound healing. It was concluded that accelerated epithelization underneath the highly water vapor permeable polyetherurethane film dressing is associated with the presence of a gelatinous coagulum containing fibrin(ogen) and fibronectin. We speculate that the enhanced healing rate might be caused by an increased concentration of growth-promoting factors present in the residual exudate underneath the PEU dressing...|$|R

A standard preoperative anti-coagulation regimen was utilized on all patients with enoxaparin sodium 40  mg (Lovenox, Sanofi-aventis, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) injected subcutaneously once per day. The enoxaparin sodium was withheld 24  h prior to surgery. A standard K-L surgical approach, without extension or trochanteric osteotomy, was used in all cases. All surgical procedures were performed by fellowship trained orthopedic traumatologists specializing in acetabular and pelvic fracture surgery. As per hospital protocol, all study patients received preoperative antibiotics. A standard perioperative prophylactic antibiotic protocol utilizing a weight-based dose of cefazolin was administered; alternatively vancomycin was administered to patients with a drug allergy to cefazolin. Intraoperatively all patients received identical deep closure of the fascia using (0) vicryl (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) interrupted sutures and 2 – 0 monocryl interrupted subdermal sutures. Two suction canister 1 / 8 inch drains were placed: sub-fascial (deep) and extra-fascial (superficial). A standard <b>occlusive</b> gauze <b>dressing</b> was applied to all wounds.

40|$|The {{application}} of wound dressings {{is the most}} common method of wound management. In the past two decades, a novel type of wound dressing has been introduced that functions according to tissue engineering principles and provides an implantable platform for wound regeneration. The focus of this thesis was to develop such a wound dressing with multi-layer architecture that would be capable of absorbing wound exudates, be flexible with adequate contact with the wound bed, and have desirable porosity to allow cell migration. This thesis concludes with the development of a wound dressing which is comprised of three separate layers bonded together. The first layer, which would be directly in contact with the wound bed, was a gelatin scaffold of uniform porosity produced through an optimised gas foaming method. In this part of the research, in addition to optimising the gas foaming process parameters, a comprehensive comparison between applying four different crosslinking agents (glutaraldehyde, hexamethylene diisocyante, poly ether epoxide, and genipin) was carried out. The scaffolds, although showing a uniform porosity, had the tensile strength (240 kPa) lower than the reported value for natural skin (850 kPa). To strengthen the porous scaffold, a middle layer was applied and bonded to it. The middle layer with a thickness of 120 m was adhered to the gelatin scaffold, functioning as a mechanical support and exudate absorbent. This layer comprised of a chitosan-gelatin composite which exhibited a tensile strength of 26 MPa. The chitosangelatin membrane bonded to the gelatin scaffold had a combined tensile strength of 644 kPa, approaching natural skin tensile properties. The wound dressing assembly was completed by applying a plasticised gelatin membrane as the third and final layer above the chitosan-gelatin composite. This membrane with a thickness of 130 m, was plasticised using glycerol. It was designed with the primary function of covering the wound against debris, bacteria, and excessive manipulation, but also safeguarding the chitosan-gelatin membrane from disintegration once the wound exudate had been absorbed. The presented multi-layer design architecture provides a combination of a conventional wound <b>dressing</b> <b>occlusive</b> functionality with a modern tissue engineering approach in one product. Application of gas foaming resulted in a pore system that had an optimised porosity in comparison with commercially available wound dressings, by providing a more spherical pore system with pore size distribution closer to desirable values for skin tissue engineering (125 m). It is anticipated that the design of the biomaterial would result in accelerated wound healing and reducing long term care in a cost-effective manner...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The main {{objective}} of dressing wounds {{is to prevent}} wound infections. Successful wound management depends on {{an understanding of the}} healing process combined with knowledge of the properties of the various dressings available. Wounds can heal primarily, secondarily, or by delayed primary closure. The method of dressing includes occlusive and non-occlusive dressing. Aim: To evaluate the clinical outcome of non-occlusive versus occlusive dressings in postoperative sutured wounds. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study done on 298 patients over a period of one and half years from 1 st January 2012 to 30 th June 2013. All elective inpatients with sutured wounds in the Department of General Surgery requiring local wound care postoperatively were included in this study.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Suction-based {{wound healing}} devices with open-pore foam {{interfaces}} {{are widely used}} to treat complex tissue defects. The impact of changes in physicochemical parameters of the wound interfaces has not been investigated. METHODS: Full-thickness wounds in diabetic mice were treated with <b>occlusive</b> <b>dressing</b> or a suction device with a polyurethane foam interface varying in mean pore size diameter. Wound surface deformation on day 2 was measured on fixed tissues. Histologic cross-sections were analyzed for granulation tissue thickness (hematoxylin and eosin), myofibroblast density (α-smooth muscle actin), blood vessel density (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1), and cell proliferation (Ki 67) on day 7. RESULTS: Polyurethane foam-induced wound surface deformation increased with polyurethane foam pore diameter: 15 percent (small pore size), 60 percent (medium pore size), and 150 percent (large pore size). The extent of wound strain correlated with granulation tissue thickness that increased 1. 7 -fold in small pore size foam-treated wounds, 2. 5 -fold in medium pore size foam-treated wounds, and 4. 9 -fold in large pore size foam-treated wounds (p < 0. 05) compared with wounds treated with an <b>occlusive</b> <b>dressing.</b> All polyurethane foams {{increased the number of}} myofibroblasts over <b>occlusive</b> <b>dressing,</b> with maximal presence in large pore size foam-treated wounds compared with all other groups (p < 0. 05).
