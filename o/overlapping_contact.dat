40|$|A {{methodology}} for topology optimization {{to the design}} of compliant cellular mechanisms with and without internal contact is presented. A two-step procedure is pursued. First, a baseline noncontact mechanism is developed and optimized via an inverse homogeniza-tion method using the “solid isotropic material with penalization ” approach. This com-pliant mechanism is optimized to yield specified elasticity coefficients, with the capability to sustain large effective strains by minimizing local linear elastic strain. In the second step, a system of internal contacts is designed. The initial continuum model of a noncon-tact mechanism is converted into a frame model, and possible contact links are defined. A computationally efficient algorithm is employed to eliminate those mechanisms having <b>overlapping</b> <b>contact</b> links. The remaining nonoverlapping designs are exhaustively inves-tigated for stress relief. A differential evolution optimizer is used to maximize the stress relief. The results generated for a range of specified elasticity coefficients include a honeycomb-like cell, an auxetic cell, and a diamond-shaped cell. These various cell topologies have different effective properties corresponding to different structural requirements. For each such topology, a contact mechanism is devised that demonstrates stress relief. In one such case, the contact mechanism increases the strain magnification ratio by about 30 %.

40|$|YY 1 is a {{multifunctional}} {{transcription factor}} {{that acts as}} an activator or repressor in different contexts. YY 1 binds to multiple sites in the mouse c-fos promoter, inducing at each site a sharp DNA bend. Binding of YY 1 to a site situated between the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and the TATA box bends the DNA {{in a way that}} interferes with the interaction of proteins bound at the CRE and TATA elements, resulting in repression of transcription. Here, we show that binding of YY 1 to a different site in the c-fos promoter has a different result. Binding of YY 1 to the c-fos serum response element (SRE) enhances the binding of serum response factor (SRF). This enhancement requires the binding of YY 1 to SRE DNA. YY 1 and SRF can cooccupy the SRE at least transiently. In the region of <b>overlapping</b> <b>contact,</b> YY 1 contacts DNA in the major groove, while SRF contacts DNA in the minor groove. YY 1 also enhances the association of SRF with the SRE in transfected insect cells. Thus, although YY 1 induces similar structural changes in DNA at different binding sites, it can have distinct local effects on protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. These data support a general role for YY 1 in the building of highly organized promoter complexes. The promoter regions of eukaryotic genes generally contain multiple binding sites for different transcription factors. The spacing and relative phasing of these binding sites are crucia...|$|E
40|$|Protein–protein {{complexes}} remain enticing, but extremely challenging, {{targets for}} small-molecule drug discovery. In a rare example described earlier, a high-affinity small molecule, SP 4206 (Kd ≈ 70 nM), {{was found to}} block binding of the IL- 2 α receptor (IL- 2 Rα) to IL- 2 (Kd ≈ 10 nM). Recently, {{the structure of the}} IL- 2 /IL- 2 Rα complex was solved [Rickert, M., Wang, X., Boulanger, M. J., Goriatcheva, N., Garcia, K. C. (2005) Science 308 : 1477 – 1480]. Using structural and functional analysis, we compare how SP 4206 mimics the 83 -fold larger IL- 2 Rα in binding IL- 2. The binding free energy per contact atom (ligand efficiency) for SP 4206 is about twice that of the receptor because of a smaller, but <b>overlapping,</b> <b>contact</b> epitope that insinuates into grooves and cavities not accessed by the receptor. Despite its independent design, the small molecule has a similar, but more localized, charge distribution compared with IL- 2 Rα. Mutational studies show that SP 4206 targets virtually the same critical “hot-spot” residues on IL- 2 that drive binding of IL- 2 Rα. Moreover, a mutation that enhances binding to the IL- 2 Rα near these hot spots also enhances binding to SP 4206. Although the protein and small molecule do bind the same hot spot, they trap very different conformations of IL- 2 because of its flexible nature. Our studies suggest that precise structural mimics of receptors are not required for high-affinity binding of small molecules, and they show that there are multiple solutions to tight binding at shared and adaptive hot spots...|$|E

40|$|A star {{around a}} massive black hole can be {{disrupted}} tidally by {{the gravity of}} the black hole. Then its debris may form a precessing stream, which may even collide with itself. In order to understand the dynamical effects of the stream-stream collision on the eventual accretion of the stellar debris onto the black hole, we have studied how the gas flow behaves when the outgoing stream collides supersonically with the incoming stream. We have investigated the problem analytically with one-dimensional plane-parallel streams and numerically with more realistic, three-dimensional streams. A shock formed around the contact surface converts the bulk of the orbital streaming kinetic energy into thermal energy. In three-dimensional simulations, the accumulated, hot postshock gas then expands adiabatically and drives another shock into the low-density ambient region. Through this expansion, thermal energy is converted back to the kinetic energy associated with the expanding motion. Thus, in the end, {{only a small fraction of}} the orbital kinetic energy is actually converted to thermal energy, while most of it is transferred to the kinetic energy of the expanding gas. Nevertheless, the collision is effective in circularizing the debris' orbit because the shock efficiently transforms the ordered motion of the streams into the expanding motion in directions perpendicular to the streams. The circularization efficiency decreases if two colliding streams have a large ratio of cross sections and a large density contrast. But even in such cases, the main shock extends beyond the <b>overlapping</b> <b>contact</b> surface, and the high-pressure region behind the shock keeps the stream of the larger cross section from passing freely. Thus stream-stream collisions are still expected to circularize the stellar debris rather efficiently, unless the ratio of the cross sections is very large (i. e., sigma(1) /sigma(2) much greater than 10) open 9...|$|E

Solutions such as BotMiner [20] rely on DPI which can easily defeated by bots using encryption. Some {{of the recent}} work has used supervised [24],[25] and unsupervised [26],[27] machine learning approaches and other statistical measures [28]. PeerRush [24] created ‘application profile’ from the network traces of multiple P 2 P applications. Their work utilized payload sizes and inter-packet delays to categorize the exact P 2 P application running on a host. The approach of Zhang et al.

P 2 P bots were identified based on certain features like fingerprint similarity, number of <b>overlapping</b> <b>contacts,</b> persistent communication, etc. However, their work can detect P 2 P bots inside a network only when there are multiple infected nodes belonging to the same botnet. Yen and Reiter [28] attempt to segregate P 2 P bots from benign P 2 P apps based on metrics like the volume of data exchanged and number of peers contacted. Unfortunately, their features are not sufficient to correctly differentiate P 2 P bots and apps. Furthermore, their approach fails to detect bots when bots and apps run on the same machine.|$|R

40|$|In {{staggered}} {{thin film}} transistors, the injection length is {{the fraction of}} the gate to <b>contact</b> <b>overlap</b> that is effectively involved in current injection. Its assessment is important to properly downscale device dimensions. In fact, {{in order to increase}} transistor operation speed, the whole device footprint should be downscaled, which means both the gate to <b>contact</b> <b>overlap</b> and the channel length, as they affect the relative weight of gate to contact parasitic capacitances and the carrier transit time along the channel respectively. Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make the gate to <b>contact</b> <b>overlap</b> smaller than the injection length, because this negatively affects contact resistances. Suitable figures of merits are introduced to quantify these aspects, and a method is proposed to extract the injection length from electrical measurements. As an example of application, transistors based on the prototypical n-type polymer poly[N,N′-bis(2 -octyldodecyl) -naphthalene- 1, 4, 5, 8 -bis(dicarboximide) - 2, 6 -diyl]-alt- 5, 5 ′-(2, 2 ′-bithiophene) (P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) are analyzed. When the channel length is scaled while driving voltages are kept constant, in P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) the injection length decreases as well, thus proving that the downscaling of the whole device footprint is feasible.

Screening of libraries of random 12 -mers, 7 -mers, and cyclic 9 -mers produced two families of gp 120 binding peptides. Members of a family with the prototype sequence RINNIPWSEAMM (peptide 12 p 1) inhibit the interaction between gp 120 and both four-domain soluble CD 4 (4 dCD 4) and monoclonal antibody (MAb) 17 b, a neutralizing antibody that covers the chemokine receptor binding surface on gp 120. Peptide 12 p 1 inhibits the interaction of 4 dCD 4 with gp 120 from three different HIV strains, implying that it binds to a conserved site on gp 120. Members of a second family of peptides, with the prototype sequence TSPYEDWQTYLM (peptide 12 p 2), bind more weakly to gp 120. They do not detectably affect its interaction with 4 dCD 4, but they enhance its binding to MAb 17 b. A common sequence motif in the two peptide families and cross-competition for gp 120 binding suggest that they have <b>overlapping</b> <b>contacts.</b> Their divergent effects on the affinity of gp 120 for MAb 17 b may indicate that their binding stabilizes distinct conformational states of gp 120.

In contrast, the contribution of such determinants to AT 1 A receptor internalization, phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is not known. In this study, the internalization of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged AT 1 A receptor (AT 1 A-EGFP), in response to AngII {{and a series of}} substituted analogs, was visualized and quantified using confocal microscopy. AngII-stimulation resulted in a rapid, concentration-dependent internalization of the chimeric receptor, which was prevented by pretreatment with the nonpeptide AT 1 receptor antagonist EXP 3174. Remarkably, AT 1 A receptor internalization was unaffected by substitution of AngII side chains, including single and double substitutions of Tyr 4 and Phe 8 that abolish phospholipase C signaling through the receptor. AngII-induced receptor phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by several substitutions at Phe 8 as well as alanine replacement of Asp 1. The activation of MAPK was only significantly inhibited by substitutions at position eight in the peptide and specific substitutions did not equally inhibit inositol phosphate production, receptor phosphorylation and MAPK activation. These results indicate that separate, yet <b>overlapping,</b> <b>contacts</b> made between the AngII peptide and the AT 1 A receptor select/induce distinct receptor conformations that preferentially affect particular receptor outcomes. The requirements for AT 1 A receptor internalization seem to be less stringent than receptor activation and signaling, suggesting an inherent bias toward receptor deactivation...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources, Wildlife, 2012 Diseases are {{potential}} threats to wildlife populations worldwide, and recent epidemics have demonstrated their far-reaching impacts. The spread of directly transmitted pathogens {{is influenced by}} host contact rates, and host density can alter these contact rates by changing the spatial distribution of host home ranges. I explored how host density might affect the spread of directly transmitted pathogens in Channel Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) through changes in contact rates, home range size and overlap. I tracked 40 radio-collared foxes at four sites on San Clemente Island, which ranged in density from 2. 8 ?? 1. 28 to 42. 8 ?? 9. 43 foxes/km 2. Thirty foxes wore collars that also contained proximity loggers. More overlap correlated with higher rates of contact between neighbors. Foxes at high densities had more neighbors with overlapping home ranges but not {{an increase in the}} amount of pair-wise <b>overlap</b> or <b>contact</b> between individual neighbors. I used these home range and contact data to parameterize a spatially explicit model of rabies and canine distemper spread in island foxes. Modeled fox densities, home range sizes and degree of <b>overlap,</b> and <b>contact</b> rates approximated those measured on San Clemente Island. I examined how host density at the point of disease introduction and different vaccination strategies (i. e., no vaccination, random vaccination, or firewall/core area vaccination) might affect disease dynamics. In model simulations, canine distemper spread quicker, infected more animals, and caused a greater reduction in the fox population than rabies due to differences in the length of the prepatent and infectious periods. The introduction of either pathogen to areas of high fox density resulted in more rapid transmission than if the pathogen was introduced at lower densities. Random vaccination was generally the more successful strategy for reducing the number of infected or dead animals from both diseases, and may be the preferable strategy for San Clemente Island. The model parameters with the greatest proportional effect on output were fox contact rates, virus transmissibility, background transmission rate, and the length of the prepatent and infectious periods. This study was the first time island fox contact rates were directly measured and compared to density and home range overlap, and it confirms that overlap is a reliable index of the amount of direct contact between island foxes. Model results can be used to advise conservation efforts aimed at preventing and responding to disease outbreaks in island foxes.

40|$|The {{distributions}} of both fibronectin (LETS, CSP) fibers and focal contacts to the substratum, as viewed by fluorescence and reflection contrast microscopy, respectively, have been compared in freshly plated WI- 38 human fibroblasts. Most frequently, the actual focal attachment plaques {{did not contain}} fibronectin fluorescence and, furthermore, fibronectin spots and fibers often alternated with focal <b>contacts.</b> <b>Overlap,</b> however, was observed between focal contacts and the endings of actin-containing stress fibers [see also Wehland, J., Osborn, M. & Weber, K. (1979) J. Cell Sci. 37, 257 - 273]. Thus, the fibroblast attachment membrane might {{best be described as}} a corrugated sheet that undulates between alternating microfilaments and fibronectin fibers, at the points of closest and farthest distance to the substratum, respectively...|$|R
