[...] Lamb criticized the video's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war, saying, [...] "Does Def Jam, Rihanna's label, need to be reminded that this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30,000 troops from <b>our</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> real war?

During the subsequent democratic interval, Moscovici was commemorated by Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște with a belated obituary in Jurnalul de Dimineaţă: [...] "there are very few politicians in <b>our</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> have remained faithful to an idea their whole lives.
