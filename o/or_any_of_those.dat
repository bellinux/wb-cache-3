Bentley also stated that the Rocko {{universe}} was influenced by [...] "everything from Looney Tunes to underground comics". The staff of the show were fans of outrageous comedy, both animated and not animated. Tom Kenny cited Looney Tunes and SCTV as influences for the show, and also stated [...] "I'm sure if you asked Joe Murray or Mr. Lawrence <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> guys, especially in terms of animation, the weirdest cartoons would of course be our favorites—those weird '30s Fleischer brothers Betty Boop cartoons and stuff like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May, on Ebert & Roeper, both Richard Roeper {{and guest}} critic Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave {{enthusiastic}} reviews. Phillips called it, [...] "the most charming thing I've seen all year", [...] "the Brief Encounter for the 21st century", his favorite music film since 1984's Stop Making Sense and said, [...] "It {{may well be}} the best music film of our generation". Roeper referred to the film's recording studio scene as [...] "more inspirational and uplifting than almost any number of Dreamgirls or Chicago <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> multi-zillion [...] dollar musical showstopping films. In its own way, it will blow you away."

2500|$|John McCain {{would later}} say, [...] "My marriage's {{collapse}} was attributable {{to my own}} selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] Carol McCain later said, [...] "The breakup of our marriage was not caused by my accident or Vietnam <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> things. I don't know that it might not have happened if John had never been gone. I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] McCain's biographer Robert Timberg believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to Carol, her husband's five-year captivity in Vietnam had left him wanting to [...] "make up for lost time", and John put it this way: [...] "I had changed, she had changed ... People who have been apart that much change." [...] Ross Perot later said, [...] "After he came home, he walked with a limp, she [...] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [...] and the rest is history." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{found it}} very {{difficult}} to make this decision. There were thousands of places where people went to camp out, but none of them seemed to be the place for us.
