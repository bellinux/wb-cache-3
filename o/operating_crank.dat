50|$|The machine {{performs}} multiplication by repeated addition, {{and division}} by repeated subtraction. The basic operation performed {{is to add}} (or subtract) the operand number to the accumulator register, {{as many times as}} desired (to subtract, the <b>operating</b> <b>crank</b> is turned in the opposite direction). The number of additions (or subtractions) is controlled by the multiplier dial. It operates like a telephone dial, with ten holes in its circumference numbered 0-9. To multiply by a single digit, 0-9, a knob-shaped stylus is inserted in the appropriate hole in the dial, and the crank is turned. The multiplier dial turns clockwise, the machine performing one addition for each hole, until the stylus strikes a stop {{at the top of the}} dial. The result appears in the accumulator windows. Repeated subtractions are done similarly except the multiplier dial turns in the opposite direction, so a second set of digits, in red, are used. To perform a single addition or subtraction, the multiplier is simply set at one.|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{experimental study}} on the dynamic responses of slider-crank mechanism with clearance joints is presented in this work. The main sub-assembly of the experimental test rig consisted of slider-crank mechanism with an adjustable radial clearance at the revolute joint that connected the slider and the connecting rod. The motion of the slider was measured with a linear transducer and an accelerometer. Dynamic tests at different <b>operating</b> <b>crank</b> speeds and with several clearance sizes were performed. The slider acceleration (impact acceleration) {{was used as a}} measure of the impact severity. The results obtained clearly demonstrated the severe dynamical behavior in a clearance joint and they provide a qualitative measure of the associated fatigue and wear phenomena in which the components must be reliably operate in real joints.

The main objective {{of this study is}} to provide an experimental verification and validation of the predictive capabilities of the clearance joint models, also proposed in this work. The experimental procedure complements the theoretical or numerical studies in the literature and it provides a proposal for the coherent combination of numerical and experimental work that needs to be undertaken, in order to establish validated models and to identify directions for subsequent studies that will allow for the improvement of the models.

5000|$|The {{idea of an}} {{automatic}} washing machine had been around for many years but these were crude mechanical efforts that typically involved a manually <b>operated</b> <b>crank</b> or similar design. [...] In many ways, the patent of the new Thor washer sounds modern, even today. The patent states that a 'perforated cylinder is rotatably mounted within the tub containing the wash water'. A series of blades lifted the clothes as the cylinder rotated. After 8 rotations on one direction, the machine would reverse rotation to 'prevent the cloths from wadding up into a compact mass'. [...] Drive belts attached to a Westinghouse motor connected to three wheels of different sizes, which moved the drum during operation. The design also included a clutch, which allowed the machine to switch direction, and an emergency stop rod. The new Thor washer was mass marketed throughout the United States beginning in 1908.|$|R

50|$|The {{other common}} type of furling system is for the {{mainsail}}. The mainsail may be furled into the mast or the boom, with boom furling systems being simpler and more common. The simplest boom furling system consists of a boom that can rotate along its axis, with a latch to lock it in place. Provision {{must be made to}} allow the mainsail to wrap around the boom without interfering with the mainsheet, such as end-boom sheeting or a bridle. To furl the mainsail, the boom is unlocked, and then rotated to take up the desired amount of mainsail, and then locked in place. More advanced boom furling systems will wrap the furling mechanism in a slotted cover, so the sail furls inside the cover; this also makes sheeting easier, since the sheet may be attached to the outer portion of the boom. These systems use either a line, a hand <b>operated</b> <b>crank,</b> or a hydraulic or electric powered furler.|$|R

While the slicer is traditionally a commercial apparatus, domestic use versions are also marketed.|$|R

25|$|Two {{different}} classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations {{took place on}} the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that <b>operated</b> a <b>crank</b> and connecting rod to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.|$|R

2500|$|Fixed spool reels {{are cast}} by opening the bail, {{grasping}} {{the line with}} the forefinger, and then using a backward snap of the rod followed by a forward cast while releasing the line with the forefinger at the same time. [...] The forefinger is then placed {{in contact with the}} departing line and {{the leading edge of the}} spool in order to slow or stop the outward cast. [...] On the retrieve, the left hand normally <b>operates</b> the <b>crank</b> handle, while the large rotating wire cage or bail (either manually or trigger-operated) serves as the line pickup, restoring the line to its original position on the spool.|$|R

50|$|The Gardner gun was {{an early}} type of {{mechanical}} machine gun. It had one, two or five barrels, was fed from a vertical magazine or hopper and was <b>operated</b> by a <b>crank.</b> When the crank was turned, a feed arm positioned a cartridge in the breech, the bolt closed and the weapon fired. Turning the crank further opened the breechblock and extracted the spent case.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a saw mill is even simpler than a flour or grinding mill, since no gearing is needed, and the rotary saw blade can be driven direct from the water wheel axle, as the example of Sutter's Mill in California shows.

The Germans fired 148 shells and one torpedo while Stanvac Calcutta fired only twenty-five, hundreds of machine gun rounds were also expended by both sides.|$|R
