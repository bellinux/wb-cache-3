In this study, the development, survival and reproduction of P. unionalis were evaluated in the laboratory at 25 °C and photoperiod of L:D = 16 : 8 on three host plants: olive (Olea europea L., cv. Gemlik), ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl.) and jasmine (Jasminum fruticans L.). <b>Olive</b> leaf <b>moth</b> larvae survived on all three host plants. The developmental time of immature stages ranged from 27. 52 days on ash leaves to 30. 00 days on olive leaves. Immature survival from egg to pupa was 72 % on jasmine, 73 % on olive and 74 % on ash. The average number of eggs oviposited by adults from larvae reared on ash, jasmine and olive were 194. 7, 321. 8 and 390. 3, respectively. The net reproductive rate of this species varied from 129. 8 females/female on ash to 298. 3 on olive. The intrinsic rate of population increase on ash, jasmine and olive was 0. 148, 0. 149 and 0. 163 females/female/day, respectively.

40|$|Doutoramento em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - ULThe {{olive tree}} (Olea europaea L.) has been shaping and characterizing {{landscape}} {{and culture in}} the Mediterranean basin. This tree is attacked by pest that can cause significant losses. This thesis {{was focused on the}} conservation biological control of one of its most damaging pests: the <b>olive</b> <b>moth,</b> Prays oleae (Bernard). Naturally, a large number of parasitoid and predator species are associated to this pest, and in order to satisfy their needs they make use of ecological infrastructures occurring in the olive grove agroecosystem. However, how these ecological infrastructures can be used to enhance the <b>olive</b> <b>moth</b> conservation biological control needs to be disentangled. For that, two approaches were followed. First, the influence of ecological infrastructures on P. oleae and its natural enemies was analyzed through field surveys. Then, different food resources were evaluated as potential foods for P. oleae and its natural enemies, i. e., the parasitoid Elasmus flabellatus (Fonscolombe) and the predator Chrysoperla carnea s. l. (Stephens). In the first approach, P. oleae was found to disperse throughout non-crop patches, although the implications for the pest population are unknown. The heterogeneous landscapes composed by herbaceous and woody vegetation around the olive groves were exploited by syrphids as food sources. Finally, ground covers within the olive groves favored the parasitoid Ageniaspis fuscicollis (Dalman) while the herbicide application diminished it. In the second approach, insects’ honeydews [Saissetia oleae (Olivier) and Euphyllura olivina (Costa) ] and the flowers of Malva sylvestris L. favored the survival and/ or reproduction of P. oleae, C. carnea and E. flabellatus. Several plant species such as Daucus carota L., Veronica persica Poir, and Lamium purpureum L. showed to be potential food resources for the studied natural enemies.

40|$|Conservation {{biological}} control (CBC) is an environmentally sound potential {{alternative to the}} use of chemical insecticides. It involves modifications of the environment to promote natural enemy activity on pests. Despite many CBC studies increasing abundance of natural enemies, there are far fewer demonstrations of reduced pest density and very little work has been conducted in olive crops. In this study we investigated the effects of four forms of non-crop vegetation on the abundance of two important pests: the olive psyllid (Euphyllura olivina) and the <b>olive</b> <b>moth</b> (Prays oleae). Areas of herbaceous vegetation and areas of woody vegetation near olive crops, and smaller patches of woody vegetation within olive groves, decreased pest abundance in the crop. Inter-row ground covers that are known to increase the abundance of some predators and parasitoids had no effect on the pests, possibly as a result of lack of synchrony between pests and natural enemies, lack of specificity or intra-guild predation.

40|$|Abstract: Since 2004 {{several studies}} {{have been carried out}} in order to {{identify}} the main insect species that usually inhabiting the olive ecosystem. The field trials have taken place in two olive groves, one situated in Olhão and the other one in Loulé, both in Algarve and also under Integrated Pest Management (IPM). The sampling techniques used differ according to their purpose (sticky traps, pheromone traps, pitfall traps and samples of aerial parts of the trees such as inflorescences, leaves, fruits and branches). Results showed that the main insect pests of olive tree in southern Portugal were the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae Gmelin (Diptera: Tephritidae) and the <b>olive</b> <b>moth</b> Prays oleae Bernard (Lepidoptera: Hyponeumetidae). Other insect pests were also found in our olive groves namely the olive psyllid Euphyllura olivina Costa (Homoptera: Psyllidae), the olive dark beetle Phloeotribus scarabaeoides Bernard (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the mediterranean black scale Saissetia oleae (Olivier) (Homoptera: Coccidae) and the olive thrip Liothripes oleae Costa (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae). Concerning the auxiliary insects that were found in our olives groves they belong to the following orders and families: Diptera (Syrphidae), Coleoptera (Carabidae, Coccinelidae and Staphylinidae), Hemiptera (Anthocoridae and Miridae), Neuroptera (Chrysopidae) and Hymenoptera (Braconidae, Encyrtidae, Eulophidae, Formicidae and Trichogrammatidae) ...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{manipulating}} flowering weeds within an agro-ecosystem can have an important role in pest control by natural enemies, by providing them nectars, which are significant sources of nutrition for adults. However, flowering weeds have also been found to have a negative impact when insect pests benefit from the same food sources. Thus, before proceeding with a manipulation program, candidate plants must be screened in order to identify those which provide resources to natural enemies and not to pests. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess if, theoretically, the <b>olive</b> <b>moth,</b> Prays oleae and three of its main natural enemies (the parasitoids, Chelonus eleaphilus and Elasmus flabellatus, and the predator Chrysoperla carnea) can access the nectar from 21 flowering weeds from the olive grove, by analyzing the architecture of the flowers as well as the mouthpart structure of the pest and its enemies. The architecture of the flowers was studied by measuring corolla opening and corolla depth. For the mouthpart structure of P. oleae, the proboscis length of recently dead individuals was measured, while for natural enemies, as elongated ¬mouthparts are missing, the head width was measured, as this is the limiting factor in exploiting nectar from deep, narrow flower corollas. All measurements were done with an ocular micrometer fitted to a stereoscopic microscope, by using the computer software Digital Imaging Solutions. The combinations of measurements on floral architecture and mouthpart structure have allowed conclusions on the theoretical nectar accessibility for the four insect species...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{applications}} are {{still one of}} the most common control methods against the main olive grove pests and diseases: the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), the <b>olive</b> <b>moth,</b> Prays oleae (Bernard), the black scale, Saissetia oleae (Olivier), and the olive leaf spot, caused by the fungus Spilocaea oleagina Fries. However, and because the new pesticide legislation is aimed at an integrated pest and disease management, it is still important to evaluate and to know the ecotoxicology of pesticides on the natural enemies of the different agrosystems. A part of this work has been focusses on evaluating the direct and indirect effects of kaolin particle films and two copper-based products (Bordeaux mixture and copper oxychloride) through different laboratory, extended laboratory and semi-field experiments. Two natural enemies have been chosen: Psyttalia concolor (Szèpligeti), a parasitoid of the olive fruit fly, and Chilocorus nigritus (F.), predator of Diaspididae. This predator has been used instead of C. bipustulatus (L.), which is the species found in olive orchards. Kaolin mainly acts as a repellent of insects and/or as an oviposition deterrent. It is used in olive groves to control the olive fruit fly and the <b>olive</b> <b>moth.</b> Copper is applied against fungal and bacterial diseases. In olive groves it is used against the olive leaf spot and other diseases. No statistical differences were found in any of the experiments performed, compared to the controls, except when the oral toxicity of the products was evaluated on P. concolor females. In this case, kaolin and copper oxychloride caused a higher mortality 72 hours after the treatments, and both kaolin and the two copper formulations decreased females’ life span. Reproductive parameters were only negatively affected when kaolin was ingested. Apart from these experiments, due to the uncommon mode of action of kaolin, two extra experiments were carried out: a dual choice and a no-choice experiment. In this case, both P. concolor females and C. nigritus adults showed a clear preference for the untreated surfaces when they had the possibility of choosing between a treated surface and an untreated one. When there was no choice, no statistical differences were found between the treatments and the controls. Furthermore, the efficacy and the selectivity of three insect growth regulators (methoxyfenozide, tebufenozide and RH- 5849) on B. oleae and P. concolor, respectively, have also been evaluated. In addition to laboratory experiments to evaluate the toxicity of the insecticides, also molecular approaches were used. RNA of both insects was isolated. cDNA was subsequently synthesized and the complete sequences of the ligand biding domain (LBD) of the ecdysone receptor of each insect were then determined. Afterwards the three dimensional structures of both LBDs were constructed. Finally, the docking of the insecticide molecules in the cavity delineated by the 12 α-helix that composed the LBD was performed. Both toxicity assays and molecular docking approaches showed that either methoxyfenozide or tebufenozide had no negative effects nor on B. oleae nor on P. concolor. In contrast, RH- 5849 had no deleterious effect to the parasitoid but decreased olive fruit fly adults’ life span, especially when they were in contact with the fresh residue of the insecticide applied on a glass surface. The docking study of RH- 5849 molecule has shown a very light hindrance with the wall of the LBD pocket. This means that this molecule could more or less adjust in the cavity. Thus, searching of new insecticides for controlling the olive fruit fly could be based on the basic lead structure of RH- 5849 molecule...|$|E
40|$|Comunicação em painelThe {{olives and}} olive oil {{production}} are important agricultural activities in Portugal. In the region of Trás-os-Montes, olive orchards are strongly affected by Prays oleae Bern., {{which is responsible for}} high losses in the olive production, as much as 40 % of the expected yield. This lepidopteran presents three generations per year (phyllophagous, antophagous and carpophagous) that damage the olive tree in different organs (leaves, flowers and fruits, respectively). In an attempt to identify fungi that might cause the death of olive moths, larvae and pupae of those three annual generations were collected and surveyed for natural fungal infection. After their isolation, the fungal agents were molecularly identified by sequencing the amplified internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA. In the present work, the diversity of fungal species associated to P. oleae, in several olive orchards located in Trás-os-Montes region, is discussed. The diversity and abundance of fungal species differed between all three generations. Higher diversity was found in the carpophagous generation, followed by the antophagous and phyllophagous generations. The use of already adapted fungal species to control one of the major pests of olive groves will increase the success of a future biocontrol strategy. In this context, the identification of fungi associated to P. oleae from olive orchards provided a pool of potential biocontrol agents. In this work, Beauveria bassiana proved to be the most promising fungus to be used as biocontrol agent against <b>olive</b> <b>moth,</b> being strongly associated to the phyllophagous generation. Other fungal species presenting entomopathogenic, antagonistic and phytopathogenic characteristics were also found. This work has been supported by FCT (PTDC/AGR-AAM/ 102600 / 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|From all the barcoding {{initiatives}} in progress, fungal barcode {{is probably the}} one where more difficulties have been encountered. While for plants and animais the barcode regions were easy to define, for fungi the choice was not so straightforward. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region {{was one of the}} proposed DNA regions for barcoding fungi. This is an extensively used region, for molecular systematic and identification of species, being probably the most widely sequenced DNA region of fungi. This is due to the simplicity of the amplification, related to the multicopy nature of the rDNA; the possibility of using universal primers; and the high levei of sequence variation that occurs even between closely related species. Furthermore, a significant number of identified sequences for comparison are available in the GenBank database. Although the ITS region of rDNA was chosen for some groups of fungi, the use of this region presents very limited application for others, especially for Ascomycetes. As {{some of the most important}} entomopathogenic fungi are Ascomycetes, belonging to genera Beauveria, Cordyceps, Isaria, Lecanicillium and Paecilomyces, the use of the ITS region for barcoding purpose are being complemented with other regions. This work, based on the identification of fungal entomopathogens isolated directly from cadavers of one of the major pests in olive graves, the <b>olive</b> <b>moth</b> iPrevs oleae Bern.), intends to illustrate the application of the ITS region to identify these fungal species. The use of this region proved to be useful for the identification of most of the entomopathogenic fungi found in dead larvae and pupae of P. oleae. However, the use ot ITS region for barcode purposes did not allow the identification of several isolates, proving the requiremerít of using a second barcoding region, to enable full fungal identification.
