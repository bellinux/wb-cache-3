5|$|The 9th Infantry Regiment {{had planned}} Task Force Manchu on {{orders from the}} 2nd Division {{commander}} Major General Laurence B. Keiser, which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrolling. Keiser decided the patrol should cross the river at the Paekchin ferry. The 9th Infantry reserve, E Company, reinforced with <b>one</b> <b>section</b> of light machine guns from H Company, {{was to be the}} attack force. The 1st Platoon, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31. Two heavy weapons companies, D and H, were each to furnish <b>one</b> <b>section</b> of heavy machine guns, <b>one</b> <b>section</b> of 81-mm. mortars, and <b>one</b> <b>section</b> of 75-mm. recoilless rifles for supporting fires.

40|$|Engel {{groups and}} Engel {{elements}} became popular in 50 s. We {{consider in the}} paper the more general nil-groups and nil-elements in groups. All these notions are related to nilpotent groups and nilpotent radicals in groups. These notions generate problems which are parallel to Burnside problems for periodic groups. The first three theorems of the paper are devoted to nil-groups and Engel groups, while the other results are connected with the further generalizations. These generalizations extend the theory to solvable groups and solvable radicals in groups. The paper has two parts.

5|$|Between {{the state}} line near Michiana and the {{interchange}} with I-94 near New Buffalo, US12 forms {{a portion of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT). The full length of the highway in the state is also a Pure Michigan Historic Byway. Outside of the various cities, most of US12 is a rural, two-lane state highway. <b>One</b> <b>section</b> runs concurrently with I-94 south of Ypsilanti. From there eastward, the US12 is a divided highway and then a boulevard into the Detroit area. The entire length of the highway east of Coldwater is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|M-72 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state highway by 1919 along a segment of its current route.

Another section of highway near Empire was disconnected {{from the rest of}} M-72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade. All of M-72 was completely paved by the early 1960s. The highway was rerouted in a few places in the 1950s, and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{changes were}} {{occurring}} {{in the eastern part}} of Jefferson County. The portion of highway from Ryan east to the Love County line was removed from the highway system on December 31, 1937. As a result, SH-32 was discontiguous; <b>one</b> <b>section</b> stretched from Davidson to Ryan, while another began at a spur ending at the Jefferson–Love county line and continued east from there. The portion of SH-32 concurrent with US-81 between Waurika and Ryan, once necessary to connect to the now-decommissioned road, was removed on February 24, 1938. Both of these sections of road were reinstated as part of SH-32 on February 29, 1944.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1917, the 7th Brigade—of {{which the}} 26th Battalion was part—was tasked with {{the capture of}} Lagnicourt. It was during this {{engagement}} where Cherry was to earn the Victoria Cross. An artillery barrage opened up on the village at 05:15 and continued for twenty minutes, allowing the infantry to close in. The plan was that Cherry's company would storm the village itself while the battalion's other companies encircled it. For the assault, Cherry split his company into two sections; he commanded <b>one</b> <b>section</b> himself and placed the other under Lieutenant William Frederick Joseph Hamilton.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} had changed again by 1918, when tank attacks would have one tank every 100 or , with a tank company of 12–16 tanks per objective. <b>One</b> <b>section</b> of each {{company would be}} out in front, with {{the remainder of the}} company following behind and each tank providing protection for an infantry platoon, who were instructed to advance, making use of available cover and supported by machine gun fire. When the tanks came across an enemy strong point, they would engage the defenders, forcing them into shelter and leaving them to the devices of the following infantry.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and ligase activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing <b>one</b> <b>section</b> to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E
5|$|Article <b>One,</b> <b>Section</b> Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the {{authority}} to create a federal district {{to serve as the}} national capital.

The Act established the District of Columbia {{on the banks of the}} Potomac River between the states of Maryland and Virginia to serve as the new federal capital. However, Robert Morris, a Senator from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years.|$|E

5|$|By 1944 it {{was fairly}} routine {{practice}} for Stavka to assign its operating fronts new and more ambitious missions while the Soviet Armed Forces were conducting major offensive operations. The rationale was that relentless pressure might trigger a German collapse. For the 1943/1944 winter campaign, Stalin ordered the Red Army to conduct major offensives along the entire Soviet-German front in {{a continuation of the}} 'Broad Front' strategy he had pursued {{since the beginning of the}} war. This was applied in consonance with his long-standing rationale that, if the Red Army applied pressure along the entire front, German defences were likely to break in at least <b>one</b> <b>section.</b> The Soviet winter campaign included major assaults across the entire expanse the front in the Ukraine, Belorussia and against the German Panther Line in the region of the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into <b>one</b> <b>section</b> {{of the city}} of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways, Route 8 was defined to run along present-day Route 94 from Route 6 (current US 46) at the Delaware Bridge north to Columbia before turning northeast to Route 31 (now U.S. Route 206) in Newton. Past Newton, Route 31 continued northeast to the New York state line (current US 206 {{north of here}} was Route S31). In the original version of the renumbering bill, Route 31 was to reach the border via Sussex, incorporating pre-1927 Route 8 (now Route 284) from Sussex to the state line. However, in the final version, Route 31 ran via Hamburg, using the same alignment as a planned spur of pre-1927 Route 8 from Lafayette to North Church. Route 8 was eventually {{taken over by the}} state. On the other hand, by 1949, only <b>one</b> <b>section</b> of Route 31 north of the Route S31 split had been taken between North Church to Hamburg.|$|E
