5|$|In 1850, Kentuckians {{ratified}} {{their third}} constitution. One of many changes effected by this document {{was that the}} office of superintendent became elective. Though the election belonged to the Democrats, Breckinridge, a Whig, was elected over five challengers for the office. His tenure would be a short one, however. Unlike his early reforms, his calls for parental selection of textbooks {{and use of the}} Bible as the primary reading material were not heeded. He also opposed the abolition <b>of</b> <b>tuition</b> charges and unsuccessfully lobbied for a pay increase for his position. (The salary was only $750.) With little prospect of further reform under his leadership, Breckinridge resigned in 1853.|$|E

5|$|On March 11, 1994 FBI agents {{executed}} {{a search warrant}} to confiscate records from the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals {{as part of an}} ongoing investigation. Weeks later, federal agents investigating ghost payrolling subpoenaed financial records regarding several past and current employees of the Board, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The US Treasury Department investigated the IDOT contracts with Berrios and Panayotovich, and a federal grand jury subpoenaed the contracts. A federal grand jury in Chicago subpoenaed records documenting the recipients <b>of</b> <b>tuition</b> waivers to state universities request by three current and two former state legislators, including Berrios and Panayotovich.

No charges were filed against anyone in the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals. The Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals was reconstituted and renamed the Cook County Board of Review in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{while serving}} at the FCO, Penfold volunteered {{to learn a}} {{difficult}} language {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. After passing an aptitude test, he was assigned a professional language tutor and began learning Amharic—the official language of Ethiopia—and after six weeks <b>of</b> <b>tuition,</b> was sent to Gondar to continue learning the language by living in Ethiopia. Shortly after, he was posted to Addis Ababa as second secretary, because the British ambassador to Ethiopia, Sir Willie Morris, was keen to have an Amharic-speaking second secretary. Penfold was responsible for monitoring and reporting on internal Ethiopian affairs and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as the latter was based in Addis. As part of the role, Penfold was required to attend and report on meetings of the OAU, which took place all over Africa. On the instruction of Foreign Secretary David Owen, Penfold met with the leaders of the independence movement in Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) at an OAU conference in Gabon in 1977. There he met separately with Bishop Muzorewa, Joshua Nkomo, and Robert Mugabe. Penfold believed Mugabe to be difficult to work with, but later stated that it should have been obvious that Mugabe would come to power in Zimbabwe and that the British government could have made a greater effort to work with him.|$|E
