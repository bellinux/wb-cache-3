This study investigated the personality and background experiences of individuals who are attracted to work as educators with students with visual impairments. A sample of 132 teachers who had been trained at either the undergraduate or graduate level and were employed within their first five years as teachers with this specialization completed the Holland Self-Directed Search (Form CP) and a Participant Profile form to ascertain the personality types and experiences of those new to the field. The study considered three variables: (1) gender, (2) race/ethnicity, (3) teacher training level and their association with Holland personality type (RIASEC).

The small-scale study aimed to capture the scope {{and complexity of the}} activities of these teachers and the regular challenges they face in their expected everyday roles. Methods: Telephone interviews were used to collect descriptive data from the teachers. A direct field-sampling procedure was used across the governmental schools to recruit qualified and specialist teachers who met prespecified criteria, most of whom lived in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city. The content of the interviews was generated from two sequenced activities with a different group of experienced teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Results: The teachers carried out complex and demanding duties as part of their everyday roles. These duties were consistent with those performed by their counterparts around the world. The most frequently performed and most important activities including providing direct support to students, advocating for students' needs, and collaborating across school and community contexts. The identified challenges were linked primarily to the lack of time to undertake important activities. Discussion: Three important and interconnected findings can be drawn from the results: role complexity, time and collaboration, and the importance of the expanded core curriculum. Implications for Practitioners: The findings provide an initial snapshot of the changing role reported by the teachers. Thus, these data offer a beginning point for future probes into the workplace knowledge and skills required by teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Education and Professional StudiesFull Tex...|$|E

The lack of physical activity and issues of weight can compromise the ability of the individual who is blind or visually impaired to maneuver through the environment safely and efficiently. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the perceptions of itinerant teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> about the importance of physical activity for their students with visual impairments and its effect on academic success and social relationship. Data was gathered from 175 teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> concerning their perceptions regarding the importance of physical activity and obesity and their relationship with academic success and social relationships. The teachers indicated that physical activity for their students is very important.

Teachers reported on their own personal physical activity levels in relationship to the importance they placed on their students' need to be active. The teachers did not indicate that being overweight was a particular issue with their visually impaired students, but they acknowledged that being overweight and a lack of physical activity create additional barriers for academic success and appropriate social relationships. The teachers also reported that the same barriers in physical education classes and access to recreation activities in the community that have been listed in past research studies were still in existence, and these barriers were also part of their dilemma in creating positive physical activity experiences for their students who are visually impaired.
