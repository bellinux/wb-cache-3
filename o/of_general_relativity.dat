He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and proved the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> and those of Newtonian gravity. In addition, Ehlers had a keen interest in both the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science.|$|E

5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{was in the}} field <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity.</b> In particular, he made contributions to cosmology, the theory of gravitational lenses and gravitational waves.

5|$|General {{relativity}} can {{be understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description.

5|$|Some {{predictions}} <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> {{differ significantly}} from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The predictions <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

5000|$|If Newtonian physics {{does have}} a {{gravitational}} deflection of light (Newton, Cavendish, Soldner), <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> predicts twice as much deflection in a lightbeam skimming the Sun. This difference {{can be explained by}} the additional contribution of the curvature of space under modern theory: while Newtonian gravitation is analogous to the space-time components <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity's</b> Riemann curvature tensor, the curvature tensor only contains purely spatial components, and both forms of curvature contribute to the total deflection.|$|R
5|$|Dark {{energy in}} its {{simplest}} formulation {{takes the form}} of the cosmological constant term in Einstein's field equations <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity,</b> but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, {{and on what}} level changes are introduced, there are numerous other attempts {{to arrive at a}} viable theory of quantum gravity, some examples being the lattice theory of gravity based on the Feynman Path Integral approach and Regge Calculus, dynamical triangulations, causal sets, twistor models or the path integral based models of quantum cosmology.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to all other}} modern theories of fundamental interactions, general relativity is a classical theory: {{it does not include}} the effects of quantum physics. The quest for a quantum version <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> addresses one of the most fundamental open questions in physics. While there are promising candidates for such a theory of quantum gravity, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity, there is at present no consistent and complete theory. It has long been hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would also eliminate another problematic feature of general relativity: the presence of spacetime singularities. These singularities are boundaries ("sharp edges") of spacetime at which geometry becomes ill-defined, with the consequence that general relativity itself loses its predictive power. Furthermore, there are so-called singularity theorems which predict that such singularities must exist within the universe if the laws <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> were to hold without any quantum modifications. The best-known examples are the singularities associated with the model universes that describe black holes {{and the beginning of the}} universe.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Ehlers' arrival, {{the main}} {{research}} of Jordan's group had been {{dedicated to a}} scalar-tensor modification <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> that later became known as Jordan–Brans–Dicke theory. This theory differs from general relativity in that the gravitational constant {{is replaced by a}} variable field. Ehlers was instrumental in changing the group's focus to the structure and interpretation of Einstein's original theory. Other members of the group included Wolfgang Kundt, Rainer K. Sachs and Manfred Trümper.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{equations}} <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> are non-linear, {{a lump of}} energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
