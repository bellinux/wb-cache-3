25|$|An <b>on-hook</b> {{condition}} {{represents an}} idle circuit, i.e. no phone call is in progress.|$|E
25|$|Most urban exchanges {{provided}} common-battery service, {{meaning that}} the central office provided power to the subscriber telephone circuits for operation of the transmitter, {{as well as for}} automatic signaling with rotary dials. In common-battery systems, the pair of wires from a subscriber's telephone to the exchange carry 48V (nominal) DC potential from the telephone company end across the conductors. The telephone presents an open circuit when it is <b>on-hook</b> or idle.|$|E
25|$|Supervision (line signaling) was {{supplied}} by a District circuit, {{similar to the}} plug and light cord circuit that plugged into a line jack on a switchboard. It supervised the calling and called party and, when both had gone <b>on-hook,</b> released the ground on the sleeve lead, thus releasing all selectors, which returned down to their start position to make ready for further traffic. Some District frames were equipped with the more complex supervisory and timing circuits required to generate coin collect and return signals for handling calls from payphones.|$|E
25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection, and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard. Disconnecting {{at the end of}} the session was also manual, with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging it up on the phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the <b>on-hook</b> state and end the call.|$|E
50|$|The called switch {{sees the}} network go <b>on-hook</b> and the switch goes <b>on-hook.</b> ABCD bits = 0000.|$|E

5000|$|On a trunk, <b>on-hook</b> and {{off-hook}} signals {{must pass}} in both directions. In a one-way trunk, the originating or A board sends a short for off-hook, {{and an open}} for <b>on-hook,</b> while the terminating or B board sends normal polarity or reverse polarity. This [...] "reverse battery" [...] signaling was carried over to later automatic exchanges.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>on-hook</b> {{condition}} {{represents an}} idle circuit, i.e. no phone call is in progress.|$|E
5000|$|Press {{the hook}} flash button (or quickly tap the <b>on-hook</b> sensor on the phone) ...|$|E
50|$|The act {{of going}} <b>on-hook</b> is also {{referred}} to as releasing the line or channel, and may initiate the process of clearing.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, the called {{equipment}} can end a call {{by going}} <b>on-hook</b> deliberately, {{because of some}} specific signalling, or because of some time out.|$|E
50|$|An FXS {{interface}} utilizes an FXO {{protocol to}} detect when the terminating device (telephone) goes <b>on-hook</b> or off-hook, and can {{send and receive}} voice signals.|$|E
5000|$|Delay Start - the {{originator}} {{goes off}} hook, waits a pre-defined delay, and then checks for <b>on-hook</b> {{from the other}} end before sending the digits.|$|E
50|$|While every modem is different, usually mode 0 means <b>on-hook</b> (hung up) and mode 1 is {{sufficient}} {{to pick up the}} phone, record/playback audio, and detect DTMF (touch tones).|$|E
5000|$|One of two {{possible}} signaling states, such as tone or no tone, or ground connection versus battery connection. Note: if <b>on-hook</b> pertains to one state, off-hook {{pertains to the}} other.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to dialing instructions, the system {{also included a}} number of other tones that represented various commands or status. 2600 Hz, the key to early phreaking, was the frequency of the tone sent by the long-distance switch indicating that the user had gone <b>on-hook</b> (hung up the phone). This normally resulted in the remote switch also going <b>on-hook,</b> freeing the trunk for other uses. In order to make free lines easy to find, the 2600 Hz tone was continually played into free trunks. If the tone was sent manually by the local user into the phone line, it would trigger the remote switch to go <b>on-hook,</b> but critically, the local switch knew he was still off-hook because that was signaled electrically, not by the tone (which their local switch ignored). The system was now in an inconsistent state, leaving the local user connected to an operational long-distance trunk line. With further experimentation, the phreaks learned the rest of the signals needed to dial on the remote switch.|$|E
50|$|Other uses {{might include}} placing the caller in queue {{to connect to}} the called party when the called party's line goes <b>on-hook.</b> Increasingly, the {{attendant}} function of a phone system is handled by an auto-attendant.|$|E
50|$|Line {{signaling}} is a {{class of}} telecommunications signaling protocols. Line signaling is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, <b>on-hook</b> unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, line signaling initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While register signaling occurs, line signaling remains quiescent unless the calling party goes <b>on-hook</b> or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|E
5000|$|A general {{description}} {{of one of}} two possible signaling states at an interface between telecommunications systems, such as tone or no tone and ground connection versus battery connection. Note that if off-hook pertains to one state, <b>on-hook</b> pertains to the other.|$|E
5000|$|An {{operating}} state of a telecommunication circuit in which transmission is disabled {{and a high}} impedance, or [...] "open circuit", is presented to the link by the end instrument(s). Note: during the <b>on-hook</b> condition, the link is responsive to ringing signals.|$|E
5000|$|The command AT+VLS=? or AT#VLS=? usually returns {{a list of}} {{operating}} modes that are specific to each modem. Each of these numbered modes determines the telephone line's <b>on-hook</b> or off-hook status, as well as sound routing between each of the following: ...|$|E
50|$|Signaling: Signaling {{is often}} {{referred}} to as supervision. The circuit detects the <b>on-hook</b> and off-hook conditions by monitoring the loop current. In rotary dial systems, it decodes dial pulses. It includes decoding of dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) dialing, hook flash, and other signals.|$|E
5000|$|Wink Start - {{when the}} {{originator}} goes off hook, {{the other end}} transmits a short (140-290ms) off-hook signal and returns to <b>on-hook.</b> The originator detects the wink and then sends the dialed digits. The other end goes permanently off-hook (seized) when the call is answered.|$|E
5000|$|The ring {{conductor}} {{has a direct}} current (DC) potential of [...] to [...] with respect to tip conductor when the line is in the <b>on-hook</b> (idle) state. Floating both conductors, not referencing either one to ground, minimizes the pickup of hum from any nearby alternating current (AC) power wires.|$|E
5000|$|A {{graphic symbol}} that designates a handset {{is used on}} {{cordless}} and mobile phones to specify placing or ending a telephone call. Usually a button with green upright (off-hook) handset icon [...] is used for starting a call, and a red lying-down (<b>on-hook)</b> handset [...] is used for ending a call. Unicode provides the [...] symbol.|$|E
50|$|Using MF signaling, the {{originating}} {{telephone switching}} office sends a starting signal {{such as a}} seizure (off-hook) by toggling the AB bits. After the initial seizure, the terminating office acknowledges a ready state by responding with a wink (short duration seizure) and then goes back <b>on-hook</b> (wink start). The originating office sends the destination digits to the terminating switch.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{enterprises}} with a private branch exchange (PBX) switch, the ringdown can be operated by the PBX key. The switch is programmed to ring a specific extension (the called phone) when a defined extension (the calling phone) goes off-hook. The PBX does not offer dial tone to the calling extension: it only detects <b>on-hook</b> or off-hook status.|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the phone}} {{contained}} circuitry {{composed of a}} small number of passive electrical, electronic and mechanical components. The set needed no separate power supply as it was powered from the telephone line; when it was <b>on-hook</b> and not ringing, it used virtually no power, as the ringer was isolated with a capacitor from the direct current (DC) potential of the local loop.|$|E
5000|$|The {{condition}} that exists when a telephone or other user instrument {{is not in}} use, i.e., when idle waiting for a call. Note: <b>on-hook</b> originally referred to the storage of an idle telephone receiver, i.e., separate earpiece, on a switchhook. The weight of the receiver depresses the spring-loaded switchhook thereby disconnecting the idle instrument (except its bell) from the telephone line.|$|E
50|$|Loop {{start is}} a {{telecommunications}} supervisory protocol between a central office or {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) and a subscriber telephone {{for the purpose of}} starting and terminating a telephone call. It is the simplest of the telephone signaling systems, and uses {{the presence or absence of}} loop current to indicate the off-hook and <b>on-hook</b> loop states, respectively. It is used primarily for subscriber line signaling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanisms}} described {{so far only}} allow circuit seizure - <b>on-hook</b> and off-hook - to be signaled. In {{order to}} allow dialing over the interface, [...] "start" [...] signaling mechanisms are defined. This allows the other end {{to know when to}} send the dialed digits, which are transmitted by pulse (loop disconnect) or multi-frequency tones. E&M defines three methods of [...] "start" [...] signaling: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{device with}} an FXO port has the {{capability}} of behaving as a common analog telephone.In telecommunications, foreign exchange office (FXO) designates a telephone signaling interface that generates the off-hook and <b>on-hook</b> indications (loop closure/non-closure) at the Foreign exchange station's (FXS) end of a telephone circuit. Analog telephone handsets, fax machines and (analogue) modems are FXO devices, though the term is rarely used except in connection with foreign exchange service (FX).|$|E
50|$|Most urban exchanges {{provided}} common-battery service, {{meaning that}} the central office provided power to the subscriber telephone circuits for operation of the transmitter, {{as well as for}} automatic signaling with rotary dials. In common-battery systems, the pair of wires from a subscriber's telephone to the exchange carry 48V (nominal) DC potential from the telephone company end across the conductors. The telephone presents an open circuit when it is <b>on-hook</b> or idle.|$|E
50|$|The pair {{of wires}} {{from the central}} office switch to a {{subscriber}}'s home is called a subscriber loop. It carries a direct current (DC) voltage at a nominal voltage of 48V when the receiver is <b>on-hook,</b> supplied by a power conversion system in the central office. This power conversion system is backed up with a bank of batteries, resulting in continuation of service during interruption of power to the customer supplied by their electrical utility.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{types of}} loop {{signaling}} are {{signals to the}} central office that the subscriber intends to initiate a second simultaneous call, a three-way conference call, or answer a second incoming call. This signal is called flashing or hook flash, and is performed by interrupting the loop {{for a fraction of}} a second, typically at least 300 ms. The flash signal is longer than a rotary dial pulse, sometimes called a short flash, and is shorter than the time required for the <b>on-hook</b> condition.|$|E
