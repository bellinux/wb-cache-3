These tunnels permit safer <b>offset</b> <b>entry</b> into the peritoneal cavity for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Technical advantages include the visual identification of the layers of the gut, blood vessels, and subepithelial tumors. The creation of a mucosal flap that minimizes air and fluid leakage into the extraluminal cavity can enhance the safety and efficacy of surgery. This submucosal tunneling technique was adapted for esophageal myotomy, culminating in its application to patients with achalasia. This method, known as per oral endoscopic myotomy, has opened up the new discipline of submucosal endoscopic surgery. Other clinical applications of the submucosal tunneling technique include its use in the removal of gastrointestinal subepithelial tumors and endomicroscopy for the diagnosis of functional and motility disorders. This review suggests that the submucosal tunneling technique, involving a mucosal safety flap, can have potential values for future endoscopic developments.

Using a unique data set, in which register data from 2011 and 2013 on the Dutch population, income and vehicle registration were combined, the study revealed that couples are more likely to enter car ownership and less likely to exit car ownership when they enter into parenthood. This implies that the delay of entry into parenthood might lead to later entry into car ownership and an increase in life time childlessness might lead to an overall decline in car ownership...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{pathogenesis}} {{of several}} common gastric motility diseases and functional GI disorders remains essentially unexplained. Gastric wall biopsies {{that include the}} muscularis propria to evaluate the enteric nervous system, interstitial cells of Cajal, and immune cells can provide important insights for {{our understanding of the}} etiology of these disorders. Objectives: To determine the technical feasibility, reproducibility, and safety of performing a full-thickness gastric biopsy (FTGB) by using a submucosal endoscopy with mucosal flap (SEMF) technique; the technical feasibility, reproducibility, and safety of tissue closure by using an endoscopic suturing device; the ability to identify myenteric ganglia in resected specimens; and the long-term safety. Design: Single center, preclinical survival study. Setting: Animal research laboratory, developmental endoscopy unit. Subjects: Twelve domestic pigs. Interventions: Animals underwent an SEMF procedure with gastric muscularis propria resection. The resultant <b>offset</b> mucosal <b>entry</b> site was closed by using an endoscopic suturing device. Animals were kept alive for 2 weeks. Main Outcome Measurements: The technical feasibility, reproducibility, and safety of the procedure; the clinical course of the animals; the histological and immunochemical evaluation of the resected specimen to determine whether myenteric ganglia were present in the sample. Results: FTGB was performed by using the SEMF technique in all 12 animals. The <b>offset</b> mucosal <b>entry</b> site was successfully closed by using the suturing device in all animals. The mean resected tissue specimen size was 11 mm. Mean total procedure time was 61 minutes with 2 to 4 interrupted sutures placed per animal. Histology showed muscularis propria and serosa, confirming full-thickness resections in all animals. Myenteric ganglia were visualized in 11 of 12 animals. The clinical course was uneventful. Repeat endoscopy and necropsy at 2 weeks showed absence of ulceration at both the mucosal entry sites and overlying the more distal muscularis propria resection sites. There was complete healing of the serosa in all animals with minimal single-band adhesions in 5 of 12 animals. Retained sutures were present in 10 of 12 animals. Limitations: Animal experiment. Conclusions: FTGB by using the SEMF technique and an endoscopic suturing device is technically feasible, reproducible, and safe.

40|$|In theory, {{free entry}} {{can lead to}} social inefficiency. When new {{products}} are substitutes for existing products, the business stolen from incumbents places a wedge between private and social benefits of entry. The business stealing effect can be <b>offset</b> if <b>entry</b> reduces prices or increases available product variety. Our study of the radio industry provides {{one of the first}} empirical attempts to quantify the inefficiency associated with free entry. Using data on advertising prices, number of stations and radio listening in 135 U. S. metropolitan markets, we estimate how listening and revenue vary with the number of stations. Using a free-entry assumption, we infer the distribution of station costs, which are fixed with respect to listening. We then use our estimates of revenue and fixed costs to calculate the welfare of market participants (excluding listeners) and the number of stations under free entry and social optimality. Relative to the social optimum, the welfare loss of free entry is 40 percent of industry revenue. However, we calculate that the free entry equilibrium would be optimal if the marginal value of programming to listeners were over three times the value of marginal listeners to advertisers, who pay 4. 5 cents per hour. ...|$|R

In the absence of entry, contribution caps improve welfare by "leveling the political playing field".

In particular, a cap may lead to worse policies than the status quo; and even if better policies are chosen, the resulting gain in welfare {{may be more than}} <b>offset</b> by the <b>entry</b> costs.

50|$|In the North Atlantic Region {{pilots are}} {{expected}} to fly along the oceanic track center-line or 1 or 2 nautical miles to its right, randomly choosing one of these three <b>offsets</b> on each <b>entry</b> to oceanic airspace. The aim is to not achieve an overall even distribution of one-third of all flights {{on each of the}} three possible tracks, as one might assume. When the procedure was originally developed, 4.9 percent of aircraft in most oceans could not offset automatically, so the centerline had to remain as an option. Because of the possibility of opposite direction traffic on the centerline, it is the least desirable option, with the highest risk. The procedure lowers the overall risk of collision should an aircraft move vertically away from its assigned level. This randomization has the advantage over a planned assignment of offsets to each individual aircraft in that it mitigates the collision hazard for same-direction flights should an aircraft be erroneously flown along a track that was not assigned by ATC.|$|R
30|$|Greater {{transferability}} {{of human}} capital for prefilers extends to education as well. For {{both male and}} female immigrants, the coefficients on the educational variables indicate that non-prefilers receive a lower return to their education than prefilers. For instance, holding all else constant, a university-educated male non-prefiler earns 20 % more than a non-prefiler with a high school or less education and 15 % more than a non-prefiler with some postsecondary education. For male prefilers, the figures are 91 and 53 %, respectively. Together, these findings indicate that the biggest advantage of preselection is experienced by university-educated immigrants. In particular, for male prefilers with less than a university degree, the higher return to foreign experience will not generally <b>offset</b> the lower <b>entry</b> earnings and the lower return to Canadian experience. To match entry earnings of an observationally equivalent non-prefiler, a prefiler with postsecondary education requires 7 years of foreign experience, while a prefiler with at most a high school diploma requires 10 years. Similar patterns hold for female immigrants. However, given the lower return to foreign experience, female prefilers with less than a university education will be at a permanent earnings disadvantage relative to equivalent non-prefilers.|$|R

In order to establish the ideal anatomical landmarks for insertion of the nail and their clinical relevance we analysed CT scans of bilateral proximal humeri in 200 patients (mean age 45. 1 years (sd 19. 6; 18 to 97) without humeral fractures. The entry point of the nail was defined by the point of intersection of the anteroposterior and lateral vertical axes with the cortex of the humeral head. The critical point {{was defined as the}} intersection of the sagittal axis with the medial limit of the insertion of the supraspinatus tendon on the greater tuberosity. The region of interest, i. e. the biggest entry hole that would not encroach on the insertion of the supraspinatus tendon, was calculated setting a 3 mm minimal distance from the critical point. This identified that 38. 5 % of the humeral heads were categorised as 'critical types', due to morphology in which the predicted <b>offset</b> of the <b>entry</b> point would encroach on the insertion of the supraspinatus tendon that may damage the tendon and reduce the stability of fixation. We therefore emphasise the need for 'fastidious' pre-operative planning to minimise this risk...|$|R

Although the profitability of firms may suffer from the costs of ADA compliance, no systematic review of the evidence has been done. This paper seeks {{to determine if the}} ADA had a measurable impact on both the entry of new firms and the failure rate (exit) of existing firms. The empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ADA negatively impacted the retail industry. There were fewer retail firms after the ADA was passed, and the drop was larger in states in which the ADA was more of a legal innovation, and in states that had more disabled people, more ADA-related lawsuits, and more ADA-related labor complaints. There is also evidence that employment and access discrimination suits imposed real costs on retail stores, encouraging exit. However, the exit of incumbents was partially <b>offset</b> by new <b>entry.</b> Overall, the number of food stores decreased 2 - 13 % after the ADA came into effect, and at least a 1. 4 - 2. 3 % {{decrease in the number of}} smaller stores may be attributed directly to the ADA, net of trends affecting larger firms. Two subsidiary contributions of the paper are an inquiry into the response of industry dynamics to increases in costs, and an econometric model to back out entry and exit rates from establishment count data. The theoretical model of industry dynamics shows that increases in marginal and fixed costs may have interesting and non-obvious effects on entry and exit. The econometric model enables maximum likelihood estimation of unobserved entry and exit processes based on the observed establishment count data. Both models show promise for application to other questions in economics. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how regulators can use access pricing to promote entry by innovatory firms in the presence of essential facilities. The entrants have lower costs that spillover to firms in the market but the regulator is not able to distinguish which entrants have low costs and which do not. In a dynamic framework with entrants of differing quality technology spillovers have two effects. One is positive in that the incumbent can copy the cheaper technology of the entrant. This reduces cost in the industry and <b>offsets</b> the fixed <b>entry</b> cost associated with entry. The other is a negative effect in that the ability to use access pricing to deter entry of bad quality entrants is reduced. A low quality firm can free ride on the quality of a good entrant since it is protected from the consequences of its high costs and poor technology if a good firm has already entered or may be about to enter. The greater the spillover the greater the desire to attract good entrants but also the harder it is to penalise poor quality entrants. This paper considers this dilemma and the consequences for public policy. The question we address is whether the lack of full information encourages the regulator to sustain entry enhancing policies for longer or whether the regulator makes entry harder. Generally, we show that the incentives are for the regulator to limit entry enhancement in the face of incomplete information rather than be more open {{in the face of the}} inability to determine the good firms from the bad ones. We also show that for certain configurations the good firm has an incentive to raise its costs, i. e., become a less good competitor. JEL Classification: L 5...|$|R
40|$|Congress enacted The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{over the}} protests of small {{business}} advocates who claimed that the ADA would trigger a wave of bankruptcies. Although the profitability of firms may suffer from the costs of ADA compliance, no systematic evidence {{is available on the}} ADA’s effect on firms. This paper seeks to determine if the ADA had a measurable impact on the number of retail firms, the entry of new firms, and the exit of existing firms in each market. I first develop a theoretical model of the response of industry dynamics to increases in costs (an extension of Klepper’s (1996) model). I show that increases in marginal and fixed costs may have interesting and non-obvious effects on entry and exit. The restrictions the model places on observed changes in entry and exit allow inference about which components of the ADA raised marginal cost and which raised fixed costs. The same model could easily be adapted to examine the impacts of other forms of cost-increasing regulation or exogenous process innovation on industry dynamics. The data used in the study are counts of business establishments currently operating by county and type of business. While standard count models can be used to investigate changes in the number of firms after the ADA, investigating the ADA’s impacts on entry and exit is more challenging. Backing out the entry and exit rates from the establishment count data is a major econometric contribution of the paper. Applying techniques from queuing theory, we develop the maximum likelihood estimator for a generalized Poisson queuing system based on the available count data. The model incorporates unobserved heterogeneity in and correlation between the entry and exit rates. Identification of the entry and exit rates is secured through the assumption that entry and exit are Poisson stochastic processes, conditional on time-varying covariates and correlated, gamma-distributed mixing terms (i. e., random effects that relax the Markovian assumptions in the model). Although we use techniques drawn from the existing queuing theory literature, the likelihood for the count data is non-trivial to derive and we have not seen the likelihood for this model presented elsewhere. We develop this model here out of necessity, due to the particular limitations of the available data; however, there are many other potential applications for the econometric model. The empirical results imply that the ADA indeed decreased the number of retail firms. There were fewer retail firms after the ADA was passed, and the drop was larger in states in which the ADA was more of a legal innovation, and in states that had more disabled people, more ADA-related lawsuits, and more ADA-related labor complaints.
