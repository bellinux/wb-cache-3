5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology.

In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} for designing decision procedures based on <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to simpler ones. Specifically, we define reduction {{functions as a}} tool for reducing <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a complex <b>theory</b> to <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a simpler one. Reduction functions allow us to reduce <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> lists to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> constructors, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> arrays to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> sets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, and <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> multisets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> integers. Finally, we provide a method for combining reduction functions. This method allows us to reduce <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a combination <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> simpler ones. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E
5|$|The {{rational}} numbers (including 0) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields {{more complicated}} structures called rings and—if division is possible, {{such as in}} Q—fields, which occupy a central position in abstract algebra. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> those entities.|$|E

5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
5|$|Academically, the University of Toronto {{is noted}} for {{influential}} movements and curricula in literary criticism and communication theory, known collectively as the Toronto School. The university was {{the birthplace of}} insulin and stem cell research, and {{was the site of}} the first practical electron microscope, the development of multi-touch technology, the identification of the first black hole Cygnus X-1, and the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> NP-completeness. By a significant margin, it receives the most annual scientific research funding of any Canadian university. It is one of two members of the Association of American Universities outside the United States, the other being McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment should have given a positive result. However, the result of this experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> special relativity.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> evolution {{around the same time}} as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E
5|$|Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun (The Three Leaps of Wang Lun) was Döblin's third novel (although it was {{the first}} to be {{published}} as a book), and garnered him the Fontane Prize. Published in 1916, (although back-dated to 1915), this epic historical novel narrates upheaval and revolution in 18th-century China, and was favorably received by critics, who praised its detailed and exotic depictions of China. Wang Lun also had an influence on younger German writers, including Lion Feuchtwanger, Anna Seghers, and Bertolt Brecht; for the latter, Wang Lun provided an impulse for the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> epic theatre. In commercial sales, it is Döblin's most successful novel after Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E

5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also an expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies {{became more and more}} dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E
5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> sets avoided {{the contradictions of}} earlier systems, and became usable {{as a foundation for}} mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E
