5000|$|Officially {{referred}} to as standard centre-aisle trams, 65 trams in this class built between 1908 and 1925. These trams could carry 90 passengers. The last 21, which were built for the Brisbane Tramways Trust between 1924 and 1925, had 12 windows, remainder built with 6 windows. Originally they were built with <b>open</b> <b>end</b> <b>platforms,</b> but these were enclosed in the 1930s. Some received [...] "streamlining" [...] with oval windows and skirting around their bogies. The attached picture illustrates the differences between various members of this class. The tram in the foreground is a 12 window Dreadnought (built by the Tramways Trust), still with seats on its <b>end</b> <b>platforms</b> and no streamlining. The tram ahead of it is an older, 6 window Dreadnought (built by the Tramways Company), but with its end seats removed and streamlining around its windows and skirting below {{the body of the}} tram.|$|R
50|$|The NZR 50-foot {{carriage}} of 1908 {{were originally}} constructed for the North Island Main Trunk passenger trains. The first were clad in Kauri, with <b>open</b> <b>end</b> <b>platforms,</b> however those built from 1930 were clad in steel, with enclosed vestibles. These main line cars {{were used by}} the NZR. From 1930, similar cars were ordered for South Island services and for North Island provincial services, in particular, for the Rotorua Limited express. All of the North Island cars were 8 ft wide and the 20 South Island cars (7 first class seating 30) were 8 ft wide. The North Island second class cars seated 42 passengers with four across, but the South Island cars seated 37 passengers with three across. Two observation cars with lounge chairs were trialled on the Rotorua service from 1930, but did not prove successful and were converted into ordinary carriages.|$|R
2500|$|Rolling {{stock was}} also renewed. [...] The {{passenger}} cars, mainly still {{dating from the}} steam era, and equipped with <b>open</b> <b>platform</b> <b>ends,</b> were replaced between 1955 and 1963 by passenger cars of modern light steel construction with centre entrances. The locomotives {{from the time of}} electrification were supplemented between 1960 and 1965 by five passenger railcars. To increase safety, a remote controlled block signalling system was installed along the complete line from Brig between 1965 and 1966.|$|R
5000|$|TGR {{has three}} all-steel air {{conditioned}} panorama cars with <b>open</b> <b>platform</b> <b>ends</b> and <b>open</b> gangways {{similar to the}} 'Scarrett' cars, known locally as 'Jungle Gyms' {{due to the nature}} of their framework when under construction. These were designed and built by the OETT in 1987-92, with a [...] "very distinctive shape to fit the tunnels". Two of these carriages were built on Z class 'roadsider' van underframes while the third was built on the underframe of guard's van F 529.|$|R
5000|$|All trains as of [...] {{include some}} of Dunedin Railways five ex-New Zealand Government Railways 47" [...] 6 foot wooden cladded carriages. These cars are known as [...] "Scarrett" [...] {{heritage}} carriages, and were built between 1912 and 1923 with <b>open</b> <b>platform</b> <b>ends</b> and gangways and 37 seats. Dunedin Railways has started retiring these carriages largely to provide bogies for their 56-foot stock, which did not have their own when they were purchased. Two of the 47 foot cars have been sold, while two were scrapped circa 1978. One carriage, A 1254, {{is owned by the}} Ocean Beach Railway and is leased to Dunedin Railways. This carriage will be returned to the OBR at the conclusion of its lease.|$|R
25|$|Intending {{to use it}} in the off season, the <b>open</b> <b>platform</b> <b>ends</b> were rebuilt to be enclosed, with folding {{doors on}} the UK loading side, and the {{original}} roof-mounted electrical resistances were replaced by new platform-mounted units, arranged to help to keep the car interior warm in winter. Original interior features were restored, although changes were made to the destination boxes. While the tram was repainted into the Beamish crimson and cream livery as used on No. 10, the intention of the restoration was to retain its original Portuguese styling as much as possible. It entered museum service in May 1992. In 2012 it received an overhaul and was repainted into a South Shields Corporation Tramways blue and yellow livery. At the end of 2016 it received a tyre and motor overhaul to prepare it for the busy Christmas season.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a system is informed from design factors in order to success- fully support the intended usability from the perceived affordances. The theory of ‘Human Centered Design’ champions that these factors be derived from the user itself. It is based on exploiting these affordances that the boundary of technology is pushed to sometimes invent new methods or sometimes approach a problem from newer perspectives. This thesis is an example where we inform our design rationales from children {{in order to develop}} a gender neutral modular robotic toy kit. ^ To this end we create HandiMate, a robotics kit which enables users to construct and animate their toys using everyday craft materials. The kit contains eight joint modules, a tablet interface and a glove controller. Unlike popular kits, HandiMate does not rely on manufactured parts to construct the toy. Rather this <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>platform</b> engages users to pursue interest driven activities using everyday objects, such as cardboard, construction paper, and spoons. These crafted parts are then fastened together using Velcro to the joint modules and animated using the glove as the controller. ^ To understand the usability of the affordances, we discuss the results from user studies. These studies were designed to understand the a affinity of HandiMate among children. The first study reveals that children rated the HandiMate kit as gender- neutral, appealing equally to both female and male students. The second study discusses the benefits of engaging children in engineering design with HandiMate, which has been observed to bring out children’s tacit physics-based engineering knowledge and facilitate learning. ^ We further investigate the use of a gesture user interface by children for controlling robots made from a modular robotic toy kit. We conducted gesture elicitation studies to suggest embodied hand gestures for invoking motion among user developed robots. We elicit gestures from 23 children, first by portraying the ‘effect’(motion from the toy) and then asking the user to perform it’s ‘cause’ (reading gestures by a wearable glove). A total of 276 gestures for controlling 4 referent toys were collected, analyzed and reported. The gesture data, calculated by a kinematic hand model, was analyzed using a visual analytics approach integrating an interactive clustering and visualization technique. ^ Our findings suggest designs preferences of generic gestures for controlling toys like puppet, robotic arm etc. The results also imply that the sustained period of a gesture pose is about 30 seconds and give us insights into higher level classification of gestures mapped to the motion, topology and logical action based on motion of the toy. We also found that children would prefer using whole body interactions for big robots as compared to using hand gestures for lap-sized robots. We further discuss these design implications which helps designers design gesture systems for modular robotic kits. ...|$|R

50|$|Cars 67A and 68A, {{built at}} Williamstown Workshops in 1880, were rebuilt as Ministerial Cars 2 and 1 {{respectively}} in 1894.
