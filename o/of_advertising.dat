40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present paper is {{to examine the effects of}} overconsumption on {{consumer}} evaluations <b>of</b> <b>advertised</b> brands. While the determinants and health consequences of overconsumption have received considerable attention, the authors suggest that there are important marketing and advertising implications. Specifically, based on goal theory, the authors examined whether the aversive state of oversatiation is associated with more negative evaluations <b>of</b> <b>advertised</b> brands <b>of</b> the overconsumed product. Design/methodology/approach: In three studies, oversatiation was measured or experimentally induced by having participants drink (too) much mineral water. Subsequently, participants watched advertisement of mineral water brands and control brands. Evaluations of the brands, buying intentions and estimates of future purchases <b>of</b> the <b>advertised</b> brands were measured. Findings: Oversatiation negatively affected evaluations, buying intentions and estimates of future purchases <b>of</b> <b>advertised</b> mineral water brands. Importantly, a state of oversatiation did not affect evaluation <b>of</b> <b>advertised</b> brands not relevant to the overfulfilled goal. Originality/value: Overconsumption of food and drinks can have detrimental health effects and results in large costs to society. While its health implications have received abundant scientific attention, little attention has been paid to the psychological consequences of the state of being oversatiated. Here, the authors show that the state of oversatiation (which might, for example, be very common during watching television commercials) can lead to particularly negative evaluations <b>of</b> <b>advertised</b> brands. As such, these findings have important marketing implications...|$|R
