40|$|Controlled <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{precipitation}} can be {{used for}} various applications. <b>Calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> precipitation occurs when dissolved <b>calcium</b> and <b>carbonate</b> are mixed at concentrations which exceed the solubility of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> With alternate injection of pulses of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate solutions in time through a porous medium, dispersion will create a partial mixing zone in space, which moves through the whole system by advective flow. By means of dispersion and advection this should then create a homogeneous <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> deposit. By varying the concentration of the pulses, the size of the pulses, the distance between the pulses and the flow velocity {{it should be possible to}} control the location and distribution of the precipitated <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> to a certain extent. To investigate this principle a numerical model is developed, which is based on advective-dispersive-reactive transport equations for multiple dissolved and solid components using Matlab and Orchestra. Different ways of implementation have been tested and the performance of the model has been evaluated. With the final model seven different simulations were performed in which the system variables: concentration, flow rate, pulse duration and pulse distance were varied. These simulations showed that controlled precipitation of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> using alternating pulse injections is possible. Increasing the distance between the pulses increases the distance over which the <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> is distributed, while the amount stays the same. Doubling the solute concentration in the pulse leads to a proportional increase of the amount of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> Doubling the flow velocity or the pulse duration lowers the peak quantity of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> but improves the distribution. However, the quantity of precipitated <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> in all simulations was only 30 % of the expected quantity of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> Further investigations showed a saw tooth pattern near the injection point which indicate that <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> is dissolving again at a higher rate than anticipated.
