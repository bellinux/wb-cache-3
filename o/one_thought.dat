25|$|The {{acquisition}} of Airco in February 1920 was a financial {{disaster for the}} BSA group.

All dividends were passed from 1920 to 1924.|$|E

25|$|During the {{planning}} phase, virtually no <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the original}} site of Jamestown would be suitable, as it was isolated and long-abandoned.

25|$|As {{a celebration}} was planned, {{virtually}} no <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the actual}} isolated and long-abandoned original site of Jamestown would be suitable for a major event because Jamestown Island had no facilities for large crowds. The original fort housing the Jamestown settlers was {{believed to have been}} long ago swallowed by the James River. The general area in James City County near Jamestown was also considered unsuitable, as it was not very accessible in the day of rail travel before automobiles were common.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{approaches}} were more heavily mined than anticipated, the ships {{of the invasion}} fleet were unable to use the main anchorage safely until it was properly swept. As the day proceeded, ship to shore travel became more difficult as a south-easterly gale blew up and made heavy seas. But by this time, no <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> to delay operations for better weather. Thus, LCAs were required to make long and frequent journeys from ship to shore with supplies and reinforcements in worsening sea conditions.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, leaking {{aviation}} gasoline accumulating {{in the forward}} elevator pit began vaporising and soon permeated {{the upper and lower}} hangar decks. The danger this posed to the ship was readily apparent to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three months had passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to pump out the damaged elevator well were bungled and no <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> to try to cover the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.|$|E

25|$|Mar Samuel was unfortunate in {{his family}} life. He had no sons, and his two daughters were {{captured}} by soldiers during the war with the Romans. They were taken to Sepphoris, in Palestine, where they were ransomed by coreligionists, but both died {{at an early age}} after having been married successively to a relative (Ket. 23a; Yer. Ket. ii. 26c). The esteem in which Mar Samuel was held appears from the fact that no <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> of attributing his misfortune to any sin committed by him; it was explained rather as being in consequence of some offense committed in Babylon by R. Ḥananya, the nephew of R. Joshua (Yer. Ket. ii. 8; comp. Ket. 23a). After his death Samuel was glorified in legend.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest were}} {{scattered}} and proceeding independently, including {{a group of}} four with Pink, trailing some 80 miles behind the main body. The 1st Support Group sailed from Newfoundland at midday with frigates Wear, Jed, Spey and sloops Pelican and Sennen to replace Oribi and Offa whose fuel state would become critical on the 5th. U-628 of group Finke, assembled to catch convoy SC 128, sighted convoy ONS 5 at 2018. Two of the gathering group Finke U-boats were attacked by RCAF Cansos in separate incidents. <b>One</b> <b>thought</b> to have been U-630 was sunk; but is now {{believed to have been}} U-209, which was damaged in an attack by Canso W, and foundered later while attempting to return to base.

25|$|There {{were those}} who {{preferred}} Britannicus over Nero, such as Claudius' freedman Narcissus. Unfortunately for his cause, Narcissus was away in Campania when the emperor was poisoned, while Britannicus and his sisters, Octavia and Antonia, were kept {{out of sight in}} their rooms by Agrippina. That way none could challenge Nero's succession. If <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> that Britannicus' claim should take precedence, the response was that Nero too was the son of Claudius, with Agrippina linking him back to Augustus. It didn't help that many were convinced that Britannicus was no longer in the line of succession, a direct effect of the propaganda against him by Agrippina. Nero spoke the eulogy at the emperor's funeral and took sole power. Claudius' new will, which either granted joint-rule to Britannicus and Nero or just Britannicus, was suppressed by the new emperor's men in the senate.|$|E

25|$|One {{other major}} {{collector}} {{who was also}} famous was Carlos Monsiváis, who considered La Lagunilla {{one of his most}} important sources for his collections. During his first visit to La Lagunilla in 1968, Carlos Monsiváis found an old copy of “La familia Burrón,” when no <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> this series by Gabriel Vargas was collectible. He was regularly found here and other markets in the city to add to his collection which eventually filled his house in the Portales neighborhood to overflow. This collection was amassed over forty years and included stamps, postcards, scorecards, crafts by artisans such as Teresa Nava, Susana and Teodoro Torres, and Roberto Ruiz, photographs, popular toys, albums, calendars, comics, newspapers, notebooks and cookbooks. His collection eventually founded the Museo de Estanquillo in 2006, with about 12,000 objects that he collected over thirty years.|$|E
25|$|Collett, in his book, portrays Dyer as a man, who, got on {{extremely}} well with his men and his juniors, while his contemporaries and seniors were always wary {{of him and}} as a person, who when he approached a complex political problem: his <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> was to have order; his one tool to get it was the gun. He notes that, {{at the time of}} the Amritsar massacre, Dyer was racked by ill-health and separated from his beloved family - and speculates that - perhaps, this encouraged his extreme view that the Punjab was on the brink of rebellion, the empire about to collapse and feared a mutiny like that of 1857. The solution, he decided, was not just to restore order but to show that the state was in charge. It was not enough to have shops and businesses reopen in Amritsar - an example was needed of the consequences of insubordination.|$|E
25|$|North Melbourne Football Club {{originated}} in the year 1869, when a football team was formed for local cricketers desiring to keep fit over the winter months. <b>One</b> <b>thought</b> is that the club {{was connected to the}} St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club, now the St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, whose colours – blue and white – are reflected in the North Melbourne's colours today. The association between the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club and the establishment of the North Melbourne Football Club {{is believed to have been}} an informal gathering to play some competitive sport. Information on the club's first ever match is limited, but it is known that it took place in Royal Park, which also served as the club's home ground until 1882. The ball used in the match was purchased by a local resident called Tom Jacks, who sold some roofing iron to pay for it. James Henry Gardiner is considered the founder of the club. He continued an active role with North Melbourne until his death in 1921.|$|E
