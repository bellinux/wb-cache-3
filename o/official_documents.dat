5|$|An {{impression}} of the Great Seal of a state (or its coat of arms) has long been required on <b>official</b> <b>documents</b> ranging from deeds to legislative acts. It was the emblem that certified the authenticity of a given document or that {{the authority of the}} state was invested in said document. Judicial decisions upheld the need for a valid seal and/or coat of arms on notarized documents.|$|E
5|$|In the Eastern empire, {{laws and}} <b>official</b> <b>documents</b> were {{regularly}} translated into Greek from Latin. Both languages were in active use {{by government officials}} and the Church during the 5th century. From the 6th century, Greek culture was studied in the West almost exclusively through Latin translation. Latin loanwords appear liberally in Greek texts on technical topics from late antiquity and the Byzantine period.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read <b>official</b> <b>documents</b> before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E

5|$|Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard is a posthumous {{biography}} of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard by British journalist Russell Miller. First {{published in the}} United Kingdom on 26 October 1987, the book takes a critical perspective, challenging the Church of Scientology's account of Hubbard's life and work. It quotes extensively from <b>official</b> <b>documents</b> acquired using the Freedom of Information Act and from Hubbard's personal papers, which were obtained via a defector from the Church. It was also published in Australia, Canada and the United States.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} languages {{were recorded}} in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, {{on the grounds that}} the publication of <b>official</b> <b>documents</b> only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.|$|E
5|$|<b>Official</b> <b>documents</b> {{support the}} {{allegation}} of interference by the 610 Office. In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province described how legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners {{must be approved}} and/or audited by the 610 Office. The 610 Office's organizational proximity to the CPC's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise influence with the Supreme People's Court and Ministry of Justice, both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels.|$|E

The current design of the seal was standardized by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The early hatt-ı hümayuns {{were written}} in the calligraphic styles of tâlik, tâlik kırması (a variant of tâlik), nesih and riq’a. After Mahmud II, they were only written in riq’a. Ahmed III and Mahmud II were skilled penmen and their hatt-ı hümayuns are notable for their long and {{elaborate}} annotations on <b>official</b> <b>documents.</b> In contrast, Sultans who accessed the throne at an early age, such as Murad V and Mehmed IV display poor spelling and calligraphy.|$|E

As {{in other parts of the}} country there was widespread unrest, during which property and <b>official</b> <b>documents</b> were destroyed and several individuals were summarily executed.|$|E

5|$|The tombs were {{constructed}} and decorated by the {{workers of the}} village of Deir el-Medina, located in a small wadi between this valley and the Valley of the Queens, facing Thebes. The workers journeyed to the tombs through various routes over the Theban hills. The daily lives of these workers are quite well known and are recorded in tombs and <b>official</b> <b>documents.</b> Amongst the events documented is perhaps the first recorded worker's strike, detailed in the Turin strike papyrus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his <b>official</b> <b>documents,</b> an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E

Windy Nook was part of County Durham until it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972. It is now bordered by settlements which are also part of the metropolitan borough. These are Sheriff Hill to the south, Carr Hill to the west, Felling to the north and Leam Lane Estate to the east.|$|E

5|$|Public {{holidays}} in Rhodesia, {{a historical}} region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history. Annual holidays marked {{various aspects of}} the arrival of white people during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective unilateral declarations of independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On these days, most businesses and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British manner, and referred to in <b>official</b> <b>documents</b> by name—Christmas Day, for example, or Easter Monday.|$|E
5|$|The birth {{certificates}} and wills of Roman citizens {{had to be}} written in Latin until the time of Alexander Severus (reigned 222–235). Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe (scriba) read or write their <b>official</b> <b>documents</b> for them. Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out. Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of language spoken or ability to read. An early form of story ballet (pantomimus) was brought to Rome by Greek performers and became popular throughout the multilingual Empire {{in part because it}} relied on gesture rather than verbal expression.|$|E
5|$|To {{some degree}} the {{movement}} has been successful. Beginning in 1998, the official curriculum in Taiwan schools has been changed to contain more frequent and favorable mention of aborigines. In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on <b>official</b> <b>documents,</b> offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed aboriginal/Han parents.|$|E
