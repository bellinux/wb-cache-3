5|$|Bone {{grafting}} {{is necessary}} {{when there is}} a lack <b>of</b> <b>bone.</b> While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal is to have a minimum of 10mm in bone height, and 6mm in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+mm <b>of</b> <b>bone,</b> B=7–9mm, C=4–6mm and D=0–3mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade <b>of</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E

The coronoid process (a projecting piece <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> directly behind the molars) rises steeply, with its front wall virtually vertical.|$|E

5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E

40|$|Aim: {{to detect}} the regularities of age {{variability}} <b>of</b> <b>bones</b> in the forearm at adult men. Material and Methods. By the method of a direct osteometry the greatest length and the circle of the middle diaphysis of radial and ulnar bones were determined. The thickness-length index reflecting massiveness <b>of</b> a <b>bone</b> {{was defined as a}} percentage of a circle of middle diaphysis to the greatest length <b>of</b> a <b>bone.</b> Results. Age features of the greatest length, the greatest circle of a diaphysis and the thickness-length index <b>of</b> <b>bones</b> in the forearm, and also correlation of the studied parameters with a body length were revealed. Conclusion. The greatest length of radial and ulnar bones changes with age slightly whereas the circle of the middle diaphysis <b>of</b> <b>bones</b> in the forearm significantly increases with age according to the statistics that affects the increase in an index <b>of</b> massiveness <b>of</b> <b>bones...</b>|$|R

5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity <b>of</b> <b>bone.</b> In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, the Pieds-Noirs {{numbered}} 1,025,000, {{and accounted}} for 10.4% {{of the total population}} of Algeria, a percentage gradually diminishing since the peak of 15.2% in 1926. However, some areas of Algeria had high concentrations of Pieds-Noirs, such as the regions <b>of</b> <b>Bône</b> (now Annaba), Algiers, and above all the area from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abbès. Oran had been under European rule since the 17th century, and the population in the Oran metropolitan area was 49.3% European and Jewish in 1959. In the Algiers metropolitan area, Europeans and Jewish people accounted for 35.7% of the population. In the metropolitan area <b>of</b> <b>Bône</b> they accounted for 40.5% of the population. The département of Oran, a rich European-developed agricultural land of 16,520km² (6,378 sq. miles) stretching between the cities of Oran and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, and including them, was the area of highest Pied-Noir density outside of the cities, with the Pieds-Noirs accounting for 33.6% {{of the population of the}} département in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
