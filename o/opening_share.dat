40|$|Non-parametric {{modeling}} is {{a method}} which relies heavily on data and motivated by the smoothness properties in estimating a function which involves spline and non-spline approaches. Spline approach consists of regression spline and smoothing spline. Regression spline with Bayesian approach is considered in {{the first step of}} a two-step method in estimating the structural parameters for stochastic differential equation (SDE). The selection of knot and order of spline can be done heuristically based on the scatter plot. To overcome the subjective and tedious process of selecting the optimal knot and order of spline, an algorithm was proposed. A single optimal knot is selected out of all the points with exception of the first and the last data which gives the least value of Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) for each order of spline. The use is illustrated using observed data of <b>opening</b> <b>share</b> prices of Petronas Gas Bhd. The results showed that the Mean Square Errors (MSE) for stochastic model with parameters estimated using optimal knot for 1, 000, 5, 000 and 10, 000 runs of Brownian motions are smaller than the SDE models with estimated parameters using knot selected heuristically. This verified the viability of the two-step method in the estimation of the drift and diffusion parameters of SDE with an improvement of a single knot selection...|$|E
40|$|Through 2001 to 2005, Chinese {{government}} implements {{three important}} stock market liberalization policies: <b>opening</b> of B <b>shares,</b> <b>opening</b> of A <b>shares</b> and transferring non-tradable shares to be tradable, {{to reduce the}} market segmentation and inefficiency. This article is going to examine that if the segmentation phenomenon is weakened and if enterprises receive lower cost of capital after these reforms. I use Johansen Co-integration Test and Error Correction Model to find the co-integration between markets, and then adopt the model analyzed by Stulz (1995) to examine the degree of market segmentations and cost of capital. I find that the market segmentations decrease after every reform and Chinese stock market has long-term relationships with the world stock market and between internal A&B share markets. But only two reforms: <b>opening</b> B <b>shares</b> and non-tradable shares reform, lead the cost of capital to fall, <b>opening</b> A <b>shares</b> {{does not seem to}} bring economic benefits.

S. -Canadian relationship {{was similar to the}} SC, focusing on securing external borders while <b>opening</b> <b>shared</b> borders. Some experts, especially in the U. S., argue that border security needs to be tightened further while others contend increased U. S. -Canadian border security is unnecessary and harms commerce. In 2011, Denmark decided to increase internal border security, rejecting the SC tenets requiring common security of external border of the larger Schengen area and open internal zones. The increase represented a case study of unilateral border relations. Although never completed, the lessons of this brief experiment in increased border security are that homeland security decisions are based more on arguments of sovereignty and politics, rather than on objective determinations of threats and security. More broadly, this thesis argues that the U. S. and Canada can benefit from returning to an open border and push the threat as far away as possible. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This {{audiovisual}} {{essay was}} created at the wonderful NEH-funded workshop in videographic criticism at Middlebury College, ‘Scholarship in Sound and Image’. The essay provides {{an analysis of}} the orchestration of long takes and camera movement in the opening of Caught (Ophuls, 1949), and develops a comparison with the opening of Madame de… (Ophuls, 1953 – U. S. release title The Earrings of Madame de…), not least through a series of juxtapositions, which can be directly presented and compared in an audiovisual essay. The <b>openings</b> <b>share</b> a concern with the subjectivity of the female protagonists and our relationship toward it, evoking the women’s experience while balancing this with other kinds of perspective. As has been noted in the critical literature on Ophuls, and on melodramas of passion more generally, such views enable us to perceive the women concerned to be caught in material and ideological frameworks of which they are at best partially aware. Among the interests of this particular comparison, however, {{is the extent to which}} the dynamic around female subjectivity is played in relation to luxury goods, imagined, owned or admired. Tensions between on- and off-screen spaces and sounds are critical to the interest of the long takes under discussion. Camera movements subtly inflect the extent to which we are aligned (or otherwise) with the characters and the ways in which their material circumstances are revealed to us...|$|R

Despite the availability of numerous dedicated file formats and software packages, it is a widely held viewpoint that the biggest challenge is simply <b>opening,</b> <b>sharing,</b> and analyzing a file without loss of information. Here we present OpenMSI, a software framework and platform that addresses these challenges via an advanced, high-performance, extensible file format and Web API for remote data access ([URL] The OpenMSI file format supports storage of raw MSI data, metadata, and derived analyses in a single, self-describing format based on HDF 5 and is supported by a large range of analysis software (e. g., Matlab and R) and programming languages (e. g., C++, Fortran, and Python). Careful optimization of the storage layout of MSI data sets using chunking, compression, and data replication accelerates common, selective data access operations while minimizing data storage requirements and are critical enablers of rapid data I/O. The OpenMSI file format has shown to provide > 2000 -fold improvement for image access operations, enabling spectrum and image retrieval in less than 0. 3 s across the Internet even for 50 GB MSI data sets.
