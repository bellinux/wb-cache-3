5|$|Ross felt {{strongly}} that the state should adequately care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility {{had run out of}} room, so Ross served as chairman <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected enough money to move to a larger location.|$|E
5|$|Spitzer devoted much of {{his career}} to pushing for the {{development}} of a space telescope. In 1962, a report by the US National Academy of Sciences recommended the development of a space telescope as part of the space program, and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.|$|E

5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended {{an increase in}} the number of full-time inspectors from two to four; restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the tightening of the definition and practice of pithing. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> known as the Lords Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E

Since 1977, {{players from the}} Negro Leagues have been considered by the Veterans Committee, and nine more individuals have been approved by that body. In 2005, the Hall announced the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Committee</b> on African-American Baseball, which held a 2006 election for eligible figures from the Negro Leagues and earlier 19th-century teams; 17 additional Negro League figures were chosen in that election, including executive Effa Manley, the first woman inducted.|$|E

Goebel was friends with Ford's mother and stepfather and recommended Ford to head football coach Harry Kipke at the University of Michigan. When Ford returned from World War II, Goebel urged him to run for U.S. Congress and was part of the original Ford-for-Congress committee. Goebel was later the chairman <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> formed in 1960 to name Ford as the Republican Party's Vice Presidential candidate on the ticket with Richard Nixon.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Narayan was {{nominated}} to the Rajya Sabha, the upper {{house of the}} Indian Parliament, for his contributions to literature. During his entire six-year term, he was focused on one issue—the plight of school children, especially the heavy load of school books and the negative effect of the system on a child's creativity, which was something that he first highlighted in his debut novel, Swami and Friends. His inaugural speech was focused on this particular problem, and resulted in the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> chaired by Prof. Yash Pal, to recommend changes to the school educational system.|$|E
5|$|Morgan was {{sometimes}} {{sought to investigate}} public problems on behalf of federal or state governments. She examined the food quality at San Quentin Prison in 1939, and in the 1940s she was the founding chair of the California Nutrition War Committee and served on the Office of Scientific Research and Development.

The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Whole was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the House.|$|E
5|$|Pflueger's {{social and}} {{business}} connections spanned the city, including three private men's clubs which he joined: the Bohemian Club, the Olympic Club and The Family. He designed buildings and interior architecture {{for the latter}} two. Pflueger was highly placed in several important planning organizations: He was the chairman <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> of consulting architects on the Bay Bridge project and he served on the committee responsible {{for the design of}} the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939.

5|$|The {{author and}} biographer Tom Rolt, visited {{the line in}} 1949, along with the {{locomotive}} engineer David Curwen. In the summer of 1950, Rolt {{wrote a letter to}} the Birmingham Post newspaper suggesting that a rescue of the Talyllyn be undertaken. He received sufficient positive response for a meeting of interested enthusiasts to be held on 11 October 1950 at the Imperial Hotel in Birmingham. Around 70people, including Patrick Whitehouse, attended the meeting, with Rolt proposing the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> to look into the acquisition of the railway. With the support of the meeting, the committee – with Rolt as chairman and Whitehouse as Secretary – met for the first time on 23 October and immediately entered into negotiation with Haydn Jones' executors.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} and high profile of the committees are the pairs of standing committees. These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members. The reverse {{is the case for}} the references committees. Because the chair has a casting vote in the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> vote being tied, the government effectively controls the legislation committees, while the non-government parties control the references committees.|$|E
5|$|The town of Siliguri, {{the start}} of the railway route, was {{connected}} with Calcutta (now Kolkata) via railway in 1878, while the additional journey to Darjeeling required the use of tongas (horse-driven carts) along a dust track. On the recommendations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> appointed by Sir Ashley Eden, work on the railroad began in 1879 and was completed by July 1881. The line underwent several improvements such as making gradients more gradual over the years to increase manoeuvrability. By 1909–1910, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was carrying roughly 174,000 passengers and 47,000 tons of goods annually.|$|E
5|$|When the British and Arab forces {{marched on}} Damascus {{in the final}} year of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in World War I, the Ottoman {{authorities}} fled and left Damascus in the control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> of citizens.

In that same year, he was also a member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> tasked with a project to establish a brewery in Edmonton. In 1893, he established a partnership with local architect Nathaniel G. Flater, and operated under the name Edmiston & Flater, headquartered at the Edmonton Imperial Bank Building. The firm designed many notable buildings for the town, including the first post office, the city's first brick school (for the Edmonton Public School District), the All Saints' Anglican Cathedral, a home for Herbert Charles Wilson, the McDougall & Secord retail store, and a fire hall. In 1899, he would end his partnership with Flater and enter into a new one, with Henry D.

5|$|In April 2004, Farmer {{announced}} the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> {{to study the}} effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer's markets. In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture; in 2007, he {{was elected president of}} the organization. Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals. On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue.|$|E
