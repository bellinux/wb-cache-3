5000|$|Published in November 2012, was Sullivans book on {{the life}} and death of pop star Michael Jackson: Untouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death <b>of</b> Michael <b>Jackson.</b> The book was met with some controversy, mainly because Sullivan argued that Jackson was not a [...] "child molester" [...] and rather, that he was [...] "pre-sexual" [...] having never engaged in sexual {{intercourse}} at all. The book also detailed much <b>of</b> <b>Jacksons</b> drug abuse in his later years, money trouble, and [...] "spending habits" [...] -- which upset many <b>of</b> <b>Jacksons</b> diehard fans. Some fans started an online campaign against the books sale on Amazon. However, as Guardian columnist Deborah Orr points out: many <b>of</b> <b>Jacksons</b> more fanatic followers tend to criticize any negative press about <b>Jacksons</b> life, regardless <b>of</b> evidence or argument. Others called into question Sullivans source material, and though Sullivan [...] "does an adequate job of chronicling Jackson’s over-the-top fame," [...] he relies on too few verifiable sources to draw his conclusions. Nonetheless, Jacksons long time attorney, Tom Mesereau, who was also one of Sullivans main sources for his research on Jackson, came to Sullivans defense and praised the book for its insight and accuracy. Still others praised the book; for example, there was [...] "a glowing recommendation from broadcaster and journalist Danny Baker" [...] who called it the [...] "best" [...] book about Jackson; and The New Yorker praised the books in-depth research, viz., for bringing to light the [...] "financial profligacy and wrongheadedness" [...] <b>of</b> <b>Jacksons</b> life and business choices.|$|R
