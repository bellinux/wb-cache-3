The seal rolls from the shell to the abutment surface of the piston and vice versa providing the piston with a frictionless self-centering facility. During depressurisation the seal (Usually rubber) also provides a gas tight facility that protects the holder from vacuum damage by blocking the gas <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle.</b> During commissioning of the gasholder the sealing membrane is set into an operating condition. This setting must be carried out every time the gasholder is depressurised, otherwise known as [...] "popping" [...] the seal.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} propeller systems {{where the}} rotation of the propeller is reversed to provide astern movement, a waterjet will continue to pump normally while a deflector is lowered into the jetstream after it leaves the <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle.</b> This deflector redirects thrust forces forward to provide reverse thrust. Most highly developed reverse deflectors redirect the jetstream down and to each side to prevent recirculation of the water through the jet again, which may cause aeration problems, or increase reverse thrust. Steering is still available with the reverse deflector lowered so the vessel will have full maneuverability. With the deflector lowered about halfway into the jetstream, forward and reverse thrust are equal so the boat maintains a fixed position, but steering is still available to allow the vessel to turn on the spot - something which is impossible with a conventional single propeller.|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{physical model}} of a delta-shaped, four-strand tundish was constructed at McGill University to find optimal operating conditions for the tundish. The objective of this work was to determine how best to increase steel production rates by 14 % over current tundish operating conditions, these being 12 tons/min with four 15. 0 mm <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> for a 500 mm depth of liquid steel while maintaining steel quality levels. Two options were suggested: the normal head option uses 16. 0 mm <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> and maintains the 500 mm tundish level, while the high head option uses 14. 8 mm <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzles</b> and raises the depth of liquid steel within the tundish to 800 mm. The important effects of flow control devices on the hydrodynamic performance of the tundish were also tested, using {{two different types of}} flow modifiers: Impact Pad and Turbo-Stop. For a proper comparison between the two options, three aspects were investigated; vortex formation phenomena during tundish draining between ladle changes, Residence Time Distribution (RTD), and Inclusion Separation Ratios (ISR). Inclusion removal rates were studied experimentally with the aid of the aqueous" Liquid Metal Cleanliness Analyzer (LiMCA) system. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to visualize the actual instantaneous, or momentary, flows, thereby providing the data needed for time averaged velocity fields and turbulent kinetic energies. A mathematical model based on METFLO was developed to simulate these tundish operations numerically. The Renormalization Group turbulence model (RNG) as well as the standard high Reynolds number k-s turbulence model (STD) was implemented in order to simulate the turbulent flows within the tundish. The validity of METFLO was confirmed by PIV measurements and the numerical predictions of the RTD, and RRI matched the results of physical modelling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of nozzles with different angles on PDE performance, PDE with nozzles of different convergent and divergent angles were simulated and propane-air mixture was used. The simulation {{results indicated that the}} effects of nozzles with different angles on the pressure at the thrustwall of PDE and <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> were not the same. The pressure at the thrustwall and <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> of PDE with convergent nozzles was higher than that with divergent nozzles, and the pressure peak appeared earlier in the case of convergent nozzles. The peak value of the pressure at the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> increased and appeared ahead of time as the convergent angle increased.

50|$|The lowest drum of {{the three}} {{provided}} the heating surface. This was almost entirely filled with a cylindrical corrugated furnace. A length, approximately one diameter, {{was filled with a}} number of, around 60, small diameter fire-tubes. Compared to previous large-flued stationary boilers, such as the Lancashire or Galloway boilers, this was a larger heating area in a very compact space. The tubes were still short, compared to locomotive boilers, and offered good gasflow for the exhaust gases without needing additional exhaust draughting. The waterspace around the furnace was just thick enough to allow good circulation and leave space for mud to build up, but otherwise keeping the water volume to a minimum. This led to rapid heating of the water and so good thermosyphon circulation into the central drum above. This circulation was encouraged by the provision of a number of pipe connections between the drums. Each connection had an internal divider to give two separated pipes, the downcomer being just a short pipe from {{the lower part of the}} drum, but the outlet of the upwell pipe was raised above the water level and turned over in an <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle,</b> promoting mixing of the hottest water and avoiding the formation of a stratified hot layer above cold. Examples showed a single large diameter fire-tube at the base of the tubeplate and a full-diameter section of furnace beyond the fire-tube nest, but the purpose of either of these features is unclear. Like the larger Lancashire boilers, exhaust gases were then led through brick flues around the outside of the boiler.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of the article reviews the {{possible}} methods for LPG and air mixture forming (injection of gaseous or liquid state LPG) and their influence on the operating properties of an SI engine. The next chapter explains the processes that take place when liquid state LPG is injected into the air flow of an internal combustion engine intake manifold. A simplified calculation is used to show that the injection of liquid state LPG is associated with extreme low temperature of the LPG injected into intake manifold and with ice formation on the <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The article sets out the design of an end part injector (EPI) for liquid state LPG that reduces the risk of icing of the <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The results of experimental research indicate very good operational properties for a vehicle SI engine with the combustion mixture formed by the injection of liquid state LPG into the engine intake manifold. The calculation results are confirmed by recording plots of LPG pressure inside the end part of injector (EPI) and the temperature on the <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> (ON) of the LPG injector. Visual inspection of injection of liquid state LPG into the intake manifold clearly supports the performed measurements.

The direction of the flow was defined normal to the boundary. Hydraulic diameter and turbulent intensity were specified at the inlet nozzle of both hot and cold fluids. The flow is assumed as an incompressible turbulent flow; the gradient of temperature is required at all the points of the heat exchanger. Hence, the separate grid is generated for both tube and shell side fluids, and they are separated by the boundaries.|$|R

Although jet formation at an open end cannot be represented by quasi-one-dimensional flow, the numerical simulations suggest that the behaviour is slightly more nonlinear than for a choked outlet at the same forcing magnitudes, but still closely in agree-ment with the analytic linear solutions...|$|R

The distance between the single plane jets is two times the channel height. The experimental investigation applies 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and static pressure measurements. Our study focuses {{on the influence of}} two different <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometries (triangular shape with 2 x 7. 5 ° and blunt geometry) with respect to variation of Reynolds number from 5500 - 12000.

Furthermore, we describe characteristic regions like converging region, merging region and combined region. The triangular outlet geometry generates most uniform velocity distributions in comparison to a blunt <b>outlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry. The blunt outlet geometry shows an unstable behavior where the jets tend to attach {{to one side of the}} walls (ceiling) generating a large recirculation region on the opposite side.

40|$|AbstractShell-and-tube heat {{exchangers}} with trefoil-hole baffles are new type heat transfer devices and {{widely used in}} nuclear power system due to their special advantages, with the fluid flowing longitudinally on the shell side.
