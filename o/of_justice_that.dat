Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary falls {{under the authority of}} the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, and the supreme court. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>that</b> judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Denmark in 1940, both Else and Aage {{were arrested for}} the latter's involvement in National Bolshevist armed cells. Christensen was released after three days' interrogation, but Aage was convicted of illegal weapons' possession and detained for six months. At that point, Christensen convinced her father's cousin, who was Minister <b>of</b> <b>Justice,</b> <b>that</b> Aage should be released. Following the end of World War II, the couple left Denmark for England. In 1951 they migrated to Canada, where they settled in Toronto; here, Elsa worked in various hospitals, a vocation she retained throughout her life.|$|E

The head of Southampton CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Shirley Dinnell, stated that the referral was voluntarily made by Hampshire Constabulary because of the miscarriage <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> had taken place and to ensure transparency of inquiries.|$|E

The hearing took place on October 16, 2007; Washington and Sharpton, among others, testified. Walters was invited to testify but declined. Most Republican members of the committee declined to attend. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said to Washington and other Justice Department officials, [...] "Shame on you....

500|$|In September 1645, Temple {{was elected}} Member of Parliament (MP) for Bramber to replace Sir Thomas Bowyer, the royalist member {{who had been}} ejected. He belonged to the {{political}} and religious group known as Independents who were opposed to any compromise in Parliament's negotiations with the King. As a result, {{he was one of}} the MPs allowed to remain after Pride's Purge - a military coup that excluded from Parliament roughly three quarters of the MPs, particularly those who were believed to be unsympathetic to the Army. In January 1649, the army and the Independents decided to bring Charles I to trial. Temple was one of the judges named to the High Court <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>that</b> conducted the trial. [...] He attended nine sessions of the court in both the Painted Chamber and Westminster Hall. He approved the guilty verdict and signed the King's death warrant - the 28th of the 59 judges to so.|$|E

500|$|The decision, by Judge Paul Breckenridge, {{found that}} Armstrong's fears of {{persecution}} by the Church were reasonable, and thus his conduct in {{turning over the}} documents in his possession to his attorneys was also reasonable. The judge issued a wide-ranging verdict, commenting of Hubbard that [...] "the evidence portrays {{a man who has}} been virtually a pathological liar {{when it comes to his}} history, background and achievements." [...] A few weeks later, a British judge ruled in a case heard at the Royal Courts <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>that</b> Hubbard had made a number of [...] "false claims" [...] about his military career: [...] "That he was a much decorated war hero. He was not. That he commanded a corvette squadron. He did not. That he was awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated. That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetics techniques. He was not crippled and was not blinded." [...] The judge, Mr. Justice Latey, noted: [...] "There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 September 1867 committal {{proceedings}} {{were heard}} {{in front of}} a magistrate to establish whether there was a prima facie case against the 28accused. The team of defence barristers included Chartist leader Ernest Jones, who had spent two years in prison for making seditious speeches, and W. P. Roberts, whose fee was paid by subscribers to a defence fund to represent nine of the men. Jones, representing Condon and O'Brien, clashed with the court almost immediately because the accused were handcuffed, saying [...] "It appears to be discreditable to the administration <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> men whom the law presumes to be innocent should be brought into Court handcuffed together like a couple of hounds." [...] Jones also objected to the presence of a number of soldiers in the courtroom, and when the magistrate refused to order the prisoners' handcuffs to be removed he [...] "marched dramatically" [...] out of the courtroom saying [...] "Then {{as a member of the}} Bar I decline to sit in any Court where the police override the Magistrate... I cannot disgrace the Bar by proceeding with the defence." ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 November 1996 the day {{the first}} subpoenaed USAF officer was {{scheduled}} to appear, the DoD delivered a letter to Roth, signed by its general counsel, Judith Miller, stating that the DoD believed the subpoenas were invalid because they were issued [...] "after the adjournment of sine die of the 104th Congress" [...] and was therefore not going to honor the subpoenas by providing the four officers for interview. Roth replied to the DoD that only the Senate's legal counsel could determine the validity of congressional subpoenas because of the [...] "separation of powers" [...] principle in the U.S. Constitution and thus, the subpoenas were valid. The DoD, on 20 November in another letter signed by Miller again refused to produce the witnesses. Roth, whose committee chairmanship was scheduled to end the next month, {{was told by the}} U.S. Department <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. Attorney General, Janet Reno, would not support him if he chose to take the dispute with the DoD to court. Also, many of Roth's senate colleagues, including John McCain, were asking him to [...] "back off". Thus, Roth decided to drop the matter and continue preparing the report without the testimony of Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin. For the first time in U.S. history, the DoD had refused to comply with a U.S. Senate subpoena.|$|E

500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Takashi Hasegawa, who had written for multiple series entries since Tales of Eternia; Koki Matsumoto, who had written the scenario of Tales of Legendia; Hideo Baba, who had previously done work on Tales of Rebirth; and Takaaki Okuda, a newcomer to the series. The game's title, meant to be indicative of the games' theme of justice, was derived from [...] "Vesper", a name referring to the planet Venus. Its general meaning was to depict the protagonists and their ship as a newly-born star shining on the land, similar to Venus in the evening sky. The logo was also design to convey this, and the term [...] "Vesperia" [...] was used in-game for the party's airship. The game's main protagonist, Yuri Lowell, was created {{to be a more}} mature, evolved protagonist than Kyle Dunamis in Tales of Destiny 2 or Luke fon Fabre in Abyss. His role was to facilitate the growth of the other characters, and to have a sense <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> did not take account of the law. Veteran Tales character designer, Kōsuke Fujishima, was brought in to design the main characters. Fujishima found designing Yuri difficult, while Flynn proved one of the easiest designs. One of the intentions for Flynn and Yuri was for their designs to contrast with each other. A main character not designed by Fujishima was Repede, who was designed by the art director Daigo Okumura.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{likewise}} {{disagreed with}} the plurality's holding {{that even if the}} government had charged Hamdan with a crime that was clearly cognizable by military commission, the commission would still lack power to proceed because it does not comply with the terms of the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949. He again emphasized that the jurisdiction of military commissions is not prescribed by statute but is rather [...] "adapted in each instance to the need that called it forth". Thomas argued that the Court's conclusion that Article 36 of the UCMJ amounts to an attempt by Congress to curb the Executive's power is [...] "contrary to the text and structure of the UCMJ" [...] and also inconsistent with prior decisions of the Court. Addressing Hamdan's claims under the Geneva Convention, Thomas argued that these are foreclosed by the Court's holding in Johnson v. Eisentrager, where the majority noted that the respondents could not assert [...] "that anything in the Geneva Convention makes them immune from prosecution or punishment for war crimes". Further, even if Hamdan's claim under Common Article 3 was not foreclosed by Eisentrager, it is nevertheless meritless insofar as the President has accepted the determination of the Department <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>that</b> Common Article 3 of Geneva does not extend to al Qaeda detainees. Thomas asserted that the Court's duty in this instance to [...] "defer to the President's understanding of the provision at issue" [...] is made even more acute {{by the fact that he}} is acting pursuant to his authority as Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

2500|$|John Rawls' [...] "theory of 'political liberalism' conceives of toleration as {{a pragmatic}} {{response}} to the fact of diversity".
