5000|$|As {{an example}} of how models can be {{estimated}} in practice with software, consider R package `mgcv' (the user interface for which is based on the original `gam', and is broadly similar to other GAM packages). Suppose that <b>our</b> <b>R</b> workspace contains vectors `y', `x' and `z' and we want to estimate the modelWithin R we could issue the commands require(mgcv) ## load the package b <- gam(y ~ s(x) + s(z))In common with most R modelling functions `gam' expects a model formula to be supplied, specifying the model structure to fit. The response variable is given {{to the left of the}} `~' while the specification of the linear predictor is given to the right. `gam' sets up bases and penalties for the smooth terms, estimates the model including its smoothing parameters and, in standard R fashion, returns a `fitted model object' (of class [...] "gam"), which can then be interrogated using various helper functions, such as `summary', `plot', `predict', `AIC' and so on.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in data science and big data research have produced {{an abundance of}} large data sets that are too big to be analyzed in their entirety, due to limits on either computer memory or storage capacity. Here, we introduce <b>our</b> <b>R</b> package 'BayesSummaryStatLM' for Bayesian linear regression models with Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation that overcomes these limitations. Our Bayesian models use only summary statistics of data as input; these summary statistics can be calculated from subsets of big data and combined over subsets. Thus, complete data sets {{do not need to}} be read into memory in full, which removes any physical memory limitations of a user. Our package incorporates the R package 'ff' and its functions for reading in big data sets in chunks while simultaneously calculating summary statistics. We describe our Bayesian linear regression models, including several choices of prior distributions for unknown model parameters, and illustrate capabilities and features of <b>our</b> <b>R</b> package using both simulated and real data sets.

40|$|We have {{developed}} the R package c 060 {{with the aim of}} improving R software func- tionality for high-dimensional risk prediction modeling, e. g., for prognostic modeling of survival data using high-throughput genomic data. Penalized regression models provide a statistically appealing way of building risk prediction models from high-dimensional data. The popular CRAN package glmnet implements an efficient algorithm for fitting penalized Cox and generalized linear models. However, in practical applications the data analysis will typically not stop {{at the point where the}} model has been fitted. One is for example often interested in the stability of selected features and in assessing the prediction performance of a model and we provide functions to deal with both of these tasks. <b>Our</b> <b>R</b> functions are computationally efficient and offer the possibility of speeding up computing time through parallel computing. Another feature which can drastically reduce computing time is an efficient interval-search algorithm, which we have implemented for selecting the optimal parameter combination for elastic net penalties. These functions have been useful in our daily work at the Biostatistics department (C 060) of the German Cancer Research Center where prognostic modeling of patient survival data is of particular interest. Although we focus on a survival data application of penalized Cox models in this article, the functions in <b>our</b> <b>R</b> package are in general applicable to all types of regression models implemented in the glmnet package, with the exception of prediction error curves, which are specific to time-to-event data...|$|E

We motivate our approach by modeling pairwise in-teractions for categorical variables with arbitrary numbers of levels, and then show how we can accommodate continuous variables and mixtures thereof. Our approach allows us to dispense with explicitly applying constraints on the main effects and interactions for identifia-bility, which results in interpretable interaction models. We compare our method with existing approaches on both simulated and real data, including a genome wide association study, all using <b>our</b> <b>R</b> package glinternet. ...|$|E
