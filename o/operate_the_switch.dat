40|$|International audienceMitotic spindle {{position}} {{relies on}} interactions between astral microtubules nucleated by centrosomes and a rigid cortex. Some cells, such as mouse oocytes, {{do not possess}} centrosomes and astral microtubules. These cells rely only on actin and on a soft cortex to position their spindle off-centre and undergo asymmetric divisions. While the first mouse embryonic division also occurs {{in the absence of}} centrosomes, it is symmetric and not much is known on how the spindle is positioned at the exact cell centre. Using interdisciplinary approaches, we demonstrate that zygotic spindle positioning follows a three-step process: (1) coarse centring of pronuclei relying on the dynamics of an F-actin/Myosin-Vb meshwork; (2) fine centring of the metaphase plate depending on a high cortical tension; (3) passive maintenance at the cell centre. Altogether, we show that F-actin-dependent mechanics <b>operate</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> between asymmetric to symmetric division required at the oocyte to embryo transition...|$|E
40|$|For increasing/decreasing {{the ceiling}} fan speed or for {{switching}} the lights ON/OFF mostly {{we need to}} get up and move towards the switch board. But the ones who are physically impaired, it’s difficult for them to do so. This system is targeted mainly to help people who are physically impaired & unable to <b>operate</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> board easily for controlling the ceiling fan speed & turning the lights ON/OFF. It’s also possible to control these electronic equipment with the help of wireless technique like remote control. But the problem here is, due to different physical shapes of device and a variety of functional commands that each remote control features gives rise to numerous problems: the required remote control locating difficulties, the button layout confusion, the device replacement issue and so on. The proposed model for AC motor speed control of ceiling fan based on image processing is a recent innovative user interface that resolves the complications of using numerous remote controls for domestic appliances. Using one unified set of hand gestures, this system can interpret the hand gestures of user into pre-defined commands to control one or multiple devices at the same time. The experimental results are highly encouraging as the system is able to produces real-time responses and accurate recognition towards various set of gestures to perform the respective task...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point approach (spa) {{to design and}} technology education presented in this thesis, is intended to stimulate children’s ideas and to allow projects with different purposes to be designed and made in one class. The projects all originate from a common {{starting point}}. The approach is intended to promote creativity and individual choice whilst being manageable for the teacher. Data were collected during a spa session taught {{to a group of}} 10 - 11 year old children in London. They were introduced to the pressure pad switch that was to be the starting point for their designing. The activity was initiated by the group brainstorming existing uses for pressure pads and ways to <b>operate</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> prior to making their own. Each child went on to develop a project with a purpose selected by them. A transcript derived from the video of the above was subjected to analysis by means of coding and a specially devised grid. Children were also observed working and data were gathered using questionnaires, video recording, Dictaphone, field notes, interviews and digital pictures of the final artefacts. Phase 1 of the study examined whether the children could do what the spa required. Phase 2 concentrated on examining in more detail what occurred when the spa was used. The research showed that children following the spa were able to design and make products with different purposes within a single class. It is argued that an advantage of the spa is that it reconciles the often conflicting demands of teaching skills and knowledge with encouraging individual creativity. The starting point approach is a pedagogical tool and process {{that can be used to}} motivate children through allowing them to decide the purpose of their individual project as well as its design.

40|$|Delta {{networks}} are {{a class of}} multistage interconnection networks {{that can be used}} to interconnect a large number of modules in a modular computing system. In a packet communication environment, the modules in a system communicate asynchronously using fixed size packets. In this environment, delta networks exhibit a large parallelism in packet transfer leading to good performance. They also allow for local control in packet routing, extensibility, clean interfaces, speed independence, and simple proofs of correctness. They can be augmented to improve reliability, and pruned to have different numbers of input and output links. Feedback paths can be added to provide a range of performance. Special extreme cases of (N x N) delta {{networks are}} the full crossbar switch, which has O(N(' 2)) gates and O(N) ideal bandwidth, and the single bus, which has O(N) gates and 0 (1) bandwidth. Delta networks constructed from fixed size basic switches have O(N log N) gates and O(N) ideal bandwidth. The performance of delta networks with fixed size basic switches is comparable to that of the full crossbar switch in realistic environments as well. The class of delta networks includes several other networks that have been proposed in the literature. Thus, this study applies to these networks as well. Unbuffered delta networks have no internal buffers within the network. A simple model for network operation can be used to obtain a network characteristic that can then be used to obtain good estimates of performance for other models and environments. Using priority schemes in arbitrating between conflicting packets (that require passage through the same link at the same time) leads to a deterioration in performance as compared to arbitration with equiprobable selection from conflicting packets. Inserting a buffer between the stages of a delta network leads to a considerable improvement in performance, making its performance better than that of the (same size) unbuffered crossbar switch. However, as the number of buffers between stages is increased, the network bandwidth saturates quickly to a constant, while the delay that a packet encounters in the network increases almost linearly with buffer size. Thus, the buffer size for most practical applications should be limited to one or two. The performance obtained is also sensitive to precisely how the switches in the network <b>operate.</b> <b>The</b> <b>switch</b> operation policy needs to be chosen depending on the values of certain network parameters in an implementation. There are many ways of pruning delta networks. Optimal pruned delta networks, with buffers between stages, have a nonintuitive topology. Introducing feedback paths leads to a range of performance and cost. However, packets can deadlock in such networks. It is possible to detect and recover from deadlocks. For good performance to be obtained, it is necessary to prevent the frequent occurrence of deadlocks. This can be achieved by controlling the flow of packets into the networks...|$|E
