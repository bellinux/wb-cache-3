In {{a study of}} 100, 448 pregnant women in Norway during 1995 - 2004, 10. 6 % of HPA- 1 a negative women had detectable anti-HPA- 1 a antibodies. Design and Methods.

We observed that immunized women with blood group O had a lower risk of having a child with severe NAIT than women with group A; 20 % with blood group <b>O</b> <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to children with severe NAIT, compared to 47 % among the blood group A mothers (relative risk 0. 43; 95 % CI 0. 25 - 0. 75).

40|$|Background. ABO {{hemolytic}} {{disease of}} the newborn {{is the most common}} hemolytic consequence of maternofetal blood group incompatibility restricted mostly to non-group-O babies of group O mothers with immune anti-A or anti-B antibodies. Aim. We estimated the risk of ABO HDN with view to determining need for routine screening for ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus. Materials and Methods. Prevalence of ABO blood group phenotypes in blood donors at the donor clinic of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and arithmetic methods were used to determine population prevalence of ABO genes. We then estimated proportion of pregnancies of group O mothers carrying a non-group-O baby and the risk that maternofetal ABO incompatibility will cause clinical ABO HDN. Results. Blood from 9138 donors was ABO typed. 54. 3 %, 23 %, 19. 4 %, and 3. 3 % were blood groups O, A, B, and AB, respectively. Calculated gene frequencies were 0. 1416, 0. 1209, and 0. 7375 for A, B, and O genes, respectively. It was estimated that 14. 3 % of deliveries will result in a blood group <b>O</b> woman <b>giving</b> <b>birth</b> to a child who is non-group-O. Approximately 4. 3 % of deliveries are likely to suffer ABO HDN with 2. 7 % prone to suffer from moderately severe to severe hemolysis...|$|R
40|$|Maternal–fetal ABO {{incompatibility}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. We postulate that hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and red blood cell (RBC) values for cord blood units (CBUs) are lower and erythroblast values higher for maternal–fetal ABO incompatible dyads than for compatible dyads. Objective: We investigated the relationship between Hb, Hct, RBC, and erythroblast CBU values and maternal–fetal ABO blood type compatibility. Methods: Mothers having blood group <b>O</b> who <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to infants with blood group A, B, or AB were classified as Group I. According to baby’s blood group, the members of Group I were further divided into AO (baby group A, mother group O), BO (baby group B, mother group O), and ABO (baby group AB, mother group O) subgroups. Mothers having blood group A who <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to infants with blood group B or AB and mothers having blood group B who <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to infants with blood group A or AB were classified as Group II. All other maternal–fetal blood type pairs were considered ABO compatible and were classified as Group III. We compared mean Hb, Hct, RBC, and erythroblast values for the infants’ CBUs among these three groups including the subgroups of Group I. Results: Group I had lower mean Hb, Hct, and RBC values than Group II and Group III (both p <  0. 001). Although the mean Hb, Hct, and RBC values for Group II were lower than for Group III, the difference was not statistically significant. Mean Hb and RBC for the AO group were higher and nucleated RBC (nRBC) ratios were lower than for the BO group; however, these differences were also not statistically significant. Interestingly, the mean Hct value of the BO group was significantly lower than that of the AO group (p =  0. 04). Conclusion: Group A or B neonates with a group O mother have lower mean Hb, Hct, and RBC values for CBUs than other neonates. The role of RBC indices in predicting neonatal hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia remains unclear and further studies are needed to identify the possible clinical association...|$|R
