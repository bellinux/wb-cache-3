5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E

25|$|During her imprisonment, Maria Luisa and her {{children}} were stripped of their rights to the Spanish crown by the Cádiz Cortes, on 18 March 1812, because she was under Napoleon's control. Her rights were not restored until 1820. The former Queen of Etruria wrote in her Memoirs:I was {{for two years and}} a half in that monastery and one year without seeing <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> to anybody. I was not allowed to write or receive news not even from my own son. I had been in the convent for eleven months already when my parents came with my son to Rome on 16 June 1812. I was hoping to be released immediately after their arrival, but I was wrong, instead of diminishing the rigor of my imprisonment I was put under stricter orders.|$|E
25|$|After 1900, {{around the}} time of his father's death, Ryder's {{creativity}} fell dramatically. For {{the rest of his life}} he spent his artistic energy on occasionally re-working existing paintings, some of which lay scattered about his New York apartment. Visitors to Ryder's home were struck by his slovenly habits—he never cleaned, and his floor was covered with trash, plates with old food, and a thick layer of dust, and he would have to clear space for visitors to stand or sit. He was shy and did not seek the company of others, but received company courteously and enjoyed telling stories <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> about his art. He gained a reputation as a loner, but he maintained social contacts, enjoyed writing letters, and continued to travel on occasion to visit friends.|$|E
25|$|The Bontoc live on {{the banks}} of the Chico River in the Central Mountain Province on the island of Luzon. They speak Bontoc and Ilocano. They {{formerly}} practiced head-hunting and had distinctive body tattoos. The Bontoc describe three types of tattoos: The chak-lag′, the tattooed chest of the head taker; pong′-o, the tattooed arms of men and women; and fa′-tĕk, for all other tattoos of both sexes. Women were tattooed on the arms only. In the past, the Bontoc engaged in none of the usual pastimes or games of chance practiced in other areas of the country, but did perform a circular rhythmic dance acting out certain aspects of the hunt, always accompanied by the gang′-sa or bronze gong. There was no singing <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> during the dance drama, but the women took part, usually outside the circumference. It was a serious but pleasurable event for all concerned, including the children. Present-day Bontocs are a peaceful agricultural people who have, by choice, retained most of their traditional culture despite frequent contacts with other groups.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, {{through the}} years of World War II American art was {{characterized}} by Social Realism and American Scene Painting (as seen above) {{in the work of}} Grant Wood, Edward Hopper, Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, and several others. Nighthawks (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, {{but one of the most}} recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. The scene was inspired by a diner (since demolished) in Greenwich Village, Hopper's home neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.|$|E
25|$|Women Against Pornography's best-known tactic was {{a guided}} tour of the {{pornography}} and prostitution outlets in Times Square, which they led twice a week for a suggested contribution of $5.00. (In San Francisco, WAVPM had conducted similar tours in the red-light districts of that city.) Lynn Campbell suggested that people who did not consume pornography knew very little about the content of the pornography or the atmosphere in sex shops and live sex shows, and that actual guided tours of the sex industry in Times Square would provide an excellent educational tool. Susan Brownmiller planned an itinerary for the tour and wrote a script for the guides (with the help of information supplied by Carl Weisbrod, a police officer tasked with finding and closing down underground brothels in Midtown, and Maggie Smith, the owner of a neighborhood bar). The tours often involved unplanned encounters—being physically thrown out by enraged store managers, watching businessmen try to hide from the tourists, <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> briefly with nude performers while they took their breaks. After a reporter for The New York Times took one of the first tours and wrote a feature article for the Style section, WAP received coverage in People, Time, The Philadelphia Inquirer, European newspapers, local TV news programs and talk shows in New York City, and The Phil Donahue Show in Chicago.|$|E

In re-tests four weeks later, it {{found that children}} retained most of what they learned. After the first three weeks, or 15 episodes, viewers and non-viewers were compared; few differences in learning were found. When both groups were tested after six weeks more differences began to appear, with viewers scoring higher than non-viewers. A two-season CTW study published in 1995 found a [...] "significant increase" [...] in difficulty in remembering the letter and number of the day. Based on the multiple-intelligence theory, producers began to cluster Sesame Street's short films, animations, and inserts around a single topic rather than sprinkling several topics throughout a single episode.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{points out}} that {{prescriptive}} technologies have moved beyond materials production to the realms of administration, government and social services. She argues that tasks which require nurturing or caring for people, in health and education for example, are best done holistically. Yet such tasks are increasingly coming under the sway of prescriptive technologies based on what Franklin calls a production model. Professor Heather Menzies, an admirer of Franklin, describes for example, how nursing tasks are performed in keeping with preset, computerized check lists which leave little discretionary time {{for dealing with the}} unexpected <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> with patients who are lonely or distressed. Franklin herself notes that schools and universities test and promote students based on strict production schedules yet [...] "if there ever was a holistic process, a process that cannot be divided into rigid predetermined steps, it is education." ...|$|E

Ely Cathedral is visible on the horizon. The pictures were shot in cold February for optimal lighting conditions. [...] Since 2001, the sculptures are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. An alternate version of the cover photo, featuring two [...] stone sculptures by Aden Hynes, was featured on the compact cassette release and the tour brochure.|$|E

Found guilty of [...] "statutory communism", a term that the {{government}} used to describe most opposition to apartheid, their sentence of nine months' hard labour was suspended for two years. In December, Mandela was given a six-month ban from attending meetings <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> to more than one individual at a time, making his Transvaal ANC presidency impractical, and during this period the Defiance Campaign petered out. In September 1953, Andrew Kunene read out Mandela's [...] "No Easy Walk to Freedom" [...] speech at a Transvaal ANC meeting; the title was taken from a quote by Indian independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, a seminal influence on Mandela's thought. The speech laid out a contingency plan for a scenario in which the ANC was banned. This Mandela Plan, or M-Plan, involved dividing the organisation into a cell structure with a more centralised leadership.|$|E
500|$|Two {{elements}} [...] {{are found}} in the illustrations of the emaki: people indoors engaging in activities typical of the aristocracy of the period, [...] such as writing letters, playing instruments, exchanging poems <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> to each other; and the gardens outside their buildings. For this reason, [...] Mason calls the people in the emaki [...] "house bound". The leftward direction of scroll reading is reflected in the composition of paintings and pictures which may build to a climax from right to left; [...] or a main event presented on the right may be followed by its after-effects to the left. Stylistically the emaki follows the principles of the onna-e genre of yamato-e and is in this respect similar to the Tale of Genji Scrolls (1120–1140) but differs from them in many other aspects. Typical for onna-e, the paintings depict life at the palace with a sense of nostalgia, timeless and very retained, but purely decorative elements such as landscapes and contemplative scenes are added. Illustrations are relatively short compared to emaki of war or folktales, which according to Mason, [...] "heightens the symbolic quality of non-figural motifs".|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful People" [...] is an uptempo electro house, dancehall and Europop {{song with}} R influences.

[...] "Beautiful People" [...] is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of Eb major with Brown's vocal range spanning from the note of Eb4 to the note of F5. The song is positive and uplifting with lyrics such as: [...] "Everywhere that I've been / The only thing that I see is beautiful people ... / Don't you know / Don't you know / You're beautiful." [...] According to Rap-Up, on the song, Brown encourages [...] "everyone {{on the dance floor}} to keep their heads up and discover the beauty inside." [...] When speaking about [...] "Beautiful People", Brown told Jayson Rodriguez from MTV News that [...] "it wasn't a selfish record, it wasn't me bragging or boasting <b>or</b> <b>talking</b> about cars or money or girls.
