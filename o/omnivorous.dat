5|$|Although ceratopsians are {{generally}} considered herbivorous, a few paleontologists, such as Darren Naish and Mark Witton, have speculated online {{that at least}} some ceratopsians may have been opportunistically <b>omnivorous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Common ravens are <b>omnivorous</b> {{and highly}} opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those {{foraging}} on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{azure-hooded jay}} is <b>omnivorous,</b> eating berries, seeds, and small, dead animals. This species {{has been known}} to steal and eat bait from traps set for small mammals. The bird tends to forage in the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is <b>omnivorous,</b> eating {{a wide range}} of invertebrates, {{especially}} earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like its relative, the blackbird, the song thrush finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.|$|E
5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine {{bodies of}} water. They {{can often be}} found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily <b>omnivorous</b> detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, and several other predators.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have coexisted {{with humans}} for {{thousands}} of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their <b>omnivorous</b> diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are mostly}} scavengers, {{but some are}} <b>omnivorous</b> or predatory. The abdomen of the earwig is {{flexible}} and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing the forceps. The forceps are used {{for a variety of}} purposes. In some species, the forceps have been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, <b>omnivorous</b> or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but <b>omnivorous</b> species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are <b>omnivorous,</b> eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, {{but they may}} join mixed feeding flocks at other times. Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E
5|$|<b>Omnivorous</b> mammals such as {{the raccoon}} and skunk and {{herbivore}} mammal species {{such as the}} porcupine and pika, are common to the forest. The beaver is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous other species such as the moose, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians and other species dependent on a riparian environment.|$|E
5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were <b>omnivorous.</b> Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is an <b>omnivorous</b> species with a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling {{in shallow water}} and grazing on land. Its plant diet {{primarily}} includes {{a wide variety of}} wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of aquatic plants, such as eelgrass, pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{tilefish}} larvae is unknown, but it {{is believed}} to be zooplankton. Juvenile and adults are <b>omnivorous</b> with a preference for small benthic invertebrates, with a staple being crabs and lobster. Great northern tilefish also consume bivalve molluscs, salps, squid, Atlantic dogfish, mackrel, hagfish, and herring. Human trash is also eaten, including potato peels and meat bones. They also eat other tilefish in a display of cannibalistism.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is <b>omnivorous,</b> feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and {{powerful}} jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.|$|E
5|$|The male of the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{which is}} found {{throughout most of}} Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is <b>omnivorous,</b> eating {{a wide range of}} insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but {{simply because they are}} <b>omnivorous.</b> The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys talamancae is a common, even {{abundant}} species. Its ecology was {{studied by}} Theodore Fleming in the Panama Canal Zone. It {{lives on the}} ground and is active during the night. The animal uses nests that are located above the ground and occasionally enters burrows also used by the pocket mouse Liomys adspersus. Its diet is <b>omnivorous,</b> including both plant material such as seeds and fruits and adult and larval insects.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are <b>omnivorous</b> generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15â€“20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are <b>omnivorous</b> and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also {{occasionally}} eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are <b>omnivorous</b> and forage in {{wetlands}} and saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of dinosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although {{it has been suggested that}} most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, Juravenator, and Megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and <b>omnivorous</b> dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral, active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian Agilisaurus was inferred to be diurnal.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous {{and best}} known {{member of the}} family Heterodontosauridae. This family is {{considered}} one of the most primitive or basal groups within the order of ornithischian dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus is thought to have been herbivorous, or at least <b>omnivorous.</b> Though it was formerly thought to have been capable of quadrupedal locomotion, it is now thought to have been bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological formations as Heterodontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the {{increased}} robustness of Balaur {{was compared to}} parallel changes seen in isolated herbivorous mammals. In 2013, it was claimed that Balaur was the only vertebrate predatory island species known to have become more robust and {{it was suggested that}} its broad feet had evolved to improve stability. The 2015 interpretation of Balaur as an <b>omnivorous</b> member of the Avialae, suggested it was the descendant of a flying species that had developed a larger size similar to the development in several other island herbivores. This would then be a rare instance of secondary flightlessness in a paravian looking like a dromaeosaurid, as predicted by Gregory S. Paul.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the <b>omnivorous</b> brown bear (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the Bluefish Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, caribou, wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E
5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their <b>omnivorous</b> diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} <b>omnivorous</b> and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding {{exclusively}} on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are <b>omnivorous</b> {{and a few}} are predators. The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers.|$|E
5|$|Some social wasps are <b>omnivorous,</b> {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly {{consumed by the}} adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E
5|$|The American crow is <b>omnivorous.</b> It {{will feed}} on {{invertebrates}} of all types, carrion, scraps of human food, seeds, eggs and nestlings, stranded {{fish on the}} shore and various grains. American crows are active hunters and will prey on mice, frogs, and other small animals. In winter and autumn, the diet of American crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns. Occasionally, they will visit bird feeders. The American crow {{is one of only}} a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and using tools to obtain food.|$|E
5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is <b>omnivorous.</b> Its diet includes insects and insect larvae (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers and nectar. It also eats small vertebrates, including bats, birds, lizards and tree frogs. It finds its food foraging through the lower and middle {{levels of the}} forest, typically between fifteen and thirty feet high. Two-thirds to three-quarters of each day is spent foraging for food. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available.|$|E
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} (Turdus pilaris) is {{a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in woodland and scrub in northern Europe and Asia. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south during the winter. It is a very rare breeder in the British Isles, but winters in large numbers in the United Kingdom, Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It is <b>omnivorous,</b> eating a wide range of molluscs, insects and earthworms in the summer, and berries, grain and seeds in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} is <b>omnivorous.</b> Animal food in {{the diet}} includes snails and slugs, earthworms, spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae, flies and grasshoppers. When berries ripen in the autumn these are taken in great number. Hawthorn, holly, rowan, yew, juniper, dog rose, Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Berberis are all relished. Later in the winter windfall apples are eaten, swedes attacked {{in the field and}} grain and seeds eaten. When these are exhausted, or in particularly harsh weather, the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an <b>omnivorous</b> and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} is <b>omnivorous.</b> It digs beetle larvae {{from trees}} and also takes many other invertebrates including adult beetles, ants and spiders. Crustaceans, molluscs and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for suet and domestic scraps. The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as tits, may be raided for their eggs and chicks; nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the woodpecker where necessary. House martin colonies can be destroyed in repeated visits.|$|E
5|$|The grey currawong is an <b>omnivorous</b> and {{opportunistic}} feeder. It preys on many invertebrates, such as snails, spiders and woodlice, and a {{wide variety}} of insects including beetles, earwigs, cockroaches, wasps, ants and grasshoppers, and smaller vertebrates, including frogs, lizards such as the bearded dragon as well as skinks, rats, mice, and nestlings or young of Tasmanian nativehen, red wattlebird, eastern spinebill, house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and splendid fairywren (M. splendens), It has been recorded hunting at the nests of the superb fairywren (Malurus cyaneus), and the bell miner (Manorina melanophrys).|$|E
5|$|The larvae of Megaselia scalaris (Phoridae) {{are almost}} <b>omnivorous</b> and consume such {{substances}} as paint and shoe polish. The larvae of the shore flies (Ephydridae) and some Chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers (Diamesa sp., Chironomidae), hot springs, geysers, saline pools, sulphur pools, septic tanks and even crude oil (Helaeomyia petrolei). Adult hoverflies (Syrphidae) {{are well known}} for their mimicry and the larvae adopt diverse lifestyles including being inquiline scavengers inside the nests of social insects. Some brachycerans are agricultural pests, some bite animals and humans and suck their blood, and some transmit diseases.|$|E
