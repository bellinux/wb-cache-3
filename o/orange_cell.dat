40|$|We have {{isolated}} a novel {{source of}} stem cells derived from the dermis of either rodent or human skin. When induced to differentiate in vitro, these cells give rise to all types of neuronal lineages. In this study, we therefore investigated if naive S̲ḵin-derived P̲recursor (SKPs) cells could be neuralized by the neonatal brain environment thereby generating neural cells in vivo. We transplanted <b>orange</b> <b>cell</b> tracker-labelled mouse SKPs into the lateral cerebral ventricule and the hippocampus of neonatal rats. Analysis of the transplants revealed that SKPs survived over the short, medium and long-term in vivo, with SKPs remaining viable for up to 6 weeks without forming tumors. Many cells also adopted a branched morphology, but, based on immunocytochemistry of <b>orange</b> <b>cell</b> tracker-labelled SKPs with specific markers for either neurons or glia, these morphologically complex cells did not differentiate into specific neuronal cell types. In control experiments, neural stem cells exhibited a similar in vivo pattern of survival {{and a lack of}} differentiation, thereby validating our results and that our transplantation protocol required further refinement in order to give optimal results. In conclusion, we have shown that SKPs can survive in vivo and do not appear to form neural lineages...|$|E
40|$|We report {{analyses}} {{of the effect of}} anti-Fab antibodies on plasma membrane potential of mouse B lymphocytes. Results indicate that divalent fragments of anti-Fab antibodies mitogenic for B cells stimulate membrane depolarization detectable by cytofluorometric analysis of 3, 3 '-dipentyloxacarbocyanine iodide-stained cells. Depolarization is detectable within 5 min of exposure to ligand and maximal within 1 h of exposure when {{greater than or equal to}} 80 % of splenic B cells exhibit decreased membrane potential. The ineffectiveness of monovalent Fab antibody fragments in inducing this event suggests that receptor immunoglobulin cross-linking is essential. Frequencies of cells induced to enter cell cycle, as assessed by acridine <b>orange</b> <b>cell</b> cycle analysis, are equal to those induced to depolarize by lipopolysaccharide plus dextran sulfate or anti-Fab, which suggests a relationship between these events. However, membrane depolarization is itself an insufficient signal to promote subsequent thymidine uptake, as evidenced by the fact that doses of anti-Fab that are suboptimal for thymidine uptake induce maximal depolarization. These results suggest that cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin on B cells may provide an initial signal for activation but is itself insufficient to drive B cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|Nobiletin, a citrus flavonoid, shows strong {{cytotoxic}} effect in several cancer cell lines. The {{aim of this}} research was to investigate cytotoxic activities of nobiletin alone and in combination with doxorubicin. Cell viability assay of nobiletin, doxorubicin, and combination treatments were carried out by using MTT assay. Apoptosis assay was done using double staining method using Ethidium Bromide-Acridine <b>Orange.</b> <b>Cell</b> cycle distribution was determined by flowcytometry FACS-Calibur and data was analyzed by using ModFit LT 3. 0 program. Nobiletin (5, 10 and 15 µM) increased {{cytotoxic effect}} of doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin alone in MCF- 7 cells but not in T 47 D cells. The strongest cytotoxic activity was showed by the combination of 200 nM doxorubicin and 15 µM nobiletin in MCF- 7 cells. Single treatment of doxorubicin 200 nM, nobiletin 15 µM and their combination induced G 2 /M accumulation in MCF- 7 cells. Combination of 15 µM and nobiletin 200 nM doxorubicin showed strong synergism on apoptosis induction of MCF- 7 cells. Single treatment of nobiletin 15 µM and doxorubicin 7. 5 nM induced T 47 D cell accumulation in G 1 phase and G 2 /M phase respectively, while their combination induced accumulation of T 47 D cells in G 2 /M phase.

40|$|Here {{we present}} an event where {{simultaneous}} global imaging of the aurora from both hemispheres reveals a large longitudinal {{shift of the}} nightside aurora of about 3  h, being the largest relative shift reported on from conjugate auroral imaging. This is interpreted as evidence of closed field lines having very asymmetric footpoints associated with the persistent positive y component of the interplanetary magnetic field {{before and during the}} event. At the same time, the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network observes the ionospheric nightside convection throat region in both hemispheres. The radar data indicate faster convection toward the dayside in the dusk cell in the Southern Hemisphere compared to its conjugate region. We interpret this as a signature of a process acting to restore symmetry of the displaced closed magnetic field lines resulting in flux tubes moving faster along the banana cell than the conjugate <b>orange</b> <b>cell.</b> The event is analyzed with emphasis on Birkeland currents (BC) associated with this restoring process, as recently described by Tenfjord et al. (2015). Using data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) during the same conditions as the presented event, the large-scale BC pattern associated with the event is presented. It shows the expected influence of the process of restoring symmetry on BCs. We therefore suggest that these observations should be recognized as being a result of the dynamic effects of restoring footpoint symmetry on closed field lines in the nightside.

40|$|Tonsillar B {{lymphocytes}} of {{a particularly}} high buoyant density were prepared essentially free of contaminating monocytes and T cells. When exposed to anti-immunoglobulin, such cells initiated the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids. This provides a postulated 'dual signal' for growth through the liberation of intracellular calcium stores and the activation of protein kinase C. Nevertheless, neither anti-immunoglobulin nor direct agonists of this bifurcating pathway (respectively, calcium ionophore and the phorbol ester TPA) were capable, when used alone, of driving cells out of G 0 and into RNA synthesis. All three agents did, however, induce two activation antigens at the surface of G 0 B cells, which included CD 23, p 45 and a lineage-unrestricted antigen identified by the monoclonal antibody BK. 19. 9.

40|$|Hexokinase II (HKII) {{is one of}} 4 {{mammalian}} Hexokinase isoenzymes catalyzing {{the first}} obligatory step of glucose metabolism. In addition to their catalytical activity, HKII is also believed {{to play a role}} in regulating cell death. In the state of ischemic tolerance Hexokinase II is upregulated by Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF- 1). In order to investigate the role of HKII in neuroprotective signaling, site directed mutagenesis was used to generate several murine HKII expression vectors with mutations in domains relevant for glucose metabolism and apoptosis regulation. The effect of HKII and its mutants on neuronal survival was studied using a sensitive technique based on co-transfecting embryonic rat primary cortical neurons with eGFP (green cells) and HKII or HKII mutant vectors. These co-transfected cells were co-cultivated with primary neurons expressing m-orange (<b>orange</b> <b>cells)</b> and subsequently submitted to an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia (oxygen-glucose-deprivation, OGD), (glucose-deprivation, GD) or (oxygen-deprivation, OD), respectively. The ratio of green vs. orange neurons before and after the damaging event was analysed. Thereby the effect of different HKII mutants on neuronal survival could be determined. The data demonstrates that mitochondrial binding of HKII is a dynamic and adaptive response mediated by protein kinase B (PKB) /Akt kinase dependent phosphorylation, that protects neurons from OGD induced apoptosis. It is proposed that HKII may serve as a molecular switch regulating apoptosis in a glucose concentration depending fashion and may those provide a link between cellular metabolism and survival. These results might also have a therapeutic implication for vascualar diseases like stroke...|$|R

Normal cells with intact DNA show green fluorescence of AO. The extent of EB binding to fragmented DNA changes the color from green to yellow (for early apoptotic <b>cells),</b> <b>orange</b> (late apoptotic <b>cells)</b> and bright red color indicate necrotic cells (Gohel et al. 1999; Natesan et al. 2006; Priyadarsini et al. 2010).

On the other hand, CD induced necrosis in neuronal cells as early as 3  h and continued till the end of experimental period (12  h post-CD). These data reconfirms our recent observations that the HD induces neuronal cell apoptosis in DG region of the rat brain (Khatun et al. 2013).

The technique is rapid, taking less than 25 min, inexpensive, costing less than 50 cents per sample, and is suitable for milks containing 5 × 103 to 5 × 108 bacteria per ml...|$|R
40|$|ARS-Media for Excel is an ion {{solution}} calculator {{that uses}} "Microsoft Excel" to generate recipes of salts for complex ion mixtures {{specified by the}} user. Generating salt combinations (recipes) that result in pre-specified target ion values is a linear programming problem. Excel's Solver add-on solves the linear programming equation to generate a recipe. Calculating a mixture of salts to generate exact solutions of complex ionic mixtures is required for at least 2 types of problems- 1) formulating relevant ecological/biological ionic solutions such as those from a specific lake, soil, cell, tissue, or organ and, 2) designing ion confounding-free experiments to determine ion-specific effects where ions are treated as statistical factors. Using ARS-Media for Excel to solve these two problems is illustrated by 1) exactly reconstructing a soil solution representative of a loamy agricultural soil and, 2) constructing an ion-based experiment {{to determine the effects}} of substituting Na+ for K+ on the growth of a Valencia sweet <b>orange</b> nonembryogenic <b>cell</b> line...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Estudar a avaliação da maturidade fetal em gestações de alto risco e analisar os resultados neonatais. MÉTODOS: Entre julho de 1998 e agosto de 1999 foram realizadas, no Setor de Vitalidade Fetal da Clínica Obstétrica do HC-FMUSP, 180 amniocenteses para avaliação da maturidade fetal, sendo realizados os testes de Clements em três tubos e a contagem de células orangiófilas coradas com Azul de Nilo a 0, 1 %. Os resultados perinatais foram correlacionados com a maturidade fetal em 75 casos cujo parto ocorreu até sete dias após a punção. RESULTADOS: Na macroscopia, 91 % das amostras apresentavam líquido amniótico claro, 3, 3 % meconial e 5, 6 % hemorrágico. A maturidade foi observada em 28 % dos exames realizados. Na avaliação dos resultados perinatais, quando a maturidade estava ausente, a necessidade de intubação do recém-nascido ocorreu em três casos (13 %) e nos fetos maduros isto ocorreu em um caso (2, 5 %) (p BACKGROUND: To study, in {{high risk}} pregnancies, {{the results of}} fetal {{maturity}} evaluation, and analyze the perinatal results. METHODS: Between July 1998 and August 1999, 180 amniocentesis were performed at the Fetal Surveillance Unit to assess fetal maturity. The amniotic fluid exams included Shake Test and <b>orange</b> <b>cells</b> counting. The perinatal results were correlated to fetal maturity in the 75 cases that delivery occurred until 7 days after the amniotic fluid analysis. RESULTS: The macroscopic aspects showed 91 % of clear amniotic fluid 33 % of hemorragic, and 3. 3 % of meconial fluid. The fetal maturity was evidenced at 28 % of analyzed exams. When the fetus was immature, 13 % of newborn required artificial ventilation at birth and 65 % were allocated at the neonatal intensive care unit. Between the mature fetuses, only one (2. 5 %) required artificial ventilation at birth and 10 % were allocated at the neonatal intensive care unit (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The fetal maturity was associated to less newborn interventions. Between the 29 th and 32 nd weeks 10 % of amniotic fluid analysis showed maturity, providing that, when necessary, the amniotic fluid sample study can be performed at these periods. No cases of fetal maturity were diagnosed before 29 th week...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} impact of neural {{activity}} on cellular physiology, one would like to combine precise control of firing patterns with highly sensitive probes of cellular physiology. Light-gated ion channels, e. g., Channelrhodopsin- 2, enable precise control of firing patterns; green fluorescent protein-based reporters, e. g., the GCaMP 6 f Ca 2 + reporter, enable highly sensitive probing of cellular physiology. However, for most actuator-reporter combinations, spectral overlap prevents straightforward combination within a single cell. Here we explore multiwavelength control of channelrhodopsins to circumvent this limitation. The “stoplight” technique {{described in this article}} uses channelrhodopsin variants that are opened by blue light and closed by <b>orange</b> light. <b>Cells</b> are illuminated with constant blue light to excite fluorescence of a green fluorescent protein-based reporter. Modulated illumination with orange light negatively regulates activation of the channelrhodopsin. We performed detailed photophysical characterization and kinetic modeling of four candidate stoplight channelrhodopsins. The variant with the highest contrast, sdChR(C 138 S,E 154 A), enabled all-optical measurements of activity-induced calcium transients in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, although cell-to-cell variation in expression levels presents a challenge for quantification...|$|R

50|$|Epicoccum nigrum has a {{wide array}} of medical, industrial, and {{agricultural}} applications. It produces a variety of pigmented and non-pigmented antifungal and antibacterial compounds. These antimicrobial compounds are effective against other fungi and bacteria present in soil. Flavipin, and epirodins A and B are pigmented antifungal agents; non-pigmented compounds include epicorazines A and B. Endophytic fungi such as E. nigrum are being explored as alternative sources of antibiotics to treat important resistant infections. Polysaccharide antioxidants are also produced by E. nigrum. Epicocconone is a fluorescent pigment unique to E. nigrum. Epicocconone is valuable in terms of its ability to pigment <b>cells</b> <b>orange,</b> which then fluoresce red without impacting cell structure or function.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a cell-free system for regulated exocytosis in the PC 12 neuroendocrine cell line. Secretory vesicles were preloaded with acridine <b>orange</b> in intact <b>cells,</b> and the cells were sonicated to produce flat, carrier-supported plasma membrane patches with attached vesicles. Exocytosis resulted in the release of acridine orange which was visible as a disappearance of labeled vesicles and, under optimal conditions, produced light flashes by fluorescence dequenching. Exocytosis in vitro requires cytosol and Ca 2 � at concentrations in the micromolar range, and is sensitive to Tetanus toxin. Imaging of membrane patches at diffractionlimited resolution revealed that 42 % of docked granules were released in a Ca 2 �-dependent manner durin...|$|R
