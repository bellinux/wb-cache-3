Gender-specificly, in women both hemispheres were equally involved, while men were left-lateralized. Smell and memory are closely related, which was studied for words and faces. With Alzheimer patients, in whom dementia had just started (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) the MEG proved to be predictive in showing whether a certain MCI patient would develop into an Alzheimer patient. This design was also employed for therapy follow-up studies. In the complex of themes “Smell, emotion, memory, words, faces“ an influence of the <b>odorous</b> <b>substance</b> PEA (N-Palmitoyl-ethanolamine) upon the encoding and recognition of faces was found, if these were to be classified into ’appealing’ and ’unappealing.’ Stuttering was investigated as well: 8 stutterers and 8 controls were faced with certain tasks and examined in the MEG. While stuttering in task 1 (silent reading) was not yet noticeable, it was strongly present in task 2 (immediate loud uttering of a word shown): Only the normal controls showed clear neuronal activity {{prior to the start}} of speaking. This brain activity is the Readiness Field (RF) or Bereitschaftsfield (BF) and in particular its left-lateralized component BF2 prior to the fluent speech production. With the stutterers' non-fluent speech production, the Bereitschaftsfield was missing or was greatly reduced.|$|E

From the acidic part, seven volatile fatty acids (formic.

In the fresh meat, the <b>odorous</b> <b>substances</b> obtained were formic and acetic acids. 4.

It was performed on 120 subjects (60 females and 60 males) divided into three age groups (20 - 30; 31 - 40; 41 - 50 years of age).

40|$|ABSTRACT Cecectomy (the {{surgical}} {{removal of}} ceca) {{is a technique}} {{that has been used}} to explore the nutritional and osmoregulatory role of the ceca in domestic fowl and other birds. The operation imposes a high level of physiolog-ical stress on a bird. The current study describes the effectiveness of ligating or detaching the ceca in young turkeys as an alternative to complete removal of the organ. Birds with ligated ceca showed less postsurgical depression and initiated feeding and other normal activities sooner than birds with detached ceca. Birds with detached ceca also had a significantly slower rate of weight gain 1 wk after surgery. Both surgically treated groups were more depressed than were sham-operated turkeys. Post-mortem examinations revealed that cecal detachment was more successful in actually separating the ceca from the rectum and in preventing flow of digesta {{in and out of the}} ceca. Evidence of growth of cecal stumps that remained attached to the rectum was found following both ligation and detachment. Post-mortem examinations revealed that in four birds both ligated or detached ceca left in the abdominal cavity became enlarged and filled with a dark, pasty, <b>odorous</b> <b>substance.</b> This increase in cecal size and volume of contents with time apparently indicates that some microbial metabolic activity continued in the cecal lumen.

40|$|The one-trial passive {{avoidance}} {{learning task}} {{is commonly used}} in avian research to explore anatomical, cellular and molecular parameters of learning and memory. Many factors are known to influence the effectiveness and/or duration of such learning events. Combinations of novel odours, such as pyrazine, and aposematic colours, such as brig ht yellow or red, {{have been shown to}} induce a long-lasting aversion to food crumbs in 'visual' predators, including birds such as the domestic chick (1). The aim {{of this study was to}} (a) examine whether visual complexity played a role in the generation of an aversive response to a novel visual stimulus and (b) to establish whether the duration of memory of an aversive experience could be modified by altering the visual properties of the stimulus. In the first experiment, naﶥ domestic chicks were trained on a weakly aversive one-trial passive avoidance bead task, in which chicks were allowed to peck at a bead coated with a 10 % solution of the bitter-tasting and <b>odorous</b> <b>substance</b> methylanthranilate (MeA). The chicks were trained with (allowed to peck) one of four differently coloured beads dipped in 10 % MeA. Chrome, black, yellow or black-and-yellow striped beads were used. 'Recall' of the aversive bead was examined by presenting the (clean) training bead 24 h after training and monitoring avoidance to it compared to a 'neutral' white bead. A high proportion (63 %) of chicks trained with the black and yellow striped bead avoided it 24 h after training, whereas little or no avoidance was seen in response to chrome, yellow or black beads. In a second experiment naﶥ domestic chicks were all trained once only with a black and yellow striped bead coated in a 10 % MeA solution, but this time, were tested 24 h later, once only, with either a black, a yellow or a black and yellow striped bead. Nearly 60 % of chicks tested with a black and yellow striped bead showed avoidance of the bead, whereas only 23 % of those tested with a black bead and 14 % tested with a yellow bead showed avoidance. These results confirm the importance of complex warning colouration, when paired with a novel olfactory cue and a bitter taste, in avoidance learning. We conclude that the chicks' response to monochromatic colours (e. g. yellow or black) is not affected by their previous experience with a conspicuously patterned stimulus (yellow and black stripes). Moreover, it suggests a predisposition for chicks to attend to aversive cues associated with 'naturalistic' high contrast colour cue combinations such as black and yellow.
