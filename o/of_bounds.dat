Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive First Team, and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics split the first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly out <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma. The ball bounced off Sikma before going out <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> and the Celtics maintained possession.|$|E

Tech completed two short passes, advancing to the 50-yard line, but the Hokies punted after not gaining another first down. The kick sailed out <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> and the Eagles returned to offense with 19 seconds remaining in the first half.

40|$|AbstractClique-width is a {{relatively}} new parameterization of graphs, philosophically similar to treewidth. Clique-width is more encompassing in the sense that a graph <b>of</b> <b>bounded</b> treewidth is also <b>of</b> <b>bounded</b> clique-width (but not the converse). For graphs <b>of</b> <b>bounded</b> clique-width, given the clique-width decomposition, every optimization, enumeration or evaluation problem that can be defined by a monadic second-order logic formula using quantifiers on vertices, but not on edges, can be solved in polynomial time. This is reminiscent of the situation for graphs <b>of</b> <b>bounded</b> treewidth, where the same statement holds even if quantifiers are also allowed on edges. Thus, graphs <b>of</b> <b>bounded</b> clique-width are a larger class than graphs <b>of</b> <b>bounded</b> treewidth, on which we can resolve fewer, but still many, optimization problems efficiently. One of the major open questions regarding clique-width is whether graphs of clique-width at most k, for fixed k, can be recognized in polynomial time.
